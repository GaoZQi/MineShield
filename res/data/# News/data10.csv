By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Marine Hornet forward deployed to Japan crashed last evening a 6:40pm local time while on a routine training mission. The wingman of the stricken Hornet pilot stayed overhead the crash site until they had to return to base due to a low fuel state.  A search was quickly launched for the pilot—who was thought to have ejected—in an area roughly 120 miles southeast of MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. Both US and Japanese assets were said to be taking part in the rescue mission. Now, according to Military.com, that search has ended, with the body of the pilot being found by a Japanese vessel. The pilot has been identified as 32 year old Capt. Jake Frederick . The F/A-18C Hornet supposedly belonged to VMFA-115 Silver Eagles. The Marine Corps has been shedding Hornets at an alarming rate, and with those losses some of the USMC’s best aviators have lost their lives. In just the last six months, the USMC has lost six F/A-18s. Two crashed in separate incidents at MCCS 29 Palms, one crashed while deployed to NAS Fallon, two collided while flying out of MCAS Miramar. In addition, the Blue Angels lost a Legacy Hornet last June, and in September of 2015 a Miramar-based Hornet crashed while flying home from Middle East . International Hornet users have also lost Legacy F/A-18s as of late, with a deadly Canadian Hornet crash occurring just days ago, and a Swiss Hornet crashing late last August. A USMC Hornet flying high over the Pacific., USMC Although every crash is different, and we don’t know what transpired last evening over the waters near Japan, the USMC has been negligent in keeping their crews trained and their aircraft in flyable condition—two key components that go hand-in-hand. This is no secret, and the service is now attempting to deal with the problem through recapitalization efforts, including pulling 30 worn-out Hornets from the boneyard , regenerating and upgrading them, and returning them to the fleet—all at great cost. Similar efforts are occurring with other run-down Marine aviation communities. The loss of two CH-53E Super Stallions off the coast of Hawaii last winter is the most glaring example of how bad things have become. The after-action findings are so damning and so absurdly sad that it will make you outright enraged that things were allowed to get so bad—especially considering the USMC has been investing many billions into new high-end capabilities while the force it already had rapidly degraded. The Super Stallion community has been hit especially hard over the last decade, with availability rates dwindling to just a fraction of what is mandated. , USMC Even with 30 reworked Hornets coming online, these constant losses will only broaden the fighter gap being experienced by NAVAIR. The Navy has continued to buy more Super Hornets , which are readily available from Boeing , to help bridge this gap that has been exacerbated by massive delays in the F-35 program and a high operations tempo. The USMC on the other hand deferred purchasing the Super Hornet, instead betting everything on the F-35. This decision has dogged the service as there is no tactical fighter in its inventory still in production to purchase as a stopgap measure until the F-35B/C has finally matured. With a new administration arriving in Washington on January 20th, there is an opportunity for change. Trump and the Republican dominated congress have said that they aim to immediately quell the specter of sequester. This will help, but more money alone is not the answer. Systemic change in the way the USMC prioritizes its funds will be needed in order to keep history from repeating itself. With ex-Marine General Mattis likely taking the reigns of the Pentagon, a leader that seems to place core capabilities at least on par with whiz-bang new technology, hopefully Marine Aviation will get back on its feet in the not so distant future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 12, 2017",Trump’s Air Force One Twitter Rant Was Anything But Random,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Elect Trump’s Twitter feed seems driven more by a random topic generator than an actual human being. Today the subject was the Air Force One replacement program, and the costs related to it. It’s apparent that Twitter is so attractive to Trump because its 140 character format is ideal for conveying simple and hard-hitting thoughts—fine, unless you are trying to tackle very complex defense procurements programs. Then again, when you looking deeper into the matter it becomes clear that not only can Trump’s quip be traced back to a place he does know something about, but there is a serious strategy behind the picking this particular defense program to malign. Here’s the tweet in question: The outburst dominated the news cycle for the entire day and sent Boeing stock tumbling. The criticism of Boeing over costs surrounding the new Air Force One initiative may have been slightly inaccurate and undeserving, but considering the critic it was also totally predictable. A Flashy But Geriatric Personal Air Force First, Trump does actually know about owning and operating large aircraft. At one time he owned an airline. That didn’t end well . Since then he’s continued to own a small fleet of personal aerial chariots. For decades the centerpiece of that fleet has been “Trump Force One”—second-hand Boeing airliners converted into lavish flying mansions. Trump buys Eastern Shuttle — Donald Trump with Frank Lorenzo and model of the Trump jetliner. Deal was for 360 million In cash. October 12, 1988. , Michael Schwartz / (c) NYP Holdings, Inc. via Getty Images Trump’s garishly appointed 727-200 became an iconic staple associated with the self-proclaimed king of all dealmakers, reaching prominence within America’s pop culture lexicon while acting as a backdrop and set piece for The Apprentice reality TV show in the mid 2000s. When Donald acquired the jet for his personal use in 1997 it was already 29 years old—nearly the same age as the two VC-25As serving as Air Force One today. The 727 started its life in 1968, flying for American Airlines, and was passed around successively smaller airlines, even flying with Trump’s defunct airline operation for a short period of time. By the time he put his branded 727 up for sale in 2009 it was 41 years old with over 42,000 flight hours and nearly 30,000 landings in its logs. With enormous operating costs—including the need to keep high-time components running, a massive thirst for gas (even with upgraded engines), and the requirement for a flight engineer in addition to two pilots, not to mention being noisy as hell which limits the airports it can visit and at what time—meant that few buyers existed for such an aircraft. In the end the 727 likely sold for just a few million dollars, about the same as the cheapest new Cessna Citation jet, and a far cry from the sticker price of a new, but smaller, $55 million Gulfstream G550—all the rage among billionaires at the time. Trump's 727 sure looked cool but it was an old and expensive aircraft to operate, and had a relatively small resale value., AP Replacing the 727 in Trump’s air force was yet another used airplane, this one just 20-years-old when it entered service as the premier Trump transporter. The Boeing 757 was one of two matching jets that belonged to billionaire Paul Allen before he switched over to flying a Bombardier Global Express and starting using a charter aircraft for his sports teams. Trump overhauled the jet’s interior and made technical upgrades following the transfer of ownership. Although its interior is often referred to in the same gaudy language as its predecessor, the 757 is tastefully appointed by comparison. This is an awesome, current and surprisingly little known documentary showing what it takes to keep Trump’s 757 in the air and how the jet is operated, a must watch: https://youtube.com/watch?v=0Tmbn5QMIlw The more fuel miserly and modern 757 would become a set piece for a reality show—just like its predecessor—but this one would have much higher-stakes. Trump’s 757, embellished with the same red, black and gold paint scheme as his 727, became the literal backdrop of his bid to become the next President of the United States. Flybys over sports stadiums and dramatic pull-ups to hangars packed with supporters would become the norm during the campaign. Not only did the plane work as a mobile billboard for one of the best self-promoters in modern history, but it also allowed Trump to execute the campaign his way, moving around the country in luxury, then back to his gold-leaf encrusted New York residence in Trump tower at night. Trump's 757 became a star of his succesful bid to become the 45th President of the United States., Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The aging 757 kept up quite well with the absurd demands of the year-and-a-half-long campaign, and is functioning now as the President Elect’s flying White House in waiting. The Donald’s affinity for squeezing the most out of aging aircraft doesn’t just end with his personal airliner, he also has a 1997 Citation X . The aircraft is one of the first built as the type entered service just a year before it was completed—but Trump only acquired it 2012. Still, at ‘just” 19 years old, it is youngest aircraft in Trump’s fleet. A new Citation X can run upwards of $30 million, but ones predating the turn of the millennium can sell for less than a tenth that price. Trump’s more pedestrian Citation even made news earlier in the year when it was discovered that the aircraft may have been flying without an updated registration. Trump campaign communications manager Hope Hicks steps off Trump's Citation X in Muscatine, Iowa during the primary campaign. The jet has big Rolls Royce logos on its engines, which are indeed built by Rolls Royce, just like on his 757. Although, Rolls Royce engines on jet aircraft do not carry the same cache in the aviation world as the cars do in the auto world, AP Donald also has his beloved Sikorsky S-76 helicopters, three in total (N76DT, N7TE , G-TRMP), which allow him to make point-to-point trips around the Northeast, the Southeast and in the UK. N76DT also starred heavily in The Apprentice, but more recently one of these helicopters was used to give kids rides at the Iowa State Fair during the campaign. The helicopters were built in 1989 and 1990. Before that he flew around on a Super Puma and his shuttle airline had handful of S-61s and even Chinooks. Trump's motoring alongside his S-76 in a golf cart. This one is based in the UK and frequents his Turnberry Golf Club. , AP Why Donald buys these older airframes is pretty clear, he sees value in size over efficiency, whether that be a fleet size or the physical size of the aircraft. In terms of wealth: it takes far more up-front capital to purchase new aircraft than it does to buy old ones, and you can get a lot bigger jet for the money if you are willing to buy one that is well broken in. And that dynamic is supersized when it comes to old fuel-guzzling airliners turned VIP aircraft as few people want to be burdened with the cost of operating such a machine. The Donald exiting his 727 via its rear air-stairs., AP But for a guy whose persona is supposedly full of “yuge” and “beautiful” things, to the regular joe it sure looks like a personal 727 is so much ritzier than a brand new personal Gulfstream. And a quick google will show you enormous prices of the aircraft he owns— but those are for new models—not ones flying well into their third decade of service. Regardless of his motivations, a very clear truth emerges—Donald does know about operating and owning large aircraft, especially aging ones. That doesn’t mean that his conclusions about Air Force One are correct, or even that he has a handle on the issues surrounding the Air Force One recapitalization program, but considering that he has paid out of pocket for supporting and fueling aging aircraft, he knows more than the media is giving him credit for. Trump standing before his VIP Super Puma in 1987. , Photo by Joe McNally/Getty Images A New Air Force One Trump seems to balk at the cost of replacing the two VC-25As—aircraft that are approaching 30 years of service—which Trump says is around $4 billion.That figure seems to be a fairly accurate estimate, though his number is on the higher end of the estimate spectrum. A single 747-8i—which these new Presidential airlift aircraft will be based on—costs around $365 million from Boeing. But we’re not talking about the average crying baby hauler here. Pressed into Air Force service, these new aircraft will require a massive amount of systems integration work to be able to handle the job of Air Force One. This includes adapting them to host the most advanced flying communications suite there is, and making them hardened against the electromagnetic pulses given off by exploding nuclear weapons. It will also include building in and testing aerial refueling capabilities, lots of power generation, and integrating a self defense suite made up of the most complex constellation of missile countermeasures found on any aircraft in the world. Not just that, but the aircraft will also be subject to an avalanche of specific requirements, many from emanating from disparate agencies, which will all have to be folded into a single design that will only be replicated two or three times. Finally, the design has to take future expansion and upgradability into account at every turn—an expensive task upfront aimed at saving money down the road. In other words, this is tough and expensive work that has America’s national security relying on it. If Air Force One cannot act as a reliable flying command center, even during a nuclear exchange, the credibility of America’s nuclear deterrent erodes. The 747-8i that the next Air Force One will be based on., Dave Subelack/Wikicommons But there’s no question requirement creep for this type of program can quickly get out of control. Case in point: The VH-71 Kestrel program that aimed to replace current VH-3D and VH-60N “Marine One” helicopters with the European-designed, triple-engined, and US assembled derivative of the EH-101. Things got so out of hand during the helicopter’s concurrent development process that each of the 23 helicopters was slated to cost over $550 million—more than three times the original eyebrow-raising estimate. The program was cancelled after billions were spent, and the nine aircraft in various stages of completion at the time of termination were sold-off to Canada for a sickening $164 million to support their troubled Cormorant rescue helicopter program. A new program is now underway to replace Marine One , this time with the twin-engined Sikorsky S-92 as the base platform. Even this less-ambitious endeavour may be fiscally unpalatable for President Elect Trump, at least at first glance. What’s interesting is that the VH-71 program was cancelled by President Obama, who made a very similar off-the-cuff quip about it shortly after being elected, stating: “By the way, I’ve already talked to Gates about a thorough review of the helicopter situation. The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me.” He also added “It is an example of the procurement process gone amok, and we’re going to have to fix it.” A rendering of the VH-92 Presidential helicopter. The big difference between the VH-71 debacle is that Boeing’s Air Force One recapitalization program is nowhere near the distressful state that the VH-71 program was in when Obama singled it out. In fact, there is no contract to build a replacement for the VC-25As at all. Boeing has been down-selected as the supplier, and a $170 million contract has been put forward to better define what the specially outfitted 747-8is will look like, and how much they will cost if the program moves forward as planned. Boeing replied to Trump’s tweet with the following statement : “We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” So even if Trump cancelled the program altogether, it would not mean any aircraft would be orphaned, or any sort of production would stop. Yet doing so would mean that—unless somehow a new model of Presidential air travel was instituted under Trump—the current fleet of VC-25s will soldier on through the next decade instead of being replaced by 2024, as suggested by the current initiative. The problem with keeping the VC-25As flying indefinitely is that they are hideously expensive to operate. Air Force One is the most expensive aircraft in the DoD’s inventory to fly, at over $200,000 per hour —and it’s only going to get worse as the 747-200 continues to retire from airline service and support for the type dwindles. Not only that, but each President has flown more than his predecessor. This means that more will be asked of an already aging and tiny VC-25A fleet—which will eventually lead to gaps in aircraft availability. So what are Trump’s alternatives to continuing on with the Air Force One replacement program? First, he could tell the Pentagon to plan on operating the VC-25As for a certain number of years longer than planned. In doing so, adjustments will need to be made so that the Presidential airlift mission is not constantly stalled by decreasing aircraft availability. With this in mind, Trump could decide to fly far less than his predecessor. It would present a significant savings, but it seems unlikely, considering the guy found it necessary to have his own fleet of aircraft even as a private citizen. What’s more likely is that he’ll change the way the White House travels by utilizing smaller Boeing C-32A aircraft—more commonly known as Air Force Two when the Vice President is onboard—for domestic travel. These are 757s similar to the one Trump owns today, and although not nearly as large or lavish as the VC-25As, they already carry the President from occasionally when the Presidential jumbo jets cannot access certain airfields, or in the rare occurrence they are unavailable due to maintenance issues. Shifting a substantial portion of the Presidential airlift mission to the USAF’s fleet of six C-32As would likely require upgrades to these aircraft—although some have gone through a substantial upgrade recently. Using these aircraft for domestic flights would mean the White House had to travel with a smaller footprint. USAF C-40s (737s) could also be used to move non-essential personnel on these missions, and commercial charters could also be tasked alongside USAF aircraft. Under such a plan other government officials and their staffs that currently enjoy this level of air travel will have less access to C-40 and C32A aircraft than they had previously. Still, purchasing more C-40s and C-37s (Gulfstream Vs) is a far less expensive option than procuring more Presidential airlift aircraft—at least for now. Not just that, but it may be worth a look at how these aircraft are used by both civilian and military leadership—or at least taking a closer look at how their flight hours are allocated. A C-32A sits on the ramp as a VC-25A takes off., AP Another alternative available to the President is the similarly expensive-to-fly cousin of the VC-25A, the E-4B Advanced Airborne Command Post . These are America’s doomsday planes, equipped with all the goodies needed for the President to communicate and the country and its military during a time of war. Four of these aircraft exist, and the Secretary of Defense now uses the type when traveling abroad—a relatively new phenomenon. Though nowhere near as luxurious as Air Force One, these aircraft could stand in for the VC-25A during international or even domestic missions. In fact, one E-4B usually shadows Air Force One on missions abroad, flying into an airport dozens of miles away as a contingency aircraft. Trump could also chose to attempt to restructure the new Air Force One procurement initiative, possibly opting for another aircraft type in an attempt to save on up-front and sustainment costs. The only other type that would make sense would be the 777—though going this route would invite a degree of additional risk into normal Presidential air travel. The USAF mandates that the President’s primary aircraft have four engines. This has as much to do with redundancy against shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile strikes as it does with jet engine reliability. The 777, with its two massive turbofans, does not meet this requirement. Trump, who is accustomed to flying long distances under ETOPS rules on his twin-engined 757, could order a change of this rule. Still, saving tens of millions of dollars on the aircraft itself is just a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of turning that aircraft into Air Force One. The Boeing 747 has been flying the President since Bush 41, so a ton of know-how exists when it comes to adapting the type to this challenging mission. All requirements being the same—aside from number of engines and square footage—switching to a smaller twin engine aircraft cost more to develop than just sticking with the 747 family in the long run. President Obama waving from the cabin door of a C-32A., AP Setting Himself Up For “Yuge” Wins Like many things Presidential, “optics” seem to have a higher priority than substance. Trump’s calling out of a program that is fairly innocuous for being wasteful or overpriced accomplishes several things. First, it’s like punching the biggest, baddest guy on the cell block to make a point. That point being: I am not to be messed with. Maybe the guy didn’t deserve the jab but too bad as he was just a conduit for delivering a strong message. And if this program upsets Trump, wait till he starts digging through the maelstrom of garbage defense programs that we talk about here at The War Zone every day. This new Air Force One deal is nothing compared to the failed Littoral Combat Ship, or the too-big-to-fail F-35 Joint Strike Fighter—among many others. But they’re all on notice now, because the conclusion we’re coming to is the same conclusion all the head honchos of the big defense contractors were making yesterday morning as they sipped their coffee and glanced at the news. Turmp’s tweet, just like Obama’s calling out of the VH-71 program, sets up a looming narrative—one that is pre-packaged to show leadership from the front and aimed at elevating the administration’s change-agent profile early on. Most people will tune the hell out if you start trying to explain why the Ford class carrier is an absolute boondoggle . It’s a complex story to convey. But a simple message, that the President is giving up a new Air Force One for the sake of reform and austerity—even though he would never have flown on that jet if he won reelection and spent eight years in office—sure sounds like change is afoot and a new sheriff is in town . Trump is a master at finding unique angles on certain topics that vibe with key parts of the electorate. , AP The truth is that when the President travels, regardless of the aircraft her or she is in, so do a pair of Marine One helicopters via C-17, and the Presidential motorcade via C-5 or a series of C-17s. This is for every stop, everywhere. If the Marine One helicopters being used instead of the motorcade, MV-22 Ospreys also either self-deploy to the location or get airlifted by heavy transport. On top of this, many other people associated with the White House and Secret Service fly commercial or on other government aircraft. A spare command and control aircraft, usually a C-20C, also is deployed to an airfield nearby. With all these moving parts, each leg of each mission costs many hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions, just in air transport costs alone. When flying overseas, this aerial ballet turns into a flash mob, with an entire Air Force traveling alongside Air Force One. These aircraft include multiple C-5s, C-17s, MV-22s, VH-3Ds, VH-60Ns, C-20s, C-32s, C-37s and E-4Bs. Even E-6B Mercuries support these missions. Many of these aircraft are kept out of the public’s line of sight. International trips can cost many millions of dollars per-leg. So Air Force One, even with its brutally high operating costs, is just one piece in the larger—and much more costly—Presidential airlift puzzle. Presidential limos being loaded onto a C-17., USAF When you think of all this, and combine it with the fact that Trump has made an argument over the decades that operating older aircraft at high hourly cost is better than splurging for newer and more efficient ones, his anti-Air Force One replacement tweet make so much more sense. Consider it one part familiarity, two parts propaganda. The latter will work to prep the political battlefield of the near future with pre-packaged “wins” for the administration. Trump could execute any of the options above; but even if it makes the best financial sense to move forward with the Air Force One replacement program as is, doing so would be a missed opportunity to show the world that Trump can do better. If we’ve learned anything it’s that Trump wants to send the message that he can squeeze a better deal out of anyone and everyone, including Boeing. So with just a little restructuring of the program here and there—and some dollars thrown Boeing’s way for other projects—Trump could potentially announce that he fixed the problem. Trump aboard his personal 757., AP In the end, Air Force One replacement jets will get built. The VC-25As can’t fly forever and considering Boeing’s 747-8i line is at risk of being shuttered in the coming years (they are only producing six aircraft a year as it is) they probably will come to pass sooner than yesterday’s tirade would make you believe. In the meantime, these jets will act as nearly perfect political fodder for a very young Presidential administration that appears to have an unquenchable thirst for just that.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Footage has appeared online showing what’s described as the final moments of Afghan General Mohayedin Ghori’s life. The General died as his Mi-17 helicopter made an approach to land near Muri Chaq, in Badghis Province’s Bala Murghab district of Afghanistan. The video shows the helicopter approaching a landing zone, with armed fighters in the foreground awaiting its arrival. Then it seems as if the helicopter looses tail rotor rpm, resulting in a spin into the ground. It does not look as if the empennage of the aircraft was impacted by anything. The incident occurred on November 29th, and shortly thereafter the Taliban, which is very active in the area, claimed that they shot down the helicopter. Clearly, that doesn’t seem to be the case based on this video, although a few frames seem to missing for an unknown reason. Some reports state that the helicopter was making an emergency landing due to a mechanical issue before the devastating crash. Seven onboard the Mi-17 were injured, with the General being the only person who died during the incident. The head of the province’s ruling council and the chief intelligence officer for the province were among those onboard. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YlZBHe5dTGo Ghori was the commander of the Afghan National Army’s 207th Zafar Corps based in western Afghanistan, and was one of the country’s most notable military leaders.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 2, 2016",Another Russian Jet Crashed Into the Med While Landing On Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian media reports, and the Kremlin has confirmed , that an Su-33 had crashed in the Eastern Mediterranean while attempting to land on the Admiral Kuznetsov . The loss comes just days after a MiG-29KR assigned to the carrier’s air wing was lost while waiting to recover on the carrier. The ship’s arresting gear appears to have been at the center of both losses. The most recent crash was the result of one of the carrier’s cross-deck pendants—also known as a wire—snapping right after an Su-33’s tailhook caught it upon touchdown. With the wire partially slowing the aircraft before snapping, the Su-33 did not have enough energy to bolter, and return to the air. Deprived of airspeed, the jet plummeted into the sea. Thankfully the pilot was able to eject and was subsequently picked up alive by one of the ship’s helicopters. A video shows a similar loss of an Su-33 in 2005: In the case of the other loss days earlier, a wire snapped during a MiG-29KR’s landing. Though the jet was not lost, as its hook caught the next wire, It did cause another MiG-29KR still in the air to have to wait for the deck to be reset and cleared. Strangely the aircraft was not diverted to a nearby land base due to its low fuel state, and both the MiG’s engines flamed-out do to fuel starvation. The jet plummeted into the ocean although the pilot ejected safely. It has been noted that the Kuznetsov’s fighters have primarily been operating from Russia’s air base in Syria, not from the carrier as of late. It is not perfectly clear if the move to the land base happened before or after the loss of the second aircraft, though imagery of the base dated November 20th shows no less than eight Su-33s parked on the ramp there. Most reports put the Kuznetsov air wing’s fighter contingent at 10 Su-33s—eight of which are slightly upgraded—and four to five new MiG-29KRs. At least, that’s what was embarked on the ship when it left Severomorsk last October. A Su-33 about to trap aboard Russia's only carrier., AP Combat Aircraft says the aircraft that was lost was number Red 88, one of the Su-33s that have recently received the upgrades. The War Zone stated in early October : “Russia has executed a light upgrade of a portion of the tiny Su-33 fleet, which includes some modernized avionics and possibly the addition of the SVP-24 system , which helps improve accuracy of dumb bombs–the vast majority of air-to-ground weapons used on Syrian targets by Russian aircraft. While it’s an improvement on previous targeting systems, this new-found accuracy is not even remotely comparable to any modern guided air-to-ground munitions. These Su-33s also appear to have been overhauled mechanically and feature new paint.” A digital kneepad has also been seen worn by some Su-33 pilots which is part of the Su-33’s recent set of enhancements. This type of system is a less expensive and more adaptable alternative to outfitting the cockpit with up-to-date high-resolution multi-function displays and mission computers. The French executed a similar upgrade with their aging Super Étendards years before retiring the venerable jet last Summer. Russia maintains a small carrier-borne air wing that gets limited at-sea training due to the ship's low availability., AP There have been some reports stating that the carrier is slated to return
 to Russia on February 9th to go through a complex overhaul. Regardless of when the well-worn ship actually returns to Severomorsk, it will be interesting to see what changes, if any, Russia makes to its carrier aviation program—especially considering that its air wing will likely be on hiatus from shipboard operations for a very long time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 25, 2018",USAF Asks For Bids To Finally Replace Its Antique UH-1N Hueys,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USAF’s Vietnam era UH-1N Twin Hueys have soldiered on decades longer than most anticipated. Today most serve as utility and security support helicopters for the Air Force’s ballistic missile farms, while a single squadron of them also cart VIPs around Washington . After multiple attempts to replace them with a more modern platform, the USAF seems focused on finally making this happen once and for all, releasing a draft RFP for bidders to furnish 84 new airframes. Earlier this year the USAF said it would at least partially replace their Huey fleet with UH-60M Black Hawks, but that plan was withdrawn. Instead an open bidding competition is being executed for an off-the-shelf helicopter, with minimum requirements conservative enough that multiple manufacturers can participate. A VIP Twin Huey based out of Andrews AFB. According to Flightglobal , the helicopter must be able to carry nine equipped troops, have a range of at least 240 miles, endurance or at least three hours, and a cruise speed of at least 135 knots. Currently Sikorsky’s UH-60M, Airbus’s UH-72 Lakota, Leonardo’s AW139, and Bell’s UH-1Y are going to compete for the contract. All of these helicopters aside from the AW139 are currently in the DoD’s inventory. Although the four choices at hand each offer their own advantages, the very fact that a modernized verison of the Huey is still a competitor for this same mission, even against very modern designs like the AW139, is a testament to the type’s longevity. Currently the UH-1Y is serving the USMC brilliantly , and like the Marines, maybe the USAF will decide that replacing a Huey with another holds some merit. The vastly upgarded UH-1Y continues with a long lineage of Huey service in the Marine Corps., USMC It is good to see the USAF move forward with replacing their antique UH-1s, but creative options other than buying new helicopters existed. In the past I have posited reworking the Air Force’s HH-60G fleet that is now slated for replacement by another S-70/UH-60 variant— which is a whole other issue onto itself —for the more mundane utility and VIP transport roles. Alternatively, if a total helicopter force program were executed by the DoD, one that made the most out of all the helicopters in inventory across all the services, another already paid for replacement may have been available. For instance, the Army’s controversial decision to retire all Jet Ranger variants, including its fleet TH-67 and OH-58 training helicopters, and replacing them with the much larger, more expensive and complex UH-72 Lakotas was a laughably wasteful move. The USAF UH-1N remain very active considering their age. Instead, 81 already in service but practically new UH-72s could have been transferred to the USAF to replace its UH-1Ns. Instead those helicopters are teaching Army pilots how to takeoff and land. Not just that, but another 108 UH-72s had to be purchased to fully equip the Army’s training fleet. Those funds could have been spent elsewhere. The Army's UH-72 Lakota., DoD Interservice asset allocation is maybe one of the most frustrating and frankly depressing ways the Pentagon’s chronic mismanagement rears its ugly head. But wishful thinking aside, at least the USAF will be getting a new helicopter type, or at least subtype, in the not so distant future. Which helicopter, in service or new, do you think would be best to provide Washington DC big-wig limo service and for taking care of America’s ICBMs?

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Office of Naval Research are literally doubling down on the Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node concept—better known as Tern—ordering two full-scale technology demonstrators instead of just one. The news came as multiple design reviews surrounding critical Tern components were successful, allowing the Northrop Grumman and Aerovironment team that was selected to build Tern to continue to move forward with program. On top of all this positive news, Northrop Grumman has released a pretty sweet new conceptual video showing what Tern will look like in action. Tern has the potential to totally change the way US Navy’s surface combatants operate and fight. Providing a fixed-wing, medium-altitude, medium-endurance (MAME) unmanned capability to small-deck warships that have historically been relegated to operate shorter ranged, slower and lower flying helicopters would be a game changer. The project aims to give everything from a Littoral Combat Ship to a “gator navy” amphibious assault ship an unmanned aircraft capability analogous to something between the USAF’s MQ-1 Predator and a MQ-9 Reaper. But unlike those unmanned systems, Tern will require no runway at all. Fielding Tern operationally would give these ships the ability to survey massive amounts of the earth’s surface and sky far from the ship’s location—up to about 900 miles away according to the Pentagon—using many types of sensors. These could include radars, electronic intelligence collecting systems or exotic electro-optical payloads , as well as communications relay and data fusion equipment . But surveillance and communications support is not the aircraft’s only mission, it will also have teeth. Tern is being created to carry around a 600 pound payload, that can include missiles and guided bombs. It could use this capability to not only attack ships at sea, but also to support special operations or Marines on the ground. In fact, a single Tern should eventually be able to provide armed overwatch and communications relay duties at once. Make sure to read all about Tern, its potential applications, including those beyond the naval warfare space, and about its throw-back design in this past feature . The Tern concept. , DOD As the Tern program enters its third phase the prototypes are under construction. Once finished they’ll enter a graduated testing program. If initially successful, Tern could go to sea for testing on a platform the same size as those found on the flight deck of destroyers, cruisers and Littoral Combat Ships. A significant part of the flight testing side of the program will be proving that the craft can land of the pitching and rolling decks during rough seas, something that tests the skills of the best helicopter pilots around . Not only that, but the big “tail sitting” flying wing craft will also have to prove that it can be easily wheeled around a flight deck and stored in a typical destroyer’s hangar bay. Who knows, if the Tern demonstrators are as successful as the Navy’s other recent unmanned technology demonstrator program— the X-47B UCAVs —they could go on to pave the way for an entirely new class of air combat vehicle. And that’s precisely what DARPA and ONR seems to have in mind.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 13, 2016","Russia Threatens To Shoot Down Ukrainian Test Missiles, Ukraine Fires Anyway","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Moscow said that Russia was prepared to swat Kiev’s missiles out of the sky with surface-to-air missiles located in fortress Crimea and on Russian warships in the Black Sea, but according to Ukraine, that never happened. Last week Ukraine released a notice to airman (NOTAM) regarding a series of S-300 surface-to-air missile tests slated for December 1st and 2nd that would occur off the country’s southwestern shores. Moscow was unhappy with the planned exercise, saying the test area violated their airspace near Crimea—the land mass that they seized from Ukraine in early 2014. According to Ukraine, the test area was 18 miles from Crimean airspace and outside of the 12 mile internationally recognized border. A revised notice to airman was posted yesterday that shifted the test area further from Crimean airspace, but Russia still seemed unsatisfied with the prospects of any missile test occurring at all. Ukraine fired back—verbally—saying that the missile test would occur in accordance to international law and would not threaten Crimean airspace in the least. Ukraine’s President Poroshenko stated : “I want to emphasize that the launches are taking place in open sea over Ukrainian airspace, in full accordance with international law… The launches will go on regardless of any statement released by Moscow. The only reason that makes us conduct these exercises is the need to be consistently ready for any full-scale invasion from the side of our aggressive neighbor.” Meanwhile, Russia’s MoD spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the following regarding the situation: “In the Kremlin we wouldn’t want to see any actions by the Ukrainian side that breached international law and that might create dangerous conditions for international flights over the territory of Russia and adjacent regions.” Peskov’s statement is ironic considering the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine by a SAM, an incident for which Russia has been at least partially blamed . Then there is the fact that Crimea was seized from Ukraine via a military operation in a move that left little regard for international law. It’s also worth noting that Russia has held constant large-scale military exercises in the area since annexing the Peninsula, including long-range bombers . Additionally, Moscow has armed Crimea with its latest weaponry, including advanced jet fighters and surface-to-air and coastal anti-ship missile systems. Not to mention that Sevastopol is home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which totally eclipses the meager naval capabilities of Ukraine. Furthermore, Russia’s surface combatants are stuffed with anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, making the Black Sea a kind of inaccessible super missile engagement zone (SMEZ). The Black Sea Fleet force also includes thousands of Russia’s equivalent of Marines, and a flotilla of amphibious assault vessels that puts any beach Black Sea beach at risk of invasion. A Ukranian S-300P SAM likely similar to the ones tested today. , Віталій/Wikicommons All this has occurred as Russia deployed one of its most
 advanced SAM systems to the region . Yet the idea that Russia could shoot down one SAM with another seemed doubtful at best,—though it’s possible they could have attempted to take down the target drones the Ukrainian SAMs were slated to intercept. Still, just hours before the test launch window opened, Russia supposedly released its own notice to airman stating that it would shoot down any missiles fired even within the revised test area. #Russia NOTAM states #Ukraine missile test launches will be destroyed – follows #Crimea deployment of S-300V series pic.twitter.com/qEdSmjlEtW — Joseph Dempsey (@JosephHDempsey) December 1, 2016 Ukraine ended up firing the missiles as it had planned this morning, with the test being deemed a success by Ukrainian military officials. Two days were allotted for the exercise so more tests may occur tomorrow. https://youtube.com/watch?v=TZvB85Vq3JY It is hard to understand how Ukraine’s test of a couple of defensive anti-air missiles is any threat to Russia—and the truth is that it isn’t. For Russia, it’s just another fulcrum from which to leverage Kiev with its military might. Russia’s propensity for over compensation in these matters does not just lie just in the abstract. Powerful officials in Moscow don’t only condemn the idea of the test, they actually float the idea of some sort of retribution for executing it. Konstanin Kosachev, the Foreign Policy Committee chair in the Russian parliament stated the following regarding the planned launch: “We have will have to respond militarily… Of course this would be the least desirable scenario, and all of us must work to prevent it… But eight years ago the leader of another country that was in conflict with Russia, I’m referring to Georgia, decided to test our military. And we all know how that ended. I hope Ukrainian officials remember the lesson from that experience.” As the rhetoric heats up over Ukraine’s innocuous missile tests, reports that Russia has rapidly amassed 55,000 soldiers and their equipment along the Ukrainian-Russian border. Another 30,000 are now stationed on Ukraine’s southern border in Crimea. The rapid buildup of fighting forces remains a mystery, but there are fears in Ukraine that those troops could quickly blitz into Ukraine. Then again Putin’s playbook is all about keeping adversaries guessing, and Russian snap deployments have become an all too common occurrence along Europe’s eastern border—a capability that has bewildered some NATO generals.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 14, 2016",Iran Mulls Over Opening Up Naval Bases In Syria And Yemen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the Middle East continues to morph in ways previously unrealized , Iran may be aiming to increase its military reach drastically. Iranian proxies—such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and more recently Houthi rebels in Yemen—have extended Iran’s military influence abroad. Yet the strategic utility of these groups alone pales in comparison to that provided by actually having military outposts in the regions where they operate. In other words, when you pair a regular military asset like a naval base with these irregular proxy elements, the sum is greater than their parts. Not just that, but persistently holding a military presence far from Iranian shores opens up a new set of tactical and strategic possibilities. Now it looks as if Tehran has come to the same conclusion and is now actively mulling over the possibility of doing just that–establishing naval bases in or very near Syria and Yemen. General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, Iran’s top general, told the semi-state ran Tasnim news agency the following: “Maybe, at some point we will need bases on the shores of Yemen and Syria.” Bagheri went on to compare doing so with a nuclear program, saying that “having naval bases in remote distances is not less than nuclear power… It is ten times more important and creates deterrence.” The general also described the possibility of doing this, at least partially, by using sea basing platforms which require virtually no in-situ infrastructure in the countries near where they deploy. General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, Tasnim News Agency/Wikicommons Setting up basing in or near Yemen or Syria would not just signal a drastic shift in Iran’s military posture, but it could also greatly complicate interdiction efforts that attempt to keep arms—especially high-end ones—out of the hands of Iranian-backed non-state actors. If Iran were to set up naval bases in Syria they would be able to more reliably supply Hezbollah fighters operating in Lebanon and actively fighting for the Assad regime in Syria’s ever more internationalized civil war. Hezbollah is known to already have higher-end weaponry , and they’ve used anti-ship missiles successfully in the past . Were there another major entanglement with Israel, it’s feared Hezbollah would put these weapons to use, greatly increasing the volatility of such a conflict. We know all too well that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have been armed with weaponry traditionally under the control of state actors—namely anti-ship missiles. Those missiles have destroyed one UAE flagged vessel and were fired multiple times at US vessels patrolling the area. Currently these missiles and other war materials are smuggled ashore . If Iran were to set up a naval base in Yemen it would not only create a direct supply route for resupplying Houthi fighters in the western part of the country but it would also drastically complicate an already very complicated conflict. Iranian troops fire shore-based anti-ship missiles during training., AP Doing so may also be a sign of a greater overall strategy, one that the general loosely alludes to. Iran is aware of the strategic value of the Mandeb Strait, especially when it comes to international commerce, just as they have long understood the value of the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Being able to quickly close this naval corridor—via mines and/or the threat of anti-ship missile and small boat attack—would give Iran great leverage far from its own shores. This is a strategy we discussed in-depth just as the Yemeni civil war became largely internationalized a couple years ago . Saudi Arabia, who is leading the fight against Iran’s Houthi-rebels in Yemen, would be especially vulnerable to the closing of both the Strait of Hormuz and the Mandeb Strait via Iranian military action, or that of its proxies. It would cut off the Kingdom’s ability to supply oil to the eastern hemisphere. If Iran had a naval base in Syria, giving them persistent access to the Eastern Mediterranean, they could threaten Saudi oil exports that are pumped via pipeline to terminals in the Red Sea that then travel through the Suez Canal to customers in the western hemisphere. Doing so, in combination with actions in the Strait of Hormuz and Mandeb Strait, would effectively shut down all Saudi energy exports and the Kingdom’s cash flow. Although such tactics would likely lead to a much wider war, their greatest utility would be just as the general said, as a deterrent. As such, this scenario would be something Sunni Arab gulf states, and especially Saudi Arabia, would have to factor carefully before attacking Iran. In other words, the ability to even threaten the whole of Saudi Arabia and other oil producing Arab nations’ energy exports, even if just for a limited amount of time, is a bewildering possibility for Saudi Arabia and its allies to grapple with and could provide Iran with some level of additional deterrence against future aggression by the ever more heavily armed Sunni gulf states. Iranian navy's replenishment vessel IS Kharg passes through the Suez canal., AP Iranian naval bases in the eastern Med and/or near the Horn of Africa would be a direct challenge to the US and its allies who are already firmly entrenched militarily in both regions. Today, NATO aligned European countries wield military dominance in the eastern Mediterranean, along with Israel, all of which would not be comforted by the idea of Tehran setting up shop in their backyard. In the Gulf of Aden, the US has had an ever increasing presence at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti since shortly after 9-11. Having the Iranians install a naval base nearby would likely lead to a rapid buildup of military capabilities in the region by both parties, and others as well. When it comes to Syria, it is possible that Tehran’s ever closer strategic partner, Russia, could offer naval base in Tartus, Syria up for the Iranian Navy’s continuous use. Iran has opened its air bases up to Russian combat aircraft , so allowing the Iranians to have a presence in Tartus seems like something that is more probable than just possible. This is especially true considering Russia now basically owns the vast majority of the port , as opposed to the smaller portion of it they leased from the Syrian government for decades. Finally, the fact that the general notes the possibility of using some sort of off-shore sea base concept—at least initially—to set up a continuous naval presence abroad is intriguing. Iran understands gas and oil platforms very well, they also understand littoral combat operations equally as well as their native environment has dictated as much. Putting the two together—to some degree at least—in an expeditionary manner makes a lot of sense. The truth is that Iranian warships have ventured farther and farther from their home turf in recent years and the Iranians definitely have had an interest in expanding their naval sphere of influence long before the general’s recent statements. And clearly Iran has kept a close watch on America’s use of sea bases in the Persian Gulf over the last 30 years. They have also likely kept a keen eye on the giant leaps in capability the US Navy has made in recent years involving the concept, building massive purpose-built floating forward staging bases and logistical arteries. Even US Special Operations Command has their own sea base under construction which will be a far cry from the austere barges used during the Tanker Wars of the 1980s. An American sea base barge in the Persian Gulf during Operation Prime Chance. , USN With all this in mind, we could see Iran deploy a similar strategy in the near term, and even naval ports abroad in the longer-term. The question then is what would or could the US and its allies do about it? The answer to that question, at least from the Iranian’s point of view, could likely be “not much,” at least if Russia’s and China’s extra-territorial expansion efforts are any indication. Yet assuming that the US would not intervene, or at least try to, may be a misjudgement as America has always exercised a far heavier hand with Iran than its rival nuclear-armed military competitors Russia and China. Setting up a mobile sea base will be a higher-risk, but lower-cost endeavor for Iran. It may be more flexible and far cheaper, but it will not have the same protections and cache that having an actual port in a host country could offer. Still, the barriers to entry are lower with a mobile sea base than installing a naval base, and Iran definitely has the money to construct one of these platforms following the execution of the P5+1 nuclear deal that saw billions in Iranian funds unfrozen. We’ll have to wait and see if Iran moves forward with some or any of these strategies, but considering their expanded influence on the ground abroad, it is likely only a matter of time till a similar strategy manifests itself in the naval realm.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 23, 2019",Russian Carrier Jets Move To Syrian Land Base As Aleppo Begins To Fall,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According to new satellite imagery , Admiral Kuznetsov , the Russian aircraft carrier sailing off the coast of Syria, has dispatched nearly its entire fighter jet inventory (eight Su-33s and one MiG-29KR) to Moscow-controlled Hmeimim Air Base in Syria. The move comes after the loss of a new MiG-29KR — one of Russia’s most advanced fighter aircraft — as it was waiting to recover aboard the carrier following a mission over Syrian territory. The Admiral Kuznetsov had just been on station for just a few days before the loss occurred. The Admiral Kuznetstov’s fighters could be using the base as a forward-arming and refueling point (FARP) to increase their bombing sortie rates. By utilizing the base’s runway, these aircraft can carry far more weaponry and fuel on each sortie than they can when using the Kuznetsov’s ski jump. Despite that advantage, sending most of the ship’s fast-jet inventory to a Syrian airbase as a temporary stop-off point before returning to the ship seems highly unlikely. Especially since large strike packages have not really been used by Russia for the fairly rudimentary duties their fast jets have been called upon to execute during the conflict. Safely operating fixed-wing aircraft from a carrier isn’t easy or cheap — and doing it in a sustained manner over multiple months presents a whole other set of challenges, risks and costs. The Kuznetsov’s presence in the Eastern Mediterranean has never held much tactical importance when it came to the conflict in Syria. Russia has bases in-country, and carrier operations remain a transient military capability for the Kremlin , so sending a carrier to the region makes little sense. What the deployment lacks in tactical relevance it makes up for (at least superficially) in larger strategic significance — especially when it comes to “optics” surrounding such a deployment; both for international and domestic consumption. By dispatching the Kuznetsov — along with the largest flotilla Russia has assembled since the end of the Cold War to the waters off Syria — and executing highly publicized operations before sending naval fighters ashore, Russia gets a big propaganda win leveraging the most out of the fighters it has in the region, even if carrier operations are limited. By continuing to release snippets of video showing different types of operations aboard the carrier, the public in Russia and abroad will assume that the ship continues participating in large-scale air strikes — and that it’s effective at its intended mission — even though the truth may tell otherwise. Hence this video of a KA-52K flying around the carrier that has just popped-up online: https://youtube.com/watch?v=C-qcLUY-Vp0 It is possible that a bit of both scenarios are occurring, with limited operations continuing on the Kuznetsov , but with the vast majority of the air wing’s strikes emanating from Russia’s master jet base in Syria. Then again, this near-total evacuation of combat punch from the Kuznetsov could have a different and more momentary purpose altogether. We will just have to wait for more satellite imagery to find out. Either way, it’s another reminder of how things rarely are as they appear when it comes to Russian military operations. Su-33s armed up on Kuznetsov's deck during its transit through the English Channel. The carrier seems to have acted more like a transport ship than a combat vessel. , AP Meanwhile, as expected , the campaign to break Aleppo has hit new levels of depravity, with bombs striking eastern Aleppo at a rate never seen before. Now, two large districts in northeastern part of the city has been seized from rebel control via a ground assault by Assad’s Iranian, Russian and Shiite militia-backed forces. The thrust into the area looks to be a dividing maneuver, used in an attempt to cut the rebel’s communications, supply lines and combat punch in half. Roughly one third of the rebel-held territory in Aleppo has been seized by Assad’s forces and their allies since this latest offensive kicked off. In the process the humanitarian situation has turned from bleak to downright doomed. Some estimates state that at least 250,000 innocent people remain trapped in the metropolis, nearly half of whom are children. Food, water and medical supplies are becoming dwindling, and medical
 facilities are no longer operating anywhere in the city. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uaboq1LvHBI Russia denies that its aircraft are active over Aleppo since resuming air strikes nearly two weeks ago. Regardless, US officials are not decoupling Russia from responsibility for the horrors occurring in the besieged city. The US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, stated the following just last week: “”The reality is that the Assad regime and Russia are continuing their ‘starve, get bombed, or surrender’ strategy in eastern Aleppo… Between November 13 and 15, five hospitals in Syria were struck. Five hospitals in two days. After airstrikes hit another hospital in eastern Aleppo on November 18, every hospital in that city is now reportedly out of service due to attacks by Russia and the Assad regime. Every single hospital serving a population of 275,000 civilians, out of commission. On November 6, an attack by the Assad regime on a Damascus suburb reportedly killed at least six children in a kindergarten. A kindergarten… During this pause in strikes, Russia and the Assad regime never gave the UN permission to deliver a single parcel of food or medicine to eastern Aleppo. Not one.” Power went on to chide Russia for not condemning any of these attacks, and made it clear that top officials will be held accountable in a similar manner to war criminals in the past, stating: “Attacks on civilians fuel terrorism; they don’t defeat terrorism. The perpetrators must also know that, like their ignominious predecessors through history, they will face judgment for their crimes.” US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power. , AP Russian media has continuously painted a very different picture of events in Aleppo and has constantly touted “humanitarian corridors” as a great success in keeping innocents out of the fighting and indiscriminate bombing. Yet other reports state that these corridors are widely untrusted and unreliable, with both sides being accused of firing on innocents trying to leave the city. Last week’s UN-backed humanitarian aid deal for Aleppo, supposedly agreed to by the rebels, seems to be in limbo waiting for a formal Syrian government and Russian response. Days after the plan had supposedly been put forward, Russian officials acted as if they had no solid information on it and were quick to go back to the same rhetoric concerning the ‘terrorists’ they and their Syrian allies are fighting. Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov stated: “The Russian Defense Ministry is ready to support any initiatives on delivering humanitarian aid to civilians in Syria not only from UN, but also from other international organizations and countries, regarding both eastern Aleppo and other parts of Syria… Thousands of tonnes of humanitarian aid from Russia were already delivered by the Russian Center on Reconciliation in Syria to the provinces of Aleppo, Hama, Homs, Damascus, Latakia, Palmyra, Deir ez-Zor and other cities… Talking about statements made by Mr Egeland (Special Advisor to the UN Special Envoy for Syria) on Aleppo, the Russian Defense Ministry does not have reliable information on alleged agreement of the ‘armed opposition’ to delivery of humanitarian aid. There are no names, evidence or documents, apart from Mr Egeland’s words… If the ‘opposition’ in Aleppo agrees to humanitarian aid and evacuation of civilians, who has mined and shells all humanitarian corridors then? Who opens fire from mortars and self-made rocket launchers at residential areas of western Aleppo?… Do terrorists know about his (Egeland’s) agreements with ‘opposition forces’? Or are the ‘opposition forces’ terrorists themselves that kill Aleppo residents at night and hold talks with UN representative Egeland during the day?” Russian MoD spokesman Igor Konashenkov., AP Supposedly going on quietly beneath all this rhetoric is a last-ditch effort by John Kerry’s State Department to come up with some sort of lasting ceasefire in Aleppo. This obviously entails a race against time in regards to the military situation on the ground in the war-torn city as well as in regards to changing political realities in the US. The Trump Administration is less than two months out from taking over America’s diplomatic reins, and massive changes in regards to America’s policy vis-a-vis Russia and Syria will come with it. It is also important to note an incident that happened involving Turkish ground forces and Syrian aircraft last Thursday. Details remain sketchy, but the attack supposedly happened near the city of Al-Bab, located just 20 miles east of Aleppo and 18 miles from the Turkish-Syrian border. At around 3AM local time, bombs struck an area where Turkish special forces were located, killing three operatives and wounding ten more. Syria denied the airstrike , but Ankara seems to be sticking to its claim that Syrian aircraft were to blame, not ISIS artillery. A Turkish CN-235 brings a soldier's body home following a supposed Syrian air strike against Turkish troops near the town of Al Bab, Syria., AP It was the first time Turkish forces have been attacked by Syrian government forces since Ankara dove deeper into the conflict with a ground offensive late last summer . The incident also occurred on the one year anniversary of Turkey shooting down a Russian Su-24 Fencer based in Syria that had very briefly entered Turkish airspace. After many months of estrangement following the shoot-down , Russia and Turkey have become close once again. The coup attempt on Turkish President Erdogan largely catalyzed this change in diplomacy. Still, Turkish-Syrian relations remain very poor, with the Assad regime seeing Turkey’s backing of anti-Assad rebel forces as a move to overthrow the regime. Turkish soldiers’ presence near Al Bab is part of what is becoming a race among multiple factions to see who can sack the city first. Turkish-backed rebels, Kurdish fighters and Assad’s forces are all advancing on the ISIS stronghold. These factions oppose one another and are already in a shooting war to at least some degree with at least one other player in the trio. With this in mind, it is unclear how these forces will interact with one another as they converge on the city, although even the thought of them holding off fighting among themselves until they can liberate the city is likely very wishful thinking. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7P-xzo6VA8Q All this prompts questions as to what happens if, or when ISIS is no longer a centralized threat within Syria’s borders. The likelihood of an even bloodier and more fractured mutation of the Syrian civil war looms bright, as this scenario becomes a tangible possibility. Forces that oppose Assad currently focused on defeating ISIS may well turn their internationally furnished weapons and training against the regime once ISIS no longer holds major territory in the country. Assad’s forces will likely do the same, re-tasking Shiite-militias and Russian-backed forces in an attempt to crush anyone who opposes the regime, without the distractions of ISIS or Aleppo to get in their way. Iraq too could also quickly fall into its own civil war once ISIS is no longer a common threat within the country. Such a situation would result in unprecedented political and military turmoil ranging from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. That both conflicts, Syria and Iraq, have more deeply invested international stakeholders than ever before makes them much more volatile — especially considering the great geopolitical shifts of the last few years . If both countries were to become embroiled in deep sectarian and politically-driven fighting, without a common enemy to justify the violence, a much larger potential for a wider globalized conflict would develop than what currently exists today. Fighting in Mosul, ISIS last and largest stronghold in Iraq, has been door-to-door and rooftop-to-rooftop brutal urban wafare. , AP It is impossible to deny that at this point all the building blocks for such a conflict are quickly falling into place. As such, it will take great diplomatic maneuvering to see that this does not come to pass. This will be a huge challenge for the new Trump administration to tackle as it settles into the White House in January. Finally, the sad news hit late last week that for the first time an American soldier has died in Syria. 42 year old Senior Chief Petty Officer Scott Dayton, a highly decorated sailor, was reported to have been killed by an improvised explosive device in the town of Ayn Issa, Syria.

We talk a lot about the increasing strategic importance of Earth’s frigid northern latitudes, but also worth mentioning is just how gorgeous this part of the world can be. Case in point the village of Maniitsoq, located on Greenland’s western shore. Only about 2,500 people live in Maniitsoq, but that still equals about five percent of Greenland’s total population. Although the area is thought to have been settled for nearly four millennia, it was officially “settled” in 1782 by Danish traders. Like all of Greenland, Maniitsoq is part of an autonomous state under the Danish Realm. The town’s setting, age, and the natural inlets that run through it make it one of the most picturesque in Greenland. Air travel to the village is served primarily by Air Greenland and their short landing and takeoff (STOL) capable Bombardier Dash-8 Q200s. The video shows how amazing the approach into the airport is. The runway is just 2,621 feet long and is perched on a cliff above Maniitsoq Island’s western shore.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Operating helicopters off of underway “small deck” surface combatants is not a job for the faint of heart. Some very brave pilots and deck crews go about these operations everyday—in good weather they are challenging, in bad weather they can be downright horrifying. It is a unique and very unforgiving flight environment where everything, including the surface of the earth, is undulating different directions—the ultimate dance of industrial technology and human hand-eye coordination. The video below was just released by the Danish Ministry of Defense and it serves as textbook example of just how squirly it can get out there. In it, one of the Danish Air Force’s handful of new MH-60R Seahawks boards the Thetis class ocean patrol vessel HDMS Vædderen (F359) while crashing through rough seas near the Faroe Islands . https://youtube.com/watch?v=vhjTdsOhlGU These ships were designed for the often violent conditions found in the North Sea, and the MH-60R is one of the finest and most proven multi-purpose naval helicopters ever built, but simply having good equipment doesn’t make such an operation easy, far from it. Landing a helicopter on a small pitching and rolling deck can be a deadly affair as the margin between a safe landing and disaster is quite thin. In fact, any terminal operations around a ship can go terribly wrong even when the best aviators are at the helo’s controls. Sometimes just the ocean’s motion can leave a helicopter with severe damage even after the helicopter is safely on the ship’s deck. The videos below of other examples of just how harrowing small deck helicopter ops can be. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NJIZTL2ZyEw https://youtube.com/watch?v=8yhTwOyUS8w There are solutions that make recovering and securing helos on small deck ships safer and more crew friendly. Among others, the Recovery, Assist, Secure and Traverse (RAST) system is popular on high-end naval warships. It helps by winching the helicopter aboard the ship, and once it’s down, the umbilical attached to the helicopter’s belly locks it to the deck. A shuttle and track system allow the helicopter to then be rolled into the ship’s hangar bay while the aircraft is still secured to the deck. Here is the RAST system in action: A less invasive system, called the Aircraft Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) system doesn’t use a winch-like umbilical to pull the helicopter onto the deck, but instead uses laser beacons on the helicopter and receivers on the ship’s stern to not only display visual landing aids to the pilot but to also dynamically position a shuttle right under the aircraft when it touches down. Once the helicopter has made contact with the deck, the shuttle locks onto a dongle hung from under the helicopter, thus securing the helicopter to ship’s deck. The shuttle system can also maneuver the recovered helicopter around the deck and into the ship’s hangar. Here is ASIST in action: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Fii_dALkdcU UK defense company MacTaggart Scott pioneered the development of shipboard helicopter recovery assist systems in the 1960s. The first being developed for the diminutive Westland Wasp helicopter . The basic concept lives on in the deck-lock system and others like it and, most notably the increasingly popular Helligrid system. Basically, these systems don’t help pilots make safe contact with the deck of a ship, but they do make sure the helicopter stays put once contact has been made. This is done by a “harpoon” like dongle that hangs below the helicopter’s belly, similar to the one used in the ASIST system. Once that “harpoon” touches a grid area on the deck of ship it snaps onto it, safely holding the helicopter on the ship’s deck. It looks like the HDMS Vædderen has such a system in place and it was likely used during the MH-60R’s recovery shown in the video at the top of this post. Here is more about Helligrid: These shipboard helicopter recovery assist systems are only becoming more relevant as unmanned rotary-wing aircraft begin to be commonplace aboard surface combatants. Come to think of it, it would be interesting to see just how rough of seas unmanned helicopters could operate in and how exactly they compare to their manned counterparts. Still it’s safe to say that there will still be brave air and deck crews recovering helicopters on ships in the most horrible conditions imaginable for decades to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 6, 2016",Canada To Purchase 18 Super Hornets While Future Fighter Competition Looms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Common sense is running strong in Ottawa as the Canadian Ministry of Defense has decided to move forward with negotiations for 18 Boeing Super Hornets as an interim fighter solution. We reported on this plan last June while it was still in the works. Now Defense Minister Sajjan has made it policy , along with other steps that will be taken to revitalize Canada’s overstretched tactical air power capabilities. The purchase will bolster Canada’s aging Hornet fleet while the competition to replace Canada’s roughly 75 CF-18s gets underway. It is estimated that the competition, which Sajjan said will be “wide open,” will take around five years to complete once it kicks off. This would push a final decision on the future of Canada’s fast jet fleet into the early 2020s at the soonest. Sajjan also said that increases in manpower and sustainment investments surrounding the CF-18 fleet will be made in order to keep them flying until they can be replaced. The case for Canada buying Super Hornets is extremely solid , and procuring a small fleet of the jets will put the type in an even more favorable position for further purchases down the line. This interim Super Hornet solution also gets around some looming financial issues surrounding the Trudeau Administration’s propensity to turn its back on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter–a program in which Canada has been a partner since 2001. Canada's Hornets have received constant upgrades but are wearing out fast, leaving the fleet hard-pressed to meet commitments. , DOD Even if Canada decides to purchase F-35s after completing the competition, the Joint Strike Fighter program will likely be in a far more stable and developed position than it is at present. This equals less risk and probably lower unit costs than what can be had today. Also, if Canada purchases F/A-18Fs as part of this interim buy, these aircraft can later be converted to EA-18G Growler configuration after a new fighter is selected. This would give Canada a high-end electronic attack capability, one that’s very high in demand within NATO that potential Canadian F-35s could benefit from greatly. Canada’s decision to move forward with an interim Super Hornet purchase comes just as Boeing has realized two long-awaited fighter jet orders from the middle east . Qatar will be purchasing 72 advanced F-15 Strike Eagle derivatives, and Kuwait has finally been approved to buy 40 advanced Super Hornet models, some of which will feature conformal fuel tanks developed under the Super Hornet International Roadmap/Advanced program. Super Hornet Advanced with conformal fuel tanks., Boeing These two fighter contracts alone will keep Boeing’s St. Louis plant humming into the early part of the next decade. Boeing hopes additional Eagle and Super Hornet sales–as well as a USAF selection of its T-X competitor as the service’s next jet trainer–will help stabilize the historic plant’s future prospects and the company’s heritage as a fast tactical jet manufacturer. Canada still has to negotiate a price with Boeing for the Super Hornets, but they might get a very good deal considering that even a limited number of the jets could lead to future sales. Not only that, but spreading out the buy into multiple tranches would allow Boeing to extend its Super Hornet line even further into the next decade.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More bad news for the DDG-1000 program broke yesterday, when the USS Zumwalt broke down while transiting the Panama Canal. The incident happened as the stealthy destroyer negotiated the Miraflores locks on the Pacific side of the canal. The ship had to be towed to the port of Rodman (old Balboa Naval Station) for repairs. Navy Times initially reported that the ship’s heat exchangers experienced a failure. These critical components of the ship’s exotic integrated power plant produce a whopping 78 megawatts of electricity that power everything from the ship’s propulsion to sensors–and potentially even weapons in the future. Now, USNI News reports that water intrusion was noticed in two of the the four major bearings that connect the ship’s Advanced Induction Motors that drive the ship’s shafts, both of which subsequently locked up. Apparently, as result of the mechanical failure, Zumwalt had a collision with the lock walls resulting in some form of damage, although at this point the collision is being called minor. Commander Ryan Perry, a spokesperson for the Navy’s Third Fleet stated the following on Monday: “Vice Adm. Nora Tyson, commander, US Third Fleet, has directed USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000) to remain at ex-Naval Station Rodman in Panama to address engineering issues that occurred while transiting the Panama Canal. The timeline for repairs is being determined now, in direct coordination with Naval Sea Systems and Naval Surface Forces. The schedule for the ship will remain flexible to enable testing and evaluation in order to ensure the ship’s safe transit to her new homeport in San Diego.” This schedule has now been determined to include ten days for repairs in Rodman before the ship can hopefully continue on its way to San Diego. https://youtube.com/watch?v=RG8u-GAEfeM It is not the first time Zumwalt has had a high-profile breakdown , and just weeks ago another incident involving a new US Navy ship occurred in the Panama Canal, when Littoral Combat Ship USS Montgomery suffered a fissure in its hull . The break was the second in just a month’s time for the Montgomery , this one a result of hitting a concrete wall in one of the canal’s locks. The Zumwalt class is just a shell of its intended self , with many capabilities left on the table during the latter years of the ship’s design and construction. Just recently it was disclosed the the ship’s twin Advanced Gun Systems, which basically take up the forward third of the vessel, will not have any ammo to fire. There are logical alternatives to the AGS –but installing them would require time and money. The time to do so is nearing as the ship–just commissioned on October 15th–will be in dry dock in San Diego for about a year once it arrives. This down period will be used to install many of the ship’s one-off combat systems. Zumwalt's expansive bow area and peripheral VLS system., AP In the end, all this could be for not, as the class of just three ships is looking more and more like an experimental program than an operational one. Depending on how the new administration views DDG-1000, ships could even end up being cannibalized for parts to keep one or two operational–or retired prematurely altogether due to high operating and sustainment costs. On the other hand, the White House could revise the Navy’s myopic reliance on a further outgrowth of the already mature Arleigh Burke class destroyer design (known as Flight III ships) and bring DDG-1000 up to its long intended potency–and even build more of the class altogether.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The embarrassing crash of one of just four new MiG-29KR multi-role naval fighters deployed aboard the Admiral Kuznetsov earlier this month is being blamed on a series of events that occurred on the Russian carrier’s deck and the doomed jet’s loss of all engine power that followed. According to USNI News who quotes russian media statements, a three-ship reconnaissance and familiarity flight over Aleppo was coming to an end and the jets were in the process of landing aboard the carrier when things began to unravel. The first jet landed safely, while the second landed minutes later, when its hook snapped one of the ship’s cross-deck arresting cables. This can be a very deadly situation for naval aviators and deck hands alike, regardless of their nation of origin. Luckily, the second MiG still caught the next wire as it rolled across the deck. At that point a fouled deck was called and the third and final navalized Fulcrum was told to waveoff and to enter a holding pattern above the ship while the landing area was restored to operational status. USNI News writes: “While in the holding area, both of the fighter’s engines shut down,” read the translation. “A preliminary explanation is that they were no longer receiving fuel. ln such situations, a fighter falls like a rock, and the pilot has only one option — to eject.” It sounds like the third MiG simply ran out of gas, a totally unnecessary loss considering Russia’s master air base near the central Syrian coast and airfields in Cyprus would have been at max just 50 miles away. Barring the possibility of a double catastrophic engine failure, which seems very unlikely especially considering the phase of the MiG’s flight at the time of the loss and the circumstances at hand, if anything this event highlights the precarious state of Russian naval aviation and the limitation of its carrier and air wing. It seems that no recovery tanker was available to provide gas to the holding MiG-29KR, nor was there standing operating procedures in place dictating that fighter with such a low fuel-state must divert to a nearby airfield. In other words, if these reports are accurate this seems to have been an unnecessary and glaringly stupid loss, one that appears to be the result of planning that had almost no margin for the unexpected. That is a ballsy and reckless move considering how challenging the carrier flight environment is and how little actual training these crews have in that environment. Shortly following news of the crash The War Zone stated : “Russia’s training program for its limited carrier flight operations has also long been a concern. With only one aircraft carrier (which sometimes goes for years without sailing) and a small handful of fighters capable of operating from the ship, the Russian Navy’s ability to retain a critical mass of experienced pilots qualified to operate in the dangerous shipboard environment is questionable.” Luckily, in this case the pilot ejected and was recovered safely, and the only loss was one of Russia’s newest and most advanced fighters. But next time this may not be the case. The Kuznetsov did not stand down from flight operations following the crash, although its remaining inventory of just three MiG-29KRs, the most advanced aircraft it carries, have not been seen flying. Instead all new footage has showed Russia’s slightly upgraded but still relatively dated Su-33s carrying out counter-air and dumb bombing sorties.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 22, 2017",Shadowy New Missile Appears Under the Wing of Chinese J-16 Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s aim to develop aerial weaponry tailored to target American force-multiplying aerial assets, like tankers and sensor aircraft, may have just appeared in another tangible form—a relatively huge and previously unseen air-to-air missile. For years, I have posited that China would develop highly focused capabilities to counter specific but glaring weaknesses in America’s high-tech and increasingly networked expeditionary war fighting machine and battle doctrine. This pertains specifically to developing weapons and tactics used to attack low-density but high-value flying assets. China’s J-20 stealth fighter-interceptor is part of this strategy. It’s a simple premise really, one that we have discussed many times before. China knows that American and allied air power is designed around a strategy of working cooperatively as a deeply networked team, one full of diverse assets that together equal far more than the sum of their individual parts. Taking on American fighters in a traditional manner would be a losing game, at least when looked at in a vacuum void of quantitative factors. But if China can successfully attack the enabling assets that support the “shooting” assets, they can make inroads into leveling the air combat playing field. This means coming up with weapons and tactics tailored towards targeting American airborne early warning and control aircraft, and other key flying sensor platforms and communications nodes that often operate behind—but relatively close to—the front lines. Large support assets, such as tankers, AEW&C aircraft, JSTARs, and even high-flying unmanned aircraft are vulnerable to long-range missile shots in certain cases. , USAF These assets offer the US and allied combat aircraft the enhanced situational awareness that no other force in the world can muster, and this is largely a decisive factor in obtaining the very high kill ratios needed to sustain an expeditionary air campaigns against a near-peer state competitor. In addition, also being able to successfully target lumbering tanker aircraft that provide America’s relatively short-range, aerial refueling addicted combat aircraft fleet with a constant stream of fuel would hit US airpower where it hurts most. Doing so can even lead to the demise of the aircraft that the targeted tankers support during long-range combat operations. In other words, shoot down the tanker and you may have shot down the fighters it supports without even firing a shot at them. Or at least you have pulled those fighters out of the fight, and in some cases for a prolonged periods of time if they have to divert to remote airfields, many of which may be under threat of cruise and ballistic missile attack themselves by China’s missile forces. China has created a long-range stealth fighter-interceptor that can fly out over relatively large distances to obtain a sensor picture of contested airspace, and even attack these vulnerable aerial capabilities on their own. That being the J-20, and now the People’s Liberation Army Air Force seems to be adding another layer to this strategy in the form of fielding a long-range missile for its non-stealthy fighters to chuck at America’s (or another advanced foe) most prized aerial assets, all from outside the range of America’s own air-to-air missiles. J-16 with a unique payload spotted somewhere in China. Pictures have surfaced on Chinese internet showing a PLAAF J-16 indigenous multi-role Flanker derivative (roughly analogous to the Su-30MKK Flanker ) toting this new missile during takeoff. The missile itself is of a unique and substantial design. Some estimates put it at over 18 feet long. The AIM-120 AMRAAM in comparison is just 12 feet long. So we are talking about one large missile here, and its thin profile is indicative of high kinematic performance. The fact that no fins can be seen aside from small ones at it’s rear also point to the possibility that the missile uses thrust vectoring and leverages very high speed over maneuverability to kill its target. Yet the reality is that the targets it is most likely primarily intended for don’t have the ability to make hard maneuvers at all. A weapon such as this can likely be fired from well over long-ranges (roughly 100 miles away or more), and climb to a high altitude before coasting down onto their targets at near hypersonic speeds. Guidance can come from a whole mix of potential concepts, although to begin with an anti-radiation seeker would best allow the missile to execute an attack on an enemy airborne early warning aircraft (E-3, E-2) over long-ranges, and to do so passively without the missile putting out any detectable RF emissions of its own. This capability can be further enhanced by installing a dual-mode seeker, where imaging infrared or active radar homing is used for the missile’s final attack phase, as well as anti-radiation homing. This would greatly increase the missile’s probability of kill. Infrared homing is very attractive when paired with an air-to-air anti-radiation missile as it is also passive and undetectable emissions-wise. Such a missile could also be networked to use targeting information from third party assets. In fact it would almost certainly have this capability from day one. This info can be sent to the missile’s launch aircraft as well as to the missile itself in-flight. Mid-course updates would be all but necessary for a missile with this type of range as the target could move in any direction dramatically between the time the missile is initially launched and when it arrives in the area where the target was at the time of launch. A closer detail of the missile. Notice how the background it blurred/pixelated–generally speaking “leaks” from China are what the government wants to be released. The J-20, which would be able to survive closer to threats than any 4th generation fighter could, would be very useful in the providing such “third party” targeting information to a missile like this, even in very quick bursts to minimize the J-20’s chances of being detected. All of these concepts are not exclusive to China’s air warfare doctrine. Far from it in fact as the west employs them as well. NATO’s longest-range air-to-air missile, the MBDA Meteor, in particular is especially relevant when it comes to such tactics. Read all about the Meteor and all these types of air-to-air engagement concepts in this past War Zone feature. If this new missile is introduced into service as a long-range anti-radiation weapon, it may also be used for going after ground and surface-based radar threats as well in the high-speed anti-radiation missile (HARM) role. The fact that it is being flown on the J-16 is especially relevant in this regard as this aircraft is thought to have a developing suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)/”wild weasel” mission assigned to it. Theoretically, these new missiles could pose a risk to any radio-frequency emitting sensor system of decent power. But as we mentioned before , in the future they may be adapted to go after a range of targets via a series of unique seeker configurations. As such, Chinese Flanker derivatives hauling these missiles could work as “air-to-air missile trucks.” This is identical to the way the F-15C/D is evolving into a similar platform when it comes to supporting F-22s and eventually F-35s that they will team with in combat. We have also noted in the past that the unstealthy F-15C/D could really benefit from a longer-range missile than even the AIM-120D that has just entered service. This is especially true when working in the missile truck role in support of its more modern and stealthy stablemates. With this in mind, and if this Chinese missile is what we think it is, Beijing may be ahead of the US in this respect, although the PLAAF’s networking capabilities still may be an issue. A pair of J-20s execute a break., AP It is also worth noting that the large missile in question won’t likely be able to fit inside the J-20’s weapons bay, as it is just too long. The J-20’s weapons bay seems to be designed for the PL-12, and similarly sized medium-range air-to-air missiles, which have dimensions much like the American AIM-120 AMRAAM. Yet this could change as a further evolved and slightly larger J-20 variant may already be in the works. But even if the J-20’s design stays the same, the idea that the stealthy jet may be able to use its large fuel load and forward position to order-up long-range missile attacks by J-16s and other fighters operating many dozens of miles behind the front lines means its limited internal magazine may not be such a hinderance. J-20's weapons bay open during testing over the Chengdu aircraft plant. What also remains unclear is if this missile is actually the PL-15 that has loomed over the Pentagon for some time, or if this is the so-called PL-XX, a new concept all together. It was originally thought that the PL-15 would feature be a throttleable ramjet engine similar to the Meteor, but things may have changed. Another missile concept, the PL-21, seems to also use this configuration. We just don’t know what has moved from the concept stage to the testing stage. In fact, this design could even be a “hit-to-kill” missile, where it uses all its internal volume for fuel and guidance, thus maximizing range, and slams into its target instead of detonating a warhead nearby it. Now we will have to wait for other images of this new weapon to emerge so that we can better verify current size estimates and assess its capabilities. We will keep you updated as the story unfolds.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday morning, Denverites looked up into the bright blue sky and saw something totally normal, a jet, although this jet hung around doing large orbits over the city for a stretch of time. This apparently caused enough commotion that Denver’s local TV news stations ran with the story, with local ABC affiliate Channel 7 especially hot on the case. Later, the story would make national news. The station posited that the aircraft was a big mystery , even though they had pulled up the track on the aircraft on Flightradar24 , where they also discovered its callsign “IRON99.” Clearly, the aircraft was US military, and pictures and video show a white four-engined airliner derivative flying around at 35,000. Not only that, but the station had the flightpath of where the jet had been, and where it eventually went after cruising in circles over the Mile High City. Mystery flight circles over Denver; officials have few answers: https://t.co/Yph4dDZIZF #Denver #news #Colorado — Denver7 News (@DenverChannel) November 17, 2016 The jet originated its flight from just northeast of the Bay Area, headed out past the California coastline for some orbits, then headed across the country before setting up station over Denver. After it finished its business there, the jet headed to nearby Oklahoma. Flightradar24 via Denver Channel 7 Flightradar24 via Denver Channel 7 Flightradar24 via Denver Channel 7 Simply put, even if there weren’t imagery of the aircraft itself that gives away its type and mission (which there is) the data above pretty much tells us what it was—a US Navy E-6B Mercury. Even the callsign has been used by these aircraft, something that can be found with a quick Google search. The E-6B is also known by the acronym TACAMO (Take Charge And Move Out) and executes the “Looking Glass” mission , which has to do with facilitating the release of nuclear weapons during a time of war. The aircraft can also work as a command post for the National Command Authority and as a major network relay and communications node in the aftermath of a national disaster. An E-6B is captured in Stuttgart, Germany. The aircraft operate all around the world, just as the Navy's boomers do, and they also support missions where independent high-end secure communications are needed. , Julian Herzog/wikicommons The fleet of 16 E-6Bs are the last 707s to roll off the production line, and are loaded with all types of communications capabilities. These include multiple secure satellite links (one of which is facilitated by the large “hump” on the jet’s spine) and a very low frequency antenna that is reeled out behind the aircraft. This system allows the E-6B to transmit to submerged submarines. A tight pylon turn is used to get the trailing wire antenna as close to vertical as possible for the best transmission quality. A handful of E-6Bs sit high alert under heavy guard, or are airborne at all times. 60 Minutes even got to see inside one recently, which is a rare occasion to say the least. Travis AFB, located north of San Francisco, is one of the E-6Bs forward-alert sites and the type’s home base s located at Tinker AFB, in none other than Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In between the two locations is Buckley AFB just outside of Denver, where some of the Pentagon’s most capable communication systems are based, many of which support US Strategic Command. So the route that this “mysterious” jet flew is in fact quite logical and mundane. The reason why the military didn’t come forward yesterday when asked with a description of what the aircraft was doing (and what type of aircraft it was, for that matter), is that the Mercury’s mission is considered sensitive, and they don’t usually comment on its operational patterns, or even on its forward operating locations. The unique lines of the E-6B as it Takes Charge And Moves Out. , Tyler Rogoway So in the end, the Mercury was just doing what it does over Denver—training for the end of the world as we know it by flying to and from its normal bases of operation, and linking up with key sites that allow it to communicate with the powers that be and the world’s most deadly weapons scattered around the globe.

The system is really a pint-sized, quickly deployable version of the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System which is capable of slinging various rockets over long distances with extreme accuracy. Both HiMARS and the M270 are capable of carrying pods filled with a six-pack of 277mm rockets or a single 655mm Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). The M270 carries two of these weapons pods while HiMARS carries one. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oWqCVDhf6Lk What is so attractive about migrating this adaptive design over to the Zumwalt class is that multiple types of rockets were built to be launched from these common multi-celled pods. Such a system could likely be adapted into vertical launch cells taking up the area where the AGS is fitted aboard the Zumwalt. Doing so could actually reduce the ship’s radar cross-section. Four rockets that are already adapted to use this fairly simple launch systems, three of which are already fielded operationally in large quantities, would be of interest for DDG-1000. Visitors tour the Zumwalt's foredeck, with the rear AGS seen in its low observable cupola., USN The first two are the M30 and M31 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System rockets. These missiles can reach out to 50 miles and are precision guided using inertial navigation with embedded GPS. They are highly accurate and hard to defend against. Additionally, the M30 carries 404 submunitions and can affect a large area, while the M31 has a 200lb high explosive unitary warhead, better suited for taking out pinpoint targets such as structures and vehicles ,or for providing very close support for ground troops. The M30 and M31 rockets. , US Army The GMLRS+ has been in development and features the same capabilities of the M31, but can fly out even farther, to around 70 miles, and can be equipped with a laser seeker to strike moving targets designated by a third party. This could be a done by a ship, a tactical aircraft, or a special operations team in the area that the missile is intended to impact. The third is the much larger, much longer-ranged M39 ATACMS ballistic missile. The 3,700lb missile can fly out to nearly 200 miles, and packs a 500lb unitary warhead or various submunitions. It can take out a field of enemy personnel and material, or it can obliterate a building. ATACMS is also GPS/INS guided and has high accuracy. A new version is in the process of being fielded that includes a seeker that will allow the missile to hit moving targets. The idea of modifying ATACMS to hit moving targets has sparked the imagination of the US Army, who is interested in using the missile as a coastal defense anti-ship ballistic missile. Anti-ship duties have long been the purview of the US Navy, but with the Pacific Pivot underway, real anti-access/area denial threats growing, and the Navy pushing its own “distributed lethality” concept , it is hard to argue against such an application or the Army’s interest in it. ATACMS being fired. , US Army Although ATACMS is out of production, thousands still are in stock and are being upgraded, and a replacement is on the way. The great thing is that this replacement will likely be able to use the same launch system as that used on HiMARS and the M270 MLRS, and will feature increased capabilities. This missile will likely have a 310 mile range and will have a smaller diameter than the 30 year old ATACMS design, allowing two to be carried in each MLRS pod, as opposed to one. Additionally, it may also be networked and will most likely feature a multi-mode seeker for engaging all types of targets, including ships, in all weather situations. Raytheon's entry into the Long Range Precision Fires program will feature a missile with 300+ mile range that can fit two to a single MLRS pod. , Raytheon What the Navy would get by removing the Zumwalt’s Advanced Gun System and replacing it with adapted MLRS launchers is an off-the-shelf, high production volume, very flexible weapon system that will in most ways totally surpass the capabilities that the AGS was supposed to provide. With it, DDG-1000 will be able to not only provide rapid precision fires over many dozens of miles, but it will be able to also do so over hundreds of miles. Not just that, but it will be able to do both using unitary or area munitions, something the AGS could never do. And those area munitions could be especially handy when providing naval gunfire support for Marines as they prepare for a beach landing. Sub-munition laden M30 and ATACMS rockets can clear the beach of enemy personnel and lightly armored vehicles, while M31 and ATACMS rockets can go after heavily armored vehicles and fortified bunkers. The original DDG-1000 concept is shattered in many ways, the fact that its guns won't even have ammo is maybe the most glaring. More than anything else, the Navy would be investing in a very mature weapons concept that has already achieved production efficiency, and one that is constantly evolving with new rocket upgrades and capabilities. By adding US Navy dollars to the program it will only get stronger, and the USMC already fields the system. Cost-wise there is no comparison to an M30/31 rocket and a ACS shell. The rocket costs around $100,000 and the AGS shell costs at least eight times that, and likely more. The ATACMS cost far more, at around $875,000 per missile, but it’s hard hitting capabilities and long range fall somewhere between the less expensive M30/31 and the more expensive Tomahawk cruise missile. The nice thing also about the system is that for now large amounts of MLRS prds, each capable of carrying a single ATACMS or six M30/31s, can take up the space where the Zumwalt’s guns are today, leaving massive areas below deck vacant. This is where the AGS’s complex ammo handling systems are today. In the future, say half of these MLRS cells can are removed for the installation of an electromagnetic railgun, while the other half can still remain. USS Zumwalt underway. , USN Roughly each six round container takes up one and a half Mark 41 vertical launch cells. Even if an installation the size of the Mark 41 VLS magazine on the bow of a Ticonderoga class cruiser (61 cells) were installed on DDG-1000 ships, this would mean that a total of 40 MLRS pods could be fitted in the same surface area. This would equal 240 M30/31 rockets, or a mix of say 10 ATACMS and 180 M30/31. This is a lot of firepower, and the configuration offers far more capability than what a single AGS could provide. This is especially true considering that ATACMS is now likely to get an anti-ship capability, and regardless of that, it would give the DDG-1000 an intermediate range land-attack weapon. In the future, two replacement missiles will be able to fit into a single pod and offer far greater range. If the Zumwalt class were to pave the way with integrating a VLS version of the MLRS, other candidate hosts could follow suit. Most notably, the San Antonio class of Amphibious Transport Docks that were designed with a space for a 16 cell Mark 41 vertical launch system . Hosting a navalized MLRS on these ships would make perfect sense considering their role is to support, or even unilaterally conduct, amphibious operations and low-intensity warfare missions, just like USS San Antonio is executing right now off the coast of Libya. USS San Antonio LPD-17., USN Converting this space over to MLRS capability would also allow the ship to directly support raids by Marines deep into enemy territory without the need of keeping organic air assets overhead. It would also be able to help prepare the beach for a landing via providing direct artillery support from far over the horizon. Roughly ten MLRS six-celled systems could be installed in the space, which would offer 60 M30/31 rockets to be at the disposal of Marine commanders. In the end, the Navy should at the very least investigate what it would take to adapt the MLRS for its uses, and the loss of a dedicated round for the Zumwalt class’s Advanced Gun Systems could be turned from a huge loss into a substantial gain. One that could be had at comparatively minimal cost. Not only that, but the Navy and Marines could finally have an answer for their lack of naval gunfire support that evaporated the day the last Iowa class battleship was retired.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The low-level route is known by quite a few different names including Rainbow Canyon, Star Wars Canyon and the Jedi Transition, and it has become a mecca for aviation photographers looking to catch some of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft while maneuvering fast and hard before a dramatic rock backdrop. Now the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, many of which are based nearby at Edwards AFB, has been caught down in the weeds, or rocks for that matter, at the famous locale. You can read all about the Jedi Transition here , but suffice it to say that on any given weekday it becomes a virtual grab bag of military aircraft ranging from search and rescue helicopters to air guzzling Harriers . In many ways the place has become the Mach Loop of the US, and even fighter pilots have gotten into act of capturing their flights through the canyon from inside the cockpit, even putting new 360 video capture technology to use in the process. Last week aviation photographer Mark Von Raesfeld was perched high up on the south side of the canyon as a Dutch F-35A made a series of low and fast passes deep into the canyon, and the results were stunning. Dutch F-35A rips through the Jedi Transition. The jet is based at Edwards AFB located towards the the southern end of a series of vast range complexes and military operating areas that include the Jedi Transition., Mark Von Raesfeld Mark recounts his lucrative day along Star Wars Canyon’s south ridge: “I started out Monday getting up early after two full days of airplane heaven at Aviation Nation .  I left Vegas at 5AM for the drive to Star Wars Canyon.  After parking, hiking out, and setting up I was ready!  So I waited, and waited, and waited some more.  During this time the quiet was broken at various times by the rumble of jets.  All the photographers would jump up and get ready, but nothing.  Every once in awhile I’d catch a glimpse of a Hornet up high, but that was it. Finally at 11:00am the drought was broken. After hearing rumbling in the area, an F-35 popped out from behind the rocks to the east, very low and very fast.  He was in and out of sight in a matter of seconds. Wow! This is the first time I’ve seen an F-35 out there. I start checking my shots… Not a single decent click. I blew it!  My first F-35 turns out to be from the Royal Netherlands Air Force and I missed it! I sat and waited until 1:26PM. High above an F-35 was working it’s way down.  My chance at redemption? Yes! In from the west a F-35 dropped into the canyon! The pass was another low and fast one. I checked the camera… Yes! I got it.” Mark Von Raesfeld “If the day was to end right then I would have been happy, but there was more. Just minutes later two F-16s from the South Dakota Air National Guard made a run.” Armed with live missiles, the “Lobos” and their F-16Cs came tearing through the canyon. The squadron is helping to augment the 144th Fighter Wing that provides air defense for California with their F-15C/Ds. After combat air patrols the jets sometimes burn extra fuel by practicing low-level flying and the Jedi Transitiion is often used for just that. , Mark Von Raesfeld “At 2:30 the Joint Strike Fighter support F-16BM from the Royal Danish Air Force treated us to three passes.” This Danish F-16 has been flying in support of the F-35 program since test operations began at Edwards AFB nearly a decade ago., Mark Von Raesfeld “The guy in the back of the F-16 was snapping shots of the ride. Us photographers become the subjects so to speak. I hope they got my good side!” The jet is often used as a chase plane with a photographer in back, and in this case that photographer got to shoot some scenery, including other photogs arrayed along Rainbow Canyon's ridgeline., Mark Von Raesfeld “To top the day off at 2:40 the brightly painted CAG Super Hornet from VX-31 roared through. I hung around and waited for more, but that was it.” One of VX-31's Super Hornets, based nearby at NAWS China Lake, also made a pass., Mark Von Raesfeld Flying at low-level visually through tight terrain and at high speeds is one of the toughest yet most exhilarating things a fighter pilot gets to do., Mark Von Raesfeld “Two days at Aviation Nation and a full day on the canyon, a great three days full of aviation photography.” A big thanks to Mark Von Raesfeld for sharing these awesome shots.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 6, 2017",It Has Begun: Russia Is Showcasing New Weapons in Fresh Syrian Offensive,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has launched a series of strikes in the Syrian provinces of Homs and Idlib on Tuesday, in what appears to be the start of a large-scale renewed offensive. Russia’s top general, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, made the following statements during a meeting with Vladimir Putin and his top military staff: “Today at 10:30 and 11:00 we launched a large-scale operation against the positions of Islamic State and Al-Nusra in the provinces of Idlib and Homs… The main targets of the strikes are warehouses with ammunition, terrorist gatherings and terrorist training centers, as well as plants for the production of various kinds of weapons of mass destruction of the population… They are factories, not workshops, more specifically the plants for the production of all sorts of rather serious means of mass destruction… Clearly, this is a well-established industrial production, these are the targets for today’s strikes. And they will continue… You are aware that we have sent a large group of our radiation, chemical and biological protection troops to determine the toxic substances which are used by terrorists. Within the past week they used them twice – in one case, 27 people were hospitalized and three died, in the other case 30 people were hospitalized – I mean the Syrian Army soldiers.” The strikes were at least partially executed via cruise missiles, launched from both sea and land. For the first time Russia showed images of the Bastion-P coastal defense system in Syria, and strangely enough, the systems P-800 supersonic anti-ship missiles were used against land targets. It is not exactly clear how capable these missiles could be in such a role as they rely on onboard radar for terminal homing, and that radar system was primarily designed for the naval environment. But they must be accurate enough to justify their firing. Shoigu also stated “ the Bastion coastal missile complexes have covered almost the entire coastline… With these complexes, we are able to destroy both sea and ground targets at distances of 350km for sea targets and nearly 450km for ground targets.” On the sea side of the cruise missile equation, the nearly brand new Russian guided missile frigate Admiral Grigorovich fired Kalibr cruise missiles at targets deep into Syria. Last week we noted that the ship, which is part of the Black Sea Fleet , was on the move and would likely join Russia’s large naval task force positioned off Syria. Today’s Bastion-P firings are the first time the supersonic P-800 has been known to have been used in the Syrian conflict and the wide-scale deployment of the system is just another piece of the layered anti-access/area denial bubble Russia is creating around Syria. In addition to this system, Shoigu also detailed Russia’s rapidly growing anti-aircraft capabilities in western Syria, stating: “The S-400 has been running for a long time now . Apart from that, we have added S-300 to cover the sea area, nearly all the way to Cyprus.” Now that Russia basically owns the Syrian port of Tartus and is expanding its naval base there , we know S-300 systems have already been deployed around it. The systems can indeed reach all the way across the Eastern Med to Cyprus, as well as down into Lebanon and as far as the Turkish border to the North. Combined with the Bastion-P, they can put any vessel or aircraft traveling in that region under threat. Seeing as the eastern Mediterranean has become increasingly more popular a place for NATO carrier strike groups to operate from, these developments, at the very least, will likely change the way in which they go about their business in the area going forward. Also of note is that there are reports that S-300 batteries have also shown up near government garrisons on the outskirts of Aleppo . Obviously ISIS has no air force, and all of these anti-air systems are aimed at deterring any future action by the US or its allies against the Assad regime or Russia’s increasing interests in that country. Just a day after losing one of only four new MiG-29KRs deployed aboard, Russia’s only carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , has also flown its first armed combat sorties, or at least we are just now confirming this to be the case through a video released from the Russian Ministry of Defense. In the video, Su-33 fighters are shown being launched off the Kuznetsov’s deck armed with air-to-air loadouts. These appear to include a pair of R-27 (Alamo) intermediate-range and a pair of R-73 (NATO reporting name Archer) short-range air-to-air missiles. The Su-33s, which have received a limited upgrade recently , also sport Sorbtsiya-S electronic warfare pods on their wingtips. This mix of weapons and ECM gear has been a common weapons configuration for Russia’s land-based Flankers in Syria and for those flying air defense missions from Russia as well. Much has been made about the Su-33’s ability to lift large weapons loads off the Kuznetsov’s ski jump. In this case the aircraft are carrying about 2,000 pounds of ordnance each, which is not all that much and we don’t know how much fuel the jets are loaded with at the time of their departure. Still it is interesting to see the Su-33s flying from the carrier armed-up. These missions also mark the first time Admiral Kuznetsov has been used in any sort of actual combat. Still, based on the video evidence alone, Russia’s carrier-based fighters are only providing counter-air capabilities at this time. It is not clear if or when the MiG-29KRs, which are far more advanced and capable in the air-to-ground department than their larger Su-33 stablemates, will be wading into the action or if they already have for that matter. It is also possible that they are standing down, even if for a short period of time, following yesterday’s crash. Meanwhile, after weeks of a self-imposed “humanitarian pause,” airstrikes began again in eastern Aleppo once again, and this round is likely to become the most brutal ever. Just hours ago, mass text messages were sent to everyone still in Aleppo, with the message being nothing but ominous : Leave or die. Since then barrel bombings have resumed . Russia denies it is taking part in them, which very well could be true, but that does not mean that Assad’s rudimentary air force isn’t warming up for a larger onslaught that will include Russian aircraft in the near future. Onto reports that MiG-31 Foxhounds have arrived at Russia’s airbase south of Latakia, Syria. Although there is still no official comment on their presence as of yet, we do have a scant two pictures to go off of. One shows a Foxhound during recovery at what looks the base, although it is tough to tell, and another shows what appears to be a bunch of R-33 long-range air-to-air missiles, used exclusively by the MiG-31, under a tarp at what is claimed to be Russia’s air base in Syria. So why would Russia deploy a heavy interceptor to the crowded airspace of Syria ? Well at this point why not? The same question can be asked about firing supersonic anti-ship missiles at defenseless land targets, or even firing cruise missiles at any targets at all when fixed wing-tactical aircraft already based in-country could just strike the same target for a tiny fraction of the cost. Or why heavy bombers have been used, and the list goes on and on. As I have said for over a year now , and time and time again since , Syria has become a great operational testing range, weapons marketing platform and propaganda tool for Russia above all else. The military operations there don’t have to make tactical sense, because effecting the battlefield is not their entire purpose, far from it in fact. And Russia will cycle every weapon system it has through the theatre before the war comes to an end, in part to test it operationally, to show other nations that it works and to fear it or to purchase it for their own militaries. With all that in mind, Mig-31s, many of which were recently upgraded, appearance in Syria, is not surprising at all, it was only a matter of time. And Russia’s willingness to deploy all this gear to what is really a counter-insurgency operation isn’t all bad for the US and its allies because the entire region is just socked with intelligence gathering capabilities. Capturing Russia’s modern standard operating procedures , their means of communications and combined arms capabilities, as well as all the electronic intelligence that can be gained every time one of their radars clicks or data-links transmits is a dream come true for western military intelligence gurus. Regardless of what gear Russia is bringing to bear in Syria, two things are certain. The first is that a new Russian offensive is now underway and how it develops in Aleppo will have the most geopolitical impact . The other is that Syria is now basically Kaliningrad on the Mediterranean, and the anti-access/area denial bubble they are building there, especially now that they now basically own the port at Tartus and their master air base 75 miles to the north, will have a deep strategic impact on the region for many years to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 16, 2016",Russia’s Unmanned Missile Silo Sentry Is Right out of the Game “Contra”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces are slated to get a new robotic sentinel for their ICBM silo sites scattered across Russia. This new system looks like all those automated enemy defensive fortifications you ever blew to smithereens while smashing on the controller on your Nintendo back in the late ’80s. And although Russia loves to call any weapon without a human touching it a robot , it is really a remote controlled system, with a man in the loop fiddling a joystick and pressing the trigger. The system is set into what looks like a concrete cylinder, and pops out of that cylinder within 30 seconds when activated. A large, hinged lid covers the system when not activated. Supposedly, the turret has radar and electro-optical sensors, as well as machine guns and grenade launchers to do the dirty work. Russia’s Ministry of Defense stated that the system, “if equipped with modern shooting and grenade launching systems… is capable of conducting aimed fire in a circular sector… at ranges of up to 400 meters.” So in essence we are talking about a very short-range point defense system. A mock up of the system shown without its radar array whic sits between the gun barrels and the optical cameras. , Screencap The system is supposedly capable of detecting, tracking and engaging both ground targets, such as humans and vehicles, and low and relatively slow moving aerial targets, such as small unmanned air vehicles and helicopters. The system’s armament appears to include a pair of very short-barreled gatling guns similar to the 30mm OA-18 used on the AK-630 naval CIWS system. There also appears to be eight additional rocket propelled grenade tubes. These can likely deploy compact RPGs such as the RPG-26 or more modern RPG-30. The possibility of future upgrades to include small anti-armor guided missiles, such as the Kornet , would also be logical. https://youtube.com/watch?v=iiw1LHJGLeE According to the system’s designer , Dmitry Perminov, the microwave radar can detect people at roughly four and a half miles away and a car up to seven miles away. Obviously the type of terrain where this system is installed will make a huge impact on its radar’s performance. The system’s concept is such that once detected by radar, it’s EO/IR cameras will snap to the target and a visual identification can be made before the decision is made to engage. It seems very clear that Russia sees this system not just as a point defense sentry system for its most sensitive weapons sites, but also as a platform for monitoring border hotspots and to export on the commercial marketplace as well. Perminov states: “This system can be applied not only as a military interface, but also for the protection of any strategic objects. Interest in it is not only limited to the military, but also in oil to control the pipeline and stop tapping and the theft of oil… We already had a real case during the system test. At some point the robot recorded the theft of electric cables. It filmed a video where a man was seen sawing a wire. A team was sent out and he was caught red-handed.” Assuming this system, which supposedly has just passed initial trials, actually works as advertised, it may have some merit, although it seems that its design has clear limitations. First off, this thing has to be uncovered and scanning constantly for threats, meaning it has to be exposed, and considering the huge cap that pops open when it activates, that doesn’t seem to be the intention of the design. Second, there still has to be a human operating the system once something is detected. Although one person could theoretically monitor multiple units at any given time from a collective control station, they can only actively control one unit at a time. So aside from offering a centralized command and control architecture, the system provides little efficiency as compared with just putting an operator in the field to near the system itself. Then again, if missile silos are divided by long distances, a centralized command stations helps with the logistical challenges of moving people too and from each location. For smaller scale threats this type of setup could work, but what happens if multiple sites are attacked at the same time? Either manpower would need to be available to man each control stations, assuming there are enough control stations to begin with, or these systems could just sit idle during a multi-prong attack. Finally, fixed defenses have their well established drawbacks, the biggest one being they are predictable. As a result tactics can be devised to overcome and overwhelm them. Even with these operational issues in mind, this type of system could be useful in a similar role in the US. Currently roving patrols and quick reaction alert special tactics teams that deploy via helicopter provide security for America’s Minuteman ICBM fields located in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. Remote weapons and sensor stations like these could offer some persistent defensive capabilities to bolster more traditional forms of security, although decoupling the radar from the system’s optical sensors and weapons turret would be idea. This way a constant radar “picture” can be maintained while the turret is pointed in any direction, or even in a stowed position. USAF quick reaction security forces protect America's ICBMs that dot the landscape in three states. A special force of aging UH-1 Twin Hueys provides logistical and security servies for the missile silos.  , USAF Where this type of system makes the most sense is in war zones, or areas that are extremely prone to assault. For instance, around critical infrastructure in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, although in many ways, human beings still offer a better sentry option than something like this. In fact, its greatest utility is more likely in the anti-drone role than anything else. The idea that these could defend oil pipelines is a little erroneous as it would require a system every mile or less to provide persistent coverage, and it would only likely be plausible for extremely remote areas or in places that are largely lawless and the government is willing to allow contractors with remote weapons turrets to target whatever they deem a threat. Even then, they would only be used at points where critical infrastructure is located, not consistently along hundreds or even thousands of miles of pipeline. The thing is that this system isn’t really that unique. Remote weapons turrets have been hot attractions at arms expos around the globe, and the US, along with other countries are playing with them to better understand their utility. Originally they were mainly designed for being mounted on armored vehicles and on ships, but now they are available for stationary applications, and some are even operational with water hoses instead of machine guns . Russia’s integration of a microwave radar with a system like this is interesting, along with some fairly inexpensive munitions. The Apache’s Longbow radar system could potentially be adapted for a similar role for a western design, one that would likely be far more capable than this and would even be capable of firing missiles in any weather at targets up to a couple of miles away. If located in a central and elevated position, like atop a high pole, the radar could even direct multiple units spread over a multiple square miles and provide persistent 360 degree coverage and even targeting for those remote weapons stations. It all comes down to applications and cost. This type of remote weapons application does not have as broad a utility as some may think after quick glance, but the arms industry definitely sees a market for them. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see where Russia’s remote weapons turret, and many others in development, “pop up” in the coming years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 11, 2016",MiG-29KR Crashes Off Syria During Maiden Cruise Aboard Russian Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain sketchy, but the Russian Ministry of Defense has confirmed that one of four MiG-29KR naval strike fighters has crashed off Syria while operating near its floating base, the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov . The fighter’s pilot supposedly ejected safely and was recovered by one of the flotilla’s Kamov helicopters . The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed the incident, stating : “An aviation accident with carrier-based fighter MIG-29K occurred during exercise flights as a result of a technical fault during the approach landing a few kilometers from the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft-carrying cruiser…the Russian aircraft carrier group continues its activity in the Mediterranean Sea as planned. The flights of sea-based aviation continue.” The carrier’s aircraft were thought to have just began flight operations over Syria over the weekend, though it is unclear to what degree this is continuing after the incident. The MiG-29KR is an upgraded, navalized version of the MiG-29 Fulcrum. The subtype has been in development in one form or another since the late 1980s ( read all about the Mig-29K here ). The Indian Navy was the first to field a version of the design, operating it aboard the modified Kiev class aircraft-carrying missile cruiser INS Vikramaditya , their only fixed-wing aircraft carrier. Like the planes, the ship was also supplied by the Russians over a drawn-out, overbudget ordeal. 45 MiG-29Ks were ordered by the Indian Navy to equip the ship’s air wing and training squadron; so far, the type’s Indian Navy service has had its fair share of issues. An Indian Navy MiG-29K lands aboard INS Vikramaditya. , Indian Navy Russia continued to develop the jet following the Indian Navy deal, integrating all Russian-made systems and avionics into new version of it calls the MiG-29KR. An order for 20 of these aircraft was placed by the Russian Navy with the hopes that they would eventually replace the larger, aging navalized Su-33 Flanker , an aircraft that has been the backbone of the Kuznetsov’s air wing for decades. A Russian MiG-29KR aboard the Admiral Kuznetsov. , youtube screencap Although Russia has said that flight operations continue following the crash, with one MiG-29KR lost due to as-yet-undisclosed or unknown reasons, it puts the rest of the small MiG-29KR fleet’s availability for combat operations in doubt. It is also an embarrassing incident for the Kuznetsov , a historically unreliable , smoke-billowing ship which some think is a bigger threat to itself than to its enemies and for the MiG-29KR prorgram, which is one of Russia’s most modern. Russia’s training program for its limited carrier flight operations has also long been a concern. With only one aircraft carrier (which sometimes goes for years without sailing) and a small handful of fighters capable of operating from the ship, the Russian Navy’s ability to retain a critical mass of experienced pilots qualified to operate in the dangerous shipboard enviroment is questionable.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 9, 2016",How President Trump Will Change America’s Military and Foreign Policy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Love him or hate him, Donald Trump is our incoming Commander-In-Chief, and there is little doubt that he will bring great change with him. As President-elect, Trump will have to go instantaneously from being the CEO of a real estate, licensing and media company to the CEO of the federal government—with millions of employees instead of thousands. He will have to preside over the largest budget in the world, and countless programs and agencies—the Pentagon included—that together cost the US trillions of dollars a year. At the same time he will go from speaking almost entirely for himself to speaking for a nation of 320 million people, and he’ll do it as the commander of the most powerful military on the planet. Whether you woke up on November 9th excited for the future or extremely depressed and anxious about it, Donald Trump is our President-elect, and we should move forward together with open minds and give him a chance—because if he fails, we will all suffer. Besides, if there’s one truism about the Presidency, it is that the weight of its responsibility can rapidly change the person who bears it. Trump is likely to be no different. Given the limited policy information Trump and his campaign have put forward, it’s hard to exactly predict what a Trump administration will mean for America’s defense posture and foreign policy. What little we know President Trump plans on doing right when he takes office is spelled out here . Still, we can take some good guesses based on his and his surrogates’ statements on the campaign trail: US Military Expansion Although Trump’s plans for the US military have been largely anecdotal, it’s clear that he will look to expand the size of each branch with a focus on increasing combat capacity above anything else. This is thought to include the expansion of the Army from 480,000 to 540,000 soldiers. Trump’s surrogates have also stated that the USMC will be increased as well, from around 180,000 Marines today to over 200,000. Trump will seek to increase the US Navy’s fleet size to about 350 ships from around 300 today. A focus on increasing the number of high-end surface combatants is likely, including upgrading and redeploying Ticonderoga class cruisers that have been sidelined for financial reasons. Even the Zumwalt class destroyer has a chance of being put back into production, and the three ships that have been ordered could potentially be upgraded to better represent their originally intended configuration . Naval missile defense capabilities will also be a major funding focus going forward, and increased fast attack submarine production is also likely to be pushed by Trump’s administration. Whether the Navy will maintain an all-nuclear fast attack submarine force remains unclear. As for the Air Force, Trump has stated that we need more fighter aircraft – though some numbers his team have thrown out don’t add up. Nor have there been any details regarding how unmanned systems will fit into an expanded tactical air fleet. Still, it’s likely Trump will try to expand the service’s number of fighter squadrons. This will not necessarily mean more F-35 buys. In fact, Trump has floated cancelling the program during the race, and this mention was among the only comments made about the fate of specific weapon system. Currently, the USAF brass is desperately wanting to add personnel, and this will likely be included in Trump’s overall defense plan when it materialises. Above all else, it is clear that Trump will push for rapid modernization of America’s nuclear arsenal. Although Trump’s understanding of the Nuclear Triad is highly questionable , he has made no signs that he wants to cut off a leg to save money. As such, his defense plan will likely bolster key weapon system programs such as the B-21 Raider, an Ohio class submarine replacement, next generation nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, and proposed modernization and/or replacement of America’s land-based ballistic missiles. Ballistic missile defense has also been floated as an area where Trump will invest deeply. Though the Navy will likely be the focus of this mission on a theatre level, Trump may push to enhance America’s ICBM defenses located on US territory as well. America’s cyber warfare capabilities have also been mentioned as an area that Trump wants to focus more dollars and manpower on, as well as hardening the homeland to future cyber attacks. With increases in end strength across the board, this will mean the purchase of more weapons and equipment. Paired with Trump’s comments that we need to “rebuild the military,” and expand our combat capabilities, such an effort will cost massive sums of money – and it is not exactly clear where these funds will come from. So far it is clear he will move to roll back sequester through the end of a two term Presidency, and seeing he has a Republican congress behind him, this will likely happen. Yet at the same time Trump also says that he wants to tackle the national debt. This would likely become a focus later in his administration, after a rash of debt-heavy spending. Paired with lowering taxes, and claims that he will basically rebuild America’s infrastructure – not to mention keeping entitlements largely in pace as they are—the money to accomplish President-elect Trump’s gols and not drastically accelerate America’s already massive $20+ trillion debt will ride on the hope that America can reach economic growth levels not realized for decades. If this growth is not achieved, all the plans above—and many more for that matter—could very well come crashing down later in his tenure. Factor all this in and it’s likely that once Trump gets into office and realizes the costs associated with procuring new military hardware, he will look toward older, and even mothballed weapon systems to help bolster his larger force size goals. Reagan did exactly the same thing after taking office. This means aircraft like the A-10 could be safe from the budgetary axe , while other 4th generation fighters could be upgraded—with some that are currently sitting in the boneyard once again pressed to service. The same can be said for the equipment of every service. Even if Trump comes through with just a portion of his promises on defense, major defense contractors – some of which have been hit hard by sequester – stand to gain. “Big time.” Yet even though the pie may increase in size significantly under Trump, expect DoD contracts to become much more volatile. An industry forced to eat cost overruns and suffer the outright cancellation of systems that don’t perform as promised will be more likely. Also prepare for an attempt at reforming the way the Pentagon spends money – including identifying and eliminating waste and fraud. Even restrictions on Pentagon officials moving to lobbying, or key industry roles shortly after leaving their posts may be put in place. As for who will head the Pentagon? It looks like Senator Jeff Sessions , a stalwart Trump supporter and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is the favorite. Outgoing Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has
 already issued a memo ordering his staff to begin the transition. As to Carter’s major initiatives, including changing how the Pentagon recruits bright young talent, and his bolstering of the Third Offset Strategy , it’s unknown if they will survive under the next administration. Trump has always loved planes, cars and boats, now he will lead the world's largest collection of them., AP Veterans A near certainty under a Trump Presidency is the total overhaul of the Veteran’s Administration. Trump has pounded away on the topic since he first announced his candidacy, and it’s a promise he has to keep once in office. This will likely include a total restructuring of the VA’s top management, and more of a focus on providing veterans access to healthcare outside of the traditional VA system. Also going after waste and fraud within the VA will be a top priority. Trump can also be expected to go to congress for more VA funding after taking office and will likely launch major incentives for businesses that hire veterans. He will also likely make the hiring of vets within the federal government an even higher priority than it is today. Trump's commitment to veterans will now be put to the test., AP Alliances Maybe the biggest unknown and inherent risk in a Trump Administration is where he will take America’s most cherished and strategically important alliances. NATO, in particular, faces significant challenges since the reawakening of the Russian bear – and any form of instability within the alliance weakens it dramatically. This is precisely why words matter. Trump has hinted at backing out of NATO if it is not reformed, and if partner countries do not pay their fair share. That fair share is currently defined as a country dedicating 2% of GDP to their defense capability, a goal which many members don’t meet , even after the Obama’s Administration’s prodding. Under President Trump this number could increase, and there may reach a point where an ultimatum in thrown down for partner countries to “pay or else.” We simply don’t know how this will play out – but it’s clear that Trump sees the US as the chief subsidizer of Europe’s security, and wants “big league” change. Will Trump be a pragmatic and strong leader who modernizes NATO and shifts some of its economic burden off the US, or will he be the inadvertent architect of its demise? We’ll have to wait and see. Other key alliances, especially those in Asia, are also entering into uncharted territory under President-elect Trump. He has questioned our presence in South Korea and Japan, and even suggested the idea that both countries arm themselves with nuclear weapons so that the US doesn’t have to risk or invest in defending them. Some may view this as frank and overdue talk that needs to happen. The US has been in South Korea for 60 years, and in Japan for even longer. Both nations are comparatively wealthy, and have their own modern defense forces. Yet our long held position is that the threats we face in Asia, and around the world, are best confronted with a strong presence and partners. Once again the question is, will Trump push the hard issues and change the region for the better, or will he destroy military alliances that took the outcome of wars to build? There is also the question of how Trump’s foreign economic policy will impact his defense policy abroad. If trade wars are sparked, they could ignite real military conflicts in the regions they affect. Asia in particular is volatile to such policy shifts – China being the elephant in the room. It is possible that Trump, the self-proclaimed best deal maker around, could bargain with China not just on trade, but also on strategic trade offs. Maybe President Trump would turn a blind eye to China’s extra territorial ambitions in the South China Sea in exchange for Beijing playing hardball with North Korea in an attempt to reign in dictator Kim Jong Un and his nuclear and missile programs. Trump has said he is willing to inject himself directly into negotiations with leader Kim Jong Un , while at the same time he’s said that getting China to put a tight leash on Pyongyang will be the key to change on the Korean Peninsula. With this in mind, Trump knows China is going to want something in exchange. It’s this very give and take – sprinkled with moral ambiguity – that will likely be a hallmark of Trump’s foreign policy. Also expect Trump to immediately attempt to reinvigorate relationships that deteriorated under the Obama Administration – especially those that have to do with fighting terrorism. Expect an embrace of countries like Egypt – a long time ally that the Obama Administration turned away from following the el Sisi government’s seizure of power from the Muslim Brotherhood by way of a coup. The military-backed regime takes a very hard line against terrorism, and has entered Moscow’s orbit following the breakdown in ties with the US. While not an ideal partner for Obama, Trump might find good company in Egypt, and will likely reestablish deep political and military ties there alongside Russia. Trump’s firebrand style and a more inward looking and independent foreign policy may even help the deteriorating relationship between the US and The Philippines. The longtime American ally has begun to turn away from the US and towards China under the leadership of the very outspoken Rodrigo Duterte, a leader who also wants to plot a more individualistic path for his country. Above all else, expect Trump’s foreign policy to be far less righteous than Obama’s, prioritizing a country’s ability to help fight terrorism or value as a trading partner over the human and democratic rights they offer their people. Not just that, but expect a much more solitary, “go it alone” international strategy. And that brings us to… The Trump-Putin bromance is a world-wide pop culture phenomenon as evidenced by this mural in Lithuania, but will it stick?, AP Russia The biggest foreign winner of this Presidential election is Vladimir Putin. The guy just can’t seem to lose, and Russian efforts to sway the election in Trump’s favor through hacking clearly had an impact. With Trump, Moscow gets a far less ideological partner to deal with, one that will accept Russia’s will more than his predecessor. With Trump’s inward looking “America first” policy, strongmen like Putin will likely have a much longer leash to run on. So long as it doesn’t affect the US directly, Russia will be able to wield its military might more freely than in the past – and without the fear of US pushing for sanctions around every turn. At the same time, there’s nothing to say that the two leaders will actually get along. Their relationship has been largely created in the media, and never tested in any way. There is a chance that the much touted long-distance “bromance” between the two leaders could rapidly dissolve, leaving bravado and extreme military posturing to take its place. Here is precisely where the risk lies – both leaders personality types are similar – which could lead to rapid escalation over issues when Trump and Putin are not in agreeance. Some will say that an unpredictable and aggressive person at the top will be a positive change for the US. It comes down to the whole “better to be feared than liked” adage. It’s certainly the case that potential adversaries will think twice about crossing someone who seems ready and willing to put America’s massive military capabilities to use. At the same time, when that massive military includes a nuclear arsenal capable of destroying the entire human population, things get much more complicated – and far more volatile. The nuclear issue may be the most pressing when it comes to a Trump administration. Trump’s “attack twice as hard when attacked” mantra is like a religion within the man’s cult of personality – and even the smallest of bait seems to get his bite. This may work well in business, where the results of your actions are realized by fluctuations in you bank account – but on the world stage, and in regards to an equally well armed nuclear Russia – we will have to wait and see. With extreme hardliners on terrorism like former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani likely in his cabinet, Trump's war on terror will be aggressive to say the least., AP The War On Terrorism Expect Trump to pick up Obama’s targeted assassination playbook and turbocharge it. There are few other options for a leader that wants to fight terrorism militarily on a grand scale without invading countries – or enacting a policy of regime change and nation building in countries where terrorists operate.  Additionally, expect the rules of engagement surrounding targeted strikes to loosen up dramatically under Trump. More targets will be hit based on less substantial intelligence and with less regard to the loss of innocent lives. The same can be said for US air operations over Iraq and Syria, both currently conducted under the strictest rules of engagement in history. On the other hand, expect trump to do the exact opposite as Obama when it comes to GITMO , and even torture. Although “enhanced interrogation techniques” are forbidden by law, Trump has shown a consistent propensity for wanting to bring the tactic back – and he will likely have an Attorney General (Giuliani or even Christie seem likely at this point) that will work with him to make that happen. This potential reality is already sending shockwaves through the intelligence community. As for GITMO, don’t expect it to close its doors anytime soon. In fact, expect the prison – today down to just a few dozen inmates – to be expanded under Trump. Trump is also likely to drastically increase domestic surveillance in an attempt to catch homegrown terrorists and sleeper cells within the US. This will likely include some level of racial profiling. The Department of Justice will also be far more aggressive when it comes to acting on suspicious persons cases as well. A similar regime will be put in place when it comes to immigration to the US. Expect Trump to use access to visas as a major foreign policy fulcrum for countries that are maybe doing less than they could when it comes to fighting terror. As for Syria and the battle against ISIS, expect Trump to attempt to leverage Sunni Arab ruled countries into deploying ground forces to remove ISIS from Raqqa and other territory it holds. It is unlikely that Trump will put such a heavy focus on training indigenous forces that Turkey or Russia see as threats. This means Kurdish factions, such as the PKK , and the various groups that make up more moderate forces that are fighting against the Assad regime in Syria could lose US support. In other words, if Trump can coopt Turkey and Arab countries to do the heavy lifting on the ground in Syria, these groups that Obama’s Pentagon has fostered tighter ties with via US special forces will likely suffer. As for Assad, it is very unlikely that Trump will follow Obama’s demand of regime change in Syria. Instead he will try to work with the Russians and other regional powers into removing him from office over time. Although I doubt this will be a big sticking point. In the end, Trump could “trade” pushing Assad out of power for other concessions from Russia. Iran Trump has consistently maligned the Iranian nuclear deal , calling it “the worst deal of its kind, ever.” Will this mean that he will rip it up once in office? Debatable; as the alternative could mean war in a region that is already embroiled in conflict. Not just that, but much of the damage has already been done in regards to what the US has given up in return for Iran putting their nuclear program on a decade-long hiatus. Still, Trump purports to be a strong supporter of Israel, and will enter the office with expectations of a hard line towards Iran. The vast majority of Iran’s nuclear material has been moved to Russia, as outlined by the deal. Meanwhile Russia has become much closer with Iran , and the two view each other as strategic partners in the region to some degree. But to Russia, a cozy relationship with Washington is worth far more than one with Iran. As such, it’s possible that Trump works a deal with Russia to play ball with the US on Iran if, say, the US plays ball with Russia on Syria. This could include slapping sanctions back on Iran (the international nature of the original agreement would make doing so complicated) or limiting Iranian access to conventional arms from Russia. Trump could also impose unilateral sanctions on Iran, and proceed with arming Sunni gulf states to the teeth with conventional weapons. Meanwhile he can tell the international partners who signed the Iranian deal that they can stick to it if they want. So long as Russia does not return Iran’s nuclear material, there will be time before the Iranians can reconstitute their program to the point where breakout capability is imminent. In general, instead of reaching out diplomatically to Iran, Trump will likely rely on threats of conventional and cyber attack if Iran does not bend to Washington’s will. Trump will inherit a large and potent arsenal of cyber weapons particularly tailored to attacking Iran, and it’s likely they will be used if Trump thinks he needs to check Tehran. In the end, relations between the US and Iran will almost certainly degrade significantly under a Trump administration – and tensions in Persian Gulf are likely to rise significantly while the odds of a major war in the region will also increase. US Coast Guard National Security Cutter crew boards a drug smuggling narco-sub., AP War On Drugs Trump’s administration may be a soft flashback to the ’80s when it comes to America’s never ending and arguably futile war on drugs. As a candidate, he held up the heroin epidemic in America’s northeast as a reminder of how we are losing that war. And, although he has mainly pointed to building a wall along the US-Mexico border as his primary countermeasure against drug imports into the US, his anti-drug policy won’t likely end there. Even the legalized recreational marijuana trade within the US will likely be under direct fire from the Trump administration’s Justice Department. Trump’s proposed wall along the US-Mexico border, deportations and his plan to renegotiate NAFTA will also likely erode the relationship between the US, Mexico and other countries in Latin America. This could negatively impact security cooperation including joint counter-narcotics and counter-terror operations. Trump's fiery rhetoric could spell disaster on the international stage., AP The American Message Trump will be under incredible pressure to curb his trademark unfiltered, off-the-cuff and unpredictable speaking nature. Similarly, his inner-circle will be pressing him to stick to the teleprompter. His aids know what is at stake when it comes to a potential misstep on the world stage, and hopefully he will too. We’ve seen this interplay in the later part of the Presidential race, when Trump turned away from a populist standup routine to speeches read off the teleprompter – and the results were clearly positive for his political career. Still, there are many times when prepared statements simply don’t work, like press conferences with other world leaders. Real danger exists here, not just from saying something that could literally create an international crisis, but with an inability to answer specific and pointed questions. If Trump appears to have a shallow knowledge base on world issues – issues that his decisions greatly impact – it will be viewed as a major and exploitable weakness by foreign powers. As such, Trump will have to finally do his homework on key subjects, or he’ll simultaneously invite untold risk to America’s stability while degrading respect for the office he’s been elected to.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just as The War Zone predicted , reports are surfacing that Russia’s large naval flotilla, led by the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov , has already had a confrontation with a NATO submarine. Russia’s Ministry of Defense says that two destroyers chased away a Dutch attack submarine that was operating in the armada’s midst. The Russian task force had arrived off Syrian shores just two days ago. The Kremlin claims the submarine, which is thought to have been a Dutch Walrus class diesel electric boat , maneuvered dangerously close to the Russian naval group’s operating area off the coast of Syria. The Russian Ministry of Defense stated: “Naval search-and-assault group of large anti-submarine vessels, Severomorsk and Vice-Admiral Kulakov , spotted the diesel-electric submarine of the Netherlands’ Navy, which tried to approach the carrier battle group of the Northern Fleet for monitoring… Russian ships were tracking the Dutch submarine’s maneuvers and forced it to leave the area of the carrier group… Awkward attempts to dangerously maneuver in close proximity to the Russian naval group by the Dutch Navy could lead to serious navigation accidents.” Russian MoD spokesman Igor Konashenkov also said that the Severomorsk and the Vice-Admiral Kulakov, had “easily identified the submarine 20km [12 miles] away using the standard onboard hydro-acoustics systems and data obtained from anti-submarine helicopters.” The Udaloy class destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov. , Brian Burnell/wikicommons BBC reports that NATO says they were monitoring Russian naval forces in a “measured and responsible way” and had been shadowing the Kuznetsov Battle Group for weeks. The submarine in question is very likely HNLMS Walrus , which is the first in its class of the same name. The sub has been seen in the Mediterranean over the past couple months and is likely just one of multiple NATO subs running ops near the Kuznetsov , not to mention Russia’s own nuclear and diesel electric submarines, which are part the large naval task force stationed off Syria. Walrus and her three sister ships are not exactly new. The Walrus was launched in the mid 1980s, but after an electrical fire the boat had to be rebuilt and commissioned in 1992. This unique class of diesel electric submarines was ahead of its time, since they are fairly large—displacing 2,800 tons—and are capable of medium-range “blue water” operations far from shore. Building large conventionally powered subs capable of blue water operations is again becoming a trend as advances in air-independent propulsion technology have allowed them to reach capabilities approaching and even surpassing those of nuclear fast attack boats—in some respects. Israel even uses larger AIP equipped diesel-electric submarines as a second strike nuclear deterrent platform , and other countries may be planning on doing the same in the not so distant future. Walrus class submarine underway., RNN The Walrus class, which features an “x” tailplane configuration and have a unique sail shape, have gone through a deep upgrade recently and are now chocked full of cutting edge systems. These boats are known to be especially capable of spying, including collecting intelligence through electronic eavesdropping. When the Dutch government was asked about the supposed incident, Defense Minister Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert stated that she was not going to “go along with the Russian rhetoric.” The Kremlin has stated that it has come across multiple NATO subs during its roughly three week long transit from the Barents Sea to the Eastern Med, including American Virginia class nuclear fast attack boats. This is an unsurprising statement as whether or not Russia can actually detect these submarines’ presence, they can be all but certain that they are shadowing the super-high profile flotilla. A submariner working in a Walrus class submarine's control room., RNN It is possible that the Walrus’s detection was an intentionally staged operation, and that other NATO subs and intelligence collection vessels nearby were monitoring and recording Russia’s anti-submarine tactics. This would include documenting standard operating procedures such as Russian Navy communications, maneuvers and especially electronic and acoustic emissions. It’s not everyday western Navies and intelligence agencies get to monitor such a large Russian flotilla prowling in the warm waters of the Med, one that includes upgraded sub hunting systems that may not be all that well understood by western intelligence agencies. Meanwhile, it seems that Russia will soon launch an onslaught on Aleppo, as The War Zone predicted . Not only is the largest flotilla Russia has fielded since the Cold War now on station about 60 miles off Syria’s coast, but even more ships continue to be added to the armada. In particular one of Russia’s newest surface combatants, the frigate Admiral Grigorovich , was recently seen passing south through the Bosphorus Strait . Since the spotting, reports state that the ship has joined Russia’s naval task force in the eastern Med. The frigate, which is the first in its class, packs eight Kalibr cruise missiles. The Kalibr is roughly analogous to older generations of the American RGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles and has become a popular weapon during Russia’s air campaign in Syria over the last 13 months. Other ships and submarines in Russia’s battle group can also fire Kalibr missiles. This capability, paired with corvettes capable of firing these missiles from the Caspian Sea , as well as cruise missile-carrying heavy bombers launched from Russian territory, could see targets all over Syria pummeled in a coordinated barrage. A downright ominous Notice To Airman (NOTAM) has been posted stating that Russia will begin conducting major flight operations and missile firings from 5AM to 9PM at between November 10th through the 15th and from the 17th to the 22nd. Although this warning does not mean airstrikes will start immediately at 5AM local time on the 10th, or at all for that matter, but it does offer a strong indication of what Russia has planned for its battle group in the coming weeks. Moscow has kept what is largely a unilateral “humanitarian pause” in place in Aleppo since October 18th. The temporary pause in strikes came after Russia was heavy condemned by the international community for its largely indiscriminate dumb-bombing air campaign over the war-torn city. On Monday Russian MoD spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the following about holding back Russian air strikes for the unilateral ceasefire that has been extended day after day by Russia: “If the rebels don’t resort to offensive actions, to a campaign of aggression, then the president considered it expedient for now to continue the regime, under which the Russian air force does not strike eastern Aleppo.” The Kuznetsov , churns towards Syria with a full load of combat aircraft. , AP This really means nothing as the rebels have continued to fight right through Russia’s hold on bombing operations anyway. At this time, most signs point toward the Kremlin using this time to get its plans in order for a massive coordinated series of strikes on anti-regime targets in Syria. The violence of action will not only be used to crush the enemy’s will to fight, but above all else, it will be a major air, land and sea operation that will showcase old and new Russian warfighting capabilities alike. Not only will such a grand display of military might be good for Russian weapons exports, but if this offensive comes to pass as predicted, it will be the most impressive show of force that Russia has executed since the fall of the Soviet Union. Still, Putin’s playbook is wily as can be, and it is possible, although highly improbable, that Russia’s big battle group off Syria has a far less eventful deployment than what’s anticipated.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 8, 2016",It’s Election Day and Both Candidates Still Have No Space Policy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As you know, I don’t endorse candidates and I treat them equally when it comes to calling them out for their comments and ideas, blunderous or otherwise. But on this election day I’d like to note that after more than a year and a half of campaigning, debates, and interviews, neither Presidential candidate has put forward a space policy. They haven’t even posted a few paragraphs on their position on the subject on their websites, nor has the mainstream media even asked. The closest we have gotten is this . For a campaign that has discussed everything from hand size to terminal coughs, this silence is as unprecedented as it is pathetic. It should also be seen as an indicator of how poorly America’s space program has been handled in recent years – and the last few decades for that matter . Back at the end of primary season, I wrote the feature story “The Fact That None Of The 2016 Presidential Candidates Have A Space Policy Is Tragic” (a must read for context here) all about this dismal reality. At that time I explained that really none of the original candidates on either side had any sort of a solid space policy, and dove into why this unprecedented situation likely exists. My hope at the time was that this would be rectified during the long period leading up the Presidential election, when the media puts just two candidates and their policies, or lack thereof, under a microscope. Now, fast forward eight months and nothing has changed. We still know as much about their space policy as we did when they entered the race, which is nothing. Trump even had an astronaut speak at the Republican National Convention in July, what a great opportunity that would have been to roll out a few details as to where he wants our space program headed. That did not happen. This was bizarre, but not surprising considering The Donald’s lack of details on virtually all his policy positions and plans. Hillary Clinton on the other hand, a supposed policy dork with years of experience making things happen within the bowels of Washington, has given just as much detail as Trump when it comes to a space policy: Zero. She even addressed the prospect of alien visitors and their relationship to Area 51 but has said nearly nothing about America’s future aspirations in space. The candidates spent more time squabbling than talking about the issues, including America's future in space. , AP Like Trump, Clinton invited an astronaut to speak at the Democratic National Convention. Famed Navy A-6 Intruder pilot and Shuttle Commander Mark Kelly took the dais, but his speech was not about space, instead it concentrated on gun control . Not unexpected, his wife Gabrielle Giffords , is one of America’s highest profile victims of gun violence, and the couple is active in the gun control debate. So there you have it, a whole Presidential election cycle in which America’s space program seemed to simply not exist. The commercial crew initiative likely has something to do with it, but this controversial change in the way Americans look to access space is all the more reason to have a clear space policy going forward. The next President, whether it be Trump or Clinton, will inherit a neutered NASA and a heavy launch vehicle system, the SLS , which is largely made up of recycled parts and exists without a clear mission. Some may see the dawn of new opportunities in spaceflight, others see it as giant step backwards – one that was built largely on misinformation and dubious goals. It’s hard to argue that America has not stood still when it comes to technological advancement surrounding human spaceflight while private companies relearn the lessons of the 1960s largely on the taxpayer’s dime. Elsewhere, China’s space program continues to steadily march forward , and the Russians, who are not exactly cozy with the US at the moment, tout America’s dependence on them for access to the same space station that the US largely funds. Space exploration continues to be a very hot topic in China. , AP Regardless of where you stand on the issue, one thing is certain: Our next president will likely be woefully uninformed on the subject of America’s space program. Pretty tragic, considering that we need someone in the Oval Office who is just the opposite, now more than ever.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 17, 2016",The Navy Won’t Buy Ammo For Its Dumbed Down Stealth Destroyer’s Big Guns,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone went into great detail describing how DDG-1000 went from the most promising surface combatant program in decades to a dim shadow of its original self . Now the Navy has axed the ammunition specially developed for Zumwalt class’s twin 155mm Advanced Gun Systems. Yes, you are reading that right: Not only is the ship lacking its original radar suite, has only one intermediate range air defense missile, is not capable of ballistic missile defense—or even area air defense for that matter—has no close-in weapon system, and has had its stealth design continuously compromised. And these are just some of its issues. Now, the ship’s guns literally have no ammunition to fire. Time to face it, the DDG-1000 concept is shattered. Make sure to read my previous feature “ The Navy’s New Stealth Destroyer Has Watered Down Capabilities, Questionable Future ” that exposes all of DDG-1000’s faults and how they came to be, in order to gain full content for this article. Although the media, including countless defense oriented sites, may fawn over USS Zumwalt due to its Star Wars looks, the truth is that the design has been grotesquely compromised over the years. Now, with only three ships being built in the class, and not even to the same standard for that matter, whether this tiny fleet will really be operationally effective or even fiscally sustainable is highly questionable. In fact, there is a real chance that these ships will become test platforms as much as anything else, or mothballed altogether after a drastically curtailed service life. More evidence pointing to this exact scenario has came to light as it was discovered that the Navy has dropped all funding for the Zumwalt class’s Long-Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) round specifically designed for the ship’s 155mm Advanced Gun Systems. This is not hearsay: the Navy has admitted to it and there is no funding in future defense budgets for buying LRLAP shells. The LRLAP and 155mm AGS combo are massive features of the Zumwalt class design, both figuratively and literally speaking. The Advanced Gun Systems and its automated magazines, each storing roughly 300 rounds, take up the vast majority of the ship forward of its deckhouse. The LRLAP round itself is a rocket-assisted and GPS/INS guided shell that weighs 230 pounds. It can fly up to around 75 miles from the ship and strike with pinpoint precision, even attacking at near vertical angles in dense urban and mountainous terrain. The gun’s cooled barrel is capable of firing a shell every ten seconds, allowing for a large amount of projectiles to impact a specific target area. There is no doubt about it, the AGS/LRLAP combo is a flexible and deadly force to be reckoned with. This capability was intended to allow the Zumwalt class to quickly destroy targets of opportunity over intermediate ranges and to rapidly provide fire support to special operations forces dozens of miles inland without the use of aircraft. In some instances the Zumwalt could even theoretically accomplish this while staying outside the range of enemy detection. Yet above all else, the AGS/LRLAP pair was touted as the long awaited return of naval gunfire support for the Marine Corps . This capability was lost 25 years ago with the retirement of the Iowa class battleships and has been a highly controversial sticking point between the Navy and the Marines, as well as on Capitol Hill , ever since. With the Navy’s decision to not buy any more LRLAP rounds, not only does the Zumwalt lose yet another promised capability, but no other ammo has been developed for the ship, not even “dumb” shells. As a result, those massive guns are going to turn into dead weight as only 150 LRLAP rounds were bought for testing purposes. After USS Zumwalt fires through those rounds during its pre-operational testing period, Zumwalt , and its two sister ships, will have nothing left to fire. The extremely expensive LRLAP. , Lockheed The Navy’s reasoning behind the cancellation of the LRLAP round is that it is hideously expensive. Each one costs a jaw dropping $800,000, and that is the most generous figure. That is a lot of money even as guided munitions go, as the latest Tomahawk land attack cruise missile variants cost around $1 to $1.4 million each depending on who you ask. But considering the high-tench, miniaturized components inside a LRLAP round, and forces that these components have to endure during firing, these things were never going to be dirt-cheap. But still, that is an abhorrent price tag, and other extended-range guided artillery rounds have been delivered for around $50,000, although they are less capable. In fact, the LRLAP originally was quoted to cost around $50,000 in 2001 dollars, or about $68,000 today Let’s put this in perspective: Roughly 300 LRLAP rounds can be loaded into each of the Zumwalt class’s guns. Another 150 rounds that can be stored on the ship. So just arming each DDG-1000 class vessel with a full load of LRLAP shells would cost as much as buying an entire squadron of new F/A-18E Super Hornets. The truth is that the LRLAP program has performed well, as has the Advanced Gun System. The main problem is that when the decision was made to chop the planned DDG-1000 fleet size from 28 vessels down to just three, the Navy ended up buying just a fraction of the rounds that they originally planned on over a decade ago. As such, no real economies of scale can be realized when it comes to LRLAP, or with anything else DDG-1000 related for that matter. Just like the ships they were destined for, LRLAP shells have become oddities. The same can be said for many of the Zumwalt’s unique systems, sensors and software, putting the whole future of the tiny fleet in doubt. AGS fired during testing. Now the Navy says that it may look for another round to replace the LRLAP sometime in the future . This could include migrating another munition that is currently being eyed for the smaller five inch deck guns found on the Navy’s existing destroyers and cruisers, such as the hypersonic projectile or the Excalibur N5, . But these rounds will not have the same capabilities of the custom-made LRLAP, nor will they likely take advantage of the AGS’s larger caliber barrel. Not only that but adapting them to fit the AGS’s ammo handling system will be a project onto itself as the LRLAP is 88 inches tall. Either a sabot type casing will have to made for the smaller, less capable rounds to be fired out of the AGS, or the technology found on an existing guided round will have to integrated into a larger shell made to the AGS’s unique requirements. In this case, the Navy may find itself in a similar albeit likely less severe fiscal conundrum as they are now with ghastly expensive LRLAP round. A round that utilizes common components from an existing guided round that is already in production or that is planned on being fielded across the Navy’s fleet of existing destroyers and cruisers may end up costing less, but built in small numbers it will likely continue to be comparatively expensive. All the while it will provide less capability than what was originally envisioned for the AGS and the DDG-1000 as a weapon system overall. USS Zumwalt has been commissioned under a wave of glowing press, but a less than ideal reality lays beneath the ship's futuristic skin., USN There is the possibility that the Navy may just eventually decide to rip out the Zumwalt class’s guns altogether, replacing them with more vertical launch cells for increase missile storage. Although doing this would compromise the periphery launch cell design that supposedly makes the ship more survivable. The Navy could also just leave the space, or the gun systems for that matter, dormant in hopes that they can fit an electromagnetic railgun in there sometime in the future. Then again the best compromise may be to modify the AGS to handle “dumb” 155mm rounds, or build a dumb round specifically for it, with the possibility of adapting a guided round for the gun system sometime in the future. Although going from the incredible promise of LRLAP to dumb 155mm rounds is ridiculously unfortunate, at least the guns would have something to fire and the ships could still be used for naval gunfire support in certain situations. The only problem is that when operating that close to shore, within maybe 15 miles or so, even the stealthy Zumwalt class is vulnerable to anti-ship missile attacks and they lack a close in weapon system capable of providing a last line of defense against an anti-ship missile barrage. Parking an Aegis equipped Arleigh Burke class destroyer or Ticonderoga class cruiser nearby, both of which have far better air defense capabilities than the Zumwalt class, is not really a good solution as they represent an even larger target than the DDG-1000 and totally take away the advantage of having a stealthy ship in the first place. As such, putting DDG-1000 to work in the shore bombardment role in higher-threat scenarios would be problematic. The U.S. Navy's new stealth destroyer, the USS Zumwalt, passes Portland Head Light on its way to Portland Harbor , Derek Davis/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images What is most appalling about this situation is that the Navy seems to have kept this under wraps for some time, as the decision not to procure LRLAP rounds was likely made some time ago. They probably avoided disclosing the fact that those big guns that were so heavily touted to the media leading up to USS Zumwalt’s commissioning on October 15th were really nothing more than very elaborate and very expensive hood ornaments. With the confusing cancellation of LRLAP round the media will likely begin to dig a little deeper into DDG-1000’s true capabilities and will start to discover just how badly the Navy has bungled the program over the last decade. In the meantime expect the Navy brass to brush the situation off and to play the capabilities shell game, promising unfunded additions to the ship “sometime in the future” that will be “so much better” than LRLAP could have been. Better translated: they will talk about how cool railguns will be… Someday. Bottom line: After nearly $23 billion spent, the Navy has just three drastically watered down destroyers to show for it, ones that won’t even have a deck gun that can go boom.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 22, 2016",It’s Only a Matter of Time Before Election Day Cyber Attacks Become the Norm,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Washington is on high alert for some sort of cyber event as Americans go to the polls on Tuesday. For many, electronic vote tampering would appear a new threat on our democracy – and another twist in an already challenging election cycle. But if this campaign has taught us anything, it’s that our political process is vulnerable to intrusion and exploitation. We need to assume that cyber attacks on election day will become the norm, not the exception. Perceptions on this issue are fairly skewed. When people think about a cyber attack on election day they are most likely to think of hacking into voting machines and changing the results of an election. Although this is – and for years has been – a serious concern, attacking the heart of American democracy directly by fiddling with the vote tallies themselves is not the only place a savvy opponent will target, far from it. Election day is a ripe target for cyber attacks. Superficially, it’s obvious why: There are the global-scale economic and political effects a manipulated outcome could have, and the psychological appeal of attacking a democratic process that the US holds on a pedestal. But the biggest attraction to an election day cyber attack is the massive stage it would play out on. After all, what other day of the year are Americans paying attention to the process itself – and especially news coverage of that process. As such, cyber attacks of any kind will have far more psychological impact than on other dates. Presidential elections, which come around only every four years, magnify this reality exponentially as voter engagement is especially high. More eyeballs on TVs and the net means more impact from even a localized attack. It has been an unprecedented election, with the introduction of hacking as a political weapon being just one of the reasons why., AP Even with a broad audience, fear, and uncertainty may not be the goal of some adversaries. Barring the public from accessing information may prove to be just as powerful a tactic as any. On October 21st , hackers used lower-end internet connected devices to stifle access to the net with a series of mass DDoS attacks , affecting tens of millions of Americans. It seems clear that a peer state actor could use more harmful and precise attacks to creatively sway elections. But our vulnerabilities don’t end there. Much in the same way that weather can affect voter turnout , cyber attacks could do the same. Strikes on the power grid in key areas could disrupt the predicted outcome of a Presidential election – especially in key swing states where polling is extremely close. This is especially true in demographically slanted areas, such as big cities. These population centers often lean one way while rural parts of the same state lean the other. Attacking cities’ power grids, transportation arteries or other critical infrastructure, while leaving rural areas untouched, could result in a significant advantage for one candidate over another. Even disrupting communications and digital flow of information in a region could adversely affect the outcome of an election. This is especially true today, as voters are increasingly dependent on the internet for things like locating polling stations in their area. Broken down neatly, there are three separate potential objectives for anyone who would want to execute a cyber attack during voting in the US. The first would be to attempt to specifically skew the outcome of an election for a certain candidate or candidates. Second would be to attack the American democratic process at its heart, in an attempt to cast a lasting shadow over it. Third would be to cause chaos and damage affecting as many of Americans as possible. This is the “terror” model of cyber warfare. Maybe the most challenging part of fighting on this new battleground and addressing the types of attacks laid out above, is that they can come from both peer-state actors and non-state actors alike. Serious threats can even come from individuals. This makes predicting, tracking and countering threats incredibly challenging. Even more concerning is that, because of the level of deniability intrinsic to many cyber strikes, the threshold for choosing to execute them is far lower than other forms of attack, or even traditional political subversion. Voting machines have long been under fire for their potential vulnerabilities, but they represent just one tiny aspect of the cyber threat matrix surrounding election day. , Sean Rayford/Getty Images) This year has set a new precedent for external cyber meddling in America’s political process. Endless bundles of hacked emails combined with a weaponized Wikileaks have changed perceptions of how cyber attacks, or at least cyber espionage, can be executed. The US population has rapidly become accustomed to targeted “leaks” that involve foreign hacking. The authenticity of stolen documents are seldom questioned – even though they come from the most nefarious of sources. This murky area of cyber warfare will become more of an issue in the coming months, as similar tactics are used not just to get people elected, but to make sure they don’t get reelected, or even rehired for positions of importance. In other words, it is likely that this sort of warfare will increasingly be focused on a corporate or even personal level. The Sony hack by North Korea is an early example of this trend. With all this, and the educated guess that there’s reams of classified intelligence on the subject we are not privy to, Washington DC is preparing not just to deal with a cyber attack during tomorrow’s election, but to respond accordingly to that attack in real time . So far, official fingers have pointed towards Moscow when discussing this election cycle’s endless hacking events . Meanwhile there has been a lot of talk that President Obama is reviewing plans to retaliate against Russia’s supposed attacks , efforts that were made against the heart of the President’s own political party. These retaliation plans will likely only be put into play after the election, and at the ok of Hillary Clinton should she be the President elect. While the ball may already be motion, America’s own cyber arsenal on alert for another intrusion . If an attack occurs tomorrow, even if it is limited in nature, and if Russia is deemed the culprit, it is likely that these reprisal plans will be deployed in real time. There is little doubt that America has some exotic and terrifying cyber weapons of its own. The first of which was put to use against Iran’s nuclear program , and now cyber warfare is being conducted against the Islamic State . Still, retaliation for Russia’s supposed hacking will come in a proportional manner, likely congruent to the attacks made against the US over the last year. This could mean that instead of dramatically turning the lights off in Moscow for 24-hours, hacked emails or documents that expose corruption within Moscow’s ruling power structure could mysteriously emerge. If a strike is made during election day that prohibits voting or redirects the focus off the democratic process through fear and spectacle though, leaked documents are likely the least of the culprit’s worries. Regardless if any of this comes to pass or not, the cyber genie is out of the bottle, and America should prepare to mitigate the effects enemy cyber operations could have on its democratic process. Vote-by-mail is one way many of the concerns with voting machines or election day cyber strikes could be largely contained. Oregon's vote by mail has been a success and could serve as a model for other states as the cyber threat towards election day groes., AP Currently Oregon, Washington and Colorado all have postal only voting (you can still drop your vote at a drop box the day of the election), and the majority of states have some sort of a hybrid system. In Oregon, vote by mail has been a largely a fraud free success with positive turnout rates. If the majority of states were to break with tradition and adopt a vote-by-mail concept, it would harden the nation’s voting process against hacking and disruptions caused by cyber attacks on one single voting day where much of the voting is done on networked machines. Such a drastic move for many states will likely only come after an attack has been successfully executed. Being proactive, the US could deter future attacks with a relatively simple and convenient change in the voting process. Hopefully tomorrow’s national vote will go smoothly, with little speculation of electronic tampering or a high-profile cyber strike – but that doesn’t mean we should not begin preparing for what is likely inevitable. It’s our most precious shared institution at stake.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just a day after new imagery surfaced of China’s “other” stealth fighter, the Shenyang FC-31 , photos have emerged that give us the best look yet of the Z-20, Beijing’s shadowy H-60/S-70 Black Hawk clone. The Z-20, which has been an elusive beast since taking its first flight a couple years ago, differs from the Black Hawk in a number of small ways. Noticible changes include the cockpit area shaping, changes to its tail configuration, and above all, its rotor design. The Z-20 has five rotors instead of the four found on the Black Hawk. A satellite communications array, or at least a place for one, also appears to be installed on the Z-20’s spine. Rear view of the Z-20., Chinese Internet Although China has been accused of hacking detailed design information from American aerospace defense contractors — and rightfully so — the path to constructing the Z-20 was likely a far easier one. 24 S-70C Black Hawks were bought by China from the US in the mid 1980s. Another 100 were offered as options, but after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, strict arms embargoes were placed on China by the US and the EU. This ended deliveries of Black Hawks to China and curtailed direct manufacturer support for the helicopters to some degree. US built S-70C Black Hawks delivered to China in the 1980s. Regardless of the ban, the Chinese seemed to take great pride in their small but capable Blackhawk fleet, continuing to fly and maintain them through the 1990s and even into the present day. The aircraft were used mainly for assault, cargo transport and liaison duties, often in high altitude environments. Three of the Black Hawks are thought to have been lost due to accidents over the last three decades, but the majority of the remaining fleet still appears to be in flying condition today, despite approaching the end of their service lives. Another view of the Z-20 from the most recent set of images. , Chinese Internet To fill out their fleet, China has procured Mi-17s, an export version of Russia’s Mi-8 ‘Hip’ medium-lift helicopter family which fill a similar role as the Black Hawks. They also use the locally assembled Z-9 variant of the AS365 Dauphin to address lighter tasks, including acting as a multi-purpose maritime helicopter and VIP transport. But even a helicopter produced under license in China and with mostly Chinese-built components is not a true indigenous design. The Z-20, once in mass production, will likely fulfill many of the roles that these helicopters do today, and in much the same manner as how the US utilizes the H-60/S-70 design . A Chinese Z-9 from the PLAN. , UK MoD Beijing has followed a similar path with the development of the Z-18, a large multi-role transport helicopter based on the Aerospatiale AS321 Super Frelon . Super Frelons were initially imported to China from Europe in the late 1970s, but eventually the type was built under license in China, like the Z-9. Locally the Super Frelon is known as the Z-8. The Z-18 is basically a indigenous copy of the Z-8 with some improvements and small changes, the largest being the deletion of the “boat” style fuselage. Along with the Z-20, these two aircraft will likely make up the backbone of China’s vertical lift capabilities in the coming decade. A Z-18 operating in the field. , Chinese Internet Also of note is that China was known to have inspected the tail section of the crashed stealth-optimized Black Hawk variant left at the Bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Insights gained from examining the highly intact tail section could be extrapolated by the Chinese in an attempt to create their own low-observable Black Hawk, or Z-20, variant. The stealth Black Hawk's tail that was left behind after the raid on Bin Laden's compound. Pakistan let the Chinese examine it during the political row with the US that followed the mission. Obviously examining something and executing such an ambitious project are two very different things, but China is clearly very interested in stealth technology — and has shown a fair understanding of it in recent years. With this in mind, at least attempting to create something similar is a real possibility, and even if such a helicopter results in only limited gains signature reduction, it could be seen as a win by the People’s Liberation Army.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 24, 2016",Video Shows China’s Newly Constructed And Enhanced FC-31 Stealth Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s “other” stealth fighter was mysteriously absent at this year’s biennial Zhuhai Air Show after being the star of the show in 2014 . There have been rumors that the type was being reworked into a much enhanced iteration, while other rumors have suggested the program has been passed over, with China instead concentrating on a single stealth fighter design— that being the larger J-20 . The idea that China would abandon its middleweight stealth fighter program was somewhat laughable, as the jet clearly has high export potential and could help China garner a larger share of the international fighter aircraft market than it does today. Not only that, but there seems to be a clear place for the jet in PLAAF inventory as part of a high-low type stealth fighter capability mix. Now, a promotional video is being shown on the small screen at the arms expo portion of the Zhuhai Air Show, one that depicts a J-31/FC-31 2.0 of sorts. The somewhat flashy video includes depictions of the aircraft’s various loadouts and even footage of what clearly looks like a flying prototype of this new evolution of the J-31 design being completed. This new configuration appears to closely match the models that have been displayed at recent weapons expos showing a much more more refined J-31 concept. Included in this updated model are smaller “clipped” and swept vertical tails, a less angular overall appearance, and cleaner surfaces, among other changes. Overall, these modifications appear very similar to those made from the X-35 to the F-35, the YF-22 to the F-22, and even from the J-20 prototype to the more advanced configuration it is flying in today. The fact that another and updated flying example of the J-31/FC-31 appears to be nearly finished solidifies the notion that China will continue to develop a middleweight stealth fighter, one that will likely be accessible for purchase by nations who do not have access to or cannot afford the F-35. Also, we have an official name and designation for the jet: the Shenyang FC-31 Gyrfalcon. Check out the images and videos below. (The first video has the beginning, the second includes the end, with some overlap in the middle.) If AVIC is showing this prototype under construction now, expect a test flight of the jet soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 25, 2016",Russian Mi-24 Hind Gets Obliterated after Making an Emergency Landing in Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Syria is not a good place to make an emergency landing in a helicopter—or to fly around in one, for that matter. The majority of country’s territory remains hostile to the Assad government, and much of it is equally as hostile to Russian forces fighting alongside the Syrian regime. For example, a Russian Mi-8 that was hunting for the pilots of a Su-24 downed by a Turkish F-16 was filmed getting obliterated by a TOW missile after making an emergency landing. Another video shot last July shows an Mi-24 derivative (likely a Mi-24P) being blasted out of the sky. These are just a couple examples of how hostile the area is to rotary-wing aircraft. Now another video has surfaced which appears to show another Russian Mi-24 Hind variant getting blown up after making an emergency landing. According to Radio Free Europe , Russia claims that the helicopter had made an emergency landing after coming under fire about 25 miles northwest of the ancient city of Palmyra, in Homs Province . After the helicopter landed, friendly ground forces surrounded it and an Mi-8 swooped in to extract the Hind’s crew. Just as that helicopter was taking off the nearby Hind exploded. A video showing the incident has been released, and as you can see, the rescue helicopter looks like it barely made it out intact. Russia says the Hind crew and the rescue helicopter crew all made it back safely to its master airbase south of Latakia. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Swfvpp6dUxA It is not clear exactly how the Hind was destroyed. A blast can be heard just before the helicopter explodes, denoting the firing of some sort of weapon, although no missile can be seen striking the helicopter. A large caliber rifle or a recoilless rifle may have been used, or even lucky mortar. On the other hand the Hind could have exploded from damage it already sustained, or even a demolition charge placed on the aircraft to destroy it may have detonated sooner than expected. Also of note is that as the Mi-8 rescue helicopter comes around after the Hind explodes it starts popping flares while seemingly still on or very near the ground. Regardless of how the helicopter was destroyed, ISIS has claimed that they did it, although their shoot-down claims cannot exactly be trusted . Although Syrian helicopters have become notorious for dropping “barrel bombs” since the civil war began, Russian attack helicopters became prominent in the conflict after the Kremlin temporarily pulled the vast majority of its fixed-wing tactical aircraft out of the country last March . Although Hind and Hip variants were operating in Syria as early as the late fall of 2015, after the sudden draw-down, Russia inserted some of its most advanced helicopters into the conflict. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Tztydc3nMO4 Russian attack helicopters remain a potent part of Russia’s aerial arsenal deployed to Syria and the Admiral Kuznetsov , Russia only aircraft carrier that has just arrived in the eastern Mediterranean, carries one of the most advanced attack helicopters Russia has ever put into service, the KA-52K.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In recent weeks there have been reports of pinging noises detected around Fury and Hecla Strait in Canada’s northeastern Nunavut Territory. Locals say that the noises may be scaring off wildlife, and that they are not audible to the human ear but have been heard using listening devices. Concerns over the issue have led to a slew of possible explanations — everything from the presence of Russian submarines to conservationist sabotage. These reports of strange pinging noises are not just a legend or urban myth; the subject has garnered so much attention that the government representative for the area, Paul Quassa, recently told his legislative colleagues that: “The sound that has been heard in the area seems to be emitted from the seabed and underwater… Our constituents as well as hunters and boaters have reported that the area in question is almost devoid of sea mammals and that hunting has been poor in the area for quite some time…We will await the Department of National Defense review.” The area where the pings are said to have been detected are by the village of Iglook, near Fury and Hecla Strait., Google Maps Canada’s armed forces did take up the matter immediately. Department of National Defense spokesman Evan Koronewski responded publicly to the request stating: “The Department of National Defence has been informed of the strange noises emanating in the Fury and Hecla Strait area, and the Canadian Armed Forces are taking the appropriate steps to actively investigate the situation.” It seems that the steps taken have included the near immediate dispatch of a CP-140 Aurora (Canada’s name for their configuration of the P-3 Orion ) to the area to listen for the mysterious subsurface sonic anomaly. Another Department of National Defence spokesman, Dan Le Bouthillier, described the Aurora’s findings, or lack thereof, after it returned from its mission: “The aircrew performed various multi-sensor searches in the area, including an acoustic search for 1.5 hours, without detecting any acoustic anomalies…The crew did not detect any surface or subsurface contacts.” The Ottawa Citizen reports that although no pings were detected, wildlife was spotted by the aircraft, including six walruses and two separate pods of whales. A Canadian CP-140 Maritime Patrol Aircraft. , Aldo Bidini/Wikicommons The sound is said to have been triangulated by locals to about 45 miles north of the Fox-Main North Warning System site. Fox-Main, located on Hall Beach , was one of the first major installations constructed during the early days of the Cold War as part of a string of radar sites that would span across Canada’s northern reaches. Dubbed the Distant Early Warning line , or more famously the “DEW Line,” the installations were intended to detect waves of incoming Soviet bombers that would have marked the beginning of World War III. The site is still in use today, and is likely of increased interest to Russia ever since they restarted large scale long-range bomber drills. Hall Beach North Warning System site. , Google Earth As for the supposed pings, they could be a localized anomaly that some recording devices pick up under certain conditions — and there is nothing to say that they could not be caused by military equipment in the area. Some manner of sonar system could have been left on the seafloor in the area for a period of time to monitor surface or subsurface traffic. It is also possible that such a device was set there for a period of time, picked up and then possibly returned to the location at a later date, or not at all. The thing is that there is really little reason why the US or Canada would use such a mobile device in friendly territory, as they could just hard wire one to the seabed floor permanently. The US placed throngs of fixed hydrophones on the seabed floor all around the world as part of a massive top secret Cold War surveillance network called SOSUS . Today SOSUS is used for both military and scientific purposes; but that’s not to say that new clandestine programs similar to SOSUS do not exist — and we certainly have a submarine that is capable of supporting them. Don’t point a finger at SOSUS itself or a system like it though; it’s a passive detection system, not an active one. In other words, it listens only, and does not send out signals of its own. The signals detected in this arctic mystery are indicative of an active system, or at least a semi-active system — whereby when a specific sound is picked up passively, a series of sonar pings are triggered. Fixed active sonar installations are not unprecedented. Project Archimedes was one of the first iterations of such a system, and was basically a DEW system for enemy submarines. Eventually these fixed systems were decommissioned and the capability migrated to mobile platforms. So if the US or Canada are not the culprit, could Russia have placed a temporary device in the area to monitor traffic? It’s possible — but the question is why would they? USNS Loyal (T-AGOS-22) is a Victorious -class surveillance ship that can deploy low-frequency radar., MSC What about the possibility that Russian subs are prowling in the area? Once again, it may be possible; and Russia has taken a very high interest in the arctic as of late , with the US following suit. Fury and Hecla Strait may also be emerging as an increasingly strategic shipping funnel. For the better part of the 20th century it was regularly covered in ice, but the strait is increasingly navigable as climate change accelerates. Could this key artery in the Northwest Passage be an upcoming hotspot in the new Cold War? Well, that’s debatable, as the channel is fairly deep in Canadian territory. Then again this all could just be the result of a cocktail of coincidences that led locals to jump to conclusions. Consider what would happen if some sort of sonor was being used in the area for a time by a submarine or a survey vessel, and its emissions were indeed detected. Paired with natural changes in wildlife habits — due to the dwindling ice cover in the region, for instance — it’s easy to imagine how locals could associate the pings with the rapid environmental changes around them, even though these occurrences may have nothing to do with each other. In an age where great submarine hunts are once again becoming a thing , Canada’s mysterious underwater pings, and the reaction to their supposed existence, are if anything else another reminder of the turbulent geopolitical and environmental times we have entered into.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 13, 2017",America’s Huge Afloat Forward Staging Base In Action,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have followed the progression of both the Expeditionary Mobile Base and the Expeditionary Transfer Dock , both variants of the Navy’s modified Alaska class oil tanker designs. A small fleet of these two types of ships will allow the Pentagon to have a persistent and capable maritime presence nearly anywhere on the high seas, and rapidly access land masses by conveying masses of military equipment with efficiency never realized before. The USNS Lewis B. Puller , named after the famous Marine “Chesty” Puller, is the first of three planned Expeditionary Mobile Bases. The ship measures 764-feet long, 164-feet wide, and displaces a whopping 78,000 tons. Its identical sister ship, the USNS Hershel “Woody” Williams , is now under construction in San Diego, and a third ship has been funded. These ships are meant to tackle a slew of tasks, including counter-mine, special operations, humanitarian, counter-piracy and maritime security missions. They can even support large-scale amphibious operations. Make sure to read all about these ships, their specs, and the sea basing concept in this past article of mine . The USNS Lewis B. Puller will soon be sent to take over the role as America’s forward afloat staging base in the Persian Gulf. This mission had been executed by the aging Austin class amphibious transport dock, USS Ponce . Late last summer the Puller completed Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) exercises that saw it field MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters and their massive mine countermeasure sleds as well as deploying small boats from the ship’s cavernous lower level, known as the Mission Deck. It also demonstrated its capability to execute replenishment underway, as well as further proving its seakeeping qualities. Although the ship’s baseline requirement was limited to deploying MH-53Es and their mine-hunting gear, as well as small boats, the Navy has chosen to outfit the ship with upgrades that will allow it to simultaneously support special operations forces. Lieutenant Commander Matthew Muehlbauer, the officer in charge of the Puller’s military crew (the ship is ran by a split crew of civilian mariners and sailors) stated the following in a Military Sealift Command press release : “The Puller is going to receive an upgrade which will enable special operations forces (SOF) to utilize the ship for operations. The Puller will be able to support maritime interdictions, operations potentially in-country, and different adaptive military packages to perform different types of SOF contingencies throughout the world.” An MH-53E Sea Dragon sling-loads cargo aboard the Puller . , USN Exactly what this upgrade includes is not clear. Specialized communications, computers, mission planning areas as well as lockers, gyms and berthing areas have probably been added. The ability to deploy special operations helicopters and large boats, are likely part of this enhanced mission fit as well. Outfitted in early 2017, the ship will undergo a similar series of drills proving these capabilities. After that, it will deploy to the Persian Gulf. What’s interesting is that that Special Operations Command is quietly constructing its own elaborate sea base ship , tailored to their unique mission set. It seems as if the Puller will be a more multi-role oriented vessel, while the other ship will be used exclusively for special operations missions. According to USNI News , the ship currently has four operating spots, two parking spots and two hangar spaces for MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters. As new aircraft are integrated onto the ship, this will likely change — with multiple aircraft handling layouts being certified for operations. By most accounts, adding new aircraft, such as the H-60 and V-22, or unmanned systems such as the MQ-8 will only require basic enhancements, like specific maintenance support systems to the ship’s cavernous hangar deck. The 160th Special Operations Air Regiment, better known as the Night Stalkers, will likely work with the ship as part of its special operations upgrade. The unit flies everything from small MH-6 Little Birds to MH-47 Chinooks. The ship's expansive flight deck is currently setup for MH-53E operations., USN The lower “Mission Deck” also has a ton of potential, with unmanned surface and underwater vehicles easily deployed and stored there, as well as towed arrays. Stout cranes mounted on the Mission Deck are capable of lifting much larger boats into the water than small rigid hull inflatable boats, mine countermeasure sleds and unmanned systems they have launched and recovered so far. The cranes are capable of moving 11 metric tons in heavy sea states, which means much larger vessels such as special operations support craft may be deployed from there in the future. Larger vessels can just dock alongside the ship, where they can refuel and rearm. One of the cranes on the ship's Mission Deck., USN Although we have seen quite a bit of material showing USNS Montford Point , the Expeditionary Transport Dock version of these ships, in action , pictures and video of the Expeditionary Mobile Base going about its business are more scarce. As to how important these ships could become in the inventory, Director of Expeditionary Warfare, Major General Chris Owens, told USNI News that combatant commanders want the ships in their area of operations even before they are constructed, stating: “The demand for that right now is so high, CENTCOM has got their hooks in this one ( Puller ) but both the [U.S. European Command] and [U.S. Africa Command] commander are asking for that ship, and if not that, they’re getting their bids in early to get the next one committed to them… They know they can employ it nearly full time.” A Mk105 mine countermeasures sled that is towed by the MH-53E Sea Dragon., USN That’s what these ships are all about. By building them off of a reliable and proven commercial platform, and designing them to stay on station for years instead of months, they offer persistence that other naval assets cannot. They do all this at a bargain price as well, costing about the same as a Littoral Combat Ship. The only controversial issue with the design at this point is that they are totally defenseless when it comes to anti-ship cruise missile or aircraft attacks. They lack even the basic Mk15 Phalanx close-in weapon system that some of their fellow Sealift Command ships are equipped with. Considering they are built to commercial specifications, not the Navy’s, and that they operate with a relatively tiny crew (not idea for damage control), this is troublesome — especially so in light of recent events . Also, given the fact that these ships are supposed to free-up major surface combatants to do higher-end missions, that won’t happen if they need an Aegis-equipped destroyer or cruiser nearby to protect them even in low to medium threat environments. Hopefully this deficiency will change, and the ships will get outfitted with SeaRAM before they are sent into dangerous and unpredictable areas of operations.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s Littoral Combat Ships have had a terrible spate of mechanical failures and accidents, but the latest aboard the USS Montgomery (LCS-8) takes the cake . The ship’s aluminum exterior has fractured for the second time in just two months. This, after suffering two different major mechanical failures while trying to transit to her new homeport of San Diego. This most recent mishap came while the aluminum trimaran was passing through the Panama Canal on its second attempt at finishing its voyage to Southern California. On October 29th the ship collided with one of locks’ concrete walls while under the control of a canal pilot. A statement from the 3rd Fleet obtained by USNI News read: “On Oct. 29 USS Montgomery (LCS-8) sustained damage to her hull while transiting southbound through the Gatun and Pedro Miguel locks of the Panama Canal. Under control of the local Panama Canal Pilot, the ship impacted the center lock wall and sustained an 18-inch-long crack between her port quarter and transom plates. The crack is located 8-10 feet above the waterline and poses no water intrusion or stability risk.” It is not exactly clear how this mishap happened, much larger warships have passed through the canal for over a century with few mishaps. The USS Montgomery is apparently continuing on to San Diego, where it will be repaired. What appears to be an Essex class carrier passes through the Panama Canal in the 1940s. The last fissure in the Montgomery’s hull occurred on October 4th, when the ship collided with a tugboat as it was heading to sea to escape Hurricane Mathew. The ship was docked at Naval Station Mayport at the time after it had to turn back from its initial voyage to San Diego following the detection of a seawater leak in the ship’s hydraulic cooling system. While the crew was dealing with the leak, USS Montgomery experienced a catastrophic failure of one of its gas turbine engines. The ship was commissioned on September 13th.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 10, 2016",Russian Carrier Executes Flight Ops as Subs Head for Rendezvous in the Med,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s unique and only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, is on its way toward Syria where its battle group will take part in combat operations over the war torn country. In the meantime, Russia has released video of recent flight training operations aboard and around the ship, including clips of its upgraded Su-33s, new MiG-29Ks and Kamov helicopters in action. There is even a shot of what appears to be an interesting infrared countermeasure system being activated off the ship’s starboard side. The Russian flotilla, the largest since the end of the Cold War, has been seen as a pariah by western nations. No country has yet been willing to refuel the ships as they make their journey from the frigid Barents Sea to the warm waters of the eastern Mediterranean. Originally Spain agreed to refuel the carrier and some of its escorts, but a wave of diplomatic protests and media coverage accusing Spain of helping Russia commit war crimes in Syria by providing material support for their military hardware preempted that operation. The Kremlin says that the ship really doesn’t need ports of call anyway, as it can be replenished underway. If anything this most recent controversy is a reminder of why Russia sees its port in Tartus, Syria as so strategically crucial, and their lease on that port has been extended indefinitely by the Assad regime . Not just that, but Russia’s port facilities there have been drastically expanded and now will be able to accept any ship in the Russian Navy”s inventory. An S-300 air defense battery has also been deployed nearby. Russia’s expanded and indefinite access to its only warm water port in the Mediterranean, as well as to its master airbase south of the Syrian port city of Latakia, is clearly a form of partial repayment to Russia by the Assad regime for saving it from collapse via direct military intervention. That intervention started over a year ago and continues till this day. https://youtube.com/watch?v=MAAfPACvyUY There have also been media reports that more attack submarines have been deployed to support the Russian flotilla in the eastern Med. These supposedly include two Akula class nuclear fast attack submarines and a diesel-electric Kilo class submarine. That same report said that NATO has been tracking these boats for some time now. It’s doubtful that this tally includes the submarine that was already thought to have been escorting Kuznetsov and its battle group, or any of the Kilo class submarines based in the Black Sea that venture into the Mediterranean on a fairly regular basis. These Sevastopol-based subs have even taken part in strikes on targets in Syria using their Kalibr cruise missiles . The flowing lines of a Russian Akula class nuclear fast attack submarine. , Public Domain It is thought that the Kuznetsov is holding off Libya in order to join up with these submarines. Also in the area is the USS San Antonio LPD-17 supporting anti-extremist operations in Libya. The addition of Russian submarines prowling the area while Kuznetsov is on station near Syria combined with the US and other NATO subs which sure to be waiting to ‘receive’ the flotilla once it arrives will make the depths of the eastern Med a busy place in the coming weeks. As The War Zone predicted , the Kuznetsov battle group will likely arrive just as a major offensive in Aleppo begins — an offensive aimed at finally clearing the city of anti-Assad rebels once and for all. As to those Syrian peace negotiations between the US and Russia, well, they are no longer happening at all. As we discussed earlier, the situation has spun nearly out of control . Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu now says that peace talks are “indefinitely delayed ,” adding “It is time for our Western colleagues to determine who they are fighting against: terrorists or Russia… Maybe they have forgotten at whose hands innocent people died in Belgium, in France, in Egypt and elsewhere?” Tensions between the US and Russia have only increased in recent days as reports of aerial near misses between Russian and US planes over Syrian airspace have surfaced. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated the following about the possibility of extending Russia’s “humanitarian pause” in Aleppo: “All that is impossible if the terrorists continue to fire on neighbourhoods and humanitarian aid routes, to launch attacks, and continue to hide behind a (human) shield. That will not permit the continuation of the humanitarian pause.” The truth is that Russia has made a big investment into not only this massive naval deployment, but also in building up their forces in Syria over the last two months. Pulling these assets back now, just to have to redeploy them is likely very fiscally unpalatable for the cash-strapped Kremlin. Russian Defense Minister Shoigu. Moscow also likely realizes they need to get the “Aleppo issue” off the table so that Assad’s hold on power can be solidified and Russia can pull its forces back out of Syria on a prolonged basis. The military excursion into Syria has been a costly one for Russia. While the Kremlin has realized significant spoils of war , the longer fighting goes on, the harder it will be to justify it to the Russian people who are already seeing their economy struggle . This likely means that brutally crushing rebel forces in Aleppo, regardless of the cost to innocent human life and the how it may change perceptions of Russia around the globe, may be seen as necessary by Putin and his military advisors. Now that opposition forces have launched their own offensive , Russia will likely use this move as a justification for starting a hardcore offensive of their own — one that is likely already planned. In fact, they threatened to do just that hours ago. Suffice it to say that the forecast looks exceedingly violent and bloody for northwestern Syria in the weeks ahead.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As expected, the J-20 stealth fighter made its public debut at the Zhuhai Air Show today. Thought the Chinese government has largely kept silent about the J-20 over its last half decade of flight tests, a pair of the jets went screaming high over the runway at Jinwan Airport before splitting up via a dramatic cross-over break. Then a single J-20 came back for more passes, climbs and turns. Although some spectators may have been a little disappointed that the display did not last longer, or feature a wider flight envelope and aircraft configuration changes (such as a flyby with its weapons bay doors open ), there is no doubt that the J-20 has finally arrived on the world stage. Both aircraft wore an overall metallic gray scheme, not the splinter style gray camouflage that has been flying on some early production examples of the type. Even with its abbreviated routine, the flyby still offered some of the best views of the big delta-canard planform jet, as you can see below. https://youtube.com/watch?v=If2QpImw6Bk VCG/VCG via Getty Images VCG/VCG via Getty Images VCG/VCG via Getty Images AP AP AP AP AP The air show and international arms expo also featured China’s premier flight demonstration squadron—the J-10-flying August 1st Aerobatic Team.

A jet-powered unmanned combat aircraft similar to General Atomics Avenger/Predator C was also on display for the first time, although photos of the aircraft have been floating around for some time. The aircraft is supposedly named “Cloud Shadow.” The turboprop-powered Wing Loong II unmanned aircraft system on display. , AP China’s massive new amphibian, the AG-600, was present at Zhuhai as well. Wearing its smart new paint job, the big boat-hulled transport is clearly a focus of pride for China, as the unique aircraft was designed and built indigenously. Though Chinese officials are quick to point out the aircraft’s many civilian and humanitarian uses, its military utility is undeniable—especially considering China’s extra-territorial expansion in the South China Sea and other remote island claims in the Pacific region. Though it appeared two years ago , China’s “other” stealth fighter, the Shenyang J-31, was absent at this year’s show. The J-31 is seen as a lower-end low-observable fighter that China could eventually use in a high-low strategic mix alongside the J-20. It is also clearly an aircraft that China hopes to export to countries who lust for a stealthy aircraft, but either cannot afford or are not allowed access to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. There is even talk that the J-31 may be navalized, eventually becoming the mainstay of China’s supposed future CATOBAR carrier force. The J-31 seen flying at the 2014 Zhuhai Air Show, although the type was strangely absent this year. , AP The absent J-31 is a bit puzzling, as showing off two stealth fighters instead of one would have sent a powerful message to potential foes, industrial competitors and arms buyers alike. There have been hints the J-31 program may be morphing significantly as it moves from prototype to a pre-production configuration, although China’s interest in fielding the fighter is still unknown and a major export partner may still be needed to get the jet into operational form. Now that China has unleashed its prized super-fighter before the masses, expect to see and hear much more about it. It is thought that the type is in low-rate initial production, and going by the way China handles military aircraft development, it will likely be fielded to its first operational squadron soon. The jet’s screaming arrival at Zhuhai also comes alongside reports that a larger, more stealthy version of the aircraft may be in the works. At the very least, a design concept for the larger jet has existed since at least 2013.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 30, 2016","No, The Fight To Save The A-10 Warthog Has Not Been Won","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Many news outlets ran triumphant headlines late last week that read as if the battle to keep the A-10 Warthog in service for the foreseeable future had finally been won. Sadly this is not the case, far from it. The A-10’s future remains murky at best, and the USAF’s sly plan to rapidly draw down the A-10 fleet over the next few years has not been taken off the table, though it may be slightly delayed. Just one thing has changed as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the Presidential election, the clear need for the jet’s capabilities overseas, and the status of the still largely unproven F-35: The USAF’s Material Command is leaving itself in position  to sustain the A-10 fleet, just in case it isn’t sent to the boneyard once and for all. Last week’s naive news reports centered around an Aviation Week article featuring a recent interview with Air Force Materiel Command head honcho General Ellen Pawlikowski. In the interview the General stated the following: “They have re-geared up, we’ve turned on the depot line, we’re building it back up in capacity and supply chain… Our command, anyway, is approaching this as another airplane that we are sustaining indefinitely… My approach from a sustainment perspective is to approach this as if we’re just going to continue to keep these airplanes operating…We will wait as the dust settles as far as what the strategy will be; that discussion continues to go on and I think it always will as we look at the fact that our demand signal for our airplanes continues to be high.” An A-10 seen operating on a rough field with a combat air controller in the foreground., USAF So the AF Material Command is hedging, nothing more. If it were to draw down depot capacity for the A-10, it would likely disrupt the Warthog community’s warfighting capability dramatically if and when a decision was ordered to keep the jets operating at full strength for the foreseeable future, – even if their retirement was pushed just a year or two into the future. That media outlets turned this statement into gloating headlines is troubling – doing so hurts the A-10’s odds of surviving, as many now think the aircraft is no longer endangered. Beyond keeping A-10 depots running at full capacity, there have been small-scale glimmers of hope that the greater USAF is moving in the direction of extending the USAF’s planned retirement date, and some statements from head Pentagon officials have supported that possibility. Yet the reality is that, without Congressional support, there is little the USAF could do on its own to axe the A-10 even if they wanted to. Case in point: The aircraft is still flying today after constant assassination attempts by the USAF over the last half decade – and to a broader degree, over the aircraft’s entire operational history. In recent years, the USAF has tried to justify retiring the A-10 in every way imaginable , going so far as cherry-picking data , and stating that they cannot stand-up the F-35 fleet without poaching many of the personnel currently assigned to the A-10. This helped spark a bizzare and manufactured rivalry between the two very different combat aircraft . This faux-competition hit a crescendo last year when Arizona Representative Martha McSally demanded an absurd “fly-off” close air support competition between the two wildly different, but in reality, quite complementary aircraft. An A-10 deployed to Afghanistan. , USAF USAF brass has even put forward the idea that it will replace the A-10 with not just one, but two new aircraft . This is a laughable idea that we labeled as vaporware at the time, considering the USAF doesn’t have the money to operate the A-10 itself – an aircraft both already paid for and proven to be the least expensive manned tactical platform in the USAF inventory. Not only that, but the Air Force’s tactical aircraft budget as it sits today will be insolvent by 2021. Even the Secretary of Air Force has never even seen a proposal for this A-10 replacement plan and said there was no money for such an initiative even if there was one. Yet once again, the press ran wild with the story, with major news outlets and military bloggers alike offering little skepticism about yet another new airplane program emanating from an already broke Air Force. Now, with a seemingly pragmatic Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein, settling into his new role, hopefully the days of the USAF pitting the A-10 and the F-35 against each other will be coming to an end. With that rivalry dispatched, we’d finally rid ourselves of the fiscally unsupported propaganda surrounding the possibility of an A-10 replacement. General Goldfein talking air combat., USAF Don’t expect the A-10’s future to be decided until after the election. With money on the line, it won’t just be the new President and a new cabinet pulling the strings; a new paradigm in Congress will also impact the USAF’s force structure plans – including the fate of the A-10 Warthog. The USAF is unlikely to end its offensive against the A-10, even if they punt its retirement date slightly into the future. After buying themselves a little time, and waiting for the political and foreign policy winds to change in their favor, the “boys in blue” will go after the Warthog again. The back stabbing has long been a fact of life for the A-10, as the flying branch has tried time and time again to slaughter the ‘Hog . Even as the Air Force Material Command tries to mitigate the risk of a change in the A-10’s looming retirement plan, other USAF commands are taking aggressive measures in an effort to prepare for life after the A-10 , one where the Air Force would no longer have a community dedicated to the close air support mission set. So sorry folks, don’t believe everything you read. Despite demand , the Warthog’s future is still very much in doubt, and we probably won’t get a clearer view of its fate until after the election and the passage of the Pentagon’s 2018 budget.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 22, 2016",These Special Blocks Likely Saved Mike Pence’s Plane From Disaster,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The runways at LaGuardia have always been an issue—at least in the public’s mind. They are shorter than most runways at large airports in major metropolitan areas and they lead to either a body of water or dense civilization. Jerry Seinfeld even lampooned the airport’s unnerving runway setup on SNL . How unsafe the airport’s runways actually are is debatable, but Republican Vice Presidential candidate and Indiana Governor Mike Pence, along with his entourage, will probably agree with the naysayers after experiencing a terrifying incident Thursday night when their 737-700 campaign plane skidded off the end of LaGuardia’s Runway 22. What likely saved them from a much more horrific outcome is a fairly obscure but proven airport technology called the Engineered Material Arresting System, or EMAS for short. The concept behind EMAS is fairly simple. Instead of putting asphalt before the thresholds of runways, the area is covered with a stretch of thousands of brittle, concrete-like blocks meant to collapse when the weight of an aircraft’s landing gear bears down on them. The plane’s gear continues to ride through the blocks, dramatically slowing the aircraft’s speed in a very short distance. The technology is especially relevant for airports with short runways and limited overrun areas. The FAA describes the genesis of EMAS, its effectiveness and what it is made out of: “The FAA began conducting research in the 1990s to determine how to improve safety at airports where the full RSA cannot be obtained. Working in concert with the University of Dayton, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the Engineered Arresting Systems Corporation (ESCO) of Logan Township, NJ, a new technology emerged to safely arrest overrunning aircraft. EMAS uses crushable material placed at the end of a runway to stop an aircraft that overruns the runway. The tires of the aircraft sink into the lightweight material and the aircraft is decelerated as it rolls through the material. The EMAS technology improves safety benefits in cases where land is not available, or not possible to have the standard 1,000-foot overrun. A standard EMAS installation can stop an aircraft from overrunning the runway at approximately 80 miles per hour. An EMAS arrestor bed can be installed to help slow or stop an aircraft that overruns the runway, even if less than a standard RSA length is available.” A diagram of how EMAS is placed at airports., Youtube “As of October 2014, there are two  manufacturers of  EMAS products that meet the FAA requirements…EMASMAX is the latest, most durable version of ESCO’s EMAS, developed with and technically accepted by the FAA. EMASMAX arrestor beds are composed of blocks of lightweight, crushable cellular cement material designed to safely stop airplanes that overshoot runways. Runway Safe EMAS is a foamed silica bed which is made from recycled glass and is contained within a high-strength plastic mesh system anchored to the pavement at the end of the runway. The foamed silica is poured into lanes bounded by the mesh and covered with a poured cement layer and treated with a top coat of sealant. Both EMAS products are located at the end of the runway and are typically the full width of the runway. The length depends on the airport configuration and the aircraft fleet using the airport.” As of February of 2016, ESCO’s EMAS, the most prolific of the two suppliers, has been installed on over 103 runway ends at 61 airports in the US, according to the FAA.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 15, 2016",Shadowy UAE Base in Libya Hosts Attack Aircraft and Chinese Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A quiet but bloody war is raging on in Libya, and players from around the hemisphere continue to attempt a stabilization of what continues to be a very unstable situation . Some of these nations even have their own forward operating bases in Libya, including a secretive remote airfield operated by the United Arab Emirates and located about 50 miles southeast of Benghazi. Here, the UAE has deployed a pocket air force of heavily armed and armored agricultural planes developed into surveillance and light attack platforms–the AT-802U Border Patrol variant of the Air Tractor and the more capable IOMAX Archangel –in addition to S-70 Blackhawks, and Chinese Wing Loong unmanned aircraft, which are loosely analogous the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator. Also check out more images of the base via Terraserver here. Make sure to pick the latest images by toggling the tab on the left hand side of the user interface window. The base is austere, with satellite images showing no facilities there until early this year. Over the last few months there have been reports of AT-802Us being flown from somewhere in the country, likely by the UAE, one of the type’s major customers. There have even been reports of these aircraft orbiting over key locales, and flying low along certain roadways in the eastern part of the country. Now, with the base identified by IHS Janes , there is no doubt where these mysterious aircraft are coming from. The UAE was one of China’s first export customers for the Wing Loong, having closed the deal in 2011 . Since then the type has found another customer in nearby Saudi Arabia. Both the AT-802U and the Wing Loong have seen action in war in Yemen. In fact, the UAE has been training indigenous AT-802U pilots for duty in Yemen, donating some of their oldest variants of the AT-802U, the Border Patrol Variant (the more advanced Archangel is now in service), for the cause. It is not clear if a similar program is underway in Libya, where the UAE backs the Libyan National Army. It’s not exactly in step with the fledgling UN supported government in Tripoli, but the group is active in fighting Islamic extremist elements, especially in the eastern part of the country. The Libyan National Army is known to have a small hodgepodge of an air force of its own, though it wouldn’t be equipped with the high-tech sensors or munitions of the AT-802U or Archangel. In addition to the UAE, Turkey, Egypt and Qatar are active militarily in the Libya, as are a handful of European militaries and the US. Although American aircraft have been flying over the skies of Libya consistently since the beginning of coalition operations in that country in 2011, actual airstrikes have been sparse and mainly targeted against very high-value individuals. US special operations ground elements are clearly operating in Libya as well . This summer the US waded back into the fight in a much more conventional manner, leveraging the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp’s embarked Aviation Combat Element (ACE) to strike extremist forces in and around the port city of Sirte. This operation is now being scaled back, with the Landing Platform Dock USS San Antonio (LPD-17) – the same ship that was attacked while transiting through the Strait of Mandeb two weeks ago– taking up station off Libya’s coast in place of the USS Wasp. Whether it’s news of the UAE’s secretive air base in Libya, or America’s “Gator Navy” flying combat missions over Libyan shores, it’s a reminder that perpetual “low-intensity” warfare around the Middle East, Northern Africa and southwest Asia has become a miserable fact of life. There are so many players in each conflict, and so many fragmented objectives motivating those players, that it seems almost impossible for any sort of peace to be obtained in the foreseeable future. This latest revelation regarding the forward deployment of elements of the UAE’s “lower tier” air force serves as another example of how militaries in the region and major power brokers abroad are arming themselves for two different conflicts, simultaneously developing a high-tech, high-end force for relatively quick and bloody conflicts with high stakes against peer-state competitors, while also fielding a simpler, much more affordable force in long-term irregular and counter-insurgency warfare. In other words, even small countries in the region can no longer afford a “one-size-fits-all” military. It is simply too expensive to sustain in combat for long periods of time. In the end the only people who seem to truly win are the arms dealers.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has built nearly 1,100 767s over the past 35 years. While other designs like the 757 have come and gone (many would say prematurely), the 767 continues to roll off the production line at the company’s sprawling Everett, Washington plant. Bolstered largely by the USAF’s KC-X contract a uniquely configured 767 tanker – the KC-46As Pegasus – will be built with a proposed 179 airframes to be delivered over the decade following its introduction into service in 2018. Well, at least that’s the plan. The USAF has finally cleared the KC-46 for production . it took a decade to select the type against its Airbus A330-based rival, and its development has been a fiscal black hole for Boeing to say the least. Its turbulent past aside, if everything goes well, the USAF’s massive order will keep the 767 production line alive for many years to come. Here’s that incredible process in action: With the KC-46, Boeing’s proud tradition of building jet tankers (including the oft-forgotten KC-747) will continue on for the foreseeable future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 4, 2019",DARPA’s Submarine Hunting Drone Ship Test’s Sensor Hauling Parasail,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel, much better known as simply ACTUV, is DARPA’s ambitious technology demonstrator , a project which aims to potentially change the way the Navy tracks enemy submarines. A loft goal on its own, but ACTUV’s unmanned capabilities could also help revolutionize shipping, environmental monitoring, and save lives on the high seas. And when the program isn’t researching ways to take the sailor out of the ship or tail enemy subs for weeks at a time other sensors and concepts are being tested aboard the one-off vessel. Case in point the Towed Airborne Lift of Naval Systems (TALONS) program. TALONS is remarkably simple in concept: It’s a winch-attached parachute that can be towed behind a ship or a boat while underway – very similar to the parasailing rides offered in vacation spots around the globe. But instead of carrying a couple on their honeymoon aloft it carries intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance payloads weighing up to 150 pounds. Not only that, but it also goes quite a bit higher than your average ski-boat towed revelers, up to 1,500 feet to be exact. By being able to lift sensors like radars, infrared surveillance systems and communications nodes far up into the sky, the ship towing the parachute-like airfoil bound payload can ‘see’ and communicate much farther than if the sensors were mounted on the ship’s mast. The long-time limitation of naval vessels’ sensors communications systems has been the curvature of the earth. With TALONS, that limitation can be greatly overcome, and in a cheap and relatively simple manner that doesn’t require complex aircraft, pilots or handlers. At 50 feet, line of sight is just eight miles. Peering down from 1,500 feet the line of sight to the horizon is nearly 50 miles in any direction. DARPA describes the recent tests with TALONS and ACTUV off the southern California coast: “The demonstration took place over two days with 90 minutes of flight each day. The TALONS prototype started out from its “nest” installed on the back of the ACTUV vehicle. It then expanded its parachute and rose to an altitude of 1,000 feet, where it tested its onboard sensors and communications equipment. Once the test was complete, the prototype reeled itself in back to the nest. The entire process took place as the ACTUV vehicle maneuvered at operationally realistic speeds. While aloft, TALONS demonstrated significant improvements to the range of the sensors and radios it carried compared to mounting them directly on a surface vessel. For example, TALONS’ surface-track radar extended its range by 500 percent—six times—compared to its range at sea level. Its electro-optical/infrared scanner doubled its observed discrimination range. The TALONS team plugged in a commercial handheld omnidirectional radio; that radio’s range more than tripled.” Dan Patt who manages TALONS for DARPA added: “TALONS showed the advantages of using a low-cost add-on elevated sensor to extend the vision and connectivity of a surface asset and ACTUV demonstrated its ability as a flexible and robust payload truck…This demonstration was an important milestone in showing how clever use of unmanned systems could cost-effectively provide improved capabilities.” ACTUV began testing just last June after being shipped from Portland, Oregon to San Diego. The idea that it is already being used as a new surrogate for experimental subsystems is pretty incredible. TALONS itself only took 90 days to go from approval to testing and is part of the TERN program picking up steam within the Pentagon. If fully realized, the cocktail of technologies that come out of TERN could drastically increase the capabilities of the Navy’s ‘small deck’ surface combatants. Now that this initial demonstration is complete, the TALONS program is being transferred over to the Navy for further evolution. As for ACTUV, it will continue testing for the next couple of years before the program has the chance to be transferred over to the Navy. During that time, we will likely see more modular systems tested onboard the drone ship, following a long history of exotic one-off vessels that have helped pave the way for the technologies and operational concepts now deployed by the US Navy.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 26, 2016",Is a Showdown Between Russia and the U.S. Unavoidable?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Syria has become a straight up proxy power struggle between the US and Russia. A miserably designed and hastily implemented ceasefire, even a budding “cooperation” plan between the US and Russia aimed to focus the fighting on common foes like ISIS and al-Nusra had no chance of succeeding. And on the heels of its nearly immediate and foreseeable failure, US-Russian relations are in worse shape than they were in before the deal was struck. Now, after Russian and Syrian forces have turned back to Aleppo in an attempt to crush the rebel resistance there once and for all, and as the White House mulls a response to Russian cyber attacks targeting the heart of American democracy, it seems like some sort of confrontation or standoff between old Cold War foes is inevitable. Russia had long lusted after US intelligence that could depict all the players on the Syrian battlefield map at any given time. They even attacked a base frequented by American special forces in Syria, in an attempt to force the US into providing it. But when last month’s rickety ceasefire and intelligence sharing arrangement was put in place, requiring a greater commitment of American assets than Russian ones, it was almost certain the cooperative effort would fail fast and hard. It all comes down to priorities. Russia’s fundamental concept of operations in Syria doesn’t fit alongside the American-led coalition’s concept of operations. Major differences in the the quality of the targeting process, everything from who is considered a target and who is not, and how those targets are struck are simply insurmountable obstacles to overcome. For instance, Russia considers anyone opposing the Assad regime as a terrorist and employs unguided “dumb” munitions almost exclusively, even in urban areas–regardless of the potential for collateral damage. The US-led coalition sees the chance taking an innocent life as a major barrier to attacking most targets, and the coalition is operating under the tightest aerial rules of engagement ever devised . An Su-25 loaded with dumb bombs sits across the ramp from Russian Su-24 Fencers at Hemeimeem air base in Syria., AP The idea that the US would condone dumb-bomb strikes in urban areas and against targets it sees as non-enemy, if not friendly, was absurd. Furthermore, the fact that the US could potentially be called upon to help facilitate these strikes by sharing intelligence was unacceptable. Beyond just deconflicting flight schedules and possibly creating safe zones for the allied groups fighting for either side so safely operate in, the notion of US and Russian cooperation while persecuting targets in Syria was a farce. In essence, a diplomat’s bright idea and military commander’s worst nightmare. Before the intelligence sharing effort gained traction, the ceasefire that precluded it fell apart. Accusations of both sides not adhering to the deal came just hours after it began. Then, two separate air strikes set the ceasefire and the idea of military cooperation ablaze. US-Russian relations were quick to follow. The first of these incidents came on September 16th, with a series of US-led coalition air strikes on the embattled eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. The US planned an attack on ISIS positions near an air base on the outskirts of the besieged city, but Syrian troops had taken control of the base not long before the aircraft arrived overhead. The Russian military says it tried to contact the US twice on the hotline setup for such emergencies. The first call was answered by a person in the Combined Air Operations Center that couldn’t understand the Russian official, so they hung up. By the time the designated contact was found, much of the carnage had already occurred. It’s estimated that 62 Syrian soldiers were killed in the attack and hundreds more were wounded. Following this errant strike, Russia began lashing out against the US, stating publically that the the US and its coalition directly supports ISIS . Within a couple days of the attack, as accusations in the UN Security Council flew , the rickety ceasefire came crashing down when Russian and Syrian aircraft, as well as Assad’s ground forces, restarted their attack on Aleppo in a more aggressive manner than ever before. Secretary of State John Kerry in a heated exchange following the bombing of Syrian troops by US-led coalition aircraft., AP Around the same time, as US diplomats frantically tried to save the doomed ceasefire agreement, Russian Su-25s attacked a 30 vehicle humanitarian aid convoy near Aleppo, killing 20. The US had clearly informed Russia of the convoy’s planned route, but that did not keep the attack from commencing. After that, there was little chance the ceasefire could be salvaged, and fanciful ideas of US-Russian military cooperation in Syria have been washed away. Things have continued devolve in Syria, especially in the rebel stronghold of Aleppo. Russian and Syrian forces have encircled a large portion of the city, a place where an estimated 250,000 innocent people still reside. Airstrikes and artillery barrages have left a city that was already largely broken completely in ruins. No target has been left off Russian or Syrian target lists, including hospitals. Both Assad’s regime and Russia deny striking them on purpose, but over the last year, one after another, they have been hit. Then, just weeks ago, Russia’s ambassador to the UK admitted that hospitals are legitimate targets as rebels are using them along with civilians. A bombed-out semi full of humanitarian aid outside of Aleppo. , AP Russia’s uptick in bombing operations has resulted in a dissolution of Russian-American diplomatic ties, and a clear end to any dialogue over the Syrian issue, with the State Department saying that all formal ties between the two countries regarding Syria have officially been cut. On October 3rd, State Department spokesman James Kirby described the decision : “This is not a decision that was taken lightly. Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course, inconsistent with the Cessation of Hostilities, as demonstrated by their intensified attacks against civilian areas, targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the September 19 attack on a humanitarian aid convoy.” Russia has been pouring more fighting capabilities into the region, and it seems fairly clear a larger military operation is imminent. Russia has also announced that it will permanently control the airbase south of Latakia, where the majority of its aerial fighting force in Syria is based, and that it will permanently hold and expand its highly strategic, but previously leased naval base in Tartus. Ownership of these bases are prizes won from the Assad regime in return for stepping into the Syrian civil war on its behalf – a move that largely reversed the regime’s dire fortunes at the time. A permanent air base and port on the Mediterranean – one able to accept any ship or aircraft in Russia’s inventory – represents a massive strategic shift for the region. It also fits in perfectly with Putin’s designs to revive the Russian Navy and to wield influence, backed by military power, far from home. Now Russia’s only aircraft carrier, equipped with new and upgraded fighters in addition to helicopters, along with a Kirov class battlecruiser and other escorts , is on its way to the eastern mediterranean . Once on station, the armada will augment Russia’s land-based aircraft in the bombardment of Aleppo. The flotilla – the largest and most powerful since the end of the Cold War – will also send a message to NATO, and to other players in the region, that Russia’s ability to project devastating naval power abroad is now a reality. The Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's only aircraft carrier, is chugging its way toward Syria along with the largest Russian battle group assembled since the end of the Cold War. , AP As this piece is published, Russia’s flotilla in the North Sea and headed south. In just days it will be on scene off Syria’s coast, and Russia’s carrier battle group arrival there will likely coincide with the end of the unilateral ceasefire called by Russia and the Assad regime in Aleppo earlier this week. Russia says the ceasefire was put in place on “humanitarian grounds,” and has extended it through Friday – though it seems that another four days will likely be added. Corridors have been opened through which civilians can leave the city, and leaflets have been dropped stating that anyone who is not a rebel fighter should evacuate. This pause in fighting is likely the prelude to a massive offensive that will lay waste to Aleppo once and for all. Russia isn’t playing its cards close to its chest when it comes to its post-ceasefire plans. Franz Klintsevich, a senior member of Russia’s parliamentary defense committee has stated to Russian media that “after the humanitarian pause, the clearing operation begins.” The war-torn streets of Aleppo. , AP Cleansing Aleppo of all rebel fighters would be a massive win for the Assad regime as the northwestern Syrian city has long been the stronghold of anti-Assad rebel forces. Yet doing so will come at a horrific cost of human life as many innocent Syrians are likely to stay in the city. Just because roads are supposedly open for them to leave, that does not mean they have any place to go, nor do many families have the ability to travel on foot as so many have been wounded over a half decade of fighting in the city. The international community has taken notice of just how barbaric the last few weeks of Russian and Syrian government military operations have been in Aleppo. Secretary of State John Kerry has advocated investigating the Russian and Assad regime’s actions in Syria as war crimes, stating : “Russia and the regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals, and medical facilities, and children and women… These are acts that beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes, and those who commit these would and should be held accountable for these actions, this is a targeted strategy to terrorize civilians.” A Russian Ministry of Defense briefing showing an encircled Aleppo. , AP This sentiment is not Kerry’s alone, the EU has followed suit, now calls for increased sanctions against Russia, not just the Assad regime, are gaining favor. Theresa May, François Hollande and Angela Merkel have all stated that they are prepared to make a united stand against Russia’s actions in Syria. As in the US, this could include a new round of sanctions against Russia, a war crimes investigation, or even both. So what is the US to do? Will Washington sit back and watch Russia and Assad wipe Aleppo clean, or will we intervene in some way, outside of the now nearly non-existent diplomatic channels between the two countries? There has been lots of talk in Washington, and on the Presidential campaign trail for that matter, about the possibility of establishing no fly zones and safe havens for civilians in Syria. Yet the chances that the US and its coalition partners would execute such a strategy is highly unlikely as doing so will force a military showdown between the world’s two largest nuclear powers. In the past I have addressed how dangerous such a move would be, writing : “Aside from possibly a small no fly zone in Northeast Syria, where our own special forces are operating and an area Russia has little interest in as nothing there threatens the survival of the Assad Regime, setting up a large no fly zone over Syria would be akin to challenging Russia to a fight. As for safe zones for the Syrian Free Army, I doubt Russia would agree to that, quite the opposite actually. Basically a no fly zone over greater Syria, or any part of western Syria for that matter, is inviting a military confrontation between the U.S. and Russia, which is a very dangerous thing. I doubt few would agree Syria is worth a potential conflict with a country armed with thousands of nuclear weapons… Assad is barrel bombing his people. Russia supports Assad. Declaring a no fly zone to stymie such attacks means Russia’s combat aircraft in Syria would be grounded. The result of which is at best a military standoff with Russia, and at worst a military exchange that could and probably would, escalate very quickly. This is reckless and unrealistic policy. The old days when everything could be solved with a no fly zone are over.” And here : “A no-fly zone over Syria was an option to stop Assad from barrel bombing his own people and fighting back rebel forces with air power before the Russians showed up militarily. Declaring a no-fly zone over Syria now would be akin to the blockade of Cuba in 1962 . This tactic could start a war that might escalate to terrifying levels very quickly and would mean that Russia would largely have to capitulate their interests in Syria in order obey it. As far as we know, Russia’s primary goal in Syria is to prop up the Assad regime, so trying to get them to fly coordinates strikes against ISIS alone alongside a flimsy coalition would be of no interest to Moscow. Also, why would Russia ever follow a no-fly zone in the first place? They don’t even respect Turkey’s borders as it is. Even if the U.S. just took the eastern side of Syria and let Russia continue its campaign against anti-Assad forces in the western part of the country, what would this accomplish? Putin would claim the U.S. and its coalition were protecting ISIS by limiting Russia’s access to their territory in the eastern part of Syria and they would just up their attacks on anti-Assad rebels in the western, more developed part of Syria. In the end, a no-fly zone makes zero sense and would do nothing but invite a direct conflict with Russia. The proposition that getting rid of the Assad regime—which no matter how horrible and brutal it may be does have common interests with the U.S.-led coalition—is worth another World War would be laughable, if it were not so terrifying. It is also another reminder of how many politicians, President Obama included, do not understand the limits and even the consequences of the use of air power.” A Russian Su-24 with mission markings down its side seen before another mission over Syria., AP Putin has an uncanny knack for keeping the ball in the other guy’s court. In other words, he keeps his opponents in a reactionary state at all times. He will continue taking as much as he can and pushing his geopolitical boundaries as he knows that making him stop would mean the possibility of a devastating conflict and his massive nuclear stockpile gives him the ‘muscle’ to keep meddlers at bay. So far, Putin’s game theory has been spot-on, though there may be a point fast approaching where the US will have no choice but to put its foot own and draw a line in the sand. At which time the ball would be thrust into Putin’s court, which is unfamiliar territory since Russia’s invasion of Crimea nearly three years ago. The same ‘damned if you don’t but possibly way more damned if you do’ situation is manifesting itself in a wildly different way when it comes to Russia’s hacking and cyber espionage on US political institutions , voter rolls and even the cyber probing of American voting machines . In an unprecedented move, President Obama has come right out and accused Russia of being responsible for these pointed cyber attacks and for trying to influence the US Presidential election. James Clapper, and the head of the Department of Homeland Security, made a statement saying that the hacks “are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process” and that “based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.” Not only do these attacks attempt to tip the scales in a Presidential election, but in a greater sense they are an attack at the very core of American democracy. Instilling distrust in the political process comes right out of ex-KGB agent Putin’s hybrid warfare playbook, and over time it could have a real impact on how Americans view their political system. That one of the candidates, the same one that Moscow seems to back implicitly , also spews claims of massive election rigging – even though there is no evidence of it – does not help the situation. Putin has proven himself to be one step ahead of the US and its allies since the invasion of Crimea. , AP Undermining America’s political process, supposedly the envy of the world, through hacked party emails, weaponizing Wikileaks as a delivery system, even highlighting the electronic vulnerabilities of the voting system as a whole does not cause major change overnight. Instead, it’s an insidious tactic – one that slowly erodes the electorate’s confidence over time. It is also telling as to how much Putin and the Kremlin despise the US, and to what degree they’ll go to cause damage to America’s image as the safekeeper of democracy, both at home and abroad. The White House has made it clear that they will respond to these increasingly common hacks at the time of its choosing. By multiple accounts, the Obama Administration is considering its options . And really, they have to do something. Putin and his Kremlin cronies will just increase these types of attacks if there is no consequence for doing so. It all circles back to the possibility of a confrontation with Russia. If the White House were to decide to make a similar attack; one that exposes Russian corruption at the highest level of government, or if the NSA, CIA’s and Pentagon’s cyber warriors were to turn the lights off in Moscow for 24 hours – or even if the White House decides to do something more low-profile, like blind Russia’s radars along the country’s border with Europe, Russia could lash out with escalated attacks of its own. While this electronic battlefield seems less impactful than a physical one, should things escalate quickly, that may not be the case. Attacks on America’s power grid, financial sector, transportation systems and other critical infrastructure could cost many lives and disrupt massive amounts of commerce. Maybe most disturbing is that an exchange of fire with cyber weaponry would set a new and bleak precedent. One where cyber attacks could become a daily norm – a quiet war without the immediately bloody cost of traditional warfare, but a highly damaging one nonetheless. The Obama Administration could also leave America’s cyber weapons under lock and key, and push for another round of economic sanctions on Russia. If the US were successful in such an endeavor, those sanctions would undoubtedly hurt Russia’s already battered economy – though doing so may also play right into Putin’s hand. The relationship between Putin and Obama is chilly at best. , AP With Russia’s dwindling economy, Putin needs an enemy to rally nationalist sentiment around. The Russian people’s pitchforks are accustomed to pointing in one direction during times of strife, and getting them pointed toward an external enemy is far more appealing for Mr. Putin than the alternative. Blaming Russia’s ongoing fiscal nightmare on the US and its western allies provides Putin with an ideal vehicle in which to displace responsibility. Also, with a looming enemy abroad, one that is well known by those who were born before the fall of the Soviet Union, Putin’s heavy investment in weaponry and his costly excursions abroad can be justified. In the end, there is absolutely no doubt that the US has elaborate contingency plans for waging cyber warfare on its potential enemies, yet actually doing so, especially against a peer-state like Russia, could let the metaphorical cyber genie out of the bottle once and for all. So what’s the US to do? So far Washington has played a reactionary role in Putin’s plans for rebuilding the Russian Bear; but now the times of diplomacy and a “wait and see” attitude seem to have passed. If the US doesn’t stand up to Russia now, when it comes to the situation in Syria or Moscow’s cyber-level hybrid warfare on America’s democratic system, then our politicians will be kicking the can farther down the road, and the stakes will only increase over time. It’s astonishing to think that, 25 years after the end of the Cold War, President Obama’s last major military order as Commander In Chief may very well be his most perilous. If and when that order is given, thrusting the ball into Putin’s court for the first time in years, we will be truly entering uncharted territory.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 11, 2019",Whomp Over the Desert Floor in an AH-1Z Attack Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The AH-1Z Viper, the latest and greatest version of the venerable AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter, has performed exceptionally well overseas in the harsh combat conditions of Southeast Asia and from the steel decks of America’s “Gator Navy” since its introduction into service in 2010. Now you can get a feel of what it’s like to strap into the cockpit of a “Zulu” Cobra as it snakes its way across the desert floor with this awesome 360 video. This latest variant of the Cobra includes a long list of improvements over its Marine Corps predecessor, the AH-1W Super Cobra. These include a brand new four-bladed bearingless composite rotor system, updated drivetrain, redesigned stub wings with tip weapons stations and better crash damage resistance, and crew safety, among other refinements. Yet the biggest difference between the “Whisky” and the “Zulu” are sensors and avionics. The Viper is equipped with a fully integrated avionics system, including a glass cockpit and Top Owl advanced helmet-mounted displays that are coupled to the aircraft’s dual mission computers, GPS/INS navigation system, automatic flight control system, low-airspeed air data system, upgraded self protection suite, and the highly capable AN/AAQ-30 Target Sight System (TSS) . The front cockpit of the AH-1Z., Bell TSS supplies Viper crews with very high quality Electro-optical/TV and infrared video for targeting and surveillance, and this imagery can capture wide angles and very tight zooms. The sensor turret is also a capable laser designator, rangefinder and tracker, and is stabilized to an extreme degree, which is a great thing considering that helicopters basically beat the air into submission. The TopOwl Helmet and glass cockpit in particular are a far cry from the old heads up display and ‘steam gauges’ on the AH-1W: The AH-1Z, which can be manufactured new or reworked from old AH-1W airframes, has quite a bit of room for future growth. It can be equipped to carry a version of the Apache’s AN/APG-78 Longbow fire control radar system, called the Cobra Fire Control Radar, which would give the Viper a much more formidable punch against armor formations, especially in bad weather. Although the USMC has not integrated the system on their ‘Zulus,’ when equipped with it the AH-1Z can also employ the AGM-114L millimeter-wave radar guided Hellfire missile. AH-1Z with its tip rails holding a AIM-9M Sidewinder captive training round and a ACMI pod. , USN This combination of sensor and missile allows crews to locate dozens of targets and have them classified by the radar system in seconds. After that, a single AH-1Z crew can engage as many as 16 individual targets in a single “pop-up” volley of Hellfire missiles. When data-linked with other helicopters this number can be greatly expanded. Once again, this can happenusing just the radar system for detection, identification and targeting. Although this capability doesn’t have much merit for counter-insurgency operations, it certainly does in peer state warfare or for rapidly engaging multiple naval targets, like swarming small boats (even in poor weather conditions). A version of this system, one where the missiles lock on after launch, is slated to equip the Littoral Combat Ship . Zulu Cobra with fire control radar attached to its stub-wing tip station. Whereas the AH-64D Apache Longbow has its millimeter-wave radar mounted atop its rotor system, the AH-1Z has been tested with the radar attached to one of the helicopter’s wingtip pylons. In addition to Hellfire missiles, the Cobra can be equipped with 2.75 inch rockets, AIM-9M Sidewinders and external fuel tanks. It also retains the same 20mm cannon as the ‘Whisky’ variant. Electronic warfare pods, such as the highly dynamic Intreprid Tiger II , can also be carried by the AH-1Z. Another weapon that greatly increases the versatility of the AH-1Z are laser-guided rockets. These weapons, which have already proven to be highly effective on the battlefield , drastically increase the number of targets the ‘Zulu’ can engage with extreme precision. The small warheads on these rockets, paired with their high degree of precision, means they can be used in “danger close” situations where a Hellfire could not. One weapon that the AH-1Z cannot employ that the AH-1W could is the TOW missile , which is a negative in some ways as this weapon offered an amount of fine control that laser-guided missiles and rockets cannot. This included the ability to ‘turn corners’ to some degree. Along with the similarly upgraded UH-1Y ‘Venom’ version of the iconic Huey, these two choppers make up the basis for the USMC’s potent and ridiculously versatile light utility and light attack helicopter team. You can see this team in action in this awesome video: Aside from the USMC, the AH-1Z has only been ordered by Pakistan , although the prospects on future orders looks fairly promising . Japan in particular, which is looking for around 60 new attack helicopters , and already operates the locally assembled AH-1S Cobra variant, is very interested in the AH-1Z. The fact that the helicopter was built specifically to handle the harsh maritime environment makes it especially attractive considering Japan’s expanding helicopter carrier fleet.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 12, 2016",USS San Antonio Was Targeted During Anti-Ship Missile Barrage Last Week Off Yemen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Few new details have emerged surrounding the rash of attacks last week on US Navy vessels operating in the tight confines of the southern Red Sea. However, thanks to a Facebook post by the public affairs folks aboard the USS San Antonio (LPD-17) dated October 13, we now know that the amphibious transport dock ship was targeted in one of the anti-ship missile volleys as it transited through the area. The post reads: SAN ANTONIO Family and Friends: I would like to take a moment to express how proud I am of the men and women of the SAN ANTONIO Team for their exemplary performance during our recent transit through the Bab al-Mandeb strait. Allow me to reassure you that all of your Sailors and Marines are safe and doing well. All hands had a huge role in guaranteeing SAN ANTONIO’s safety throughout the transit. Words cannot express how much I appreciate each and every one of your Sailors and Marines. The transit was challenging and missiles were launched against the USS MASON and USS SAN ANTONIO. Our crew performed flawlessly in the defense of our ship. Per the Pentagon’s press release we will be ready and respond to any further threat to our ships and commercial traffic, as appropriate, and will continue to maintain freedom of navigation on the high seas. I am extremely proud to be the Commanding Officer of such an exceptional warship filled with exemplary Sailors and Marines. D.W. Nelson Commanding Officer USS SAN ANTONIO (LPD 17) The statement was made outside of any other official disclosure that USS San Antonio was involved in the attacks. Previously, the USS Mason and USS Ponce were the only ships identified as being targeted by anti-ship missiles fired by Houthi rebels from Yemen’s western shores. Since the ship is not part of small three-ship action group sent to the area following the successful strike of HSV-2 Swift , it seems as if USS Mason was escorting USS San Antonio through the increasingly dangerous waters around the Mandeb Strait. This would make sense, since LPD-17 class ships only have a RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles and decoys for close-in point defense against aerial threats. Sailors monitor the USS San Antonio's defensive systems in the ship's combat information center. , USN The San Antonio class was not always envisioned as being so dependent on the Navy’s Aegis combat system equipped destroyers and cruisers for protection. These ships are like a little militaries in a box, and outside of large scale amphibious operations, they can perform a ton of other missions, from counter-terrorism, to low-intensity warfare, to anti-piracy to disaster relief missions. The only problem is that when operating in medium- to high-threat environments they are vulnerable to aerial attacks, which don’t always emanate from traditional state actors. With this in mind, the design originally included two eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch systems . Each cell can be quad-packed with four RIM-166 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, which would give the ship a credible intermediate range aerial defense without requiring massive upgrades to the ship’s sensor suite. These cells can also be packed with RGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles , giving LPD-17 class ships considerable long-range striking capability. This could be used to support Marines working deep in enemy territory (likely carried there by the ship’s MV-22 Ospreys) or against any target that the Pentagon wishes to be struck, and would fit with the Navy’s greater strategic goal of distributed lethality. Early concept art of the LPD-17 class in action, including showing its bow mounted Mark 41 VLS in action., USN When it comes to this concept in relation to the San Antonio c lass, it means that whenever and wherever a ship of this type is sailing, beyond its traditional amphibious mission, it can be called upon to quickly launch strikes on any targets within a 1,000 mile radius of its location. This not only greatly increases the ship’s lethality, but it also offers greater utility to the Navy as a whole. For instance, say a Tomahawk equipped San Antonio class ship were executing anti-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa and a high-value terrorist leader was detected at a certain camp in Somalia, the Navy could look at what ship is nearby and regardless of its mission, it could be called upon to launch a Tomahawk at that target just as a cruiser or destroyer would. In essence, distributed lethality takes a platform agnostic approach to certain aspects of naval warfare and provides far more combat punch with same amount of active vessels. Many concepts have been built around evolved versions of the San Antonio class, including a ballistic missile defense ship , as well as installing the Aegis combat system on the next version of the design, dubbed the LX(R). Yet just making use of the space already designed into existing LPD-17 ships for a VLS system makes great sense as it will not only fit the distributed lethality playbook perfectly, but it will also allow LPD-17 class ships to operate more independently of their already over-tasked destroyer and cruiser counterparts. All the USMC's mainline helicopter force is represented on the deck of an LPD-17 in this shot. These ships are truly “a military in a box.”, USN Oddly enough, on the same day the message was published regarding attacks made on the USS San Antonio , the Navy admitted that they, along with the USMC, are now actively looking into equipping the class with Mark 41 VLS systems. Back to the situation in Yemen and the threat posed by Houthi rebel launched anti-ship missiles to ships sailing in the southern Red Sea, a 72 hour ceasefire has been agreed upon by both the Saudi-led coalition that backs the Yemeni government and the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The ceasefire will go into effect Wednesday night and can be extended indefinitely. Both parties are being pushed to enter direct negotiations for a permanent peace deal. If this agreement holds, it will hopefully mark an end to anti-ship missile attacks near the critically important Mandeb Strait.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 1, 2016",China’s J-20 Stealth Fighter Will Likely Look Like This At Its Air Show Debut,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s J-20 has been an internet star for half a decade. It first appeared in late 2010 in grainy photos taken from the fenceline at Chengdu Aircraft Industrial Group’s plant. It first flew just as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who long shorted China’s ability to put into operation such an aircraft, was meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing . Since then the jet has made clear progress, with apparent design changes occurring as the aircraft progressed from prototype to pre-production stages. Now the J-20 will follow in the footsteps of its simpler and smaller cousin, the stealthy J-31 , and be officially unveiled to the world at the biennial Zhuhai Air Show in Guangdong province . The J-20’s splinter style scheme is similar to those that have become popular with leading-edge Russian fighter aircraft, but the style has existed for decades in one form or another. American adversary support units have also adopted similar schemes to reflect Russia’s use of it. Although the J-20 is a remarkable accomplishment for China’s aerospace industry and military, looks can be deceiving. The aircraft clearly integrates a menagerie of design features stolen from the F-22 and F-35, likely a result of incessant hacking of US defense contractors and key human espionage operations. At the same time, it includes some fairly novel design elements of its own, such as the ability to deploy infrared homing missiles outside of its side weapons bays while still minimizing the aircraft’s overall radar signature. Still, its basic design is thought to have been obtained at least partially from the now defunct MiG1.42/1.44 program . Either way, these days a fighter aircraft is more about what lies beneath the surface, or what makes up their surfaces themselves, than just the jet’s shape and outward appearance. China still lags behind the US in the areas of avionics, radar absorbent material science , and, especially, engine technology. China’s aerial weapons, most notably its air-to-air missiles, are regarded as inferior to its western counterparts in certain ways as well. This is not to say they have not made giant leaps to improve these deficiencies in recent years. Yet the reality is that the J-20 does not have to be as capable as, say, the F-22 in some or any respects to represent a serious threat. This is especially true if China builds these aircraft in significant numbers. In any foreseeable conflict involving the US, China would be fighting as the home team, on or near their home turf, while American forces would be fighting in an expeditionary manner. One is much harder than the other, especially when fighting an enemy that occupies a large geographical area and has concentrated so heavily on building up its anti-access/area denial capabilities. This means that even in a war over, say, the Taiwan Strait, China will be able to field massive amounts of air power in a persistent manner, while the US will struggle to keep a handful of combat fighters over the battlefield. Not just that, but these fighters can only carry a limited amount of air-to-air missiles, and are dependent on being within a few hundred miles of very unstealthy and vulnerable tanker aircraft. America’s highly networked aerial forces also operate best when various support assets are present, including lumbering airborne early warning and control aircraft, flying battlefield connectivity nodes, and a whole menu of other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft. All of these are vulnerable to attack without a thick fighter counter-air screen in place. But even such a screen can fend off only so many incoming targets over a limited area, and China has the ability to overwhelm that force with a mix of very low-end aerial assets ( drones converted from surplus fighter planes , cruise missiles, etc) and very high-end assets (Su-35, J-11, J-20 etc)—and everything in between. During a Chinese aerial onslaught, some enemy aircraft are likely to leak through as America’s overwhelmed fighters assigned to the counter-air mission have their magazines run dry and fuel states diminished, leaving the critical support assets vulnerable to attack. China has taken America’s so called “tanker addiction” into account with the design of the J-20. The aircraft is likely not nearly as maneuverable as the F-22, and the maneuverability it has largely comes from low wing loading and its canard foreplanes, which likely increase its radar cross-section considerably and degrade its kinematic performance. But this jet is not really made to tangle with America’s top fighter. It is meant to range out over relatively long distances without tanker aircraft nearby and attack America’s air combat force where it hurts the most: its tankers, AWACs aircraft and other support aircraft. It is easier to take out a couple divisions of F-22s by taking out their tanker than taking them on directly, and China understands this well. The J-20 will also likely become armed with missiles tailored to its new role, including intermediate-range infrared-guided missiles that are capable of engaging aircraft with stealthy qualities, and medium to long-range anti-radiation missiles that can target American AWACs aircraft. The crazy thing is that in nearly six years, my analysis of the J-20 has remained the same. While some experts were calling the jet a bomber, I felt it was absolutely clear what China was building and why. It was an attack dog, bred to bite at the USAF’s achilles heel, its fighters’ addiction to support aircraft, namely tankers, not just another competing stealthy fighter. In the Spring of 2011 I wrote the following, among other things, about the J-20 ( you can read the whole article here ): “What the J-20 Black Eagle, as China refers to its new fighter, is not is an exact copy of anything. It is a semi-indigenous design that utilizes a tremendous amount of “lifted” concepts and technologies, but not a copy of a single weapon system as a whole, which is amazing. It is well-known that China has used human espionage in the past, learning many of the B-2 stealth bomber design secrets. Further, it is known that they stole terabytes of design information on the F-35 via hacking, much of which seems to be present in this aircraft design. There is also little doubt that they were able to examine the stealth Blackhawk tail lost in the Bin Laden raid and were surely allowed to take a sample of its prized radar absorbent material, one of the areas that China is known to be lacking in the most. So yes China has no doubtingly stolen intellectual property to build this machine, but they did not copy one design as a whole, which is an accomplishment in itself. When it comes to capability this author believes China was absolutely brilliant in their design philosophy. The fighter is much larger than the F-22 for good reason, I believe this aircraft is very similar in concept to the YF-23, the loser to the F-22 during the ATF competition. The YF-23 was not as maneuverable as the F-22 but it was very fast and it had much more internal volume for gas. It was as much an interceptor as it was a fighter, whereas the F-22 could out-turn anything in the sky but it would be running its tanks empty fairly quickly in the process. Here is why this is brilliant: The Chinese know they cannot outperform our F-22 in any respect, but what the J-20 lacks in relative speed (it can probably still supercruise just closer to mach 1 as opposed to mach 2), stealth and most importantly maneuverability it makes up for in gas. In a conflict over Taiwan our aircraft would be forced to fly enormous distances using very unstealthy tankers and supporting command and control aircraft. So although the F-22s are invisible their tankers and support aircraft are not. Plus the F-22 requires fuel often, making it have to run back and forth to the tanker to stay on station and with only 187 examples planned this would only leave a handful, maybe a few dozen deployable for combat operations at any given time. Other US tactical aircraft would be operating from aircraft carriers, which are now vulnerable do to Chinese anti ship ballistic missiles. So what China did was they built an aircraft that could swarm or evade a thin line of thirsty F-22, destroy any non stealth platforms such as the F-15C and the F/A-18E/Fs if it had to, in effect breaking through to US support assets, mainly the vulnerable tankers and AWACS. It is much easier to shoot down the F-22s tankers and AWACS than the F-22s themselves. If you break America’s netcentric information flow you confuse and blind the fighter force to a degree. If you take out our tankers, you in effect shoot down the whole thirsty fighter force on station at the time. In other words the J-20’s genius is not in its stealth or maneuverability, it’s in its range and persistence, able to loiter for long periods of time and poke holes in the US’s tanker dependent defense. Further I believe this aircraft will have a secondary strike capability very similar to the F-22. It would be a very useful weapon in hitting command in control targets or air defense nodes using both direct and standoff weapons. Further, although the J-20 is advanced it surely does not cost the hundreds of millions of dollars that an F-22 does, so they would be, to a limited degree, expendable. This is a relevant strategy that balances capability and cost with acceptable expendability. This also makes sense as China’s avionics are not on par with the US, especially when it comes to AESA radar technology and sensor fusion, so there is a capability differential here that will result in lopsided losses. But remember it is about breaking through to the support assets not about taking the US fighter forces on directly, so planned attrition is a relevant tactic here. In the end yes China’s ingenuity is startling, whether this is a pre-production aircraft or even a technology demonstrator, but what is even more surprising is the brilliant strategy behind this machine’s design and even more startling is how apparent its mission appears to be…” Now, as we’ve entered the latter half of the decade, we are likely to see China declare the J-20 operational by 2018 and begin churning them out in significant quantities. In fact, many believe the aircraft has already entered low-rate initial production (LRIP). With years of developmental testing under its belt, and having just completed testing in the high elevations around Tibet , the jet will continue its development evolution as it hits China’s flight test centers as well as the front lines. But above all, China will have its operational stealth fighter—and an impressive one at that—formally introduced to the world on November 1st in Zhuhai.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 10, 2016",USS Mason Attacked For A Third Time While US Pushes Saudi Arabia On Ceasefire,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Alarm bells rang once again in the Combat Information Center aboard the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Mason currently patrolling the southern Red Sea. The ship’s Aegis combat system had detected what looked like inbound anti-ship cruise missiles. The Mason supposedly fired a volley of its own missiles and launched countermeasures to fend off the attack, although it’s unclear if those missiles intercepted anything at all. The event marked the third attack on USS Mason and nearby USS Ponce in just one week, and comes after USS Nitze , the third ship in the US Navy’s pocket armada patrolling near the Mandeb Strait, fired three RGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles at surface surveillance radar sites on Yemen’s western shore. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels occupy roughly the western quarter of Yemen, and control all the areas where anti-ship missiles have been fired from in recent weeks. So far, these missiles have only found their mark once, destroying HSV-2 Swift , a high-speed logistics catamaran that once belonged to the US Navy. At the time of the attack, the ship was operated by the UAE and had been making runs around the region in support of the coalition of Sunni Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, that are combating Houthi rebels in Yemen. Word of Saturday’s third attack came as the America’s first DDG-1000 Zumwalt class stealth destroyer was being commissioned, with Chief of Naval Operations stating : “There’s been recent activity today, the USS Mason appears to have come under attack in the Red Sea again by coastal defense cruise missiles fired from the coast of Yemen. So as you know, this is the third such attack . . . The Mason and Nitze have everything they need to defend themselves from these attacks and respond when needed. So I’m very proud of the crews, they’ve done a terrific job . . . It’s another thing that just shows you, this is dangerous business . . . When we send our sailors overseas, we have got to send them with the absolute very best, because it’s dangerous over there.” The irony in this statement is that USS Zumwalt and its two sister ships under construction, USS Michael Monsoor and USS Lyndon B. Johnson , will not be equipped with anywhere near the counter-air capabilities that America’s Arleigh Burke class destroyers possess. At the same time, during a peer-state conflict they will be called upon to fight much closer to enemy defenses, namely in the littoral environments like where USS Mason is deployed now. Auch an enemy will be far better equipped when it comes to anti-ship capabilities than the Houthi rebels. USS Zumwalt during its commissioning ceremony., youtube screencap Meanwhile, the US has been pushing Saudi Arabia to move forward with a comprehensive ceasefire in Yemen, one that would supposedly be adhered to by the embattled Yemeni government and Houthi rebels, as well as all the external players backing both sides. Just hours ago, it appears that this pressure has worked, as Saudi Arabia has agreed to adhere to the deal if the other side does as well. In the past 18 months or so since the Yemeni civil war erupted, all ceasefire attempts have failed. But after the aerial bombing of a civilian funeral near Sana’a that killed throngs of innocent people and injured hundreds more—an incident that was seemingly abhorred by both sides—this latest ceasefire deal may have a chance of bringing both sides to the negotiating table. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, left, is greeted by British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson ahead of a meeting on the situation in Syria in London, AP While meeting with US and UK officials in London the following Monday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubei told reporters : “We would like to see a ceasefire yesterday. Everybody wants a ceasefire in Yemen, nobody more so than the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the coalition members . . . We come at this with a lot of cynicism. But we are prepared, the Yemeni government is prepared, to agree to a cessation of hostilities if the Houthis agree to it. The coalition countries will respect the desire of the Yemeni government.” Even with their current level of support from Tehran, the Houthis are losing ground in Yemen. They face a wealthy coalition armed with high-tech military gear. It is only a matter of time until they are beaten territory-wise, but that doesn’t mean an even more deadly insurgency won’t continue. At the same time, more American and Iranian military might is pouring into the region, and the possibility of a wider conflict—one involving the US directly—looms. Additionally, the eastern half of Yemen continues to be a major operating area for Al Qaeda On The Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and the country will eventually have to deal with that if it ever really wants to enjoy peace. How the attacks on US ships over the last week fit into all this is debatable. But unless you buy into the possibility that these strikes have been rebels lashing out at their own accord, then they do have a place in a larger strategy. Whether or not negotiating a ceasefire—or a potential end to the conflict as a whole—is part of that strategy remains unclear.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 9, 2018",USAF F-16s Deploy From Italy To The Horn Of Africa As Region Simmers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. African Command has noted that F-16CMs from the 31st Fighter Wing , based at Aviano Air Base in Italy, have arrived at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. The deployment, supported by KC-135R tankers from RAF Mildenhall, was said to be in response to increased threats to American lives in South Sudan. But now, in light of the recent events in Red Sea , those F-16s and their very close proximity to Yemen have taken on greater significance. For over a decade, Camp Lemonnier has hosted American aircraft, including drones, transports, surveillance, special operations and maritime patrol aircraft, even small contingents of fighters and attack helicopters have spent time at the airfield. It has even been home to aircraft whose ownership could not be readily identified. During America’s anti-Al Qaeda operations above Yemen, unmanned and manned fighter aircraft alike executed pinpoint strikes on high-value targets allied with the terror group . Since the Yemeni civil war began , and with a new drone base going operational in Saudi Arabia just miles from Yemen’s northern border, these operations out of Camp Lemonnier have tapered off, while operations over Africa have picked up. The base has been under constant expansion since Americans arrived and until recently it featured very tight quarters for aircraft temporarily deployed there. The construction of a massive new apron on the east end of the base was completed in early 2015, greatly increasing the installation’s ability to sustain larger deployments of tactical aircraft and their support aircraft. Camp Lemonnier with the new disperal on the far east side, near the ocean, complete. , Google Earth With the arrival of F-16s and tankers in the theatre, the African outpost has seriously upped its offensive capability. And that capability may very well be needed in for two international flash-points, not just one. Stars And Stripes reports that the deployment came at the direct request of the State Department in response to growing unrest in the South Sudanese capital of Juba. The F-16s, along with special operations support helicopters and combat teams could rapidly respond to any scenarios that threaten US installations and personnel in the country. This could include a full evacuation of American citizens from South Sudan. Just last week 60 people died in clashes between the government and rebel forces , and it seems a full-scale civil war could erupt at any moment. Last July, after US diplomatic vehicles were fired upon, President Obama ordered 50 troops and a bevy of support assets into the region to partially evacuate the US embassy in Juba, as government tanks rolled through the streets and helicopter gunships orbited overhead. Many of those same assets have stayed in the region, and are now further augmented by the Vipers from Aviano. An Aviano based Block 40 F-16., USAF Just to the north of Camp Lemonnier is another hotspot, one where the US has recently become involved in the shooting. On Wednesday the US Navy destroyer USS Nitze fired three Tomahawk cruise missiles at surface surveillance radar sites positioned along Yemen’s Red Sea coast. The strike was in retaliation to two separate series of anti-ship missile attacks on USS Mason and USS Ponce , both of which are patrolling the waters near the strategic Mandeb Strait along with USS Nitze. The American flotilla’s presence off Yemen was spurred by the successful attack by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on the UAE operated HSV-2 Swift , a high-speed logistics ship that once belonged to the Navy. Now, in response to USS Nitze’s fairly benign retaliatory strike on the rebel controlled radar sites , Iran has deployed a frigate and support ship to the region. What these ships intend to do once on station remains somewhat unclear. Although the Obama Administration clearly does not want to get into another bombing campaign in the Middle East, the Pentagon has made it clear that if there are any more threatening acts against their ships they would retaliate , and would likely do so in an overwhelming way. There have been rumors that Houthi rebel boats that have been used as spotters for anti-ship missile attacks and for harassing vessels transiting the Strait will be on the next retaliatory target list, along with the missiles themselves, USS Nitze and another Arleigh Burke class destroyer on patrol. , USN These types of strikes are more suited for airpower than traditional naval power. Even Wednesday’s attacks on the radar sites could have been better served by F-16s than cruise missiles. Now that these jets are based just 225 miles from Al Hudaydah, where much of the anti-ship missile activity has supposedly been emanating from, they would likely be used in another round of reprisal strikes. Still, having a ship from the same flotilla of Navy vessels that were attacked respond with force has its own deterrence value. Now we will have to wait and see if any other American military hardware shows up in the region, and if Houthi rebels will brave yet another anti-ship missile attack on a vessel transiting or patrolling the area.

The strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi rebel controlled radar sites came in response to multiple anti-ship attacks on US warships patrolling the Red Sea near the Mandeb Strait. Reports suggest that the two ships Iran has sent into the theatre are the Alvand and the Bushehr . The nearly 50 year old Alvand is the first in her class of four similar frigates, all built in the UK. Three remain in service and one was sunk by the US Navy during the Tanker Wars of the 1980s. Her main armament consists of the same C-802 / Noor anti-ship missiles suspected to have been used in the recent attacks in the Red Sea. She also has a 4.5 inch gun, various smaller guns, and is capable of anti-submarine operations with mortars and six torpedo tubes. The Iranian Moudge class frigate is a larger, indigenously built version of the Alvand class. Alvand traversing the Suez Canal., AFP/Getty Images Bushehr is a 4,500 ton displacement Bandar Abbas class supply ship. She was also built 45 years ago in Germany and only carries minimal defensive armament, although it seems as if the ship is used for patrols as well as resupplying Iranian surface combatants and conveying cargo. A helicopter hangar enclosure can be seen on the ship’s flight deck, and it appears to be capable of housing a single helicopter. Bushehr seen while in port. Iran’s exact goal in deploying these ships is unclear. The two vessels are supposedly going to patrol the Gulf of Aden, located on the eastern side of the Mandeb Strait. The US Navy vessels that have been attacked in recent days were patrolling on the opposite side of the strait, in the southern end of Red Sea. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Nitze– the same ship that fired the three Tomahawk cruise missiles last night–may be operating in the Gulf of Aden, as its location in the region over the last few days remains unclear. Semi-official Iranian state news agency Tasnim has stated that the Iranian ships will “protect trade vessels.” Whether this is an attempt to mirror the US mission in the region or if this is a sign that Iran will attempt a resupply convoy is unclear. A similar showdown occurred a year and a half ago , with a US Carrier Strike Group staring down an inbound Iranian naval convoy. The Iranians turned around and the possibility of armed conflict was avoided. Iran has sent flotillas into the area on anti-piracy missions in the past, but that seems to have nothing to do with this latest deployment.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 2, 2020",The Navy Is Quietly Arming Its Supercarriers With Anti-Torpedo Torpedoes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The danger posed to Navy surface combatants by submarines is rapidly expanding around the globe . Spurred by leaps in Air Independent Propulsion technologies , even small and relatively inexpensive AIP equipped diesel-electric subs can be as quiet their nuclear counterparts and still stay submerged for weeks at a time. The proliferation of this technology–as well as expanding fleets of Chinese and Russian fast attack nuclear submarines–have made America’s nuclear supercarriers vulnerable to attack despite a multi-layered defensive umbrella. This umbrella includes a host of aerial and surface defenses, from long-range missiles and manned aircraft, to the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile and Mk15 Phalanx close in weapons systems . A carrier’s submarine defenses use a similar layered approach, though historically they have lacked a close-in defensive system capable of countering incoming torpedoes. Currently a carrier’s submarine defenses includes cruisers, destroyers and even Littoral Combat Ships, each equipped with sonars and torpedo systems. Supercarriers also travel with a small armada of sub-hunting MH-60R Seahawk helicopters , deployed on the carrier and its escorts. Even land-based P-3C and P-8A sea control aircraft support Carrier Strike Groups, and those airborn assets are being equipped with ever more capable weaponry for attacking prowling subs . Yet, among all of those heavy hitters, the Carrier Strike Group’s most potent anti-submarine weapon might be the nuclear fast-attack submarines assigned to it. MH-60R Seahawk helicopters over an Arleigh Burke Flight IIA destroyer., Lockheed Martin Still, even under the umbrella of all these defenses the centerpiece of the Carrier Strike Group, the carrier itself, is still vulnerable to submarine attacks . A single lucky shot could have horrific consequences for the ship, its crew, and even the world’s geopolitical balance. So, what happens when a submarine is able to take a pot shot at a carrier, and its torpedo is in the water barreling towards the ship? Decoys can be quite effective at confusing incoming acoustic homing torpedos, but they don’t offer a “hard kill” capability, where the torpedo is physically destroyed or disabled before it can detonate dangerously close to the ship. Wake-homing torpedoes offer an even more complicated tactical scenario for American and allied surface combatants, and especially massive carriers. A Type 53 torpedo. , BrokenSphere/wikicommons Russia’s Type 53 torpedo and–its export variants in particular–possess a troubling attack profile for American carriers. They can be fired from over a dozen miles away and home in on the wake churned up by a ship. During their terminal attack phase, they ping-pong back and forth across a wake in an ‘S’ pattern until detonating in close proximity to the ship’s fantail. Acoustic decoys have no affect on this type of torpedo, and the bigger the wake, the easier the target is to successfully engage. The Type 53 can be fired by cheap and plentiful Russia Kilo class diesel-electric submarines , which are used by the vast majority of the US Navy’s potential opponents. In the Navy’s search for a close-in torpedo defense system, they wanted to address wake-homing torpedos. As such, not only would a way to detect incoming torpedoes have to be fielded as part of this holistic system, but a way to destroy them before they’re close enough to the ship to do serious damage would also have to be developed. Enter the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD). SSTD system overview., USN SSTD, which was developed fairly rapidly over the last decade, is a combination of systems that work together to defend the carrier (and eventually other smaller surface combatants) against torpedo attacks. It includes three major components. The first is a towed array acoustic sensor system called the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) that does just as it says, it detects an incoming torpedo. This sensor is trailed off a carrier’s fantail, so it’s particularly well suited for detecting incoming wake-homing torpedoes. This towed array is tied to tactical control stations that provide early warning, threat classification amd course of action advice to the ship’s Combat Information Center and bridge. The third and final component of SSTD is the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT). USN The CAT, which has been developed by Pennsylvania State University Applied Research Laboratory, is analogous to the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile CIWS, but instead of anti-ship missiles or fast-attack boats, it targets targets incoming torpedoes. A miniature torpedo in its own right, CAT provides a rapidly deployable kinetic “hard kill” solution to use against torpedo threats. In other words, it can be launched in an instant, then it homes in on the enemy torpedo and destroys it through proximity detonation and/or collision. In simpler terms it is a torpedo interceptor. CAT’s design is flexible and future versions could also act as decoys for certain enemy torpedo types, leading them away from the carrier (or whatever the launching ship may be) before detonation. CAT cutaway view. , USN CATs are installed in self-contained launch containers attached to a multi-cell launch system. These systems are placed around a ship, similar to other CIWS systems, and are launched on remote during an attack. It may sound like a concept, but this system is already deployed and operating; the Navy has quietly fielded it on half of America’s supercarriers. The first test unit was installed aboard the USS George H.W. Bush in 2013. During these initial carrier-borne tests, SSTD was launched against and intercepted seven target torpedoes. The trials proved that the whole system as an integrated unit worked and since then many improvements have been made. Now, just a few years later, USS Nimitz , which just came out of an extended overhaul period, is the 5th supercarrier equipped with the modular system . CAT being launched from a supercarrier. , USN Eventually the Navy plans on fitting all its major surface combatants with SSTD, with a target date of 2035 to accomplish that goal. It will be interesting to see if the Navy attempts to integrate the system aboard the stealthy Zumwalt class , a ship which will by very nature of its mission be prowling in submarine infested waters. Then again, they may not even attempt to such an installation at all, just as they have omitted a traditional CIWS from its design. In the meantime America’s carriers will continue to be outfitted with these new torpedo defenses as they receive major service and upgrades. It’s very likely “Gator Navy” LHDs and LHAs will be next. Having a torpedo close in weapon system (CIWS) is quite the accomplishment for the US Navy. When combined with advanced expendable and towed decoys, the system should provide a fairly robust and much needed last line of submarine defense for America’s largest and most expensive weapon systems.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 12, 2016",Tomahawk Cruise Missiles Pummel Houthi Controlled Radar Sites In Yemen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The US Navy’s three ship pocket flotilla in the southern Red Sea retaliated against Houthi rebels who had slung four anti-ship missiles at the USS Mason and USS Ponce on two separate occasions in just three days. A week before firing on the US Navy vessels, the UAE-operated high-speed logistics ship HSV-2 Swift was destroyed in a similar attack . Three RGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) were fired from the USS Nitze at 4AM local time on Thursday morning at three separate Houthi-controlled radar sites along Yemen’s west coast. According to the US Navy, all three targets were obliterated in the operation. A Pentagon press release states: “Early this morning local time, the U.S. military struck three radar sites in Houthi-controlled territory on Yemen’s Red Sea coast. Initial assessments show the sites were destroyed. The strikes — authorized by President Obama at the recommendation of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joseph Dunford — targeted radar sites involved in the recent missile launches threatening USS Mason and other vessels operating in international waters in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb. These limited self-defense strikes were conducted to protect our personnel, our ships, and our freedom of navigation in this important maritime passageway. The United States will respond to any further threat to our ships and commercial traffic, as appropriate, and will continue to maintain our freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandeb, and elsewhere around the world.” These strikes represent a fairly unique use of the Tomahawk cruise missile. During most operations, these weapons travel over medium and long distances before realizing their deadly endgame. In the tight confines of the southern Red Sea, it’s likely the missiles traveled dozens miles, not hundreds of miles, before reaching their targets. TLAM attacking a simulated radar site. , Raytheon Destroying coastal radar systems which can provide initial targeting data–and in some cases mid-course updates–to anti-ship cruise missiles does not necessarily mean the threat from these weapons has been nullified. Most modern anti-ship missiles, like the C-802 suspected to have been used in these attacks, can be launched toward an area where enemy naval activity is thought to be. Once there, the missile will switch on its own radar (and/or infrared and RF emissions homing sensors) and then prosecute an attack on any contact it finds. As such, the only way to really eliminate the threat posed by these weapons is to destroy the missiles themselves. Such a task can be a tall order, as shore-based anti-ship missiles can me moved around and hidden from overhead view with relative ease. Actually eliminating them with some certainty would require persistent real-time surveillance of the Yemeni coast, as well as strike aircraft readied and waiting in the immediate area. This represents a large and fairly expensive commitment of aircraft to a conflict that the US is not directly involved with. Alternatively, unmanned aircraft can be sent to scan the coastline and if they get lucky, they can attempt a quick strike with their Hellfire missiles or 500lb laser guided bombs. Either way, these aircraft have a base of operations close by in Djibouti. In limited cases, one of the destroyers could use their five inch guns to hit a missile being readied for launch, but that would require the ship be at least within a dozen miles of the coastline, and it would require a third party targeting source such as an unmanned aircraft. Alternatively, MH-60Rs based on the both destroyers deployed to the area are also capable of being armed with Hellfire missiles. These aircraft could fly along the coast hunting for these weapons, although doing so could risk them being engaged by man portable air defense systems (MANPADS) –and these missiles can be launched from inland positions as well. AH-64 operating aboard USS Ponce while the ship was positioned in the Persian Gulf. , USN USS Ponce has the ability to operate more hardened attack helicopters from her deck, and even AH-64 Apaches have used the ship for training while in the Persian Gulf. A detachment of these aircraft, or AH-1Z Vipers, could put their unique capabilities to use for such a hunt. Right now it’s likely the Pentagon is hoping no such campaign will ever have to be launched. Clearly, blowing up these radar sites sends a strong message to the Houthi rebels and their Iranian backers. Then again there may be much more to these attacks than just some rebels taking pot-shots at gray warships. Only time will tell. We will keep this post updated as more info comes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remains scarce, but the Washington Post reports there has been yet another missile attack on the USS Mason. Thankfully the missile did not hit its target, though the report states that the ship did deploy ‘countermeasures’ during the engagement. This could  have included the ship firing its own weapons, as well as expendable decoys and electronic attacks on the missile. The US Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer has been patrolling the Southern tip of the Red Sea with two other US Navy vessels–a destroyer and one forward staging base–since shortly after the UAE-flagged high-speed logistics vessel HSV-2 Swift was destroyed by a missile attack . USS Mason and its flotilla were previously attacked on Sunday by a pair of anti-ship missiles, with the destroyer firing three surface-to-air missiles and an advanced decoy in self defense. Whether or not USS Mason’s missiles and countermeasures actually downed missiles, or if they both crashed on their own accord, is still being investigated. This latest attack is said to have come from the same Iranian-backed Houthi rebel-held territory on Yemen’s west coast as the missile attacks on Swift and USS Mason and companions. The Navy has already said that they are looking at retaliating following the failed attack, and are currently going through the targeting process in an effort to do so. Reuters reports that rebels are using small fast boats to help direct the attacks and the Pentagon is looking into the possibility that a radar station is being used by Houthi rebels to detect and target USS Mason and her companions for anti-ship missile attacks. If that is the case don’t expect that station to be intact for long. This follow-on attack points to the possibility that an entirely new strategy is in play in the region , one that could dramatically affect the geopolitical situation in the Middle East, as well as world trade. It’s likely that Iran is supplying these missiles to Houthi rebels, and unlikely that the rebels are given a blank check when it comes to who to use them on and when. UPDATE- 5:13PM PST : Two anti-ship missiles were involved in the attack today, just like on Sunday. They were fired at USS Ponce and USS Mason, the latter of which is providing protection for USS Ponce.

Sunday’s anti-ship missile attack on USS Mason while it patrolled the southern Red Sea was much more “lively” than previously thought. In total, the destoryer launched two SM-2 Standard surface-to-air missiles and an Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) during the engagement. It also popped off Nulka decoys . USNI News reports that during the attack, USS Mason was actually defending, or at least partially defending, USS Ponce , the Navy’s converted Austin class landing dock ship that serves as a forward-deployed counter-mine and special operations sea base. USS Ponce is one of the three US Navy ships (two destroyers and USS Ponce ) that were sent to the region following the successful anti-ship missile attack on the UAE-operated HSV-2 Swift high-speed logistics catamaran. https://youtube.com/watch?v=M07d9MximlQ It remains unclear if the first anti-ship missile was destroyed by the surface-to-air missiles fired from USS Mason, or by its electronic countermeasures and decoys, or if it went awry on its own. The second missile did impact the water of its own accord. An after-action investigation is currently underway, which will hopefully fill in the picture as to what exactly occurred near the Strait of Mandeb on Sunday—and if the first missile was indeed swatted out of the sky by the Arleigh Burke class destroyer. This is definitely the first time a RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile has been used during a combat situation, and it is likely the first time a modernized version of the SM-2 has been put to use in a real-world scenario. The only other time I can remember an SM-2 being used was when an SM-2MR fired by the USS Vincennes mistakenly shot down an Iranian Airbus A300 during the Flight 655 incident in 1988 . As such, this engagement will likely be studied in great detail for some time to come. https://youtube.com/watch?v=H61d_OkIht4 Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have denied that they were responsible for the attack on the US flotilla on Sunday, even though the missile came from territory they control, and the US Navy ships were operating in the same area where Swift was so badly struck; Houthi rebels did claim responsibility for that attack. The Navy is making it clear that they will seek revenge for the attempted strike, with Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis stating today that “anybody who takes action, fires against U.S. Navy ships operating in international waters, does so at their own peril. We’re going to find out who did this and we will take action accordingly.” He added that analysts are actively working to discern who is responsible for the attack before any counter-attack is ordered. As for Iran’s connection in all this, Davis remarked: “It’s not a secret that Iran has been actively supplying them and giving them the tools of war.” So what’s going on here? Are Houthi rebels, now equipped with heavy weapons like anti-ship cruise missiles, just firing at any target of opportunity? Is Iran trying to pull the US into yet another conflict in the Middle East? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the ongoing conflict in Syria has reaches new levels of peril, Russia appears to be pouring combat capability back into the region –with a special focus on fielding sea-based air combat capabilities. As part of this initiative, two of the Russian Navy’s most modern vessels, both Buyan-M class guided missile corvettes, have made their way from the Black Sea into the Mediterranean. Buyan-M class corvettes may be relatively small but they are heavily armed and capable of firing Kalibr land attack cruise missiles which have a range approaching 1,500 miles. The missile type, roughly analogous to earlier versions of the RGM-109 Tomahawk, first saw operational use last year when Russia fired a salvo into Syria from their Caspian Sea fleet. Buyan M class corvette. , Russian MoD Now news comes that a third Russian surface combatant has passed through the Bosphorus Strait and into the Mediterranean, this one a Nanuchka-III class corvette. The three combat ships will join a Admiral Grigorovich class frigate, a Krivak -class frigate, and a minesweeper, as well as bunker ships and repair vessels that are already operating off the Syrian coast. Other Russian transport and amphibious ships have also been spotted heading towards the Mediterranean over the last two weeks–many of which appeared heavily laden with military equipment as they made their way past Istanbul. Meanwhile, Russia’s only Mediterranean port in Tartus, Syria–probably the biggest factor that influencing Russia’s decision to prop-up the Assad regime after the Syrian Civil War began– has received a major defensive upgrade . Just last week the installation of an S-300 air defense system in Tartus was announced. The S-300’s reach will overlap with the existing S-400 air defense battery located at Russia’s Hmeimim Air Base located just 35 miles north of Tartus. Port of Tartus, Syria., Google Earth Obviously, ISIS and anti-Assad rebels do not have aircraft that Russia would need to defend against. As such, the deployment of the S-300 system to Tartus is aimed at protecting Russian assets from a hypothetical attack by the US or its NATO allies. Or, at least, the deployment of the SAM system creates the illusion that such a thing could occur. The S-300’s arrival in Tartus also marks what could be the first building blocks in an advanced integrated air defense system that could pose a major threat to US-led coalition aircraft operating over and near Syrian airspace. Then again, that S-300 battery in Tartus will likely have something very scarce to protect in the not so distant future. Russia’s only aircraft carrier–the notoriously unreliable Admiral Kuznetsov –is supposedly in the final preparation stage before sailing south from its frigid home at Severomorsk to the eastern Mediterranean. Once on station it will actively support Russia’s Syrian campaign. The much-touted deployment of the Admiral Kuznetsov will include a newly configured air wing with more advanced air combat capabilities than in the past. Originally it seemed as if Russia’s new MiG-29KR (well kind of new) multi-role fighters would be the carrier’s lone fixed-wing fighter for the deployment, with the ship’s massive and antiquated Su-33s being put to pasture. This is now clearly not the case. Russia has executed a light upgrade of a portion of the tiny Su-33 fleet, which includes some modernized avionics and possibly the addition of the SVP-24 system , which helps improve accuracy of dumb bombs–the vast majority of air-to-ground weapons used on Syrian targets by Russian aircraft. While it’s an improvement on previous targeting systems, this new-found accuracy is not even remotely comparable to any modern guided air-to-ground munitions. These Su-33s also appear to have been overhauled mechanically and feature new paint. Admiral Kuznetsov will likely sail with examples of both the Su-33 and the MiG-29KR stuffed into its tight hangar deck. The carrier’s air wing will also feature the debut of Russia’s navalized KA-52K attack helicopters. These are some of the most advanced aircraft in the Russian inventory, they’re expected to fight alongside their land-based cousins which have been deployed to Syria since last March . The KA-52K differs from the standard variant, with folding rotor blades and a more advanced navigation system optimized for shipboard operations. Its avionics are on par–if not better than–the systems flown on the latest land-based KA-52s. The KA-52K was originally developed for Russia’s French-built Mistral class amphibious assault ships. These vessels were never delivered following the geopolitical implosion between the west and Russia after the invasion of Crimea and shadow war in eastern Ukraine. Egypt bought the ships instead , and have purchased KA-52Ks and other equipment from Russia to outfit them with. With this in mind, and with the increasingly tight relationship between Russia and Egypt , there is a very good chance that Russia could end up operating from Mistral class carrier decks after all–albeit at the invitation of the Egyptian Navy. Like all things Syrian air war, Russia will use the world stage to showcase its MiG-29KR and KA-52Ks to potential export customers –and will leave the theatre with the ability to call the systems “combat proven.” It’s like developmental range testing and customer demonstrations–but with real people as targets. In all, UPI reports that Admiral Kuznetsov’s air wing will include “15 Su-33 and MiG-29K/KUB fighter jets, as well as more than 10 Ka-52K, Ka-27 and Ka-31 helicopters” which is probably fairly accurate. Tartus has supported Admiral Kuznetsov many times over the decades, including fairly recently, so there’s no reason why the ship wouldn’t use the port now–especially considering the facility is now protected under the S-300 and S-400’s air defense umbrella. And it won’t just be the Admiral Kuznetsov visiting. Russia is going to make their leased port in Tartus a permanent operating location , with surface combatants constantly based there. This is likely part of Russia’s deal with Assad for helping to keep his regime afloat–alongside the possession of Russia’s growing airbase south of Latakia. Moscow is also eyeing Cuba and Vietnam to provide a similar constant presence in the Caribbean and in the South China Sea. Under this new focus on turning Tartus into a major operating facility, not just a support base; upgrades and an expansion of the installation are planned. These include the addition of the nearest major dock area, just south of the existing Russian-leased dock. This new dock is capable of receiving large vessels. In the past Syria had to make special accommodations for Russia to use the facility, now Russia will control their piece of the port directly. Other enhancements to Russia’s anti-submarine, communications and surveillance capabilities will be made to the installation as well. As it sits, the arrival of the S-300 battery in Tartus is likely the first building block for this new strategy–and Admiral Kuznetsov’s mission to the region will likely be just a glimpse of what is to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 18, 2016",US Destroyer Attacked by Anti-Ship Missiles From Rebel-Controlled Yemeni Territory,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The American Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Mason (DDG-87) was sailing in international waters in the Red Sea when it was attacked by two missiles emanating from Iranian-backed Houthi rebel-controlled territory on Yemen’s western shore. Pentagon spokesperson Jeff Davis described the incident as follows: “At approximately 7 p.m. local time today, while conducting routine operations in international waters in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, USS Mason detected two inbound missiles over a 60-minute period. Both missiles impacted the water before reaching the ship. There were no injuries to our sailors and no damage to the ship. We assess the missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. The United States remains committed to ensuring freedom of navigation everywhere in the world, and we will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our ships and our service members.” The attempted strike on the USS Mason comes just a week after the UAE-operated high-speed logistics catamaran HSV-2 Swift, which once saw duty with the US Navy, was brazenly attacked . The assailment on Swift was also executed by Houthi rebels, and was thought to have involved either shore-based anti-ship missile—likely an Iranian version of the C-802 —or the shorter-range C-701 , or missiles fired from a swarm of small boats. Regardless, the onslaught resulted in horrific damage to Swift and killed a still unknown number of people onboard. USS Mason was patrolling the southern end of the Red Sea, near the strategic Mandeb Strait, when the missiles were fired. This is the same highly strategic area where Swift was attacked. The destroyer is part of a three-ship American flotilla sent into the area following the demise of Swift. USS Mason underway., USN ABC reports that USS Mason used a “defensive measure” to counter the attack, although it remains unclear if this measure caused the missiles to hit the water, or if they did so on their own accord. It also remains unclear if the defensive measure referenced was kinetic (missile or CIWS ) or non-kinetic (electronic warfare) in nature, although it is likely the latter. Mason did not return fire. On the same day as the attack on USS Mason, Houthi fighters executed a Scud missile attack on a Saudi airbase near Mecca , the longest-range strike by the rebels since the war kicked off 18 months ago . The sprawling King Fahad Air Base, the supposed target of the attack , is located 325 miles from the Yemeni border. The missile is said to have done no damage. King Fahad Air Base near Mecca. , Google Earth All this occurred just 24 hours after an attack on a civilian funeral outside Yemen’s capital of Sana’a, which Houthi rebels claim was specifically targeted by Saudi and Sunni-Arab coalition aircraft. 140 people were killed in the attack and 525 were supposedly wounded. The incident has sent shockwaves through the Sunni-Arab coalition, and has the potential to fracture America’s quiet backing of Saudi Arabia’s war effort. Mideast Eye reports that Saudi Arabia initially denied that they were responsible for the attack, but later said that they are launching an investigation into the incident ( possibly after US prodding ), with Saudi officials now describing it as “regrettable and painful.” National Security Council spokesman Ned Price made the following statement regarding the attack: “U.S. security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is not a blank check. Even as we assist Saudi Arabia regarding the defense of their territorial integrity, we have and will continue to express our serious concerns about the conflict in Yemen and how it has been waged.” Beyond the possibility that the missile attack on King Fahad Air Base and USS Mason may have been retaliatory in nature, it’s unclear if the spate of ship attacks in particular are part of a larger, emerging strategy, or if they are simply opportunistic in nature.

Countless intercepts, territorial violations, and boundary-skirting bomber patrols have occurred in the last two and a half years. Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea region in particular has become some of the tensest airspace in the world. Russian tactical jets roam the area with a penchant for testing boundaries and area defenses, and spy aircraft from both sides transit the area regularly, sometimes with their transponders shut off. Just yesterday a pair of armed Russian Su-27 Flankers supposedly ventured into Finland’s airspace, and Finnish F/A-18s were scrambled to intercept. The first scramble occurred around 4:30pm local time–when an armed Russian Su-27 approached Finnish territory over the Gulf of Finland. According to the Finnish government, the jet eventually breached their airspace, entering about a kilometer into it for a brief amount of time. Finland’s F/A-18C/D aircrews snapped this shot of the afternoon encounter: Picture taken from a Finnish Air Force Hornet during afternoon intercept., Finnish gov. Later that evening, around 11:30pm, Finland had to scramble Hornets again. The jets executed a nighttime intercept on a target flying along its border. Once again it was a Russian Su-27 variant–fully armed, this time sporting Sorbtsiya-S electronic warfare pods on its wingtips. Here is a shot from the encounter: A nightime photo taken by a Finnish Hornet pilot. The Su-27 is illuminated using the jet's port-side intercept spotlight., Finnish gov. The Finnish F/A-18 crew was able to take this awesome, if somewhat eerie picture of the Flanker because their Hornets are equipped with a port-side intercept spotlight. Canada’s CF-18s were also delivered with this useful feature, as were a handful of other modern fighters, such as Norwegian and Dutch F-16s. Handy as was over the Gulf of Finland, the integration of night vision goggles and infrared targeting pods is so common on western fighters, the intercept spotlight’s utility has somewhat waned. When it comes to air defense, the country’s F/A-18C/D Hornets are some of the most capable and youngest “legacy” Hornets in the world, and have seen constant upgrades over their lifetime. Finland leverages the F/A-18’s hardy, navalized design for short field and austere operations. The jets can operate in very small groups from short and narrow stretches of highway, using the F/A-18’s tailhook and a mobile arresting cable system to drastically shorten landing roll distance. These operations are also a staple in nearby Sweden, and it is a manifestation of how both countries have prepared to independently defend themselves–and even survive the onslaught of foreign powers–over the decades. Just hours after these intercepts occurred, Estonia says a similar Russian jet also violated their airspace. This separate incident occurred at 2:38AM local time, when the aircraft appeared over the Baltic Sea with its transponder turned off. Like the incidents earlier that day in Finland, the Russian fighter was only in Estonian airspace for a minute or so. Finland’s defense minister Jussi Niinisto stated the following in response to the Russian incursion: “We take these incidents seriously. Having two suspected violation on the same day is exceptional.” He also made note that past violations had been mostly made by cargo (surveillance) planes, not high-end, armed fighters. A Finnish F/A-18D with its intercept light clearly visible., US Navy Hornet Program Office Long before tensions increased with Russia in 2014, Northern Europe was a Cold War hotspot. NATO kept a close eye on Russia’s military operations in the area, with an especially sharp focus on monitoring Russia’s master navy base at Severomorsk–home of the Northern Fleet–as well as movements on and over the Baltic Sea. Finland and its neighbor Sweden are not members of NATO; but over the last two and a half years, as the security situation in the region continued to deteriorate , both nations have become more allied with NATO than ever before . This shift has included the execution of large multi-national military drills –hosted by both Sweden and Finland–with NATO and the US playing a central part in those exercises. The two Scandinavian nations have also participated in key NATO conferences. There has been talk of both countries joining NATO, although time will tell if this becomes a reality for either. Of course, Moscow is not pleased with any of this. Hours ago, Finland signed a new security pact with the US which includes increased joint training and large-scale exercises, as well as deeper intelligence sharing. With this in mind, the appearance of armed Flankers on–and even within–Finland’s borders just before such an agreement is not a random act. Far from it: It was almost certainly Moscow’s way of reminding Helsinki not just who their neighbor is, but what they are capable of. A clear sign that the closer Finland gets to NATO and the US, the more Russia will make them pay for doing so.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 2, 2016",Littoral Combat Ship’s Hull Cracked Open After Collision With Tugboat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Littoral Combat Ship program is highly controversial, and rightfully so. Not only is there a good case that it is the wrong ship at the wrong time for the US Navy, but it has failed consistently to live up to its intended purpose and operational concept. Not only that, but the LCS program is built in two classes and by two shipyards. But beyond the systemic issues the still relatively tiny LCS fleet has experienced a rash of costly breakdowns and mechanical issues in recent months, leaving the vessels broken at the dock. Now there is news that USS Montgomery (LCS-8) has suffered a crack through its hull after collision with a tug while trying to escape Hurricane Matthew on Tuesday. The mishap resulted in a crack along a welding seam near the center of the ship. It also bent five of the horizontal stringers comprise the ship’s structural skeleton. Once the Montgomery’s crew found the fissure, which was resulting in seawater entering the ship, they plugged it the best they could. The ship did not return to port in Mayport, Florida , and under the atmospheric circumstances that makes sense. Navy Times reports that the US Navy’s official response to their inquiry stated: “USS Montgomery (LCS 8) sustained a crack to its hull while getting underway from Naval Station Mayport under orders to sortie Oct. 4. This crack resulted in minor seawater intrusion, but was contained by the crew. An investigation into possible causes is underway, and the ship will receive more permanent repairs upon her return to port.” Montgomery was commissioned less than a month ago but has had a very rough start of its active Navy service. Just three days after its commissioning, on September 13th, the ship suffered from two totally separate mechanical failures. The first issue started when the ship’s engineering team detected a seawater leak in its hydraulic cooling system. Then one of the ship’s gas turbine engines failed. The ship was diverted to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before heading to Mayport, Florida for repairs. Montgomery was originally on its way to its new homeport in San Diego when the mechanical issues arose, a trip it has still been unable to execute. USS Montgomery seen during her commissioning in Mobile, AL on September 10th., AP USS Montgomery is not the only LCS that has had major mechanical issues as of late. Far from it actually. A string of engineering problems has plagued the embattled program. USNI News recaps the incidents that have occurred prior to USS Montgomery’s commissioning: “In late August, Independence-class LCS USS Coronado (LCS-4) suffered a casualty in route from Pearl Harbor to Singapore for a planned deployment . Days earlier, the Navy confirmed USS Freedom (LCS-1) would have to have a main propulsion diesel engine replaced after seawater flooded the lube oil system . In January, operator error caused a complex gearing system in Freedom-class LCS USS Fort Worth (LCS-3) to suffer extensive damage which resulted in the removal of the ship’s commander . The year before a software problem in USS Milwaukee (LCS-5) caused a similar casualty in its gearing system.” The program has already undergone deep revisions. This included a decision to up-arm the ships with more armor and weaponry (and weight!), while another focused on cutting back their production numbers and forcing an eventual down-select to just one class instead of two. Then just recently, after the spate of issues described above, the Navy ordered further revisions. These included changes to manning levels and training training requirements, as well as organizational decisions as to how these ships would operate and where. Also a fleet-wide engineering stand-down was ordered . This is similar to the grounding of particular aircraft type following an incident or series of incidents to deeply revue the program’s procedures, training and other elements. It’s been a rough year for a program that has seen lot of rough years in its relatively short existence. Even some the program’s supposed wins that the Navy is so proud to tout have been eyebrow raising. The LCS is a failed concept. It does not, and will not, do what it was designed to do in the manner in which it was intended. Both classes of ships have been in the water for many years now and yet they’re no more reliable while their mission and justification for existence has become increasingly ambiguous. Despite calls from the most powerful people in Washington to let the program go, and calls for the Navy to just build a proper frigate in its place, the Navy seems dead-set on keeping the failing program alive. Even if the ships entering service only have a visual resemblance to the flexible, reliable, cheap, minimally crewed, brown water multi-mission jet boat concept as it was originally sold. The Littoral Combat Ship is literally a mess.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",US Navy Adversary Hornet Emerges Wearing Russia’s Latest Combat Jet Scheme,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s aggressor squadrons are a colorful bunch . Nearly half a century in existence, these units’ aircraft have worn a wide variety of camouflage schemes, including those they could face in air combat. One of the Navy’s adversary support units, VFC-12 “Omars” based out of NAS Oceana in Virginia, has led the way in mimicking the latest adversary paint schemes in recent years. Known for its “Ambush” callsign, VFC-12 has played the enemy for decades so that east coast Navy fighter squadrons can hone their air-to-air skills against as realistic an aerial adversary as possible. A couple years ago, as the unit transitioned from F/A-18C/Ds to F/A-18A/B+s, it started painting its Hornets in an awesome monochromatic “splinter” style camo scheme like the ones worn by Russia’s T-50 , and at the time the not yet operational Su-35 . One of the Omars' “splinter” Hornets. In the past most of VFC-12's jets wore a blue and white Flanker scheme. , USN The USAF’s 65th Aggressor Squadron quickly followed suit, fielding its own blue, white and gray version of the splinter scheme. Now that the 65th has been shuttered and its eclectically painted F-15C/Ds have been sent to other units, its sister unit, the 64th Aggressor Squadron , has applied the same scheme to some of its F-16s . Now team Ambush has painted one of its Hornets in a newer Russian paint scheme that has become prevalent across the country’s tactical aircraft fleet—some of which are flying above war-torn Syria. Originally, this charcoal gray on top / sky blue on the bottom motif appeared on the platypus-nosed Su-34 Fullback , and the big fighter-bomber wears it well, but now other Flanker derivatives like the Su-30 and Su-35 have also donned the same paint scheme. Even Russia’s Su-25 Frogfoots and some of their helicopter forces are painted in this charcoal tone, and with bright red stars contrasted on their tails they sure do look foreboding. Deploying this replica paint scheme on American adversary aircraft makes a lot of sense, not just because it continues with a long tradition of emulating Russian paint schemes, but because American pilots are actually encountering aircraft painted just like this over Syria. Now maybe Top Gun/NSAWC will paint one of their F-16s this way. That would look exceptionally sinister.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",General Dynamics Unveils Promising New Pint-Sized “Franken-Tank”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Army’s long search for a small tank that packs a big punch seems to never end. Now, General Dynamics is looking to do something about that with their new Griffin tank technology demonstrator. Unveiled at this year’s Association of the United States Army (AUSA) convention in Washington DC, this little tank is meant to be a jumping off point for finally fulfilling the Army’s mobile protected firepower requirement. The 27 ton Griffin is a franken-tank of sorts, which is not a bad thing. It uses pieces of existing technology to lower costs and development time–and also return some investment to the Army for projects abandoned years ago. The Griffin’s main gun is the XM360 120mm cannon that was designed at great cost under the now abandoned Future Combat Systems initiative . Remarkably, the gun weighs less than half the weight of the Abrams’ 120mm cannon, but it packs the same punch. The Griffin’s turret is a scaled-down version of the M1 Abrams turret–hence the family resemblance. The change in scale reduces turret weight from 22 tons to just eight. Inside, the turret is identical the M1A2 SEP V2 Abrams according to Defensetech.org , with all the same controls, monitors, storage spaces and crew placement. It even packs the same 7.62mm coaxial machine gun as the Abrams, located next to its main gun. The bottom half of Griffin is also borrowed, in its case it comes from the UK’s Ajax family of multi-mission armored tracked platforms. This system is about as modern as it gets, and with the UK ordering hundreds of them in multiple variants, production and research and development costs can be minimized along with overall program risk. Mike Peck from General Dynamics describes Griffin and where it could lead: The whole idea behind this technology demonstrator is to get the Army and General dynamics talking about how they can make this platform both suitable for Brigade Combat Teams and affordable. Any brand new weapon system will have an uphill fight when it comes to getting funded, but a project like the Griffin packages mature technologies and existing technologies in an innovative way may have a better chance of making production. Though technology demonstrators often use off-the-shelf components, doing so has migrated to high-end production hardware as well in recent years. Even the B-21 Raider, the USAF’s new stealth bomber , is taking this approach when it comes to many of its sub-systems, lowering risk and hopefully keeping the program on track to meeting an ambitious target price per unit. Another light tank that carried a big gun was already designed for this exact mission, the M8 Armored Gun System . The C-130 transportable M8 was designed to replace the M551 Sheridan for the 82nd Airborne, and it could have been possibly integrated with other units as well. M551 Shriden being air-dropped by a C-130 via the LAPES system., DoD The Sheridan was finally retired in the mid-1990s, and although six prototypes of the M8 were built around the same timeframe, the Army stepped away from the concept. Let’s face is, land warfare was not really a hot topic at the time. In the last few years this all changed, and expeditionary land warfare–even in denied access environments–has been a major focus within the Pentagon. This prompted BAE Sytems (who bought United Defense) to roll out an upgraded version of the M8 at last year’s AUSA conference , which also got a lot of attention. Yet the M8 does not integrate many proven technologies, including a new advanced chassis and a common turret, like the Griffin does. M8 firing its gun during testing. General Dynamics is hoping to test the Griffin system, or a tweaked version of it, for the Army in 2017. If it were to get an Army order it’s possible the USMC could also order the system, and there are export prospects for it as well.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As we noted previously , details surrounding the attack on the UAE-operated logistics ship Swift remain very fuzzy. Most news outlets reported the ship was sunk. Contrary to those reports, it appears the ship–or what was left of it–was being towed to Eritrea for examination. It looks as if it has arrived there, and the pictures are not pretty. As you can see, the vessel is badly damaged. Fires have burned off much of its forward upper structure. A large fissure in the bow appears to show where the weapon struck. If this is accurate, the height of its impact above the waterline was likely what kept the ship from sinking into the abyss. While the ship stayed afloat, major parts of the ship’s structure not directly affected by the blast were probably warped due to the heat from the resulting fire. Swift's bow badly damaged. , Screencap PLG-WAM A wider view of Swift showing the gaping hole in its bow and fire damage to its upper deck., Screencap PLG-WAM Swift being towed into port for examination and salvage., Screencap PLG-WAM The UAE has released some new details about the incident. They claim the ship had been operating in and out of Aden for a year on a humanitarian mission. This claim, that military materiel and personnel were not moved by the ship, remains uncorroborated. In fact, the UN has a different take on the ship’s mission: The official position from the UAE government, as quoted by UAE news agency WAM , states: ”In more than a year of operating routine journeys to Aden, the civilian ship has carried thousands of tonnes of humanitarian assistance and more than 1,000 wounded people, along with their companions, in addition to large equipment for the electricity, water and healthcare sectors which had significantly eased the suffering of the residents of Aden through the restoration of the infrastructure in these vital sectors.” The UAE government also has detailed the crew size and makeup for the ship at the time of the attack. 24 civilians of six nationalities manned the vessel. These included ten Indians, seven Ukranians, four Egyptians, one Jordanian, one Filipino, and one Lithuanian. No official manifest of passengers onboard, or details as to exactly how many were injured, killed, rescued or lost, has been made publically available. As for Swift’s future? Judging by these pictures the ship will likely be scrapped. Swift and her sister ships are made mainly out of aluminum. The metal has its advantages, but it’s known to burn far more ferociously than steel. If anything else, the loss of Swift should be a lesson to Navies around the world that are operating surface combatants made out of similar materials. The US Navy in particular should take heed of the incident: Its aluminum Littoral Combat Ships have reduced crew sizes compared to their traditional frigate predecessors, affecting the crew’s ability to fight fires and deal with battle damage. This attack indicates some of America’s most modern warships could suffer from similar effects after a successful attack. Traditional frigates made mainly out of steel have been known to be able to take similar hits with less catastrophic results. The Oliver Hazard Perry Class Frigate USS Stark after being hit by a pair of Exocet anti-ship missiles in Persian Gulf in 1987., USN Seeing as Swift, while in service with the US Navy , helped pave the way for the Littoral Combat Ships , it’s only fitting that its final voyage has the potential to affect the LCS program in a meaningful way. That is, if the Navy has the political will to investigate the incident and act on the conclusions drawn from it–even if those conclustions don’t support further production of a major weapons system.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 26, 2019",The Possibility Of Russians Using Tactical Nukes and the Strategic Importance Of The Arctic,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. CBS’s iconic news magazine seems to be launching a major investigation into America’s changing strategic place in the world. A few weeks ago, 60 Minutes offered a fascinating look inside Strategic Command and some of its most shy assets. Two weeks ago, the second part of that series explored America’s nuclear posture and how Russia may not see the use of nuclear weapons in the same light as the US. Then this week, Leslie Stall ventured up to Arctic to report on ICEX 2016 , where she talked the changing geopolitical winds blowing in the far north, the looming specter of climate change, and took a ride on nuclear fast attack sub. The second part of David Martin’s New Cold War expose ( see the first part here ) highlights something that I have long posited—the reality that limited peer state warfare, and even the selective use of tactical nuclear weapons during such a conflict, is not unthinkable. In fact, “escalating to deescalate” is a very real tactic, one that seems to fit (albeit in an extreme manner) with Russia’s strategic playbook lately. Even a tactical nuclear weapon used in an unpopulated area, or on an isolated military target, draws a high stakes line in the sand. This is a point of departure towards either deescalation or armageddon. It tosses the metaphorical ball into the other guy’s court, at which point he will have to decide whether the risk of a major nuclear exchange is worth trying to retake the limited territory the enemy has already seized. Watch this second part of David Martin’s New Cold War expose here . In the segment, Martin sat down with Philip Breedlove , former Commander, U.S. European Command , as well as the 17th Supreme Allied Commander of NATO until last May. The discussion was characteristically frank: Breedlove: They see nuclear weapons as a normal extension of a conventional conflict. Martin: So to them nuclear war is not unthinkable? Breedlove: I think to them the use of nuclear weapons is not unthinkable. Later, Martin talks with Admiral Steve Parode , the director of intelligence for US Strategic Command: Parode: I think that they feel that fundamentally the West is sociologically weaker, and if they were to use a nuclear weapon in the course of a conflict between, say, NATO and Russia, they might be able to shock the Western powers into de-escalating, freezing the conflict, into calling a cease-fire. Martin: So they have a belief that they’re just tougher than us? Parode: Oh, that’s definitely true. Martin: And if they have to use nuclear weapons, we can’t, we can’t take it? Parode: I think that some people might think that. Martin: So, how would they shock us into surrender? Parode: They could strike a European target with a nuclear weapon, maybe an airfield they thought was vital to conflict between NATO and Russia. Iskander short-range ballistic missiles, like those based in Kaliningrad., Boevaya Mashina/wikicommons The reality is that massive retaliation is not America’s nuclear policy. Flexible (or scaled) response is really the policy that is in place today and has been for decades. Under such a policy the President can chose to respond to the use of nuclear weapons in a tit-for-tat manner, including the use of non-nuclear means for retaliation. Or the President has the ability to execute an overwhelming response, where one nuclear weapon used by the enemy could see many more used against them in a rapidly escalating conflict model. It is all up to the Commander In Chief, and they would likely have very little time to make such a decision. Underlying this strategy is America’s second-strike deterrent and the idea of mutually assured destruction, which could be the end game in any nuclear exchange between Russia and the US. So it is not as if say Russia were to use a tactical nuclear weapon to plug a gap on the battlefield, and in doing so attempt to freeze a limited conflict by calling America’s bluff when it comes to nuclear escalation, that the US would have to retaliate with all or even a sizable amount of its nuclear stockpile. Although such a strong response remains an option, it has limited utility unless it is put in place as a clear policy by the Commander In Chief before such a conflict were to even begin. Under this type of “massive retaliation” policy the stakes are immediately much higher for both the adversary and the US, as there are less options on the table for dealing with small-scale use of nuclear weapons by the enemy. Yet at the same time the deterrence factor is considerably higher, which could keep an enemy from trying to use a nuke at all. Massive retaliation was America’s nuclear policy through Eisenhower’s term in office. JFK changed to the less absolute flexible response model, and although this has kept the mankind from extinction for half a century, there are calls to change this policy in an attempt to adapt to the strategic realities of the new millennium. In some ways, Russia has already tested NATO’s threshold for military response by invading Crimea. Although Ukraine is not a NATO country, much can be gauged by how the military action was perceived and what measures NATO has put in place following the territorial grab. Although there has been a large increase in US-NATO military drills , especially in eastern European NATO countries, and some assets have been shuffled into the region , they would have a very hard time actually staying off an onslaught from the reawoken Russian bear. When it comes to the Baltic States, which are NATO members, estimates regarding how long it would take Russia to fully seize Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are not promising, with most numbering just a matter of a few days. If such an event were to occur, Russia could very well threaten nuclear war if NATO attempted to respond conventionally in a major way. They could even initiate a first use of a tactical nuclear weapon in an attempt to freeze the conflict and maintain their territorial gains, just as Admiral Parode described. In fact, Russia has tactical ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons placed in the heart of Europe already. All this nuclear weapons talk is especially relevant during a Presidential election year, one where the candidates have had some interesting things to say on the issue. Trump in particular has talked a lot about nuclear weapons, and raised a lot of eyebrows in the process . From not knowing what the nuclear triad is to his first debate with Hillary Clinton where he said that he is against first use while at the same time saying that he won’t take anything off the table. US Army M1 Abrams tanks execute drills in Lithuania., AP The hard truth is that the next President of the United States will have to decide how to move forward with modernizing America’s rapidly aging nuclear arsenal , a highly complex initiative that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Hillary already has some opinions about this, including being against a new nuclear-tipped cruise missile , while trump has mentioned how old the arsenal is (and has slammed the B-52 incorrectly in the process) but has not offered any details as to how he would modernize it. Meanwhile, Russia is modernizing its nuclear delivery systems and has shown signs that it wants to retain the ability to expand its arsenal quickly in the future by withdrawing from a key nuclear material disposal pact just yesterday . Putin’s reasoning for doing so? “The emergence of a threat to strategic stability and as a result of unfriendly actions by the United States of America towards the Russian Federation.” The agreement, which was executed in 2000 and renewed in 2009, dealt with disposing of enough nuclear material to create 17,000 nuclear weapons. In another segment that aired just this week, Leslie Stahl ventured to the arctic during ICEX 2016 . The Navy-led exercise dealt with a whole host of issues, from testing new ways to detect submarines under ice-caps to climate change, but it was really set against a looming possibility that the arctic may be a future battleground. Watch Leslie Stahl’s segment on ICEX 2016 here. Russia has been preparing to fight in the far north for years now, and the US is just catching up . As the ice melts new strategic waterways will emerge, ones that can cut down shipping times dramatically compared to some key existing routes. Stahl also talked with ex-NATO commander Philip Breedlove about the strategic significance of these routes: Breedlove: I have heard as much as 28 days decrease in some of the transit from the northern European markets to the Asian markets. That is an incredible economic opportunity. And it could be a very boon— big boon to business around the world. Stahl: What would it mean if the Russians did gain control over the Northern Sea route? Breedlove: If the Russians had the ability to militarily hold that at ransom, that is a big lever over the world economy. Stahl: So tell us in a nutshell what’s happening. Breedlove: Along that route what we see is Russia upgrading over 50 airfields and ports, 14 of them to be done this year, increasing the number of ground troops, putting in surface-to-air missiles, putting in sensors. That could be used to guide weapons. That could be used to deny access… I think it’s important to understand what the deputy prime minister said, that the Arctic is a part of Russia, that they will provide the defense for the Arctic and that they will make money in the Arctic and that the Western world may, therefore, bring sanctions on them, but that’s OK because tanks don’t need visas. I think it sends a pretty clear message. USS Hampton (SSN 757) and secretary of Navy Ray Mabus in the arctic. , DoD Large energy reserves could also place new importance on the region. Yet operating up there is not easy, cheap or predictable, as you will see at the end of the segment. Yet the Navy will find itself in ever more demand in this inhospitable region, something that Secretary of Navy Ray Mabus, who also ventured to the ICEX 2016, knows all too well: “Our responsibilities are increasing as the Arctic ice melts, as the climate changes.  And so the Navy has got to be here, we’ve got to provide that presence and I hope that my presence emphasizes what we do.” Contact the author: tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 12, 2016",Report: Navy Sending Ships To Mandeb Strait Following HSV-2 Swift Attack,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fox News is reporting that US Navy vessels are headed to the Mandeb Strait, where Houthi rebels successfully attacked the UAE-operated high-speed logistics ship Swift. According to the report, two Arleigh Burke class destroyers and the USS Ponce are moving into the area. The Ponce is America’s specially equipped anti-mine and special operations forward staging sea base in the Persian Gulf, so moving it from that critical area seems like a huge commitment–one which will leave a capability gap in a region where the US is heavily engaged. As such, ordering Ponce to reposition to Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden seems highly unlikely. That is, unless a larger plan is underway wherin the US increases its involvement in the Yemeni civil war, or at least the larger strategic maritime implications surround it . The area has also been plagued with piracy that mainly emanates from the Horn of Africa, so a strong naval presence in the area is not a new concept. In the past, amphibious and even carrier groups have trolled the region on anti-piracy patrols. Also, the US maintains a strong presence in Djibouti , including detachments of fighter, special operations and surveillance aircraft, as well as Predator and Reaper drones. Two days after Swift was attacked, pinning down exactly how it was attacked, what the ship was doing when it was attacked, and how many people aboard were hurt or killed in the incident still remains an impossible task. The vast majority of news outlets have said that Swift was struck by an anti-ship missile, some specifically stating it was a variant of the Chinese designed C-802, found in Iran’s arsenal. The video posted seems to match with this account. Yet others have stated that the attack was executed with a group of smaller missiles. Even the Fox report alludes that this may have been an anti-tank missile attack. Such a strike could have come from shore, if Swift was within a mile or so of it, or it could have come from swarming small boats. Either way, if this is true and an anti-ship missile was not used in the attack then parts of the video supposedly showing the attack would be false. As to what the ship was doing in the area when the attack occurred is not precisely clear either. The official story is that it was delivering medical aid and transporting the wounded . Yet a major military logistics bridge into Yemen has been established by the Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Arab states fighting Iranian-backed Shiite rebels there. Considering Swift’s unique abilities, it could just as easily have been delivering weapons or troops as anything else. Then there is the uncertainty surrounding how many people were killed or hurt during the attack. At first the UAE made the impression that nobody was harmed in the strike, a claim that seemed erroneous at the time. Now there
 are rumors that dozens were killed , including members of the royal family. So far neither of these reports can be corroborated. The Sunni coalition said today that they are launching strikes against small boats tied to the attack . This is an odd statement if an anti-ship missile had been fired from land, though it’s possible that a swarm of small boats were used to harass Swift and slow its movement through the area–possibly damaging it in the process and giving crews on land time to target the ship with an anti-ship missile. The US Navy has an interest in eliminating the threat that these small boats pose as well, seeing that a massive amount of trade moves through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea everyday. American destroyers are equipped with Hellfire missile-slinging MH-60R Seahawk helicopters that can wreak havoc on small boats. But it’s the USS Ponce in particular that has the ability to set up shop, unleash then sustain a small armada of boats and helicopters that could be used to control the entire area. Although Swift was shown totally ablaze, there has been no evidence that it sunk. In fact, the Fox report says that the badly damaged ship is going to be towed to nearby Eritrea for examination. As for the official US stance on the incident, the State Department addressed the attack on Monday stating: “The United States strongly condemns the Houthi forces’ unprovoked attack against a UAE vessel operating near the Bab Al Mandeb,” said US department of state spokesman John Kirby, according to Wam, the state news agency… We take these threats seriously. The United States remains committed to upholding freedom of navigation through the Bab Al Mandeb… These provocative actions risk exacerbating the current conflict and narrow the prospects for a peaceful settlement. State Department spokesperson Retired Navy Admiral John Kirby continued: “Resolution to the conflict in Yemen must focus on a political solution and we urge the Houthi-Saleh groups to demonstrate their commitment to a peaceful solution by taking steps to de-escalate by adhering to a cessation of hostilities without preconditions, and we continue to call on all parties to return to the negotiations being facilitated by the United Nations.” The US has not been directly involved in the fighting in Yemen, but US aerial tankers, intelligence assets, search and rescue crews and other support capabilities have been provided to the Saudi-led coalition. Still, many of the weapons systems being used by the coalition against Houthi rebels are of US origin, as are much of the ordinance they employ. There have even been claims that US-supplied white phosphorus munitions are being used in the fighting. Meanwhile the Arab League has also condemned the act, and has made it clear that an active military response is underway. This could very well include the first deployment of Egypt’s Mistral class amphibious assault ships , one of which was
 just spotted making its way through the Suez Canal. Now it is a waiting game to see what, if any, US Navy assets actually show up off the Yemeni coast. Hopefully, we will also get more clarity as to how exactly Swift was attacked and how bad the damage is, both in lives lost and in terms of the condition of the ship.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 12, 2016","Iran Unveils Fleet of Combat Drones, Claims They’re Copies of Captured RQ-170","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran is once again showing off its “latest and greatest” in warfighting capabilities . A couple weeks ago, they unveiled this crazy looking catamaran , and now they’re showcasing their inventory of drones—many of which they claim have been reverse-engineered from captured craft (and they have stumbled upon a bunch of those). This new video, which ran on Iranian state television, specifically focuses on what appears to be a small fleet of their own versions of the American RQ-170 Sentinel . Iran’s claims of reverse-engineering the RQ-170 go back half a decade, from shortly after the stealthy spy drone fell into Iranian hands . Although it’s all but certain that the Russians and the Chinese have had access to the captured stealth drone, and Tehran’s best aerospace minds have clearly explored every nook and cranny of the craft—including accessing at least portions of its memory banks —the idea that Iran has faithfully reproduced even a significant portion of the aircraft is unlikely. Shown at one point in the video are the three Sentinel-like craft, all of which we have seen before. One is a small, radio-controlled scale model of the RQ-170, the other a full-sized aerodynamic scale replica that may have also been used for basic radio-controlled flight testing. The third one, which looks like it has seen better days, is the real McCoy—the same craft that Iran captured after it crashed in the country in late 2011. Clearly every one of its hatches have been opened and every system fully examined, as much of the seam-sealing tape and radar-absorbent coatings used to decrease the aircraft’s radar signature have been removed. Later in the video we see what looks like a fleet of subscale RQ-170 knock-offs stored on cradles in a hangar. Although this is an impressive sight at first glance, upon closer inspection they appear to be nothing more than prop-powered flying wings with a similar shape to the RQ-170. One, on the left side of the hangar, does appear to have a similar grated air intake as the real RQ-170, but this is likely just a different cowling, haphazardly installed to give the appearance that Tehran has a jet-powered version of this new type of drone. In fact, from one angle you can see there is nothing but an empty void inside. We also see what looks like the underbelly of one of these aircraft loaded with air-to-ground missiles. Obviously this configuration largely negates the advantages of a stealthy flying wing design, and what would provide targeting for those missiles remains unclear. Their method of mounting also looks suspect. In fact, the whole setup looks hastily mocked up, and not representative of a real capability. Additionally, none of these supposed new unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) are seen sitting on their own undercarriage. They probably lack this feature entirely; instead, these much lighter and smaller airframes are likely sling-launched, or use a booster to go airborne. Iran's self-proclaimed RQ-170-like long-range UCAV., AP In the end, copying the general shape of the RQ-170 is one thing, and if Iran can get a flying wing aircraft to maneuver reliably in a stable manner, that is somewhat impressive. But a good deal more goes into the RQ-170’s stealth design and capabilities than just its basic shape. These include the application of radar absorbent materials, the ability to precisely construct large and complex composite structures, acquiring an efficient jet powerplant suited for the medium-altitude, medium-endurance (MAME) mission profile, as well as implementing the many subsystems needed for it to accomplish its mission. These include electronic surveillance and electronic warfare systems, and a highly advanced autopilot, mission-planning, and control system and communication architectures. Not to mention a tailored sensor suite that can fit inside the RQ-170’s small airframe. The list goes on and on. Slapping a reciprocating engine and prop onto the tail of these drones sure won’t help when it comes to radar signature control, either. Not to mention that the RQ-170s low probability of intercept, satellite data-links, and command and control software and infrastructure are not something Iran can simply examine and make happen on their own in a couple of years. There is also the question of these drones’ sensor payload, as there appears to not be any. What we’re most likely seeing here are light unmanned aircraft that use line-of-sight command and control architecture that simply have a shape reminiscent of the RQ-170. If nothing else, the lack of landing gear, internal weapons bay, and a sensor suite, along with the simplicity of their propulsion system, points to the real possibility that these aircraft could be used as semi-expendable unmanned aircraft—aka suicide drones. Under such a concept they would be sent to collect electronic intelligence on the enemy’s electronic order of battle (namely radar and SAM sites) using relatively simple passive sensors, and they could even be used as decoys to stimulate and confuse those systems. They could also carry an internal charge, allowing them to home in on certain electromagnetic emissions autonomously, and to detonate upon impact with the emitter. This concept has already been widely implemented by Israel , and its tactical relevance for Iran is clear. Additionally, a small electro-optical camera can be added to these craft, adding reusable surveillance capabilities and the ability to attack targets of opportunity that are not emitting electronic emissions, including vehicles and people. However, even if these drones are capable of this type of mission set, calling them some sort of advanced UCAV is just another laughable propaganda ploy by Tehran.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The futuristic looking HSV-2 Swift, an ex-U.S. Navy experimental high-speed logistics catamaran now being utilized by the UAE government, was struck by a missile on the evening of October 1, according to multiple reports . The ship was operating near the Yemeni port of Mokha located on the northeastern edge of the Mandeb Strait, a narrow and strategic body of water that connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. Iranian-backed Houthi rebel fighters have claimed responsibility for the attack. The Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Arab states fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen has largely pushed them out of the southern reaches of the country, but the group is still entrenched in the west, especially along the Red Sea. Destabilizing the Mandeb Strait could be part of a larger Iranian-backed regional strategy, one that has the potential to inflict significant economic pain on Saudi Arabia and the west. And this isn’t the first time a Sunni Arab coalition vessel has been attacked by the Shiite anti-Yemeni government group; a year ago, two coalition ships were supposedly sunk by Iranian-supplied anti-ship missiles. A third ship was struck just months before that. An HSV-2 Swift seen during better days. , USN The video below supposedly shows the attack. The missile launch does appear to be that of an anti-ship missile, and the ship on fire does appear to be an HSV-2. A massive explosion is shown when the supposed missile impacts the ship; it likely detonated the fuel onboard, plus any flammable or explosive cargo. The ship’s aluminum hull and commercial ship design standards offer little resilience to an anti-ship missile attack, and the HSV-2 is not equipped with a close-in weapon system (CIWS ) capable of fending off such attacks. https://youtube.com/watch?v=58xPnztU4Cc The UAE has formally acknowledged that there was an “incident” with the ship, but claims that no lives were lost. If the video above is legitimate, which it appears to be, that would be a miracle. This attack is another reminder of the growing danger that anti-ship missiles represent—especially those that are more frequently being obtained by unpredictable non-state actors. This strike in particular is reminiscent of the 2006 attack on an Israeli Sa’ar 5 class corvette by another Iranian-backed group, Hezbollah, that had been supplied with a similar anti-ship missile system. Although in that case, the targeted ship was armed with a CIWS, albeit one that was not fully activated at the time. On the other hand, state actors have turned entire bodies of water into super anti-ship missile engagement zones , with layers of various anti-ship missile defenses ranging out for hundreds and even thousands of miles. Even relatively dated anti-ship missiles, or, in more rare circumstances, anti-tank missiles , are especially dangerous to vessels operating close to shore in the so-called littoral combat environment. In such an environment, these weapons can emerge from seemingly nowhere and impact in a matter of seconds, giving a crew little time to react. This is a reality that even the world’s most advanced surface combatant will have to come to terms with .

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 13, 2016",Secretary Of Defense Carter Keeps Touting The Secret Weapons He Has Up His Sleeve,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. SecDef Ash Carter is all about the Pentagon’s Third Offset Strategy , which is aimed at counteracting America’s shrinking force size and increased military and technological competition from abroad. This includes reimagining and redeveloping our military’s existing platforms and capabilities, as well as implementing highly focused new strategic investments that can offer synergistic and disruptive effects on the battlefields of the future. As you can imagine, some of these initiatives are cloaked in secrecy—but that doesn’t mean Carter stays totally mum as to their existence. Back in February, Ash Carter spoke to airman at Nellis AFB, the heart and soul of the sprawling Nellis Range Complex that includes places like Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport . During his speech he made it clear some serious programs in the works remain opaque to the public, stating in the official DOD transcript: “We are adding funds, also, in the Air Force budget, to grow manpower in the maintenance area, because we need more maintainers, given the high operations tempo, to keep our Air Force aircraft ready. So we’re doing all this at the same time that we’re modernizing the Air Force, so you’ll see in the future new aircraft here on the ramps.  You see the F-35.  You see — you’ll see shortly the KC-46 — the new tanker — and one day, maybe you’ll see — but maybe we won’t show — a new bomber. And then there are other things you also won’t see, because we like to have some surprises, also, for potential adversaries. But they fly around and they train here as well. So it’s a wonderful and extremely important installation, and at a time when we are setting a new direction for our — for — strategically, where the Air Force is a key part of that new direction, and where we’re allocating our defense dollars to implement that strategy, this is a place where it all comes together.” Ash Carter talks to airman in front of a F-35 in a hangar at Nellis AFB in February of 2016. , DoD “In the third phase of the rebalance, we’ll cement the progress we’ve made in the first and second phases, and build upon it…first, by continuing to qualitatively upgrade and invest in our regional force posture with sustained and strategic investments, which I’ll describe in a moment and second, by catalyzing the Asia-Pacific’s principled and inclusive security network even more. In this next phase, the United States will continue to sharpen our military edge so we remain the most powerful military in the region and the security partner of choice.  We’re already sending our best people and platforms into the region, and in the rebalance’s third phase, we’ll increase and target investments to ensure they – and all of you – stay the best. Here are some of the path-breaking, and high-tech improvements we’re making beginning in this budget this year: We’re going to make more of our Virginia-class submarines more lethal and more capable by tripling their Tomahawk cruise missile strike capacity with the Virginia Payload Module. We’re increasing funding for undersea drones – in multiple sizes and diverse payloads – that can operate more effectively in shallow waters where manned subs cannot.  These are part of more than $40 billion we’re investing over the next five years to ensure we continue to have the most lethal undersea and anti-submarine force in the world. We’re ensuring our continued air superiority and global reach, including with over $12 billion over the next five years for the new B-21 Raider Long-Range Strike Bomber. We’re investing more than $56 billion over the next five years to buy during this period alone more than [400] of the stealthy, fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighters – including more for the Navy and Marine Corps – while also improving avionics, radar, and electronic warfare systems in legacy bomber and fighter aircraft. We’re upgrading our aerial tanker fleet, investing almost $16 billion over the next five years in KC-46A Pegasus tanker to help shrink the Asia-Pacific’s vast distances. We’re re-purposing the SM-6 missile so that it can also strike enemy ships at sea at very long ranges. We’re investing in other advanced munitions to improve range and accuracy for land attack and anti-ship missiles – some  new torpedoes – as well as some very creative – and we’re sure unexpected by potential foes – ways to use such missiles across the varied domains of the Asia-Pacific. And we’re also making large new investments in cyber, and electronic warfare, and space capabilities, a total of $34 billion just next year.” SecDef Carter gives a speech aboard the USS Carl Vinson laying out his department's next steps in the Pacific Pivot., AP Then the Secretary once again spoke cryptically about shadowy investments in new, disruptive, and highly classified technologies and capabilities: “We’re going to have a few more surprises as well. These “leap-ahead” investments will keep us ahead in the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere. I can’t share all the details on these for obvious reasons, but what our friends and our potential adversaries – and all of you – should know is that these new capabilities will help us keep our decades-old commitment to undergirding security in the Asia-Pacific, strong and unchallengeable. These advancements may change how we operate, they will, but they’ll never change why we do so: for the security for our people, for our friends and allies, and they principles that have benefited so many in the region for so long.” So what could Carter be referring to? Well likely it is a number of systems built to break down an enemy’s anti-access and area denial capabilities, and to provide high-impact information, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities—even in the most inhospitable of enviroments. We know that an unmanned and very stealthy high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) penetrating ISR aircraft exists , as do stealthy helicopters . We also know that very potent cyber weapons have been developed in recent years, some tailored to specific adversaries vulnerabilities. But there is a good probability that Carter is also alluding to a major clandestine unmanned combat air vehicle program as we have discussed in great detail before . Other space-based and unmanned undersea technologies are also likely included in the classified side of Third Offset Strategy. Who knows, a massive hypersonic booster or stealthy special operations aircraft could also have a place in Carter’s little bag of tricks. Only time will tell, and depending on how the election goes, Carter’s term could be coming to an end soon. With the changing of the guard a new strategy may be put in place, and it is possible that glimpses of what Carter is talking about may surface.

Last time I wrote about the resurrected Stratofortress was back in February of 2015, after it had been pulled out of Type 1000 storage at Davis Monthan AFB’s boneyard and ferried to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana.  At Barksdale, Ghost Rider had systems from a partially burned B-52H transferred to it. The bomber was then flown to Tinker AFB in Oklahoma for a total depot-level refurbishment. Ghost Rider, stripped of her decades old faded paint. It is amazing how good these jets still look more than half a century after they were built. , USAF It took a whopping 45,000 man-hours to get the jet fully operational, and the aircraft needed an additional 7,000 hours of work compared with a normal B-52H’s depot-level maintenance. This was due to the fact that the jet had been sitting stagnant for so long, and that Ghost Rider’s systems needed to be upgraded so they would be on par with other B-52Hs in the fleet. Tinker’s portion of the $13M project was spread over 272 days. Ghost Rider gets much needed TLC in depot at Tinker AFB., USAF In a USAF press release, Charles “Chuck” Alley, director of Tinker’s 565th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron , described how stubborn the jet was during its flight testing, stating: “I told people during test flight that because the aircraft sat in the desert so long, we’re knocking all the ghosts out of it. It seemed like every time it came back it had two or three different things wrong with it.” 45,000 man hours went into refurbishing Ghost Rider and a long list of units and commands were involved with making it happen., USAF Even with all the additional work, the jet will be delivered 90 days earlier than planned, an amazing feat considering all the work and challenges that were involved. This was the first time a B-52H has been pulled out of storage and returned to the fleet. 12 other examples remain in type 1000 storage at Davis Monthan AFB, and it looks like the same units and commands that helped resurrected Ghost Rider will be doing it all over again, following the recent loss of a B-52H during takeoff from Andersen AFB , in Guam.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019","Air Force Eyes Air-Breathing, Rocket-Plane Mothership","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There’s no doubt that the USAF is interested, once again, in very high-speed aircraft , and the service’s drive to use new technologies to cheaply (and even clandestinely) access space has only increased in recent years. Now, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is looking at Reaction Engines Ltd’s Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE) as a potential solution for these exotic mission requirements. According to Aviation Week, the UK-based company’s SABRE powerplant works as such: “AFRL’s studies of the Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE) cycle, which uses atmospheric oxygen and liquid hydrogen from a standing start to above Mach 5 when it switches to onboard liquid oxygen, have shown the concept is thermodynamically feasible. The engine and innovative precooler at the heart of the cycle are ultimately aimed by Reaction at a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launch vehicle dubbed Skylon.” The company’s hydrogen powered Skylon spaceplane concept has been around for some time now. Versions of it even include a hypersonic cruise-capable airliner that uses the company’s proprietary lightweight heat exchangers to cool inlet air temperatures, and a tweaked version of the SABRE engine design called Scimitar. Like SABRE, this engine could theoretically also run at subsonic speeds, allowing the aircraft to operate more seamlessly within existing air travel infrastructure and with a larger margin for error at lower velocities. It would also allow the aircraft to slow to subsonic speeds for travel over populated areas. Although single-stage-to-orbit has long been the holy grail of orbital spaceflight, the USAF is eyeing the SABRE engine for the slightly less ambitious role of hypersonic flight, especially for delivering payloads into orbit using a two-stage-to-orbit method. Under such a concept, a SABRE-powered mothership booster would lift a smaller rocket or space plane to the upper reaches of the atmosphere, and to very high speeds, before sending the second stage and its payload on their way. Like the more ambitious single-stage-to-orbit Skylon concept, this concept would see the SABRE-powered mothership takeoff and land horizontally on a runway, just like any other airplane. Also interesting is that this two-stage-to-orbit concept, which AFRL is collaborating with SpaceWorks Enterprises to develop, leverages two distinct aircraft payload configurations—one partially reusable and one totally reusable. The simplest configuration features a rocket launched from an internal ventral bay of a 150-foot-long, twin SABRE-powered mothership/booster aircraft. The aircraft would accelerate to near mach five during its climb before changing from air-breathing to internal liquid oxygen-guzzling mode. While still accelerating, the airplane booster will climb to a whopping 260,000 feet, hitting mach eight before releasing its second stage booster from its belly. At this point, the SABRE-powered booster would turn back and descend, and could even use its engines in air-breathing mode for a powered recovery. Meanwhile, the expandable second-stage rocket booster would insert its payload into orbit. The semi-reusable two-stage-to-oribit concept. , AFRL This semi-reusable configuration would theoretically be capable of putting 5,000 lbs in a 100 nautical-mile-high orbit with a 28.5-degree inclination from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It would also make loading that second stage booster easier and less infrastructure-dependent when compared with mounting it on the aircraft’s spine. The other, more ambitious configuration sees a scaled-up SABRE-powered first-stage booster/mothership vehicle about 190 feet long paired with a smaller sub-orbital space plane mounted on the aircraft’s spine. This configuration is similar to other parasite concepts, like the M21/D21 concept . This totally reusable design would see both boosters return to earth via a horizontal runway landing, the second stage sub-orbital booster slinging around the earth to do so. This configuration would allow for 20,000 pounds to be put into orbit, although it would require more infrastructure on the ground to do so, including a large gantry crane to lower the plane-like second stage booster onto the first stage’s spine. The combined launch system’s gross takeoff weight would tip the scales at a massive 1.3 million pounds—slightly heavier than a fully loaded Airbus A380. The fully reusable two-stage-to-orbit concept., AFRL Although development costs would be massive, there is an obvious potential for big cost savings and increased space access synergies with such a system, and there are other possible ancillary tactical applications for it as well. For instance, being able to insert something into orbit without launching it on a predictable and detectable rocket is an enticing proposition for the USAF. Also, there’s the possibility that this system could be used to satisfy the prompt global strike mission set requirement . Under such a concept, instead of launching a payload into orbit, the SABRE-powered mothership could send a weaponized rocket onto a suborbital path toward a high-value, time-sensitive target. If one of these aircraft and its second-stage booster with a weaponized payload were kept on quick reaction alert, being able to launch in minutes instead of hours, a time-sensitive target could be struck unexpectedly and reliably, in short order, nearly anywhere in the world. A cutaway of the SABRE design., Reaction Engines Ltd Another question is, what type of cross-range performance could such a craft possess? An aircraft that hits mach eight and 260,000 feet, and has a payload bay, could potentially be a used as a reconnaissance and attack aircraft in a similar fashion as Lockheed’s SR-72 concept . The AFRL is now focusing on getting funding to further develop and test Reaction Engines Ltd’s innovative precooler technology (which is essential to the SABRE engine design) at simulated speeds up to mach five, and with all the heat accumulation that goes along with that extreme flight environment. A simplified diagram of how SABRE works, helium being a key element within the system., Reaction Engines Ltd Yet it seems likely that other USAF initiatives are are moving to develop similar two-stage-to-orbit concepts, as the commercial marketplace surely is . In fact, these concepts have long been at the top of the DoD’s “bleeding-edge” wishlist . Yet just because other programs—classified or otherwise—may be attempting to accomplish the same mission set, they could be aiming to do so in significantly different ways, and investing in multiple approaches to the same goal lowers risk. Or, in some cases, two separate programs may be aiming to achieve the exact same goal in the same way, as the USAF’s metaphorical right hand doesn’t always know what its black glove-clad left hand is doing . And it’s just this type of program, and this size and type of vehicle, that would seem right at home in Area 51’s massive new hangar. It will be interesting to see where the USAF’s involvement in SABRE leads. If it seems to disappear without explanation, that’s as good a sign as any that it has real merits.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",MH17 Investigation Concludes SA-11 ‘Buk’ Missile System Came From Russia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team tasked with figuring out exactly what happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) on July 17th, 2014 has released their preliminary findings. The team made up of investigators from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine has concluded that indeed a SA-11 Buk surface-to-air missile system downed the hapless airliner, and that weapon was sent into Ukraine from Russia and removed shortly after the engagement. “Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation,” chief Dutch investigator Wilbert Paulissen said during today’s presentation on the group’s findings. He went on to say that the missile moved from Russian territory and into Russian-backed rebel-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine on the morning of the 17th, the same day MH17 was shot down. The investigation has also largely defined the surface-to-air missile system’s route and other details surrounding its transport. The official report states: “The system was transported from Russian territory into eastern Ukraine and was later transported on a white Volvo truck with a low-boy trailer. The truck was escorted by several other vehicles and by armed men in uniform.” The site where the missile was fired has also been officially pinpointed as just outside the village of of Pervomaiskyi, which was held by pro-Russian forces at the time. After the shootdown, in which all 298 lives aboard MH17 were lost, the Buk system was quickly moved back into Russian territory the next day. The report reads: “After the BUK missile had been fired, the BUK-TELAR initially drove off under its own power. A short time later it was reloaded onto the Volvo truck and transported back to the Russian border. During the night, the convoy crossed the border into the territory of the Russian Federation.” This timeline was corroborated using many first-hand accounts, photos, videos and intercepted phone and radio communications (see video below). These conclusions come as no surprise but the incredible amount of information used by the Joint Investigation Team used to back them up does. Meanwhile, Russia has done seemingly anything and everything to skew public perceptions surrounding the shootdown, and possibly to mask their involvement in it. The investigation will now move to focusing on the roughly 100 individuals that have been identified as having been directly involved with the shootdown and facilitation of the missile system’s movement and operation. The report makes it clear that the most pressing issue now is to figure out who was within the chain of command that decided to fire the missile. Whether that was a decision made among the missile operators themselves or via a larger command and control network is where the investigation will focus its efforts going forward. One set of conversations among still unidentified individuals is of particular interest to investigators, you can hear that conversation, and read an English transcript of it here . The investigation’s mandate has been extended through January of 2018. And although identifying those directly responsible for shootdown may be possible, apprehending them and bringing them to justice may be a far more challenging affair and who knows how high up the trail of guilt leads. Additionally, Russia has already used its veto power on the UN Security Council to stop the creation of a tribunal that would have brought those responsible to justice. Russia has long tried to blame the shootdown on Kiev, and Ukraine’s inclusion in the investigation has infuriated Moscow. As to the JIT announced findings, Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, said “Russia is upset that the situation around the MH17 crash inquiry is not changing. The results of the Dutch prosecutors confirm that the inquiry is biased and politically motivated,” and that “arbitrarily assigning blame and dreaming up the desired results has become the norm for our Western colleagues.” Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the USAF was putting on its own intimidating air show just south of the demilitarized zone, North Korea was doing the same—although in a much more traditional manner. Last year it was announced that the Hermit Kingdom would be doing the unthinkable: opening its doors to international travelers and press for an air show displaying its remarkably antiquated air combat and commercial aviation capabilities. The whole thing seemed so absurd that some speculated if it was some sort of bluff, or worse. Traveling to North Korea has its dangers; it’s a place where making a poor choice can result in decades of hard labor in one of the most brutal penal systems on the planet. The show was slated to take place in the eastern port city of Wonsan, at Kalma International Airport, which is one of North Korea’s airports that underwent renovations in recent years . Although the idea that these locales receive enough air traffic to actually justify such improvements remains highly questionable. Press who wanted to attend the show would supposedly have a full itinerary of aviation-related and cultural events in store for them—not mention that just flying into North Korea can be an adventure in its own right. Two female MiG-21 pilots making an appearance during the country's first air show., AP State-owned and operated Air Koryo is known to be the worst airline in the world, having an awesome one-star rating . They fly an eclectic fleet of aircraft largely comprised of tired old Soviet-era airliners and transports. It’s an aviation aficionado’s dream. Air Koyro pilots walk the tarmac at Wonsan's Kalma International Airport. , AP I’ve known aviation photographers who have gone to North Korea on packaged tours, but this was a whole different animal. When you also consider the devolving geopolitical situation between North Korea and South Korea over the last year, it seemed like a trip that definitely had its risks. Still, the hardcores signed up and took the gamble, and it apparently paid off. From most accounts, it seems like it was a pretty awesome—although extremely bizarre—adventure. A crowd of North Koreans watches the historic aerial display., AP Now that the show has concluded, photos of the event are starting to emerge. They depict a fairly lively set of performances by most everything flyable in North Korea. A MiG-29s Fulcrum, the type that’s typically used to guard Pyongyang , and Su-25 Frogfoot tactical jets all put on solo performances, and there was even multi-ship demonstrations put on by the North Korean’s MiG-21, Su-25, and MD500 squadrons. North Korean Su-25s conclude their display., ED JONES/AFP/Getty Images Mi-8 helicopters and An-2s biplanes also participated, along with Air Koryo’s jet airliners and transports, including Tu-134s, Il-76s, IL-62s, Tu-154s, and Il-18 turboprops. An IL-18 is seen using the runway during the air show., ED JONES/AFP/Getty Images The oddest part of the whole affair seems to have been the appearance of a large-scale, radio-controlled model of an F-16—in USAF Thunderbirds livery, no less. The aircraft was one of multiple radio-controlled aircraft that were displayed before a few hundred visitors and members of the international press, and the roughly 10,000 to 15,000 North Koreans who attended. As for the backstory behind the little F-16, the North Koreans were not keen on giving up any details. A peculiar addition to the show was this 1:6 scale F-16 RC jet., AP Also of note is that the Chinese-built versions of the MiG-15, MiG-17, and MiG-19 that continue to fill out the ranks of the struggling North Korean air arm made no appearance at the show. This is really no surprise, as Pyongyang wants to show its air force in the best light possible to the world, and these aircraft are not exactly relevant beyond training purposes when it comes to modern air combat. There was also the absence of the MiG-23, although serviceability and attrition rates for the type are historically atrocious, causing them to disappear rapidly from air arms’ inventories over the last decade and a half. The whole idea of an impressively open air show in North Korea goes against the longstanding secretive nature of its military, especially considering that their geriatric Air Force is known to have extremely low readiness and aircraft availability rates. It is also absolutely bizarre that, among missile and nuclear tests and the flinging of threats between the North and the South about wiping out each other’s capitals , there was this seemingly positive event that included visitors from the same nations that have placed increasingly damning sanctions on North Korea and the Kim regime in particular. A North Korean skydiver hitches a ride on an Mi-8., ED JONES/AFP/Getty Images Yet we do know that Kim Jong Un loves aviation. It has been an obsession of his since he was a child, and he even fancies himself a pilot .

As the USAF’s QF-4 Full Scale Aerial Target program winds down the jets and their pilots are making the rounds on the airshow circuit one last time.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has confirmed that ISIS fired an artillery shell or rocket packed with mustard gas at US troops occupying Qayyarah West airfield, about 35 miles south of the ISIS controlled city of Mosul. The base was seized by an Iraqi mechanized assault two months ago and it will likely be the main artery in which materiel and personnel will stage for the long awaited Mosul offensive . That attack occurred on Tuesday and the projectile loaded with the blistering agent landed hundreds of yards from US troops, impacting an unpopulated area of the sprawling base. The soldiers who went to investigate the attack and detected the presence of chemical weapons were treated as a precaution, though none showed any symptoms of exposure. The mixture was likely of a fairly low potency, but ISIS using mustard gas in any form against US forces could be an ominous sign of what’s to come. It’s well known that ISIS has a highly active chemical weapons program . The US air coalition has struck about 30 targets relating to the manufacturing of these weapons in the last year, and still other facilities remain undetected. ISIS’s use of these weapons has increased drastically in the last nine months, especially against the Kurds, who know all too well how horrific chemical weapons can be . This has resulted in a plea by the Kurdish leaders for coalition partners to supply their fighting forces with tens of thousands of gas masks. A huge ISIS weapons stockpile discovered in Fallujah afrer Iraqi troops took back the city., AP Beyond the tactical issues a chemical weapons armed ISIS presents on the battlefield, the bigger problem is that the longer ISIS is allowed to occupy territory and function as de facto state, the more opportunity they’ll have to evolve their chemical weapons program. A weak mixture of mustard gas today will become more potent tomorrow, and so on. Eventually, this chemical weapons expertise will migrate outside of battlefield Iraq and Syria, just like other ISIS tactics have. Their impact on western civilian populations, and civilization as a whole, will be severe. This is just another troubling result of the long “incubation time” ISIS has had under the current US strategy. ISIS parades through the streets brandishing stolen US weaponry. , AP This attack is also yet another frightening reminder that although the White House will claim “no boots on the ground” in Iraq, the roughly 4,500 troops based there (as well as others that are based in Syria) , and many more that augment this number on a “temporary basis,” are very much in harm’s way . ISIS’s targeting of American troops with chemical weapons sets a pretty nasty precedent as Iraqi and Kurdish forces, both of which are supported by US “advisors” and air power, spool up to vanquish the Islamic State’s nearly two and a half year long hold on Mosul. Exactly how chemical weapons could play into what is sure to already be a very bloody fight remains unclear, but it is very unlikely that the fledgling Iraqi Army or Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are prepared to fight in such inhospitable conditions.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An incredibly clean example of one of the most beloved aircraft in the airliner world, the 747SP, is up for sale. And this shorty ‘fo-seven, registered VP-BAT, is not just any 40-year-old human hauler. It served for two decades as the centerpiece of the Qatari Royal Flight , and its interior reflects this unique and extravagant legacy. The aircraft’s inside is a setting for a king—literally: It was used by Qatar’s reigning emirs, most notably Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Al Thani . The plane’s interior is clad in blue leather, the finest wood and, of course gold, lots and lots of gold! In all, the pint-sized 747 is equipped to fly 89 passengers in its various state rooms, dining salons, offices, meeting spaces, and, yeah, that throne room. There are also 12 first class seats, 18 business class seats and 31 “tourist class” seats, according to this ad on Controller.com . This special 747SP is also equipped with its own “fly away kit,” which includes two spare engines, an auxiliary power unit, two spare nose wheels and two spare main wheels, among a ton of other parts. Basically, you could rebuild a substantial part of the jet to get it back in the air even at the most remote of places. According to the ad, the jet has been immaculately maintained, which is no surprise considering who flew around on it, but it is no spring chicken. First delivered to Pan Am in 1979, it has 68,602 hours and 10,288 cycles under its wings. The jet’s most youthful JT9D turbofan engine has over 55,000 hours on it, and the highest-hour engine more than 75,000 hours. Qatar's maroon and white 747SP sits on the ground in Zurich., Aero Icarus/Wikicommons This jet is not a cheap at the gas pump. Topping off with 50,360 gallons of jet fuel will run about $200,000. For the current owners, that may not have been a problem, since they run a major oil and natural gas exporting country . But by today’s standard , the JT9Ds is not exactly a fuel efficient jet. Even the USAF’s massive C-5 Galaxy, with its military derivative of the same engine, the TF39, is going through a reengineering process (C-5M program) to save gas and enhance reliability. Only 45 747SPs were ever built, and just a handful of them are still flying today. The type was designed to offer longer range that the 747-100, so it sacrificed size (and thus weight). Until the introduction of the next generation 747-400 in 1989, the 747SP was the longest range airliner in the world. A Pan Am 747SP on the ground in Brazil back in its airline days. , Pedro Aragão/wikicommons The aircraft is not only shorter than the standard 747-100, its tail is larger and its flaps are solid instead of slotted. It is also faster than the standard 747. These traits made the aircraft attractive VVIP conversions for rulers who wanted the majesty of “the queen of skies” but also longer range, faster transit speeds and better airfield performance than their full-sized cousins. Plus, they were cheap on the second-hand market. Today, less than a dozen 747SPs are flying. Maintaining and operating first-gen 747s has become prohibitively expensive for some users, and most of them are nearing four decades old. These surviving flyers include NASA’s SOFIA airborne observatory and Pratt and Whitney’s engine testbed aircraft . One is owned and operated by Ernest Angley Ministries, another by the Sands Corp of Las Vegas . Nearly all the others are flying for Arab royals, and are decked out with elaborate communications systems and defensive aid suites. There is a whole site devoted to these awesome jets, complete with flight tracking and a ton of history. NASA's highly modified SOFIA airborne telescope. , NASA The Qatari Royal Family has little interest in keeping a near antique 747SP mostly because they are taking shipment of two of the world’s largest and most capable new VVIP jets, the Boeing 747-8i BBJ. The cost of the aircraft alone is around $360 million, and calculating the elaborate interior, special communications systems, and a whole host of other modifications, the price balloons to well over half a billion dollars. Here is a conservative idea of what you can fit in one of these new jets, including tubular elevators that lower VVIPs right onto the tarmac, and space in the hold to haul around a motorcade. One of Qatar's new 747-8i BBJs, the most expensive private aircraft in the world. , BriYYZ/wikicommons How much is Qatar’s lovingly maintained 747SP? “Make an offer!” But for context, another VIP-level 747SP owned and operated by Fry’s Electronics was recently listed at just $2.5M , and it had less engine time than the Qatari bird (although it’s doubtful the interior could compete). That is about the price of Cessna Citation Mustang . Depreciation is a bitch. We can only hope this gorgeous classic will be plowing the skies for another owner with lavish tastes and a seriously fat wallet. It will be a very sad day when the 747SP touches down for the last time. Qatar's 747SP was seen at all the major locales in Europe over the years. , Les Rickman/wikicommons The War Zone contacted the sellers of the Qatari 747SP, but they declined to provide any other information or photos at this time.

A pair of B-1B bombers were dispatched from their temporary home on Guam to fly closer to the North Korean border than any heavy bomber has flown since the end of the Korean War. The jets even landed at Osan Air Base in South Korea , the first time a B-1B had set down on South Korean soil in two decades. It is unclear how long they will stay in South Korea before heading back to Guam. The whole affair comes after B-1Bs flew a similar show of force mission over South Korea on September 13th . The mission mirrors those that have occurred for years , usually following a major North Korean provocation, such as a nuclear test or a long-range rocket launch. Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Bergeson, 7th Air Force Commander, describes the aims of the sortie : “The bond between the United States and the Republic of Korea is ironclad and the strength of that commitment will not be shaken by North Korea’s aggressive behavior. What we are showing today is just one tool we have to choose from a wide array of options. The alliance grows stronger every day and we remain prepared to defend and to preserve the security of the Korean Peninsula and the region.” B-1Bs over South Korea escorted by F-15K Slam Eagles and F-16CM Vipers. , USAF Although displaying American and South Korean combat power to the North Korea may have had some effect on Kim Jong Il’s regime, it’s had little if any impact on Kim Jong Un’s decision making. Beyond his unchanged pattern of decisions, evidence of this can be seen in the fact that North Korea’s normal bluster and outrage over this sort of show of force never surfaced, instead they mocked the September 13 mission , stating: “They are bluffing that B-1Bs are enough for fighting an all-out nuclear war.” The truth is that the North Koreans are right: the B-1B has had no nuclear capability since it was stripped from the jet’s mission profile in the 1990s. B-1Bs and F-15K over South Korea, USAF American attempts to up the ante by flying the same aircraft a bit closer to the DMZ, and having them spend some time on the ground at Osan, is more of a sign that the US is running out of ways to deal with Pyongyang than anything else. Kim Jong Un is focused on rapidly developing his nuclear arsenal , and the ability to reliably deliver that arsenal over long distances . Based on this behavior, another air show is probably not going to change his mind, but it does make for some cool pictures. A formation showcasing South Korean and US air combat capability. In fact, North Korean will likely execute another nuclear test in the coming weeks—the third this year—along with more missile test launches. Just this week, a new rocket engine was tested by North Koreans that could revolutionize their long-range rocket capabilities. The hard truth is that displays of air power will not deter the defiant Kim regime, which has already been targeted by intense sanctions. Only China, which is the Hermit Kingdom’s trade, grain and energy lifeline, has the ability to alter Pyongyang’s decision cycle. And so far they have been an unreliable partner in doing so.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time in half a decade, Google Earth/Google Maps imagery of America’s clandestine flight test center known as Area 51 have been updated. In the new shots, we can see small changes to the ever-expanding base—and one giant one. Click here to check it out on Google Maps and the coordinates for Google Earth are 37°13’06.35″ N 115°47’51.00″ W. I’ve closely followed the construction of the massive new hangar at the base’s remote southern end , and have speculated on what’s inside . In the past, long-range photography by Area 51 watchers and sample imagery from Terraserver have shown the ongoing construction of the big structure. But this Google imagery offers a much more comprehensive and accessible view of the base and its big new feature. The hangar is 210 feet wide by 250 feet long and very high, and is the largest addition to the base in nearly a decade. In 2006, another large hangar was constructed on the south end of the base’s main ramp facility, complete with an earthen berm built around its south eastern approaches. This facility is known to house Northrop Grumman programs, including a high-flying penetrating spy drone loosely named the RQ-180. Uncharaceristically, the USAF has actually admitted to this program’s existence . Northrop Grumman likely flew a government-funded next generation stealth bomber proof-of-concept in the later part of the 2000s. The success of this vehicle, and its ability to lower future bomber development risk, spurred the Long-Range Strike Bomber program, which has since been down selected into the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider . There are also a slew of other rumored past programs and ongoing combat aircraft initiatives from myriad contractors. Each of these could take up space in this and all the other hangars on the base. The remoteness of this new facility—along with its large size and especially its height—make it a much more curious addition than the 2006 hangar. Is it a massive scoot-and-hide shelter for large aircraft or possibly for a swarm of smaller ones ? This seems unlikely due to the quality of its construction and how tall it is. Or was it built so far south due the sensitivity of the program it services? Maybe its location has something to do with the volatile nature of the fuel the aircraft uses? There are other visible additions to the base compared to the 2011 Google image, including a new engine test cell between the northern ramp and the runways, and a new smaller hangar building near where the chase and test pilot aircraft park. This new image is a stark reminder of how much the base continues to evolve nearly 60 years after its founding by famed Lockheed Skunk Works boss Kelly Johnson . Although the reality is that the military, and US citizens for that matter, were active on and around Groom lake long before then . The relatively new unmanned aircraft testing site on the southeastern edge of Yucca Dry Lake continues to grow., Google Earth The new Google images also reveal significant growth at the newer test base located at the southern edge of Yucca Dry Lake . The facility, sometimes referred to as Area Six, is thought to test exotic sensors and weapons payloads for unmanned aircraft, and likely has direct ties to the CIA’s drone program. A relatively small new facility is also being built at the northern end of Creech AFB .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",The Mexican Air Force No Longer Has Any Fighter Aircraft In Its Inventory,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Mexican Air Force has quietly retired its tiny fleet of just eight Northrop F-5E and two F-5F Tiger IIs. These aircraft represented Mexico’s entire fighter force and there seems to be no replacement in the works for them at this point in time. Mexico purchased 12 Tiger IIs from Northrop in 1982 via a US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program dubbed Peace Aztec. Before the deal was inked, Mexico experienced a turbulent decade trying to purchase a new light fighter. After the US rejected an initial sale of F-5E/Fs to to the country in the early 1970s, the US then went on to spoil Mexico’s acquisition of Israeli Kfir C2s powered by US-built General Electric J79 turbojets. Finally, nearly a decade later, a much smaller sale of just a dozen F-5s finally went through. The deal cost Mexico $110m and included pilot training and maintenance crew instruction, some spare parts and support, as well as earlier versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, an arsenal of Mk82 and Mk83 bombs and rockets and rocket pods. That is a lot of bang for your buck, equalling less than $9m per unit all-in. Mexico’s F-5s went on to serve steadily for 34 years. Although they were fairly rudimentary fighters, having no beyond-visual-range air-to-air or smart weapons capabilities, they gave Mexico at least some high-performance air defense capacity. Still, having just a dozen F-5s didn’t really allow Mexico to protect the skies over its entire country in a persistent manner, far from it actually. Although this small inventory of fighters did allow for focused air sovereignty missions over key population centers and during major events. Over the decades Mexico’s F-5s were also heavily involved in counter narcotics operations alongside their T-33/AT-33 stablemates. Today the T-33/AT-33s are also gone, having finally been retired in 2007. A Mexican F-5 loaded with stores., André Du-pont (Mexico Air Spotters)/wikicommons Mexico’s F-5s may not be highly upgraded like some of those still in service around the world (Brazil’s F-5EMs, for instance), but they are some of youngest F-5E/Fs around, ones that have some enhanced “late-model” features. These include flat “shark” noses, enlarged leading-edge root extensions, and enlarged vertical tail extensions that runs down the spine of the jet. Some slight enhancements—upgraded AN/APQ-159 V-5 radars and GPS navigation systems—were made over the years, particularly when the jets were overhauled in the early 2000s. It is clear that the remaining 10 F-5s in the Mexican Air Force have seen greatly reduced availability in recent years, with around serviceable five jets at any given time. The types last flight included just three examples and occurred on September 16, 2016, during Mexico’s independence celebrations. A replacement for Mexico’s Tiger IIs has been rumored to be in the works for a long time, under various guises, including second hand F-16s and F/A-18s, but nothing has ever come of it. There was even a supposed plan for the Mexican Navy to acquire Su-27s for surveillance and other duties, but this too never came to fruition. Now the Mexican Air Force will have to rely on turboprop powered PC-9/7 and T-6C+ light attack trainers for armed air patrols, neither of which are close to substitutes for fast-jets. Not being able to organically supply rudimentary air sovereignty capabilities is a hallmark of a failing state as much as anything else, especially for a country in the western hemisphere and the physical size of Mexico. Considering the security situation around the world, Mexico blatant lack of any fast-jet capability, even advanced jet trainers armed with cannons and heat-seeking air-to-air missiles, may also impact Mexico’s ability to host large events and even world leaders in the future.

Witnesses spotted three parachutes floating toward the ground following the jet’s impact. Two of the chutes appeared to have pilots in them and the third was thought to be carrying equipment of some kind. Both pilots were picked up among the wreckage of the aircraft, although the USAF has not released any info on their condition. The USAF operates a small fleet of around 33 U-2s in many unique configurations . The two seat TU-2S, which are essential for teaching new U-2 pilots how to safely fly and land the exotic aircraft, are much rarer. Only five of the aircraft are supposedly active within the USAF’s inventory, and fewer are likely serviceable at any given time. A TU-2S attempting to land with its spotting vehicle in tow., USAF The U-2 program has been on the edge of extinction for years as the RQ-4 Global Hawk has slowly matured into an aircraft capable of taking over the Dragon Lady’s duties. Currently, the fleet’s sundown is scheduled for 2019, though that could change as it has in the past. Additionally, Lockheed’s Skunk Works , which designed the U-2 nearly 60 years ago , is actively working at retooling the manned U-2 fleet into an unmanned and stealthy penetrating information, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform that could directly compete with the Global Hawk and other classified unmanned programs. Although U-2 crashes are rare, there have been many close calls during operations around the globe. 20 years ago another Dragon Lady crashed in Oroville, California.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During her ‘State of The Air Force’ speech at USAF Association’s national conference in Washington DC, Secretary Deborah James has unveiled the name of the Northrop Grumman B-21 Long-Range Strike Bomber. That name is Raider. The name supposedly came from a crowdsourcing campaign of the USAF’s ranks, although some indications are that such an initiative was never taken too seriously. Still, James states that two Airman came up with the name, and profiled them in her speech. Here is a video the USAF has released for the occassion: So here’s my personal take: I am not a huge fan of the USAF’s pick of Raider for the name of the B-21. It is very safe choice, and it is yet another play on the Air Force’s heritage. Having one of the original crewmen that flew the Doolittle Raids announce the name underscored this fact. Like how Hollywood is running out of ideas and rehashing old properties over and over, the USAF is doing the same when it comes to naming aircraft. Globemaster III, Thunderbolt II, Lightning II (and the YF-22 wore that name before the F-35!) and so on. With this in mind it would have been nice to have heard something really modern, sinister or reflective of the relatively huge number of roles that the B-21 is being designed to fulfill beyond just bombing. But it could have been worse I guess, so there’s that. Also worth noting, Sikorsky is already using the name Raider on their S-97 light attack and reconnaissance compound helicopter. The name has also been used in the past on Northrop’s YC-125 transport , a far less glamorous product than the B-21 emanating from the post-WWII era.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 4, 2016",The Latest F-35 Grounding Isn’t That Big a Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The media is making a big deal out of the sudden grounding of 15 F-35s, which includes nearly the entire inventory of “operational” USAF F-35As, or around ten jets. 57 aircraft are affected in all, but 42 of those are in various stages of production and not flying. The issue surrounds peeling and crumbling insulation wrapped around avionics cooling lines that run inside the jet’s wings and fuel tanks. The F-35 uses its fuel as a heat sink and its avionics produce a tremendous amount of heat (which have led to their own developmental issues in the past). Yet this latest issue doesn’t appear to be systemic or related to the jet’s design. Instead, it’s likely just the result of faulty material used by one supplier. So it is really a quality control issue and manufacturing error above anything else. The USAF’s declaration of initial operating capability (IOC) was public relations ploy made possible by lowered standards and reduced program milestones. The decision to declare the F-35 operational while it’s still deep in testing and mired with problems is going to naturally amplify any news of a grounding in a negative way. But the truth is that groundings due to issues like today’s, where a small portion of the F-35 fleet is affected, are common in military aircraft both new and old.. F-16s, F-15s, F-22s, F/A-18s, and the tactical jets that came before them, have all had groundings during their service lives for one reason or another—some even last months. The difference with the F-35 is that, eventually, it will make up the vast majority of America’s fighter jet force. Because of that, a grounding could neuter a vast amount of critical American air combat capability at one time. This reality is just another drawback of putting almost all of America’s tactical air power eggs in one basket. Making matters worse, poor decisions like not finishing development of the F136 alternate engine for the F-35 only increases risk surrounding such a strategy. F-35s are assembled inside of Lockheed's sprawling Fort Worth plant., F-35.com We’ll see if any more jets are affected. Repairs will be slow and expensive, since the jet’s fuselage and wing assemblies will likely have to be cracked open to access the cooling lines. But for a program hatched under the dreadful auspices of concurrency that has seen rework rates on aircraft as high as 15%, this type of thing is nothing new. Luckily, the issue was discovered before aircraft—or a pilot or lives on the ground—were lost. Meanwhile, this latest grounding should not be used as a major slam against F-35 program. There are plenty other issues we can talk about for that.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 6, 2018",Israel to Receive More Second-Hand F-15 Eagles in Massive New Aid Package,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There has been much speculation about what exactly the massive military aid package between the US and Israel would include. Some reports stated that more F-15 Strike Eagle derivatives would be a part of it, along with dozens of F-35s . Now that the deal has been inked we know more about what it will actually includes and there are signs that long-pending fighter jet sales to Kuwait and Qatar are finally going to be cleared to move forward. If this turns out to be true it would offer a massive lifeline to Boeing’s struggling tactical jet production lines at its historic St. Louis plant. Israel was the first foreign operator the of the F-15 Eagle, and the type has performed brilliantly in combat over the last 40 years. The aircraft’s long-range and adaptability opened up whole new set of possibilities for the Israeli Air Force. Although the F-15A/B/C/D is synonymous with air-to-air combat, the IAF quickly adapted the air superiority jet to fly operational strike missions long before the F-15E Strike Eagle entered service with the USAF. Today, the IAF’s highly modified F-15A/B/C/Ds serve as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, communications nodes and command and control aircraft. Make sure to read all about Israel’s unique F-15s and how they turned from “not a pound for air-to-ground” into highly capable strike fighters i n this past feature of mine . A F-15D lugs 2,000lb JDAMs into the air., AP Now it has been disclosed that Israel has recently received eight F-15Ds from USAF surplus stocks. The American F-15C/D community has been drastically truncated over the last decade even though the aircraft is in greater demand now since any time since Desert Storm . Today just three active USAF squadrons exist at two locations overseas, with the rest of the Eagle community spread out among five “front-line” Air National Guard squadrons, one training squadron and a tactics and development squadron located at Nellis AFB. Even the USAF’s only F-15 aggressor squadron was shuttered two years ago as a cost-saving measure . In total just 178 F-15C/D primary aircraft are slated to serve for decades to come, and they will receive substantial upgrades to remain tactically relevant . These aircraft are nicknamed “Golden Eagles” within the USAF. USAF With so many Eagles being retired to the boneyard, the Pentagon has done what it has before, offered these jets to Israel at no cost. This latest batch includes 10 F-15Ds, the two seat version that has become so valuable for non-traditional “gray eagle” roles within the IAF over the last couple of decades. Eight of these jets have already been transferred to the IAF, with two more likely being sent to Israel even before the $38B, ten year aid deal goes into effect officially on October 1st, 2018. National Security Advisor Susan Rice stated the following concerning the massive deal which includes $5B for missile defense and $33B for other military capabilities and weapon systems: “This additional funding will allow Israel to update the lion’s share of its fighter aircraft fleet, including the acquisition of additional F-35s and F-15s.” This statement appears to clarify that Israel will indeed be receiving additional Eagles in the future. Whether those are new build Strike Eagle derivatives or additional surplus F-15C/Ds remains unclear, but a combination of the two is highly possible. Either way Boeing is slated to win big with the conclusion of this monumental aid package. Even if Israel ends up receiving just used F-15s or orders brand new ones along with its F-35s , the White House is likely to approve Super Hornet and Strike Eagle sales to Arab countries that have been pending for years. The IAF's first F-35 on its maiden flight., Lockheed Martin This has not occurred without controversy . Even Kuwait, a close American ally and already an operator of some of the youngest F/A-18C/Ds in the world, has had the sale of 28 Super Hornets (and an option for 12 more) put in limbo without any clear signs of an approval coming in a timely manner. It has led the tiny but very wealthy country to buy 28 Eurofighters as an interim measure, although it still wants to complete its purchase of Super Hornets as well. The sale would be essential to keeping the Super Hornet line, which is already on life support, active. This is especially true if more orders, like one from Canada , do not materialize. Losing the Super Hornet production line does offer some strategic risk for the US Navy. It is currently the only operational US-built naval strike fighter and electronic warfare platform in production and it stands as a hedge against further F-35 delays and even as an alternative to it. An even larger sale to Qatar of 72 advanced derivatives of the F-15 Strike Eagle has been pending for nearly three years. This order could see the F-15 production line, which is slated to go cold in 2019 after the last of Saudi Arabia’s advanced F-15SA’s are delivered, to continue on into the next decade. Like Kuwait, Qatar has grown weary of the US foreign military sales process under the Obama Administration and has ordered two dozen Dassault Rafales as a half measure. A fully armed F-15SA, currently the last of the F-15 line if more orders are not realized., Boeing Slow playing these super lucrative jet sales to key Arab allies has been the result of an intricate cause-and-effect diplomatic chain that began with the Iranian nuclear deal negotiations. Outfitting Sunni Arab states with America’s most versatile strike fighters was seen as a hindrance to getting the landmark and highly controversial nuclear deal signed as those aircraft would have been seen as a direct threat to Tehran. Then once it was executed, a very unhappy Israel had to be placated via the form of a massive foreign military aid deal. Clearly it was thought that making Israel even more upset by dramatically up-arming Arab states was not a good diplomatic move, and it would just be more fodder for Israel to leverage in an attempt to get the largest foreign aid package possible. Now that the aid deal has also been signed, one that includes the most advanced fighters available on the planet, executing sales of Super Hornets and Strike Eagles with Kuwait and Qatar is less of an issue. So now that the Iranian nuclear deal is firmly in place, with a far richer Iran drastically improving its own conventional warfighting capabilities, and now that the Israeli foreign military aid deal has been finalized, Kuwait and Qatar’s purchases are likely to be approved, at least according to Senator Bob Corker , Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: “I’m glad they consummated the aid deal, and I’m glad that the follow on is we’re completing sales to Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait… To act like there’s no connection — let’s face it, it’s like the hostages left when the money arrived.” It’s about time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 17, 2019",Cause of the Tragic Loss of Blue Angel Ruled Pilot Error,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Too much speed and not enough altitude, along with a series of smaller contributing factors, sent Capt Jeff Kuss, Blue Angel #6, and his F/A-18 Hornet careening into the ground during a practice session in the skies above Smyrna, Tennessee, in June. Kuss had attempted to eject at the last moment but too late to successfully separate from the aircraft, according to a highly detailed Navy investigation report. The doomed maneuver happened right at the start of the Blue Angels solos’ show sequence. Kuss was supposed to rocket down the runway and abruptly pitch up to 70 degrees attitude, then execute a split-s to stop his ascent. The envelope for the maneuver is limited, demanding an airspeed of 125 to 135 knots and an altitude in excess of 3,500 feet above the ground. Kuss was far above that speed, traveling at 184 knots and in full afterburner when he executed the split-s. In addition, his altitude, 3,196 feet, was below the minimum required height for the maneuver. Making things worse, Kuss left the jet in full afterburner even as its nose was pointed perpendicular to the ground. His radio call at this point was correct, but it did not reflect the dire nature of the situation. With the ground rapidly approaching, Kuss didn’t execute a dive recovery soon enough to escape. The Hornet’s engines were never pulled out of full power, even as the jet smashed into the ground. From the official report, which you can read in its entirety here : “Capt Kuss did not perform the Split S portion of the maneuver in accordance with the Blue Angels Solo SOP. Capt Kuss would have seen a barometric altitude readout of 3200 feet displayed in his HUD at the apex of the maneuver. Regardless of whether the barometric altitude was accurate, the displayed apex altitude was 300 feet below the SOP minimum Pull-Down (Split-S Initiation) altitude mandated in the Solo SOP and grounds for a “no maneuver.” He also exceeded the optimum maneuver entry airspeed by 50 knots. Capt Kuss did not pull the throttles out of MAX at or before 90 degrees nose low, although he made the mandatory radio call, “Vertical, Blowers, RadAlt.” Capt Kuss never pulled the throttles out of MAX.” Here is what the maneuver is supposed to look like, and what happened on that sad day in June: https://youtube.com/watch?v=ATGJBmCzB5Q%3Ft%3D9m41s The Hornet was reported to have been current on all its required maintenance and only had small “gripes” (issues with an aircraft usually pointed out by aircrew). The report explains that Kuss was an exemplary officer and was held in the highest regard by his peers. By all accounts he was also an incredibly capable fighter pilot with a keen attention to detail and procedure. This contrasts with the strange set of errors he experienced in those critical moments before the end of his life. The investigation found an anomaly at the top of Kuss’s climb. The split-s maneuver requires no more than a 180 roll to inverted, after which #6 starts their downward “pull.” For unknown reasons, Kuss executed a 540 degree roll instead, completing one and a half full rolls before pulling into the vertical, nose down. Nowhere in the Blue Angel’s standard operating procedures and show routine is such a dramatic roll called for, nor is such a move cleared by the Navy or the FAA. Strangely, Kuss missed other routine actions leading up to the doomed maneuver. The report explains: “Capt Kuss was viewed as one of the most meticulous and professional Blue Angel pilots by his teammates, but leading up to the mishap flight, he committed errors that appear out of his norm, including not signing the aircraft acceptance (A) sheet for the aircraft prior to the mishap flight and not turning on his Mode 3 squawk during the mishap flight, although a preassigned squawk was provided to him.” No drugs or alcohol were found in Kuss’s system, nor were there any other known physical or psychological factors that could have contributed to the crash. The report draws certain conclusions, and one of them is that weather likely played some role in the incident: “Weather was a factor in this mishap. The weather observation was 3,000 scattered, but there were multiple billowing clouds near the departure end of the takeoff runway, Runway 14. Just prior to takeoff, Capt Kuss had a discussion with the Lead Solo about the viability of being able to “make” (successfully execute) the HPC. The clouds may have influenced Capt Kuss’ decision to begin the Split S before reaching the mandatory minimum altitude of 3,500 feet AGL.” The report also makes a series of recommendations, many of which have to do with revising standard operating procedures documents and training routines related to the Blue Angel’s demo, especially the ones having to do with #6’s split-s maneuver: “The content of the NFDS Solo SOP Low Transition/High Performance Climb/Split S requires revision. The maneuver description is vague and poorly written. The maneuver description does not provide detailed standards for execution under varying conditions. Quantifiable limitations and additional safety factors must be added. “No maneuver” conditions must be amplified and articulated with additional granularity.” This maneuver and a similar one performed by the Thunderbirds has led to two major incidents since 2003. In 2004, Blue Angel #6 also had a major mishap while being trained to execute the split-s at the start of the solos’ demonstration routine. The pilot survived but the jet had to be written off. Then in 2003, the Thunderbirds had a major mishap when their opposing solo pilot misjudged his altitude during a similar split-s departure maneuver, leaving him just a split second to successfully eject. Thankfully, the pilot survived. The report also underlines how the opposing solo (Blue Angel #6) has been involved with all of the team’s last three Class A mishaps, which included two pilot deaths and the loss of three F/A-18 Hornets. Another potential cause, the documents say, is the unique nature and culture of the Blue Angels squadron. Unlike other squadrons, pilots cannot fill in for one another if they feel sick, exhausted or in a mental state that may impair their flying. Considering the high-profile nature of the Blue Angel’s mission, opting out of a demonstration due to anything from fatigue to a personal issue can leave hundreds of thousands of spectators disappointed. Even worse, it may be perceived as letting the team down. This, combined with the squadron’s insanely hectic schedule , may have been a sort of ticking time bomb. A final endorsement letter of the investigation from the Commander of Naval Air Force Pacific, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker, underlines the need to change: “The unique nature of the NFDS adds another risk dynamic. Every other squadron in the feet has the ability to find a substitute pilot to complete the mission or execute an alternate mission. However, if one of the Blue Angel pilots is not ready, there are no other pilots who can readily cover their position for a show. The pressure to not let the team down and miss a performance, although unspoken, is tremendous. Fundamentally, we will create an environment for the NFDS where each pilot feels empowered to speak up before or during a brief if they are not physically or mentally prepared for a fight. Additionally, we will ensure the other pilots and members of the team are looking for those signs as well. We have well established processes in the fleet for an aviator to “take a knee” and tell the operations officer that he/she is not ready for a flight, and that freedom must extend to the Blue Angels as well.” It is not clear if fatigue actually played a role in Captain Kuss’s death, but it is certainly possible, especially considering the uncharacteristic set of mistakes he made leading up to the crash. Although, the official investigation report states: “Monday, May 30 and Tuesday, May 31 were days off for the Blue Angels, providing Capt Kuss with time to rest, recuperate, and spend time with his family… Capt Kuss showed no signs of fatigue or stress on Wednesday, 1 June or Thursday, 2 June 2016.” With all this in mind, it seems like Captain Kuss was truly having an off day. We all have them, even fighter pilots at the top of their careers. But for most these days result in spilled coffeee, a fender bender or a botched presentation at work. For a guy that is tasked with performing aerobatics at incredible speeds and at very low altitudes, all choreographed with five other aircraft hurtling through the same small piece of sky, a bad day can have far worse consequences.

In recent years, Beijing and Moscow have grown increasingly close militarily, often running cooperative drills alongside one another. But these latest naval exercises see Moscow and Beijing operating in the highly disputed South China Sea , and practicing a set of tactics that certainly are concerning—those related to using amphibious forces to jointly seize small islands. On Monday, a flotilla of half-a-dozen Russian ships entered the Chinese port of Zhanjang, where they rendezvoused with their Chinese counterparts before heading into the highly volatile South China Sea for exercise Joint Sea 2016. The date of the exercise is symbolic, occurring on the 20th anniversary of the two allies establishing strategic cooperation, according to a Chinese government press release . This is the sixth cooperative naval drill between the two countries in half a decade. Russian naval forces receive a full diplomatic welcome after arriving in Zhanjang before kicking off Joint Sea 2016., AP Russia’s commitment to the exercise includes a quartet of combat ships, two supply ships, and pair of helicopters. In addition, 96 Russian marines and their armor will also be used in the exercise. China, the “home team” host of the event, has committed a larger force: 10 ships of all types including submarines, around 20 aircraft, and 160 marines and their armor. Beyond the island-seizing portion of the exercise, Joint Sea 2016 will also include anti-submarine warfare, ship boarding, anti-piracy, and air defense maneuvers, as well as live weapons firings. Chinese maritime commandos practice helicopter assaults during Joint Sea 2016., AP The relatively small size of the force seems tailor-fitted for taking small islands, similar to those that are disputed in the South China Sea and East China Sea . Not all amphibious operations are alike, and training for this specific type of operation, with its unique set of issues, makes sense—while also being a somewhat ominous sign to other powers in the region, including the United States. The training is said to focus on fostering seamless integration of Chinese and Russian forces from a command and control level on down to individual soldiers from both nations fighting alongside one other. Chinese and Russian marines execute island-seizing drills during Joint Sea 2016., AP Interestingly enough, just this week U.S. Marines are training to seize existing island airfields and holding and defending those airfields for their own use as part of Valiant Shield 2016.

Marines train to seize, hold, and defend island airfields on Tinian Island during Valiant Shield 2016., AP This all comes as the entire region is on edge after reports that China has moved assets nearby Scarborough Shoal , with some claiming that another Chinese island-building project appears to be imminent at that pivotal locale. Scarborough Shoal sits just from 125 miles from Subic Bay, The Philippines, and the U.S. military assets that are increasingly being deployed there . Scarborough Shoal would offer China a strategic bookend in the eastern part of the South China Sea to its other island outposts in the region. The Philippines have their own claims on the shoal, as does China’s nemesis, Taiwan, and if China moves to fully occupy Scarborough Shoal and begins expanding and developing it using invasive means, it could become a flashpoint in what is already a very tense part of the world. Scarborough Shoal, as seen from space., Wikicommons/public domain Any move on the Scarborough Shoal by the Chinese would directly violate the July 12th, 2016 ruling by Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that clearly stated The Philippines’ claim on Scarborough Shoal was valid, and that China’s claim was hollow under international law.

Then, just yesterday, this tone seemed to switch again, with Duterte seemingly courting alliances with China and Russia , snubbing what was a resurgent and increasingly productive U.S.-Philippine military alliance. If this change in The Philippines geopolitical direction continues to align away from Washington, it could result in a major strategic shift in the region—one that will not be beneficial to the United States. President Duterte poses with highly capable soldiers from the Philippine military., AP It will be interesting to see if Russia plans on interjecting itself more heavily into the South China Sea dispute, possibly in a similar fashion to its operations in Syria—although at this time it would not include actual combat operations. Doing so would see Moscow at geopolitical odds with the US once again, and it would help give China’s island-building strategy and claims on basically the entirety of one of the world’s largest shipping arteries (and its natural resources) more international support. It would also severely complicate what is already a complicated situation for the U.S. Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 9, 2019",Watch a Computer Save this G-Stricken F-16 Pilot from Certain Death,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. G-induced loss of consciousness, more commonly known as G-LOC, has claimed an untold amount of fighter pilot’s lives around the globe. Reclined ejection seats and g-suits that inflate and squeeze the lower body to keep blood flowing to the brain all help with this G tolerance, but they don’t help once a pilot has succumbed to gravitation forces. This is where the Automated Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS) comes into play, turning the controls over to a computer if the jet is set to collide with ground and is not overridden by the pilot. Auto-GCAS is not just an autopilot mode tied to an altimeter. It is a complex system that took decades for the USAF, NASA and the Swedish Air Force to develop, including operational testing where fighter pilots had to nose their jets into the ground to activate the system (you can read all about those flights here and you can see a video of one of them posted in this article). Sweden was particularly interested in the project because they historically lose a lot of aircraft and crews due to controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and operate regularly at lower altitudes than the USAF. F-16D Automatic Collision Avoidance Technology demonstrator aircraft. The final system was fielded as part of the F-16's M6.2+ Operational Flight Program (OFP) software update release in 2014., NASA The Auto-GCAS system works by comparing the jet’s position, altitude, bank angle, speed, heading and gross weight against a set of terrain profiles, called the Digital Terrain Elevation Database, stored in its memory banks. In a sense, Auto-GCAS sees the entire ground below and around the jet, although virtually within its memory banks, at any given time. This way it can not only warn when a collision is imminent, but can also autonomously direct the aircraft’s path for the most favorable recovery. The video of the USAF Viper pilot’s near-death experience, which was originally posted over at Aviation Week , has the following description: “In this instance, an international F-16 student pilot was undergoing basic fighter maneuver training with his USAF instructor pilot in two separate F-16s over the U.S. southwest.  The student rolls and starts to pull the aircraft but experiences G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) as the F-16 hits around 8.3g. With the pilot now unconscious, the aircraft’s nose drops and enters a steepening dive in full afterburner from an altitude of just over 17,000 feet. After only 22 seconds, the F-16 is nose-down almost 50 degrees below the horizon and going supersonic. The shocked instructor calls “2 recover!” as the student passes 12,320 feet at 587 knots. Two seconds later, the clearly concerned instructor again calls, “2 recover!” Then, at 8,760 feet and 652 knots, the Auto-GCAS executes a recovery maneuver. The student pilot at this point regains consciousness and pulls back on the stick, momentarily increasing Gs beyond the Auto-GCAS standard recovery level. Minimum altitude by now is around 4,370 feet, with as little as 2,940 feet indicated on the radar altimeter. From loss-of-control to recovery takes just under 30 seconds. Auto-GCAS was deployed with an aim to reduce ground collisions by fighter jets by 90%, and the system, which is now deployed on Block 40/42 and 50/52 F-16C/Ds will be able to be migrated to other aircraft, both old and new, in the future. Commercial and civilian applications are also evident as the system could greatly reduce, if not eliminate entirely, the possibility of controlled flight into terrain for aircraft equipped with it. Similar technology also has other military applications. Low flying aircraft, manned or unmanned, could potentially be fitted with a similar system that focuses on nap-of-the-earth flight and navigation, not saving pilots from flying into the ground due to misjudgements or unconciousness. The advantage of such a system would be that the aircraft could operate in an electromagnetic emissions silent manner while still flying in this extremely challenging environment. This is how stealthy aircraft best fight as the signals they give off can give their presence away almost as easily as a strong radar return. A “synthetic” terrain-following system may even allow unmanned aircraft and missiles to execute extremely low altitude operations far below the 500 or 200-foot combat hardeck mandated by the Pentagon for low-flying manned tactical aircraft today. The stealthy Black Hawk helicopters used in the Bin Laden raid would have been an ideal candidate for such a system. It would allow their crews to execute nap-of-the-earth flying in all weather conditions while staying electromagnetically silent. It would also mean that they would not have had to lug around a bulky terrain following radar system, saving weight and reducing the complexity of the helicopter’s stealthy airframe. Manned assets that currently use terrain following radar, such as the F-15E and MH-47 derivatives, could also benefit from such a system. When combined with synthetic vision, which has already been established in the commercial marketplace, and/or the use of forward looking infrared and night vision goggles, crews could have the option of not having to use their terrain following radar for low-level portions of missions, or it could serve as a backup system should their terrain following radar fail. A shot of Honeywell's 3D synthetic vision display system., Honeywell Such a system could also offer any tactical aircraft all-weather terrain following capabilities without the need for any major sensor upgrades or the use of valuable stores stations to lug around heavy terrain following radar pods. Swarming unmanned combat air vehicles could also make use of a “synthetic terrain” library and ground collision avoidance system, offering the flexibility of low-level automated flight for easier penetration of the most defended airspace in the world. This kind of system could also allow autonomous drones to more easily navigate in areas with high-mountains during surveillance and Close Air Support missions. Navigation in GPS denied environments could also benefit from such a synthetic terrain library. By providing a baseline map to compare what the aircraft’s sensors see of the ground, an accurate idea of where the aircraft is in time and space should be able to be offered. This kind of concept is not necessarily new. For many years cruise missiles used simpler terrain contour matching along with inertial navigation systems to fly to their targets accurately. Although these applications stray from the Auto-GCAS’s core mission, synergies in keeping ever more precise and up-to-date topography and obstacle libraries can be had at the very least. With geospatial mapping and multi-spectral imaging capabilities increasing rapidly in quality, the idea of having constantly updated and extremely precise terrain maps of particular regions, or the entire world for that matter, is well within reach. https://youtube.com/watch?v=https%3A Regardless of where this tech could lead, in the end the video of the G-stricken Viper pilot plummeting towards his death, saved by a computerized recovery system that took decades to develop, proves that all the time and effort put into developing the Auto-GCAS was indeed worth it.

Rich Cooper,"Posted on Oct 28, 2018",The Reaperettes Provide Critical Life Support For UK Based Eagle Pilots,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tara Stratton is the wife of Lt. Col. John C. ‘Otter’ Stratton, commanding officer of the 493rd Fighter Squadron. His unit is better known as ‘The Grim Reapers’ and you may already be familiar with ‘Otter’ – he’s the fighter jockey featured in the ‘Red Flag’ IMAX movie . Otter’s squadron of F-15C Eagles are air superiority workhorses, the point at the tip of the USAF’s spear at RAF Lakenheath in England. We’ve all seen those cinematic moments. The scenes where the hero fighter pilot climbs out of the cockpit and their spouse runs towards them, arms outstretched, ready to be thrown around their loved one tighter than the g-pants still attached to their combat-worn flight suit. Sitting in her husband’s empty office, Tara Stratton is a more realistic vision of a fighter pilot’s wife: A marriage of 13 years. Tours with four frontline F-15C squadrons, in three different countries. Two young kids, a son aged eight and a daughter aged five. A busy commanding officer for a husband, his four-year posting in the UK coming to an end. How would you cope with a world constantly shifting under your feet? How would you deal with a marriage where your spouse can expect to be called away at a moment’s notice, sometimes not knowing where, when, why, or for how long. What’s the key? For Stratton, the answer is The Reaperettes: A collective of fighter pilot spouses that look out for each other, through thick and thin. A club as elite as the tight fraternity of their husbands, and one that also comes with it’s own unique dress code. The Reaperettes led by Tara Stratton in front of the mighty F-15C Eagle., Rich Cooper “I don’t have a better way to describe it other than that we are a family.” Stratton smiles as she defines The Reaperettes. “Typically, it’s the spouses – and that includes husbands – although since I have been here The Reaperettes have solely been made up of wives. Girlfriends are welcome to some things, like social events, but other things are very close-held for spouses-only.” “As wives, we are ‘keepers of information. Not in terms of classified information, but we might know details that the general public doesn’t know like where they are and how long they will be gone. Also, we are the ones that are doing things for the squadron – we are the baby-meal-makers, the grocery shoppers, when you are sick, so the spouse-only events are also a thank you, for what they put into squadron life.” “We get together a lot,” she says, laughing. “Typically we’ll try and get together once a week. We’ll ensure that there is at least one social a month, and often there are about five monthly events. It could be a lunch, a birthday, a welcome gathering for a new family, for the spouse and kids. Sometimes we’ll just get together for wine and order a pizza, or if the squadron’s on Roll Call we’ll all hang out ourselves.” The US military truly is a “family business” in its own right, one where everyone makes sacrifices, including soldiers, airmen and sailors' families., Rich Cooper Unsurprisingly, Stratton sees the tight-knit group as more than just a social club. “I think having The Reaperettes is very comforting for our husbands when they leave. It makes it easier for them to go do what they have to do. Just to know that… we’ve got it. We’ve got it taken care of.” Indeed, the wives have a fantastic handle on the ins and outs of squadron life. “I think if you ask most of us, we would always have a better way to run the squadron! If we were just in charge of it, we would do it this way and that way… but maybe that’s not just unique to our community!” she jokes. Her tone changes. “Because ‘we’ve got it,’ they can perform their mission. That’s not to say that what we do doesn’t have its own set of challenges, but we are all very strong women. I think sometimes there is a danger that people can see us as less than what we are. Our Reaperettes are made up of anesthetists, physicians, geophysicists, teachers, nurses, marketing executives – in their own right they are strong women in their careers, and many of us put those aside to focus on this kind of thing. Hopefully it makes it easier for the pilots to do what they do.” It’s a patriotic sacrifice, and an important one. “I think that it would be miserable if we didn’t have each other. It would just be a completely different assignment and a different role. I think that morale would be at an all-time low if we weren’t there for each other.” Rich Cooper Forged by that sacrifice, the bonds of the Reaperettes only grow stronger. “They (the pilots) pick up and leave at a moment’s notice and there’s nobody that gets it like we do. There’s nobody else. Not even your family. As much as they love us, they just don’t know. There’s nobody that lives it the way each of us does. Sometimes they get tasked, one (pilot) at time, to go do something. Like, after a year of being here ‘Otter’ got tasked to go to Afghanistan for 12 months on his own. The Air Force didn’t pack us all up and ship us back to the States – this was all we had. The Reaperettes stepped up and took care of us.” Although this set-up is common in the fighter world, Tara explains a unique element to life with the 493rd at Lakenheath. “It might be different here as the C-model is a small community. Each jet is just one pilot and there are no WSOs (Weapon System Officers) or navigators in our community, so the numbers are very different. However, the overall goals will be the same.” “The goodbyes are hard. We don’t come in and see our jets off. Every squadron does that differently, and every commander has their own take on that. Right now, we don’t come in before a deployment — they’re busy working for the hours before they take-off, briefing etcetera. We say our goodbyes at home, and we drop them off outside and, when we hear the noise and we do, we hear it from our homes, we know that they’re off.” “But the best part is when they come back. The homecoming is just so… amazing. It’s awesome. It’s so different to anything. To go out on the flightline when they come home and meet them is just awesome. And it’s being together through all those things that bring us closer. Everyone’s sad to see them off… Well on the longer ones at least — sometimes on the shorter ones it’s like ‘See ya!’ Thank goodness for that! But the long ones, when you don’t know when they are coming back – like three to six months, often with a big question mark – you just don’t know where they are going or when they will be back. When they are away like that, when it’s appropriate and not classified, we will get notification through the usual channels. But not all deployments are like that” Stratton explains. Indeed, the regular pattern of deployments are one thing, but calls like the one to deploy to Turkey last year for the ongoing mission against ISIS make an already busy and unpredictable life even more complex. “You just don’t know” Stratton adds. “They could still be out there now, for all we knew when they left. On top of that, even when it’s a ‘regular’ deployment, jets break, tankers break, anything could happen. Just a couple more days… Just a couple of weeks…” She sighs. “It’s hard when you have babies. But it’s a part of our life. For some it’s harder than others — each family and spouse is unique. It gets tough when a baby is sick and we’ll all help as much as we can, but sometimes we’ve seen families that have had to go back to the States for support.” Rich Cooper It’s clear how integral everyone is to each other’s lives. But often people are not keen on a squadron-sized group of people knowing their business. “I actually consider myself a pretty private person.” Stratton says. “But sometimes you just have to get over yourself. You know, you just need it. I feel like I have a pretty decent relationship across the Reaperettes and hope that I would know if something is going on and they are not feeling ok. If somebody that regularly turns up to things is not showing up then we may see that something is up, but Facebook is a great tool! We have our own secret group on Facebook, and that’s where a lot of communication can take place. Anything from “Hey I’m going to the Commissary does anybody need anything’ to ‘I’m really struggling with this….’” With a group as tight knit as the Reaperettes, it could be a challenge for a new spouse to find their place. It’s a situation Stratton is keen to prevent. “When a brand-new family is due for arrival at our squadron, I will send an e-mail to the spouse about a month before they get here. Each incoming family has a sponsor family assigned to them and they will be cc’d into this mail. This will welcome them, invite them to our Facebook page where I can introduce them and they can start to make connections and ask questions — anything from what to pack to what the weather is like. The day they get in, I make a meal for the family and take it over to their temporary lodging. If ‘Otter’ is in town, he’ll come with me and we’ll take our kids too. We also do a welcome basket for them, with local information, groceries, so they are pretty much set-up as soon as they get here. After that, we will have a welcome lunch, unless there is already an event scheduled.” “For the pilots, the only thing familiar about being posted to a new squadron is the jet. That doesn’t change for them, it’s the same cockpit in the same jet. Outside of that, people move around with the Air Force a lot, and when they do, they can just know that this welcoming ‘family’ structure will be that all important familiarity, whether you actually know the guys or not. You come into it knowing that it’s just going to be that way because that’s how we do it.” Reaperettes at home on the apron at RAF Lakenheath., Rich Cooper “If a female pilot arrives with a husband it would not change anything. Participating in the spouse’s group is totally voluntary, and we have some that are more pro-active than others depending on what is going on in their lives. Our very first fighter squadron had a female pilot and her husband would come to most things but if we’re going to a pedicure he’d skip that! We’ve not had that dynamic at the 493rd and if we did we’d have to rethink the name “Reaperettes” I guess! Furthermore, we also do things with our enlisted spouses the same way as we do with our pilot spouses.” “Being here in the UK, it’s unique. Not everyone lives on base and it’s quite spread out, so it says something that everyone will make the effort to come from all over to meet up. The squadron has a great reputation and we love it. I was used to the F-15C culture, having been at Langley, Eglin and Kadena, and when I first got here, I was a little unsure what this assignment would be, but it did not disappoint.” “There’s no real hierarchy to the set-up, it’s a natural thing that just evolves. My husband is the commander and I am his wife, but outside of that, we are peers. Whoever is in the role as the Boss’s wife can perhaps set the tone for the Reaperettes, but everybody has a role. We have someone to sign up for baby meal rotations, someone that looks after birthdays for dates and restaurants. We have two people that are known as ‘The Sunshine Gals.’ They are the ones that, when we hear you’re having a bad day, will leave a bottle of wine and a card or flowers on your doorstep. All these little things just add up to let you know that people are thinking of you, and it’s so great.” Rich Cooper “As long as I have been around the fighter community, 13 years, this has been the way. I grew up in an Army family and I can remember my mum doing these things in their battalions. Not exactly the same, and not as close-knit, but it was similar. The whole political correctness of everything, and general culture of the military now means that they have to be much more careful in choosing their words, and things that might have been traditional in fighter squadrons 20 years ago are different now. It’s not a bad thing, it is just different. At the end of the day, we support the mission, whatever that might be, we support it. Sometimes we support it more joyfully than others, but we are part of Team Liberty, and we are a small but mighty squadron.” “Wider than that, we support the USAF and, in terms of the biggest picture, we all have various political views, which often surprises people that we all don’t all feel the same way about things. But, putting all of that aside, I don’t think anyone always understands the politics of things and why things happen yet we support their mission by supporting what our country stands for and we support defending liberty. Whatever they have to do, we stand behind them. But whilst our role is right here, I think deep down we all feel that it does have a much bigger impact on our country and the world at the end of the day. We are all very patriotic.” Rich Cooper Ultimately, it’s the support that’s needed for an elite group of pilots putting themselves in danger every time they strap into the cockpit. “It’s hard in that it’s a dangerous job that they do every day.” Stratton’s voice cracks, her strength of emotion and passion for the squadron evident. “We are all very aware of that. One of the hardest things we do — and we do it every time you get to a new squadron — is sitting down with our spouses and filling out the form that says if something happens to you, if you die, this is how I want to be informed, this is who I need to take care of our kids, this is where our kids go to school. This is where I work and these are my hours. So that if someone has to show up and tell you the, you know, unfortunate news… This is where my husband wants to be buried, this is how he wants his parents told… All of it. That’s a hard document to fill out. It hits home. But, at the end of that, there is some joy to be found. You know that it is taken care of, and there is comfort in that. There’re not many people that have those conversations and get those plans in place.” “Bringing the Reaperettes into that; they’ve all done that form, they’ve all lived those deployments. And we’ve all got each other. And the best things? Regardless of political standing, we are all very patriotic and besides, our husbands have a really cool job!” Tara jokes. “I never get tired of the jet noise. I am never outside, when hearing the jets flying, and don’t stop to look… It’s just cool, and I don’t even like flying! We get to see the world. We get to live in places that people won’t even get to vacation.” “If I could go back to my High School days, growing up in an Army family — I swore I would never date anyone in the military and now here I am.” Stratton recalls, adding, with gentle sincerity “But it’s a good life, a really good life. I feel like we are taken care of. I wouldn’t change a thing — even the worst years. It’s busy and there are a thousand things you could name to not like, but it has been good to us because we have chosen to make it good for us and our family. My children love coming into the squadron, it never gets old to them. They come and sit out on the porch and watch the jets and they think it’s pretty cool.” Rich Cooper Stratton did not want to sign off without a nod to another asset vital to the Grim Reapers. “We also do an appreciation event for the maintainers, which is a fun cookie drive at Christmas. At the end for the day we all know, in fact we are very aware, that our husbands’ lives rest in their hands every single day, as well as the guys in the Aircrew Flight Equipment department, packing their chutes, maintaining their helmets and oxygen masks. Although they are not wearing the black Reaperette dress, they are a part of this network that we talk about and their spouses are often away longer than ours. They are all very much a part of the family.” Though there’s plenty of sacrifice to go around, Tara makes it clear just how important being a Reaperette really is: “The standing joke within the squadron is that the guys always say ‘When I die I want to come back as a fighter pilot’s wife!’” Another mission accomplished for the indomitable Reaperettes. , Rich Cooper Rich Cooper runs the Centre Of Aviation Photography make sure to check them out here and to follow him on Facebook here .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 27, 2019",Look at Boeing’s Entry for the USAF’s New Jet Trainer Competition,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Boeing and Saab consortium rolled out its clean-sheet design for the highly prized T-X contract , one that will include orders for hundreds of jets that will serve for decades as replacements for the USAF’s venerable T-38 Talon—and possibly in other roles as well. The glitzy unveiling happened at Boeing’s historic St. Louis plant, where the Super Hornet and the Strike Eagle are built. For Boeing, winning the T-X could be critical to keeping the St. Louis, as well as its tactical aircraft business, afloat: orders for Boeing’s 4th generation fighter products are winding down , and the aerospace giant lost the Long-Range Strike Bomber contract to Northrop Grumman last year. Boeing-Saab's T-X competitor is impressive looking to say the least., Boeing There will be little debate over this new aircraft’s appearance—it looks pretty awesome. In fact it reminds me a lot of the BD-10 actually. Saab’s involvement not only lowered Boeing’s overall financial risk, but also clearly injected an independent perspective into the design. The Swedish company has built some amazing aircraft over the years, reliable, sturdy and cheap to operate. It found an export success with the JAS-39 Gripen , which itself relies on a licensed derivative of the same powerplant as the one in Lockheed-KAI’s T-50 and in Northrop’s clean-sheet design. That engine is the GE-F404 turbofan. Boeing and Saab’s new design has large control surfaces, huge leading-edge root extensions, a landing gear configuration reminiscent of the F-16, a large bubble canopy, a nose that looks like it could easily accommodate a radar, and a pair of air inlets attached below a high-set swept-wing. It looks more in the class of Lockheed’s T-50, a muti-role light fighter as much as a trainer, than the Raytheon-Alenia M346 or Northrop Grumman’s Model 400 . The design also looks as if it will be extremely agile, even at low-speeds. The USAF will award extra points for extra capabilities beyond the baseline T-X requirements. But this will be balanced against overall cost, and high-end clean sheet designs may have trouble competing against more mature designs. Meanwhile, Lockheed has released a new promotional action video of its T-X entrant, a jet they claim will be the ideal synergistic bridge for USAF pilots between primary flight training and the manning of cutting-edge, 5th generation aircraft like the F-35 and F-22. Another angle of Boeing-SAAB's T-X entrant., SAAB Northrop Grumman still has to ‘officially’ unveil its design early next year, likely in a similar high-profile ceremony like the one Boeing executed today, although detailed images of the aircraft and some info on it have already emerged. But now that all four competitors have been seen, the competition, and the propaganda surrounding it, will surely heat up. At this time the T-X contract is to be awarded in 2017 and initial operational capability is slated for 2024. Fights on!

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 2, 2016",This Russian Beach Landing Drill in Crimea Is Downright Ferocious,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia recently said it would be executing a series of large-scale war games in Crimea, but this demonstration of firepower is way extreme. In this footage, Russia’s most advanced tactical aircraft are firing live weapons just offshore, staged explosions are set off, and Russian armor pours out of massive Ropucha (Toad) class landing beach craft . Panstir-S point air defense systems are also seen guarding over the beachhead, and Russia’s feared Bastion-P coastal defense system is shown in action. This is a lot of hardware operating in one relatively small area. Some of this looks more like a dog-and-pony show than a realistic tactical scenario (Su-34s dumping flares into the ocean on unison etc.) but still it is a pretty awesome sight and a reminder of the heavy-hitting albeit blunt military capabilities Russia has at its disposal. Crimea was a part of the Ukraine before Russia invaded it in 2014, and this show of force must be very unnerving for the Ukraine military. The majority of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and a number of other air and land assets have been forward deployed to the Crimea for the better part of a century, and remained there following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. But Russia has drastically increased its military presence in Crimea since seizing it two years ago. This includes a steady modernization of the Black Sea Fleet, much of which is based in Sevastopol, and the deployment of some of the most advanced combat aircraft and missile systems in Russia’s inventory, including the S-400 Triumf SAM system . https://youtube.com/watch?v=fjReCc22o4U Today, Crimea is the linchpin of Russia’s anti-access/area-denial strategy in the Black Sea theater. Think of it as a fortress with invisible anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile system threat rings acting as its stone walls. From the Black Sea, Russia can also project power into the Mediterranean, and its fleet was essential in building up Russian forces in Syria a year ago . The most concerning aspect of this evolution of the Crimea is the potential threat Moscow’s overwhelming military capabilities present to the other countries in the Black Sea. Some were former Soviet satellites that have largely turned their backs on Russia and entered western Europe and NATO’s geopolitical orbit. For them—particularly Georgia—seeing Russia’s amphibious capabilities in action at this level of ferocity provides an ominous reminder of what Russia is capable of.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 23, 2016",South Korea’s ‘Massive Punishment & Retaliation’ War Plan Turns Pyongyang To Rubble,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea has developed a merciless strategy to attack the heart of Kim Jong Un’s regime if a nuclear attack was imminent. The plan would call for a massive barrage of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and bombs to rain down on Pyongyang. No known targets where regime figureheads—including Kim Jong Un—could be hiding would be left untouched. A source quoted by Yonhap News states: “Every Pyongyang district, particularly where the North Korean leadership is possibly hidden, will be completely destroyed by ballistic missiles and high-explosive shells as soon as the North shows any signs of using a nuclear weapon. In other words, the North’s capital city will be reduced to ashes and removed from the map.” This preemptive decapitation strike, dubbed “Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation,” or KMPR for short, was presented last week to the South Korean National Assembly following North Korea’s fifth nuclear weapons test, the most powerful since executing its first test a decade ago. North Korea also claims that this test was of a miniaturized nuclear warhead capable of being mounted on a ballistic missile. The KMPR calls for a mindboggling variety of weapons, including the indigenously developed Hyunmoo 2A and 2B ballistic missiles . North Korea has no defenses against these Hyunmoos and they can be launched and arrive on target very quickly—especially compared to fighter aircraft. The high-speed of their warheads also makes them attractive for attacking bunkers and other hardened facilities. Also mentioned in the plan are Hyunmoo 3 cruise missiles, which can be launched by land-based and sea-based platforms. This concept makes sense, since it focuses South Korea’s conventional, quick-response striking power where it will hurt the North Korean regime the most. It puts Jong Un’s survival at risk should he and his generals even attempt to use their growing nuclear arsenal. This aggressive new war plan could also bolster South Korea’s quiet initiative to outfit their newest submarines with ballistic missiles . Also mentioned in Yonhap News report is the creation of a special operations division focused exclusively on targeting the heads of the North Korean regime. Increasing the fidelity of high-value target intel—the sort of intel Spec Ops would provide—makes these conventionally armed submarine-launched ballistic missiles an even more credible deterrent. On the other hand, this plan underlines the limitations of conventional weapons when faced with a threat by a nuclear armed power—especially one that is extremely unpredictable and almost totally isolated from external geopolitical influences. As North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs gain momentum—and the marriage between warhead and delivery system is more or less proven reliable—South Korea will have to chose to keep with its conventionally-armed strategy or develop its own nuclear arsenal as a persistent deterrent. Were South Korea to go with its own nuclear arsenal, the potential loss of forward-deployed American combat aircraft and a division of ground troops and armor would be a major blow to its conventional fighting capability. Just today, the USAF was supposed to send a pair of B-1B bombers over South Korea— an all too regular affair that follows after a North Korean provocation such as last week’s nuke test. We predicted that some of the B-1s stationing temporarily on Guam would show up in Korean skies at some point during their stay there. The vast array capabilities, like the B-1, that the US military offers South Korea is undeniable. Yet the sovereignty and security that a robust nuclear deterrent offers may make such a large conventional fighting force less relevant. As time goes on, and the threat from North Korea metastasizes, a nuclear-capable South Korea will seem increasingly necessary. A B-1B sits on the apron at Andersen AFB in Guam. It is the first time in over a decade that the “Bone” has deployed to the Pacific island outpost. , USAF Just a decade ago, the very thought of a nuclear-armed South Korea seemed remote at best. But times are changing fast, and long-standing policy is now clashing with the hard reality that a nut with nukes lives just across the northern border. Finally, the Kim regime’s stability has always been in question, and experts don’t know who will actually control the North’s nuclear weapons if it topples. All this adds up to a stormy path ahead for South Korea, one that could be wrought with change and strategic risk.

A tremor indicating the fifth and most powerful nuclear detonation in North Korea’s relatively short history of nuclear tests occurred at 9AM local time on September 9th at the Punggye-ri underground test site. The date has huge significance as it is North Korea’s National Day , basically their 4th of July. Pyongyang claims that this test was of a miniaturized nuclear device capable of being flown on a missile, and by all accounts it was about twice as powerful as their last test in January , measuring 5.9 on the richter scale. Currently, estimates put the weapon’s yield at around 10 kilotons, roughly five kilotons less than the “Little Boy” bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This evaluative yield could go up or down as more seismic and environmental data is analyzed alongside any intelligence emanating from the “Hermit Kingdom.” North Korea has been slammed with five rounds of UN sanctions since its first nuclear test a decade ago. North Korea’s strategy seems now to be to push as hard as possible to field a credible nuclear capability, as well as reliable delivery systems for that capability. This push really picked up momentum early this year with a nuclear test, followed by tests of North Korea’s most advanced ballistic missiles. Some of those weapos systems had been in the North Korean inventory for years, but had never even been test fired. At the time TWZ wrote that this was an ominous shift in North Korea’s strategy , which turned out to be all too accurate. In a statement by North Korean state media, it was clear that Pyongyang is looking to build its nuclear arsenal rapidly and in a diverse manner, saying that it will produce “as many as it wants, a variety of smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power.” Although ballistic missiles are the focus of North Korea’s nuclear delivery system capabilities, as their warhead technology becomes miniaturized, the deployment of nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and man-mobile tactical nukes tailored for use by North Korea’s dedicated special operations forces are a possibility. Creating a “layered,” diversified nuclear force would make neutralizing that threat during a time of war all that much more difficult for South Korean and US forces. The device was detonated at Punggye-ri underground test site and measured 5.9 on the richter scale. , AP Scathing statements from governments around the globe have piled up. China on the other hand, has once again become closer to North Korea after a period of strained ties. The superpower, which shares a border with North Korea, has stated that it would “file a protest diplomatically.” Without China weighing in and saying enough is enough, direct engagement on a public level or the spectre of a horrendous direct conflict, don’t expect Kim Jong Un’s nuclear development strategy to shift any time soon. By the end of the decade he will likely have a credible nuclear arsenal that can threaten the entire region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 9, 2016",Analyzing Trump And Clinton’s Missteps At NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last night Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump took the stage at the Intrepid Air And Space Museum in New York to talk about the military, foreign policy and America’s standing in the world. Here is a breakdown of the most puzzling, inaccurate and downright questionable moments from the NBC sponsored forum. Here you can watch part one and part two of the forum. The War Zone commentary is seen in italics below the transcripted exchanges. Trump answering questions aboard the USS Intrepid. , AP Trump on what has prepared him to be Commander-in-Chief: LAUER: But what have you done in your life that prepares you to send men and women of the United States into harm’s way? TRUMP: Well, I think the main thing is I have great judgment. I have good judgment. I know what’s going on. I’ve called so many of the shots. And I happened to hear Hillary Clinton say that I was not against the war in Iraq. I was totally against the war in Iraq. From a — you can look at Esquire magazine from ’04. You can look at before that. And I was against the war in Iraq because I said it’s going to totally destabilize the Middle East, which it has. It has absolutely been a disastrous war, and by the way, perhaps almost as bad was the way Barack Obama got out. That was a disaster. TWZ: Saying you were against the war in Iraq in 2004 is like saying you are not a fan of Bill Cosby today. For a long time Trump claimed he was quoted as being against the war before the invasion began. This is not accurate. Trump on the rise of ISIS and what he would do to keep won-back territory from devolving back into extremist hands: QUESTION: Mr. Trump, over the past 15 years, a lot of U.S. troops have bled and died securing towns and provinces from Iraq to Afghanistan, only to have insurgent groups like ISIS spring back the moment we leave. Now, you’ve claimed to have a secret plan to defeat ISIS. But you’re hardly the first politician to promise a quick victory and a speedy homecoming. So assuming we do defeat ISIS, what next? What is your plan for the region to ensure that a group like them doesn’t just come back? TRUMP: Sure. I mean, part of the problem that we’ve had is we go in, we defeat somebody, and then we don’t know what we’re doing after that. We lose it, like as an example, you look at Iraq, what happened, how badly that was handled. And then when President Obama took over, likewise, it was a disaster. It was actually somewhat stable. I don’t think could ever be very stable to where we should have never gone into in the first place. But he came in. He said when we go out — and he took everybody out. And really, ISIS was formed. This was a terrible decision. And frankly, we never even got a shot. And if you really look at the aftermath of Iraq, Iran is going to be taking over Iraq. They’ve been doing it. And it’s not a pretty picture. The — and I think you know — because you’ve been watching me I think for a long time — I’ve always said, shouldn’t be there, but if we’re going to get out, take the oil. If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn’t have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil. LAUER: How were we going to take the oil? How were we going to do that? TRUMP: Just we would leave a certain group behind and you would take various sections where they have the oil. They have — people don’t know this about Iraq, but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world, in the entire world. And we’re the only ones, we go in, we spend $3 trillion, we lose thousands and thousands of lives, and then, Matt, what happens is, we get nothing. You know, it used to be to the victor belong the spoils. Now, there was no victor there, believe me. There was no victor. But I always said: Take the oil. One of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is ISIS would not have been able to take oil and use that oil to fuel themselves. TWZ: This was a very convoluted reply, even for Trump. Not having a plan for when the fighting stops has dogged America’s foreign excursions abroad for a decade and a half, but Trump offers no solution of his own. Nor does he address the question he was asked. Leaving Iraq in 2011 was a disaster, but it did not really create ISIS. ISIS mutated out of Abu Musab Al Zarqawi’s brutal ideology, which has taken many guises. At one time it was famously called Al Qaeda in Iraq; a group turbocharged by very disgruntled Sunnis that were once Saddam loyalists. The exodus of US ground forces, air power and surveillance gave ISIS the vacuum it needed to expand across Iraq. But their seat of power is in Syria, and the pullout of US forces in Iraq has had little effect on the instability in Syria over the past half decade, where the Islamic State was incubated. Nor was it a major factor in the civil war in Syria that has turned into a proxy battle among global powers. As for “keeping the oil,” well that is nothing new from Trump and is maybe the biggest tell regarding his lack of foreign policy knowledge. The idea that the US should be some sort of conquering super-power is exactly the opposite image we need when it comes to enhancing our security. This is especially true since the war in Iraq was one of choice, not necessity. Trump on his “secret” war plan to eliminate ISIS: LAUER: Let me stay on ISIS. When we’ve met in the past and we’ve talked, you say things like I’m going to bomb the expletive out of them very quickly. And when people like me press you for details like that gentleman just said on what your plan is, you very often say, I’m not going to give you the details because I want to be unpredictable. TRUMP: Absolutely. The word is unpredictable. LAUER: But yesterday, you actually told us a little bit about your plan in your speech. You said this. Quote, “We’re going to convene my top generals and they will have 30 days to submit a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS.” So is the plan you’ve been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan? TRUMP: No. But when I do come up with a plan that I like and that perhaps agrees with mine, or maybe doesn’t — I may love what the generals come back with. I will convene… LAUER: But you have your own plan? TRUMP: I have a plan. But I want to be — I don’t want to — look. I have a very substantial chance of winning. Make America great again. We’re going to make America great again. I have a substantial chance of winning. If I win, I don’t want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is. LAUER: But you’re going to… TRUMP: And let me tell you, if I like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals’ plan, or the generals’ plan, if I like their plan, Matt, I’m not going to call you up and say, “Matt, we have a great plan.” This is what Obama does. “We’re going to leave Iraq on a certain day.” LAUER: But you’re going to convene a panel of generals, and you’ve already said you know more about ISIS than those generals do. TRUMP: Well, they’ll probably be different generals, to be honest with you. I mean, I’m looking at the generals, today, you probably saw, I have a piece of paper here, I could show it, 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today. TWZ: Trump has no plan today just as he had no plan over a year ago. Pure snake oil. “Make me President and I will fix all your problems. I will tell you how, once you make me President!” The idea that keeping a broad idea of how he would confront the most pressing foreign policy issue of our time secret because he wants to be “unpredictable” is such a low-end excuse for having no solution it would be comical, if it weren’t so unnerving. As for the makeup of Trump’s list of 88 generals and admirals that support him, well that too is questionable. Trump on getting along with Russia: QUESTION: Mr. Trump, as you know, tensions between the United States and Russia have been at the highest level since the Cold War. In your first 120 days of presidency, how would you de-escalate the tensions? And more importantly, what steps would you take to bring Mr. Putin and the Russian government back to negotiating table? TRUMP: I think I would have a very good relationship with many foreign leaders. I think it’s very sad, when you look at Barack Obama, as an example, lands Air Force One in China, and they don’t want to put out stairs to get off the plane. And he has to use the stairs that mechanics use to get up and down to fix the plane. They wouldn’t give him stairs. I think it’s very sad, when he lands in Saudi Arabia, and he lands in Cuba, and there aren’t high officials to even greet him. This is the first time in the history — the storied history of Air Force One. I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin. And I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia. As I said, take a look today. Take a look at what happened with their fighter jets circling one of our aircraft in a very dangerous manner. Somebody said less than 10 feet away. This is hostility. And I saw, just two or three days ago, they looked like they were not exactly getting along, but I looked at President Obama and Putin staring at each other. These were not two people that were getting along. And, you know, the beautiful part of getting along, Russia wants to defeat ISIS as badly as we do. If we had a relationship with Russia, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could work on it together and knock the hell out of ISIS? Wouldn’t that be a wonderful thing? TWZ: Trump’s claim that Russia just wants to destroy ISIS is a grotesque simplification of the situation in Syria and Russia’s actions related to it. Russia is all about propping up the Assad regime, and that means taking out anyone who challenges it, and yeah ISIS is in that pool. For instance, Russia’s primary air campaign in Syria that ran from October of last year through March of this year focused almost entirely on anti-Assad Syrian rebels , not on ISIS, although they were all referred to as either ISIS or terrorists by the Kremlin. There is also a larger strategy put in play by Moscow to greatly increase Russian influence in the region. This includes establishing deeper ties with Iran, Turkey, Egypt and other countries, with goals that are not necessarily aligned with those of the US. So no it is not necessarily a “the more the merrier” when it comes to Russia’s use of military power in the region, it is one more of an “us or them,” choosing of sides mentality. Yes, Russia states that it wants to work with the US in Syria, but there are major tactical issues that make doing so nearly impossible. Russia’s almost exclusive use of dumb bombs , even in urban areas , is a particular sticking point for instance. And really, Russia wants American intelligence above all else, including the whereabout of all the different players on the Syrian battlefield, including those that pose a threat to the Assad regime. Russia seems willing to do nearly anything to get this info, even staging bogus air raids on US-backed anti-ISIS rebels stationed nowhere near Assad’s forces. So no, Russia’s is not simply in Syria, or the region for that matter, to destroy ISIS. Not even close. Trump's silhouette against the NBC peacock. , AP Trump on his bromance with Vladimir Putin: LAUER: Let me ask you about some of the things you’ve said about Vladimir Putin. You said, I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he’s getting an A, our president is not doing so well. And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said it’s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond. TRUMP: Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters, who, by the way, some of them are based right here. Look, look… LAUER: He’s also a guy who annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, supports Assad in Syria, supports Iran, is trying to undermine our influence in key regions of the world, and according to our intelligence community, probably is the main suspect for the hacking of the DNC computers… TRUMP: Well, nobody knows that for a fact. But do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time? LAUER: But do you want to be complemented by that former KGB officer? TRUMP: Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I’ll take the compliment, OK? The fact is, look, it’s not going to get him anywhere. I’m a negotiator. We’re going to take back our country. You look at what’s happening to our country, you look at the depleted military. You look at the fact that we’ve lost our jobs. We’re losing our jobs like we’re a bunch of babies. We’re going to take back our country, Matt. The fact that he calls me brilliant or whatever he calls me is going to have zero impact. LAUER: But the fact that you say you can get along with him, do you think the day… TRUMP: I think I’d be able to get along with him. LAUER: Do you think the day that you become president of the United States, he’s going to change his mind on some of these key issues? TRUMP: Possibly. It’s possible. I don’t know, Matt. It’s possible. And it’s not going to have any impact. If he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him. I’ve already said, he is really very much of a leader. I mean, you can say, oh, isn’t that a terrible thing — the man has very strong control over a country. Now, it’s a very different system, and I don’t happen to like the system. But certainly, in that system, he’s been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader. We have a divided country. We have a country where you have Hillary Clinton with her e-mails that nobody’s ever seen where she deletes 33,000 e-mails, and that’s after getting a subpoena from Congress. If you do that in private business, you get thrown in jail. TWZ: Trump seems to judge people almost exclusively on the compliments they pay him and he is willing to send compliments right back regardless of the circumstances.The fact that Trump greatly admires Putin’s leadership and how strong a grip he has on his country is alarming as can be but it makes total sense. Like Putin, Trump would also like to go after media outlets that write negative things about him and be a strong man that can pretty much do whatever he wants. The harsh reality is that Putin is not that special in Trump’s eyes as he has a clear soft spot for many tyrants. But who cares right? Because his hats say he will make America great again! Trump on preparing to be Commander In Chief: LAUER: You’ve had a very different background, in business. So nobody would expect you to have taken over the last 20 years really deep dives into some of these issues. But I’m curious about what you’re doing now. What kind of research are you doing now? What kind of homework are you doing? What kind of things are you reading as you prepare for the day in two months where you might be elected the next president of the United States? TRUMP: Sure. Well, in the front row, you have four generals. You have admirals. We have people all throughout the audience that I’m dealing with. Right here is a list that was just printed today of 88 admirals and generals that I meet with and I talk to. LAUER: How much time are you spending on this? TRUMP: I’m also — a lot. A lot. And I’m doing a lot of different things. Don’t forget, we’re running a big campaign. We’re doing very well. I’m also, you know, and I’m very much giving it to my children and my executives to run, I’m also partially running a business. I’m campaigning, I’m running a business. I’ve got a lot of hats right now. But we’re doing very well. But in the meantime, I am studying. And I’m meeting constantly — you see — you see General Flynn and you see some of the folks that we have, and they’re scattered throughout the audience. So we have admirals, we have generals, we have colonels. We have a lot of people that I respect. And I think I’ve learned a lot. But I think, also, I certainly — I really feel I have a common sense on the various issues that you’re talking about, Matt. LAUER: You said in the speech today, you said history shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is the greatest. TRUMP: And we’re not prepared. LAUER: Will you be prepared on day one, if you’re elected president of the United States, to tackle these complex national security issues? TRUMP: One hundred percent. Hey, Matt, again, she made a mistake on Libya. She made a terrible mistake on Libya. And the next thing, I mean, not only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having no management once they bombed you know what out of Gadhafi. I mean, she made a terrible mistake on Libya. And part of it was the management aftereffect. I think that we have great management talents, great management skills. LAUER: But you are prepared? TRUMP: And I have to tell you — totally prepared. But remember this. I found this subject and these subjects of interest all of my life, Matt. This hasn’t been over the last 14 months. I’ve found these substantiates of tremendous interest. That’s why they were asking me about Iraq 14 years ago. They were asking me these questions. They don’t ask businesspeople those questions. TWZ: When Trump announced well over a year ago I was jolted by how little he knew about foreign policy issues. Simple questions were replied to in some of the oddest “talk arounds” I have ever heard, often followed by statements of how well he knew the subject matter when clearly he didn’t. Still, he was a new candidate, and although I personally think you should have crammed enough to at least answer basic foreign policy and military related questions before asking the American populous to make you leader of the free world, I figured he would note this deficiency and rapidly get briefed on what he needed to know. This never happened. If anything else, it is amazing how little growth Trump has shown on this issue over the last year. Clearly he has not done his homework and figures he will just figure it all out if he is elected. If I am wrong, then he retains nothing of substance from any briefs or studying he has done or the material presented to him is of very poor quality. There is a systemic problem that likely aggravates Trump’s sedentary foreign policy knowledge base. It has become clear that Trump has a tiny inner circle, and reads news clippings from selected sources and watches TV to gain the vast majority his foreign policy info. The FP team he had, at least for show, was questionable too. General Michael Flynn, once in the running for his VP, has not lived up to expectations as Trump’s primary national security surrogate. The General also comes with his own baggage , but despite that, Trump even stated he planned on making Flynn Secretary of Defense were he elected, something that is impossible under federal law. Many will respond saying that Trump will rely on “the best generals” to make foreign policy calls. That is great! Having good people by your side is absolutely key. But if Presidents just took the advice of their highest ranking military advisors and ran with it every time throughout post WWII history we would have have used nuclear weapons many times, and cockroaches and mice would likely be about the only things running Washington DC today. Sure, Trump will say “I am a businessman, nobody asks these questions of a businessman!” The problem is he has had his toes in the political arena for many years, and at the very least, he has had over a year to brush up. That has not happened and it shows a cavalier approach that is truly alarming. Hillary Clinton addressing veterans on the USS Intrepid during the NBC Commander-in-Chief forum., AP Clinton on classified emails: LAUER: The word “judgment” has been used a lot around you, Secretary Clinton, over the last year-and-a-half, and in particular concerning your use of your personal e-mail and server to communicate while you were secretary of state. You’ve said it’s a mistake. CLINTON: Mm-hmm. LAUER: You said you made not the best choice. You were communicating on highly sensitive topics. Why wasn’t it more than a mistake? Why wasn’t it disqualifying, if you want to be commander-in- chief? CLINTON: Well, Matt, first of all, as I have said repeatedly, it was a mistake to have a personal account. I would certainly not do it again. I make no excuses for it. It was something that should not have been done. But the real question is the handling of classified material, which is I think what the implication of your question was. And for all the viewers watching you tonight, I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state. Classified material has a header which says “top secret,” “secret,” “confidential.” Nothing — and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice — none of the e-mails sent or received by me had such a header. TWZ: This is inaccurate. Some of the emails, albeit a small number that we know of, were marked as some form as sensitive information . Additionally, many others contained information about classified programs, and we still don’t know about tens of thousands of other emails that were deleted prior to the investigation. Clinton on learning by her mistakes: LAUER: Obviously, it was not something you said you would do again. I asked before for people to raise their hand if you served in Iraq. Can you do it again? How do you think these people feel when the person running to be their commander-in-chief says her vote to go to war in Iraq was a mistake? CLINTON: Look, I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake. And I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake. I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after-action reports are supposed to do, and so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again. I think I’m in the best possible position to be able to understand that and prevent it. TWZ: This is quite the statement, considering she went on to be the architect of the failed interventionist strategy in Libya – another war that seemed to have no solid plan as to what to do after a dictator had been toppled. Today Libya is a failed state, seething with factional hatred and violence. It is also a thriving operating area for Islamist groups like ISIS. So much so that the US has reengaged there militarily on a sizeable scale in recent weeks . The truth is that we had quietly conducted airstrikes and deployed special forces to Libya long before the recent series of kinetic actions. Libya is not only a mess but it has also destabilized the region, and has made northern Africa more unpredictable place than it once was. This is especially damning for Europe as Libya sits right across the Mediterranean from some of America’s closest allies. So Clinton’s claim that she learned the hard lesson from supporting the intervention in Iraq in 2003 rings hollow at best. Clinton on her strategy to defeat ISIS: QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, as an Army veteran, a Commander-in- chief’s ability to empathize with service members and their families is important to me. The ability to truly understand implications and consequences of your decisions, actions, or inactions. How will you determine when and where to deploy troops directly into harm’s way, especially to combat ISIS? LAUER: As briefly as you can. CLINTON: We have to defeat ISIS. That is my highest counterterrorism goal. And we’ve got to do it with air power. We’ve got to do it with much more support for the Arabs and the Kurds who will fight on the ground against ISIS. We have to squeeze them by continuing to support the Iraqi military. They’ve taken back Ramadi, Fallujah. They’ve got to hold them. They’ve got to now get into Mosul. We’re going to work to make sure that they have the support — they have special forces, as you know, they have enablers, they have surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance help. They are not going to get ground troops. We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again. And we’re not putting ground troops into Syria. We’re going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops. So those are the kinds of decisions we have to make on a case-by-case basis. And, remember, when I became secretary of state, we had 200,000 troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I’m very grateful that we have brought home the vast majority of those. We have a residual force, as you know, in Afghanistan. We have built up several thousands of the folks that I’ve talked about who are assisting in the fight against ISIS. But it is in our national security interest to defeat ISIS. And I intend to make that happen. LAUER: Thank you very much for your question. CLINTON: And as part of it, we’re going after Baghdadi, the leader, because it will help us focus our attention, just like going after bin Laden helped us focus our attention… TWZ: First off, what does she think special operations forces are? I get it, she means regulars, infantry, artillery, logistics etc. but the truth is, those troops are also already deployed to Iraq and even dying in combat . So that statement is inaccurate to begin with even if she were to continue with Obama’s anti-ISIS strategy as-is. The truth is that making such a blanket commitment could greatly hamper America’s options as the battle against ISIS continues to change. Air power has its limitations, especially without plenty of forward air controllers directing airstrikes from the ground. Additionally, even large groups of special operations forces need force protection under certain circumstances. Hillary Clinton above anyone else should know that relying on indigenous forces for this role exclusively can be disastrous (see: Benghazi). Also, why let the enemy know your limitations? Lay out a broad plan of what you would do, sure, but why take anything off the table by saying what you would not do? Oh and her comment about going after al Baghdadi, the Islamic State’s wily leader? The Obama Administration is almost certainly trying to snatch or kill this guy already. There is even a task force dispatched to Iraq for just this sort of operation, and they have been willing to go right into ISIS’s backyard before to go after lower ranking ISIS operatives . So what will a Clinton Administration do that the Obama Administration isn’t already doing in this regard? The answer is simple – nothing. But it sure sounds tough and really doesn’t commit anything that already isn’t in play. Truly a low-risk, high-reward statement.

This week, as the G20 Summit was underway in Hangzhou, China, North Korea launched a trio of ground-mobile Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missiles in quick succession.The missiles flew 620 miles south, deep into Japan’s air defense identification zone in the Sea of Japan. A pair of Nodong-1 missiles rise from a North Korean highway. The launch of three medium-range ballistic missiles, nearly at once, was not only a typical geopolitical cry for attention, but also a signal that North Korea could intend to saturate America’s single forward-deployed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile battery during a time of war. The exact limitations of THAAD’s simultaneous engagement capabilities are not exactly clear, although it is safe to say that a single battery likely will not be able to contend with a large salvo of missiles fired all at the same time, and especially not multiple salvos launched in quick succession. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aNqfwppMx_M Still, North Korea’s liquid-fueled ballistic missiles are vulnerable to preemptive strikes during their fueling stage. Successfully doing so would require that aerial surveillance assets with high-resolution ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar are present and aircraft or missiles are available to quickly be vectored in for an attack. If North Korea were to strike without warning, it is unlikely that these assets would be in place to detect and neutralize even a portion of the threat quickly enough to forestall a mass launch from multiple locations across the North Korean frontier. The limitations of liquid-fueled ballistic missiles have helped keep North Korea’s capabilities “in a box” for decades, but now the Hermit Kingdom is making great strides in solid-fueled missiles . The successful test of a submarine-launched NK-11 just two weeks ago is proof that this technological limitation is no longer the barrier it once was for the North Koreans. As North Korea’s new solid-fuel rocket capabilities migrate to ground-mobile missile systems , they will be able launch far quicker than they can today with liquid-fueled missiles like the Nodong-1. This will make striking these missiles on their transporter-erector-launchers (TELs) while they are in the open and being prepared for launch much harder, even with the help of cutting-edge surveillance systems and armed fighters and missiles on standby. As for the utility of America’s single THAAD battery located in the southern portion of South Korea, its defensive capabilities were already put into question last month following North Korea’s submarine-launched ballistic missile test. Once fully operational, North Korea could launch from the sea, outside the azimuth of coverage that THAAD provides. Additionally, a missile’s range can be sacrificed for a very steep trajectory and high-speed flight profile, which THAAD is not known to have been tested against. A THAAD interceptor is fired from its mobile launcher. , US Army This has prompted calls for the deployment of at least one additional THAAD battery in the region. Combined with the existing system, it could help to cover the sea approaches to South Korea off North Korea’s coasts. There has been no official word if this is something the US is seriously considering, although as Washington comes to terms with North Korea’s rapidly increasing ballistic missile strike capabilities , expect more anti-ballistic missile capabilities to be deployed to the region as a counter-balance. A move that China will not be happy about.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The world’s largest cargo airplanes, all Cold War relics, continue to be in great demand around the globe. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, outsized air cargo charter went from an oddity to a burgeoning cottage industry. The global war on terror, and especially Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, further accelerated its growth, along with an increasingly globalized marketplace that relies on just-in-time manufacturing concepts. So, unless you’re the US Air Force, when a 747 freighter can’t carry it, a chartered An-124 Condor usually does—and sometimes, the world’s largest aircraft, the An-225 Mriya (“Dream”) steps in to do the heaviest of lifting. The giant An-225 on the ramp during charter operations., AP Only one An-225 exists, and it’s operated by Ukraine’s Antonov Airlines. It first flew in late 1988, but lay dormant between 1993 and 2000, after which it was refurbished for charter operations. The metrics are stunning: It carries as much fuel as fourteen 737-800s, and it has a whopping maximum gross weight of 1,411,000 lbs. A total of six Progress D-18 turbofans power the Mriya, totaling nearly 310,000 pounds of available thrust. It’s longer than any other aircraft, and has a wingspan of 290 feet, a metric that is only eclipsed by the Hughes H-4 Hercules, otherwise known as the Spruce Goose. The partially completed carcass of another An-225 has sat idle for decades at Antonov’s plant outside of Kiev, with rumors popping up every few years that it will be brought to life under one scheme or another. This has never happened, and Antonov has hit especially challenging times following Russia’s invasion of Crimea, the shadow war in eastern Ukraine, and the massive crevasse that has formed between the two countries as a result. The second partially completed airframe sits idle at Antonov's plant outside Kiev., Antonov So much of Antonov’s business was intermixed with Russia, which continues to operate their own fleets of Antonov aircraft, including the An-124 Condor , that the company had to be reorganized federally earlier this year. Some projects continue to show promise, like the An-178 , although foreign participation, and the injection of cash that goes along with it, is needed for Antonov to do anything of substance, and, for that matter, to financially stabilize the legendary aircraft maker. This is exactly where China appears to have stepped in, offering cold hard cash for “unique” capabilities—and the ability to reproduce those capabilities themselves down the road. In this case, it’s supposedly putting an updated An-225 into production with Antonov’s help. Janes states: “The agreement signed between the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and Antonov on 30 August gives China access to the aircraft’s designs and technologies for the purposes of domestic production, according to China’s STCN news organisation and the Ukrainian Business Channel (UBR).” China has executed this exact same procurement concept before, whereby it offers quick cash for a couple of existing examples of a particular design before producing them themselves under license (or even without), all with assistance from the original manufacturer. Beijing’s initiative to acquire the largest air cushion landing craft in the world from Ukraine, the Zubr class, was executed just this way. In doing so, China rapidly acquired a highly relevant niche capability at a tiny fraction of the cost, and time required to do it themselves from scratch. Having a cash-hungry partner is the key to making this somewhat lopsided agreement succeed, and Ukraine’s struggling heavy industries are just that partner. Chinese Zubr class LCAC in action. If these reports prove true, China’s interest in the An-225 specifically is interesting to say the least. An updated An-124 is a far more flexible, and likely a far more affordable solution for the vast majority of outsized cargo-hauling needs. It is also an aircraft that China could potentially export. So why opt for the gargantuan Mriya? The aircraft’s genesis may give us the answer. The An-225, which is an evolution of the An-124, was not built to haul locomotives, tanks, or massive drills around Moscow’s sphere of influence; it was built to support Russia’s space program during the waning years leading up to the fall of the Soviet Union. More specifically, it was designed to carry Buran, Russia’s version of the Space Shuttle , and its liquid-fueled “Energia” boosters, as well as other large spacecraft components, on its back. The world's only An-225 with Buran on its back during the last years of the Soviet space program., Ralf Manteufel/Wikicommons In other words, the An-225’s internal cargo hauling ability was a secondary capability, with its ability to lift nearly as much externally as internally (450,000 lbs vs 550,000 lbs), and do it routinely, was what the giant jet was all about. The Mriya’s massive planar tail section is indicative of this design goal, as a single vertical tail would not provide the needed stability when hauling large loads externally, due to the disrupted airflow around the object being transported. The An-225's massive tail section. And it is this capability that China likely wants to acquire on the cheap. Not to ferry around a Chinese version of the Space Shuttle per se—although moving space components externally may be attractive considering Beijing’s burgeoning space program—but to launch spacecraft right off the An-225’s back from the upper limits of the aircraft’s ceiling. This “parasite,” or “air launch to orbit” concept was very trendy during the depths of the Cold War, and is now making a big comeback . In the commercial world, Virgin Galactic’s Spaceship Two and White Knight Two combo use this concept, as does Paul Allen’s Stratolaunch and their absolutely gargantuan “Roc” launch aircraft (you can see the first photos of this crazy aircraft here ). Before that, Orbital Sciences and their L-1011 put the idea to use. Spaceship Two and White Knight Two seen mated together., Virgin Galactic As stated before, the concept goes way back, and using motherships to launch air-breathing jets, usually of the very high-speed and high-flying variety, has an even more colorful history . As such, the military applications of a massive jet, that can haul various other aircraft or rockets on its back to altitude before sending them on their way, are numerous. The dawn of hypersonic weapons that can strike over great distances in a matter of minutes , and small reusable spaceplanes that can put payloads into orbit in an unpredictable fashion, are not just popular theories anymore; they are on the “bleeding edge” of American defense policy , and China is very interested in actively developing these capabilities as well. Pictures of an H-6 bomber lugging what some think is a prototype for a small space plane., Chinese Internet China currently lacks a mothership aircraft larger than their H-6, which has been seen carrying intriguing, space-related payloads . The An-225 likely represents the closest thing to an “off the shelf” opportunity to acquire a credible launch platform for larger, evolved versions of these types of systems. Another plus is that a pocket fleet of updated An-225s could provide China with the heaviest internal cargo airlift capabilities on earth—when they are not being used for more “exotic” purposes. This is not the first time the An-225 was eyed as a first-stage launch platform or parasite mothership. Concepts existed before and after the fall of the Soviet Union that revolved around attaching a small lifting-body shuttle to a bulbous fuel tank and launching it right off the Mriya’s spine ( Russian MAKS , Ukrainian Svityaz and English HOTOL for instance). Russian concept art showing the An-225 carrying the MAKS shuttle and fuel tank combo. None of these concepts came to fruition, but China may now be planning on changing that record once and for all with the acquisition of the world’s mightiest jet hauler—one that was originally designed with just those types of missions in mind.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. 20 years after it was fully retired from combat duty by the Pentagon, the F-4 Phantom Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) has taken its last unmanned flight. The bitter-sweet milestone was marked on August 17 at Holloman AFB in New Mexico, now the QF-4’s only home. The jet was shot at during a weapons test by a pair of AIM-120 AMRAAM slinging F-35s. Apparently the QF-4 was not lost in the test, which is not uncommon as often times these drills feature missiles without warheads. Since the AIM-120 is proximity fused and uses a continuous-rod blast fragmentation warhead, as long as the missile gets close enough to the target it is considered a kill. This allows for the possibility of the FSAT to live another day without significantly impairing test data while also providing telemetry on the missile’s own end-game performance. Now, Detachment One of the 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron (ATRS) will only enjoy a few more months of manned QF-4 operations before the type is finally retired in full this December. Taking over the FSA’s duties will be the more adaptable and far more nimble QF-16 Viper, which has been flown for two years by the 82nd ATRS at Tyndall AFB . The last QF-4 flew from Tyndall last May. This awesome video commemorates the winding-down of operations of the iconic aircraft at the Florida base. A QF-4 is recovered at Holloman AFB., USAF Lieutenant. Colonel Ryan Inman, the former 82nd ATRS commander, stated in a Air Force press release: “The aging fleet of the QF-4s and their limited capabilities against modern fighters have rendered the aerial target workhorse, Phantom II, at its technological limit. The QF-16 initiates the next chapter in advanced aerial targets, predominantly in support of more technologically superior air-to-air weapons test and evaluation programs. The QF-16 will enable our leaner and more efficient Air Force to continue operations at maximum mission effectiveness while maintaining air superiority and global reach for decades to come.” Lieutenant Colonel Ronald Kind, the current commander of the 82nd ATRS, added: “It’s certainly bittersweet. The F-4 served faithfully in Vietnam and as late as the Gulf War. So, for it to be pulled out of the boneyard to continue serving its country is a testament to this airplane — to the designers, the test pilots who first flew it, to the maintainers who’ve worked on it all these years—what a testament to what they’ve been able to do, and what a great airplane it was. Forty-five years later, we are still flying these airplanes to test the latest and greatest equipment we have.” The F-4 still serves around the globe, in the armed forces of Turkey, Greece, Iran, South Korea and Japan. But the next decade will likely be the type’s final operational hurrah. In its better part of a century of service the F-4 has participated in countless battles, executed many heroic feats by some of the bravest and most talented pilots at her controlls, flown for the Blue Angels and the Thuderbirds, as well as the USAF, USMC and US Navy simultaneously. It has also made some ridiculously awesome solo displays , and has been dreamed up in seemingly an endless number configurations and produced under license around the globe with a whopping 5,195 having been built in total.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 14, 2016",Navy’s Troubled New Carrier Undergoing Long Overdue Review,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a move that is astonishingly overdue, Frank Kendall, the Undersecretary Of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, has ordered an independent review of the Navy’s deeply troubled new aircraft carrier, the $13 billion USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78). In a memo obtained by Bloomberg.com , which has lately obtained a lot of sensitive DoD memos , Kendall states the obvious to Secretary of Navy Ray Mabus: “With the benefit of hindsight, it was clearly premature to include so many unproven technologies in the Gerald R, Ford. That decision was made long ago as part of a DoD level initiative called ‘Transformation’… What we have to determine now is whether it is best to stay the course or adjust our plans, particularly for future ships of the class. The first step in that process has to be a completely objective and technically deep review of the current situation.” According to USNI News here are the five areas the memo highlights as the focus of the 60 day study. Why? Because, frankly, they are mess: Power Generation – Propulsion and electrical system components that could be associated with the recent issues discovered with the Main Turbine Generators. Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System – A lack of reliability growth and the ability to support both surge and sustained aircraft operations. Advanced Arresting Gear – The technical challenges identified in system hardware and software, achievement of design performance criteria for the operational envelope, reliability growth, and the ability to support both surge and sustained aircraft operations. Dual Band Radar – Ship integration issues discovered on CVN 78 that need to be avoided with the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar on CVN 79 and later. Advanced Weapon Elevators – System reliability and anticipated growth affecting the ability of installed systems to support requirements for both surge and sustained aircraft operations. The Ford is the first in her class, and teething issues are a given, but its problems are far from transient and seem to stem from the appalling use of concurrency in the ship’s design and procurement process. This included building untested technologies into the ship’s core design, and the consequences of that are amplified by the fact that this is the most expensive single weapon system in the world, and these ships are not built in mass serial production, so mistakes can’t necessarily be “fixed in the next batch.” The, America's first nuclear carrier, the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) sits partially dismantled across the pier from Navy's newest carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford . Congress allowed the Enterprise to be retired without a replacement ready, lowering America's active carrier inventory to 10 ships until the Ford is operational., Huntington Ingalls Still, running this review now will do nothing to ease the USS Ford’s design issues. Even the second in the Ford class, the USS John F. Kennedy , will likely suffer from some of her current failings. But the USS Enterprise , the third ship in the Ford class, could likely see a redesign that will actually port over older, proven technologies back into her baseline design. But the bottom line is that two of America’s newest super carriers—that’s two of just 11 mandated in active inventory at any given time—could be plagued with mission-crippling components and there is not much the Navy can do about it now. A similar situation is occurring configuration-wise with the still-born USS America, and the third ship in her class, albeit for different reasons . All this was easily foreseen. I wrote all about the Ford’s woes and how concurrency has sunk it and other programs in this supersized feature that was originally posted in early 2014 (a must-read to understand this issue). Meanwhile the Navy has been slow to react to the glaring probability that their new super carrier has systemic issues with pretty much all the core systems it needs to successfully accomplish its mission– that being safely launching and recovering aircraft. There has been a lot of optimistic talk about reworking key component designs and questionable improvements in reliability of some of these components, but the timelines keep moving. And when it comes to things like arresting gear and catapults on a carrier, reliability is key. Working some of the time just doesn’t cut it. The nearly complete Ford during a repositioning manuever. , USN The Navy tried to defer critical shock trials in order to speed the Ford’s delivery after multiple unrelated delays, but that decision has since been overturned. The Ford is now slated an early winter delivery, a date that has continuously been pushed back . Still, none of the trouble areas highlighted in Kendall’s memo are likely to be anywhere near fixed by then. The ship will be in testing and its crew in training for two years before the Navy can declare the Ford operational, although even this schedule could prove daunting if key testing and certification goals cannot be met due to unreliable critical components that are still mired in developmental chaos. The goal is to have the CVN-78 ready for combat operations by 2021, at which time the ship will already be five years old, which is 10% of its design life. What the Navy has not spoken a word about is holding anyone accountable within its ranks for such a disaster. That’s the problem really, the DoD has come around to openly admitting their procurement mistakes of the past as of late, whether it be not building enough F-22s , the flawed LCS procurement strategy or the concurrency boondoggle vis-a-vis the F-35 , but there is little policy being put into place to make sure these mistakes don’t happen again. Making things worse is that consequences for these atrocious decisions simply don’t exist and defense contractors have little incentive to see that design goals are met are met on time. In fact, promising the world in an unrealistic timeline and at an unobtainable cost often wins contracts, not the other way around. An angle showing one of the new features of the Ford class, large extension “wings” near the stern of the ship that expand the square footage available on the hangar deck. The platforms area can also be used for new weapons upgrades, such as lasers, and even potentially a vertical launch system., Huntington Ingalls There is light and the end of the tunnel, and programs like the KC-46 are structured so that the contractor shares in the pain of prolonged development times and their own unrealistic estimates. The Virginia class submarine has been a model of how to do procurement properly. But lessons learned are quickly forgotten in the echoing halls of the Pentagon. Without a clearly spelled out a new doctrine for procurement, the Ford class will be just another embarrassing and very costly example in the never ending list of weapons programs that suffer from a military-industrial complex run amok .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Iran Rings Their Most Hardened Nuclear Site With New Russian-Built SAMs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tehran’s mission to obtain updated versions of Russia’s S-300 surface-to-air missile system took a decade to accomplish. Now that they finally have the missile system in hand , the location of one of its first deployments is interesting to say the least. The missiles have appeared around Iran’s nuclear development site carved deep into a mountain at Fordo. For years, the site has been considered Iran’s most sensitive—and also the hardest to attack with conventional weapons. It was among the primary targets for the USAF’s Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), the world’s largest and most powerful conventional bunker-busting bomb. Even after the MOP’s development, more work had to be done so that the bomb would stand a chance at reaching the caverns at Fordo, which were once loaded with cascades of centrifuges working around the clock to enrich uranium. B-52H drops a GPS-guided 30,000 MOP during testing., USAF For Israel, which does not have a heavy bomber capable of deploying anything like the MOP, a ground assault, extreme cyber attacks , and kinetic bombardment of its entrances were the only conventional options available for shutting down Fordo, even temporarily. Still, the threat of attack on the facility mainly emanated from above, and for years Iran made due with a hodgepodge of dated SAM systems to protect it and other underground and sensitive sites . Some of these air defense systems were left over from before the revolution, some were imported from Russia or built under license from China, and some were developed indigenously. Let’s just say, Iran’s integrated air defense system was not the strongest deterrent for advanced air arms. That’s now changing with the introduction of a very mature variant of the S-300, the S-300PMU-2. Components of the S-300 SAM system seen outside Fordo., AP What’s odd is that Fordo’s relevance as a target has diminished significantly since the Iranian nuclear deal was executed last year. The site is no longer enriching uranium on anywhere near the level it once did, and is now mainly relegated to research and development purposes for the civilian applications of nuclear material. As such, Iran’s need to deploy their most advanced missiles to Fordo is puzzling. Then again, it could have been a drill, as the S-300 system is road-mobile and can set up at another location in a matter of hours. At this point, using the S-300 in the anti-access role, where its spheres of engagement overlap along the country’s western border, seems like a better use of the system. That is, if indeed Iran is complying fully with the terms of the P5+1 nuclear agreement. Detractors of the agreement are surely going to use the appearance of the S-300 nearby as evidence that the site continues to hold extreme military value for nuclear weapons, although this logic is questionable. Fordo is Iran’s most hardened site, at least that is known about publically. Regardless of what it’s being used for, this feature alone holds military value. Additionally, research and development of the nuclear kind, even if just for civilian purposes, also holds great strategic value for a country overall—and not just in a military sense. With this in mind, temporarily stationing the S-300 at Fordo makes some sense, although doing so on a permanent basis really does not. An Iranian nuclear technician at work., AP Also, if the nuclear deal were to fall apart and Iran were to revive its enrichment program, having the crews of its best air defense system experienced in providing coverage for the mountainous facility on short notice would make sense.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 8, 2016",Photos Emerge Of North Korea’s Sub-Launched Ballistic Missile After Successful Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea executed another test of its KN-11 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) on August 24th, with the missile flying just over 300 miles before falling into the Sea of Japan. The launch was the most successful yet and was followed by some very interesting images of Kim Jong Un overseeing the whole affair, from the loading of the KN-11 into the vertical launch tube built within the sail of a Sinpo class submarine, to a staged celebration following the launch itself. It’s all just about as “Bond villian” as it gets. The Sinpo class, of which North Korea only appears to have one, was long believed to have been designed with a ballistic missile vertical launch capability in mind, and these images prove that capability once and for all. Kim Jong Un watches the KN-11 missile being loaded into a Sinpo class submarine's vertical launch tube. The KN-11’s 310-mile flight, which ended with the missile crashing into the Sea of Japan instead of exploding mid-course, as it had done before, was considered highly threatening by both South Korea and Japan. The missile was fired on a nearly vertical ballistic trajectory, which trades altitude for down-range performance for testing purposes. If the KN-11 were fired on a more shallow angle, it could reach well over 1,000 miles (likely much further), putting U.S. bases as far away as Okinawa in North Korea’s crosshairs. Even Guam could be threatened by the KN-11 if the submarine were to successfully venture some distance from North Korea’s shores, and/or if the missile were developed further. The diesel-electric Sinpo class is thought to have a continuous subsurface range of around 600 miles. South Korean President Park Geun-hye responded to the launch, stating that “North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats are not imaginary threats any longer, but they’re now becoming real threats . . . Those threats are coming closer each moment.” Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described the launch an “impermissible and outrageous act.” A crane lowers the KN-11 into the submarine's vertical launch tube. The nighttime test launch came as South Korea and the U.S. are conducting annual drills aimed to simulate the response to an attack and invasion by North Korea. Dubbed “Ulchi Freedom Guardian 2016,” over 80,000 troops are taking part in the readiness exercise. With its usual bluster, North Korea warned of a “preemptive nuclear strike” in response to the drills. Instead, they tested their most deadly and dynamic weapon system currently in development. Kim Jong Un celebrates the successful launch with North Korean military brass. The fast pace of Pyongyang’s submarine-launched ballistic missile program, with its first successful cold launch test occurring just four months ago , stands to outpace the capabilities of the single Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile system recently installed in the mountains of south-central South Korea. THAAD can only track and engage targets within about a 120-degree cone in the direction it faces. This puts the North Korean mainland, and their quickly-evolving ground-based ballistic missiles based there , in its crosshairs. But the fact that North Korea is gaining the capability to launch ballistic missiles hundreds of miles from their shores means that the country can execute attacks outside the detection-and-engagement envelope of the single THAAD system. You can see the missile's trajectory on the screen in the background towards the left side of the frame. This reality has resulted in calls for a second THAAD battery to be installed in South Korea to theoretically increase the system’s coverage by another 120 degrees, or 240 degrees in total, although two systems’ conical engagement envelopes are likely to overlap to some degree, decreasing their combined azimuth slightly. Now the question is whether THAAD could intercept a medium-range ballistic missile fired at an extreme trajectory, like that of the KN-11 last week. That’s another issue entirely, as the system has not been tested against countering that profile of attack. Kim Jong Un having a staged “Top Gun” moment in front of the Sinpo class submarine that fired the missile. This latest test will only accelerate an emerging arms race in the region, and South Korea appears to already be planning for the possibility of a nuclear-armed future. Case in point: South Korea’s new class of submarines appears to also feature vertical launch tubes to accommodate ballistic missiles . This capability could provide South Korea with a potent and credible second-strike capability, the ultimate nuclear deterrent. Although the geopolitical ramifications of a nuclearized South Korea could be severe, Seoul could find such a strategy necessary once North Korea has a proven a second strike deterrent of its own. Not to mention it would be an attempt to counter-balance against North Korea’s dozens of miniaturized nuclear warheads it will one day be able to rain down onto South Korea on short notice.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two of the Air Force’s most controversial initiatives were ripped to pieces in separate government reports that were made public this week, with one leaked and one published. Both bring a much needed dose of reality to issues that have in recent months benefitted greatly from huge public relations campaigns aimed to deflect relevant criticism, and even to confuse the public. This has included declaring the F-35A operational, and floating the idea that the USAF is looking at replacing the A-10 that it supposedly can’t afford with no less than two new close air support-oriented platforms. The Pentagon’s director of test and evaluation slams the F-35 program Bloomberg obtained an internal memo originated by the Pentagon’s Director of Test and Evaluation, dated August 9th, 2016. In it, Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department’s director of testing, says “the program is actually not on a path toward success but instead on a path toward failing to deliver the aircraft’s full capabilities, for which the Department is paying almost $400 billion by the scheduled end of its development in 2018.” As we have pointed out before, Gilmore also notes that achieving full combat capability is not likely to occur before developmental testing is complete and operational testing begins. Bloomberg continues: “The program ‘is running out of time and money to complete the planned flight testing and implement the required fixes and modifications’ needed to finish the phase successfully, he said. ‘Flight testing is making progress but has fallen far behind the planned rate.’ “The most complex software capabilities ‘are just being added’ and new problems requiring fixes and verification testing ‘continue to be discovered at a substantial rate, Gilmore wrote to Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James; General David Goldfein, the service’s chief of staff; and Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s acquisitions chief.” As for the idea that the F-35 is ready for combat, Gilmore states that older aircraft would be needed to provide critical support for the F-35 in order to be considered as such, including to “locate and avoid modern threats, acquire targets and engage formations of enemy fighter aircraft due to outstanding performance deficiencies and limited weapons carriage.” The F-35’s sensor fusion capabilities continue to be especially problematic. Flightglobal.com writes: “In the memo, DOT&E detailed over a dozen deficiencies that must still be addressed on Block 3i, but referred to hundreds of capability shortfalls that still remain in Block 3F, which is needed to reach full operational capability, according to the memo. “The F-35A’s sensor fusion system is designed to blend inputs from multiple onboard and offboard sensors into a single picture presented to the pilot, but it still isn’t working. Tracks on single airborne targets are “splitting” on the displays, as the fusion algorithms confuse single tracks with multiple targets. Some airborne tracks simply disappeared from the pilots’ displays and could not be recalled, the memo states. The air force also identified other fusion issues in Block 3i including inconsistent or ineffective electronic warfare capabilities.” F-35 during weapons release tests., Lockheed Martin Among a slew of deficiencies, Gilmore also highlights the F-35’s gun woes, and that it may not even meet its revised testing and operational dates. Bloomberg quotes the memo: “All three models of the F-35 are ‘are at risk of not having a functioning and accurate gun’ in time for the combat testing because ‘significant deficiencies discovered during initial testing’ in 2015 ‘require multiple modifications’ before accuracy testing can begin.” As we have stated previously , the F-35 will likely not be able to test its cannon and helmet-mounted display aiming scheme until at least 2018, as software and hardware delays continue to loom even though the USAF promised it operational by 2017 after previous delays. This memo underscores the reality that, although progress has been made, the jet still has a long way to go regardless of what the manufacturer or the Joint Program Office say, or what arbitrary level of readiness the USAF slaps on the aircraft. Overall, it appears that Mr. Gilmore has come to the same conclusion as we did around the time of the USAF’s declaration of initial operating capability for the F-35A earlier this month. GAO slams USAF for not realizing the implications of canning the A-10 Warthog The Air Force has insufficient data to fully understand and quantify the impact of retiring its nearly 300 A-10 Warthogs by the end of 2021 , according to this report by the Government Accountability Office . Nor does it have any clear plan to replace the aircraft, especially in key roles outside of basic close air support, including the incredibly dynamic and dangerous combat search and rescue armed escort “Sandy” mission . Even the way in which retiring the A-10 fleet will impact the remaining fighter force has been left unaddressed by the USAF. If already tired “legacy” platforms have to fill the gap left by axing so many tactical aircraft over such a short period of time, it could further exacerbate the USAF’s fleet management and cost woes it’s experiencing today. Retiring the A-10 would also require changes to the training requirements of other CAS platforms, especially manned tactical jets. More training for the USAF’s multi-role fighter squadrons on CAS means either more money would have to be allocated to do so, or that training for other critical mission sets will suffer. An A-10 breaks away from a tanker during a long-range ferry operation., USAF There is also the level of overall expertise the A-10 community brings to the CAS mission that would be increasingly degraded over time if the type were retired and its pilots dispersed to other platforms. The Air Force appears to be in the early stages of moving to address this issue, albeit on a wholly inadequate basis, by standing up a F-16 tactics development squadron exclusively for CAS at Nellis AFB. The USAF’s inability to address the impact of these issues with quality data resulted in the GAO concluding that, “Overall, the Air Force did not meet all best practices in estimating cost savings from A-10 divestment, which affected its ability to determine comparable alternatives. In its fiscal year 2015 divestment proposal, we found the Air Force’s cost estimates partially met best practices for being comprehensive, minimally met best practices for being well-documented and accurate, and did not meet best practices for being credible. Because the Air Force’s cost estimate did not meet best practices in these areas, the 2015 proposal potentially overstated or understated the actual savings from A-10 divestment. Additionally, Air Force officials stated they used similar practices to estimate cost savings when developing budget requests for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, thereby continuing to potentially overstate or understate the actual savings from A-10 divestment.” A pair of A-10s flying high over Alaska. , USAF None of this is new. The USAF has muzzled officers, skewed data , and has even misled the public as to an initiative to replace the Warthog with two new platforms despite the fact that the Secretary of Air Force knew nothing about it, and there is clearly no money available to actually do so. But what is new is the level of detail the GAO has put into making their case on lack of quality data to support the USAF’s claims alone. The GAO concludes in their report: “To make a well-informed decision about the future of its A-10 aircraft, we recommend that before again recommending divestment of the A-10, the Secretary of the Air Force: • Develop quality information that fully identifies gaps in capacity or capability that would result from A-10 divestment, including the timing and duration of any identified gaps, and the risks associated with those gaps; and • Use that information to develop strategies to mitigate any identified gaps. In addition, to further inform decisions about the future of the A-10, we recommend the Secretary of the Air Force, in considering divestment, develop a high-quality, reliable cost estimate utilizing best practices. As DOD faces future decisions on how to balance its existing capabilities and capacities against future modernization requirements, it will need quality information to help inform such decisions. To ensure that senior leaders have the quality information on which to base future force structure decisions, we recommend the Secretary of Defense develop and promulgate department-wide guidance that establishes specific informational requirements to be met before proposing divestment of major weapon systems that have not reached the end of their expected service lives. This guidance should require identifying gaps in capacity or capability that will occur for the proposing service and any other service if the divestment proposal is approved; recommending strategies for mitigating any identified gaps; and developing a high-quality, reliable cost estimate of the major weapon system proposed for divestment that can be used to identify alternatives for achieving similar savings.” USAF's future tactical aircraft force structure., GAO In the end, the whole A-10 debate is silly and tiring . The aircraft takes up less than 2 percent of the USAF’s yearly budget, and that does not include the tens of billions of dollars the service receives in addition for highly classified “black” programs. The A-10 is paid for, already upgraded, and ridiculously effective in the wars we are fighting today—not to mention it’s the most cost-effective tactical jet platform in the entire Air Force. It’s clearly a capability worth keeping, as it offers great reward at little cost and should not have to compete with the F-35. Nor should the F-35 have to compete with it. That’s an adversarial concept created by the USAF as part of yet another attempt to axe the A-10, nothing more.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A more empowered Erdogan administration ordered its forces to strike into Syria on Wednesday. Ground combat elements crossed the Turkish-Syrian border in an attempt to “cleanse” the area of ISIS while also making sure that any vacuum these operations create is not filled by Kurdish militia fighters who have been making big gains along the border in recent months. In fact, they have seized at least seven villages in the area in recent days alone. The bulk of the operation included Turkish special forces, backed by armor and air support, working with anti-Assad Arab and Turkmen rebels in and around the border town of Jarablus. The city had been occupied by ISIS and was a major outpost along the Turkish-Syrian border. Clearly, this had major security implications for Turkey, which has suffered from ISIS attacks . Fighting was light. Most of the ISIS foot soldiers and their lieutenants were thought to have fled south before Turkish forces entered the town, which Turkish and rebel forces now occupy. If Turkish forces caught ISIS by surprise, they could have discovered a trove of intelligence, especially relating to how ISIS passes materiel and personnel into Turkey. The name of this operation is Euphrates Shield, and Ankara shows no sign of withdrawing its forces. In fact, this could just be the first move in a long Turkish ground campaign in Syria. A Turkish tank rolls into Syria., AP Vice President Joe Biden met directly with President Erdogan yesterday. It was the highest ranking US-Turkish diplomatic mission since the coup attempt against Erdogan on July 15th, and the reception was chilly . But Biden’s visit was nevertheless a huge show of support by the US for the almost ousted and increasingly totalitarian Turkish head of state. Biden stated after the meeting : “I think the Turks are prepared to stay in an effort to take out ISIL as long as it takes . . . I think there has been a gradual mind shift . . . in Turkey, with the realization that ISIL is an existential threat to Turkey.” Erdogan and Joe Biden meet face-to-face. It was the highest level meeting between the two long-time allies since the coup attempt on Erdogan a month ago., AP =The US fully supports Turkey’s ground incursion into Syria, the first of its kind since Syria fell into deep unrest half a decade ago. US aircraft were said to have supported Turkey’s ground operation in Jarablus. The problem is that Turkey does not run these types of operations against ISIS alone, but they also take the opportunity to put the Kurdish Worker’s Party (PKK) and its militant factions in their crosshairs as well, just as they did when they initially and seemingly reluctantly entered into the anti-ISIS fray by joining the US-led air campaign about a year ago . On the first day of those operations Turkish F-16s attacked ISIS and Kurdish targets, throwing the operation under a single unifying “anti-terrorism” label. It appears that Operation Euphrates Shield will be no different. The PKK and the Turkish government, especially the Erdogan regime, are bitter and long-standing enemies (you can read all about this complex conflict here ). Just today a car bomb ripped through a Turkish Police headquarters in the tense northeastern Turkish border town of Cizre. 11 Turkish officers were killed in the blast. The PKK is said to have taken responsibility for the attack, claiming it was retaliation for atrocities it claims Turkish security forces executed against the people of Cizre during crackdowns. The UN is working to investigate the deaths of some 100 people who are said to have been burned alive while huddling in a basement during a Turkish security operation in the city. A bomb blast claimed by the PKK killed 11 Turkish police in the conflicted border town of Cizre., AP Operation Euphrates Shield also signals a fairly large shift in US allegiances, one that is clearly in Turkey’s favor. For some time now the US has become increasingly tighter with YPG, PYD and YPJ units, the militant arms associated with the Kurdish PKK, sending in special forces to train, support, and advise these hardened fighters in their operations against ISIS. Arms have also flowed toward these relatively poor groups as they have been proven to be among the most effective soldiers at fighting ISIS. Now with Turkey pushing into Syria, the Kurds, who hold large amounts of the territory along the Turkish-Syrian border, are put under direct threat. The fact that the US has gone as far as supporting the Turkish ground incursion into Syria directly with aerial assets is a big tell that Washington is willing to endanger its relationship with the Kurdish militia forces in Syria to keep the US-Turkish relationship from crumbling. Kurdish forces affiliated with the PKK move through the Syrian countryside in technicals. , AP In the weeks following the coup attempt on the Erdogan administration, Turkey has pivoted away from the US, even blaming it for the events of July 15th. Meanwhile the once very cool relationship with Russia following Turkey’s shooting down of a Russian Su-24M attack jet in November have rapidly thawed. Even the possibility of Russia being invited by Turkey to use Incirlik Air Base alongside the US has been floated. As a result, real questions about Erdogan’s commitment to NATO and the long-running US-Turkey relationship have surfaced. Even America’s nuclear arms stored in Turkey have become the subject of a major strategic policy debate. Apparently, the US made some sort of deal with Turkey whereby it would use its influence among the various Kurdish militias to keep them from advancing west along the border with Turkey, especially near where Turkish troops are operating. In exchange Turkey would not mount a full offensive against them. This lasted just over a day as Turkey let loose a barrage of artillery shells on Kurdish fighters it said were advancing towards their position from about half a dozen miles away. Obviously Turkey fears that the power vacuum in Syria will allow Kurdish forces, who have been super-charged by US backing, to create an autonomous enclave along the Turkish border. This puts the US in a strange place where they have to tell the fighters they are backing and who are so effective at routing ISIS to not capitalize on the momentum they have gained, basically commanding them to operate against their own interests and that of the people they are fighting for. Turkish artillary sits at the ready along a ridge., AP During Biden’s visit with Erdogan the Vice President made it clear that the Pentagon has instructed Kurdish forces it works with not to advance west of the Euphrates River and that these militias would lose the support of the US if they did. The fact that this order was not followed, at least according to Turkey, is a sign of how limited Washington’s power actually is when it comes to controlling the maelstrom of forces that it supports in the Syrian conflict. Although, it should be no surprise that a country mortgages much of its command and control capability when fighting a war via a hodgepodge of proxies, each with its own unique set of motivations and cultural, religious and ethnic alliances and grudges. Russia clearly is non plussed by the idea of Turkey setting up shop on the ground in Syria. Doing so directly threatens the Assad regime, which Russia backs, and which has made some serious progress itself when it comes to taking back control on large swathes of territory in recent months. Not only did the Kremlin condemn the move, but they abruptly cancelled a key high-level meeting between military officials in Ankara. Turkish tanks staging along the Syrian border., AP Now we will have to see exactly what cards Turkey plays next in Syria. Do they plan on exiting the conflict once their Arab and Turkmen sponsored fighters have embedded themselves in deeply in Jarablus, or is the Turkish military going to bed down there and look to expand deeper into Syria with more proxy fighters by their side? If so, Russia surely will not take such a strategy well. Meanwhile the US seems to once again be drawn to Turkey’s military might and regional influence regardless of how it may affect the more humble array of allies they have assembled to fight against ISIS in Syria. Endangering the support of those who have proven to be loyal and terrifyingly effective anti-ISIS fighters to appease and get the support of Turkey may prove to be a fatal mistake for the US when it comes to its strategy in Syria. Especially considering how unpredictable a far more powerful and independently minded Erdogan administration may become. A Turkish armored fighting vehicle on the roll., AP Above all else, Turkey’s surprise push into Syrian territory, and the rebel fighters they have assembled to help them do so, is yet another complication to an already mind-numbingly complicated affair. The spiraling Game of Thrones-esque Syrian power struggle is so variable that it makes implementing an actual strategy to eliminate ISIS and stabilize the country nearly impossible to execute. There are simply too many cooks in the kitchen, all of which seem to be making a different dish.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 16, 2016",Iran May Have Booted Russia from an Air Base for “Betraying Their Trust”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s grand marketing of aerial combat operations over Syria have rubbed their most recent hosts—the Iranians—the wrong way. Last week, Russian Tu-22M3 Backfire bombers, Su-34 Fullback fighter-bombers and IL-76 tanker-transports began appearing at Hamedan Air Base in western Iran . The aircraft began flying combat operations over Syria, and filming the action along the way for all to see. Apparently this and the other parts of the Kremlin-led media blitz regarding the new base did not sit well with the Iranians who have uncharacteristically come out saying they have revoked Russia’s invitation to use its airfields. The New York Times writes : “Iran’s minister of defense, Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan, accused Russia of having publicized the deal excessively, calling the Kremlin’s behavior a “betrayal of trust” and “ungentlemanly”…. “We have not given any military base to the Russians and they are not here to stay,” General Dehghan said. The two countries had “no written agreement” for use of the base, he said, adding that it was only a temporary agreement on refueling. Russia announced what it described as a deal to use the Iranian base on Aug. 16, saying it would shorten the distance flown by long-range bombers, which had been flying from southern Russia.” Iran must have expected the Russian Ministry of Defense wouldn’t have disclosed the arrangement directly. Beyond Russian leaks, the word would have still gotten out quite quickly. The US can track the aircraft as they transit to and from the base, passing over Iraqi airspace in the process. Still, when it comes to Iranian domestic consumption of information, the arrangement could have remained officially unaddressed or even flatly denied. Instead Russia’s grandstanding about it caused quite the stir among many Iranians who see any occupying power, no matter how limited in scale, as untrustworthy and as a direct threat to Iranian sovereignty. The fact of the matter is that the US also limits information on forward deployed forces from time to time, especially while they are operating out of sensitive locations. Often times these bases are unofficially well known but are not freely disclosed during official briefings, press releases and interviews. These locales are usually referred to as a “forward operating location in the XXXX region” or similar terminology. Operating out of Iranian territory gave Russia’s bombers an upper hand by decreasing their flying distance to Syrian airspace massively, thus upping the potential sorties a single aircraft can fly in a certain amount of time. Yet when the Su-34s showed up there the whole operation seemed to reek of the same packaged set-piece photo ops that have become almost comical since Russian aircraft began flying sorties over Syria nearly a year ago. The Su-34s could just as easily have flown out of Russia’s airbase south of Latakia, but the optics of doing so would have had little strategic impact. By operating out of Iran, with strategic weaponry no less, Russia sent yet another message to the world that Russia’s influence in the Middle East is growing as is its global military footprint and abilities to project power abroad. It also reminded the powers that be that Russia can and will operate from friendly territory in the region just as the US does, and not just at the request of regimes it is stepping in to save. Yet while pushing a couple of bombers and some tactical aircraft to an Iranian base for a short period of time may have large geopolitical implications, it has few tactical ones. Yet when it comes to the information war, Russia’s short stint at the Iranian airbase likely achieved its goals. Once again Russia gets a huge bang for its buck when it comes to producing impactful propaganda while risking relatively little. Iran seems to agree with this conclusion as well, with the Washington Post stating : “Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan on Monday attacked publications of the Russian military press that reported the use of Iran’s air base. “There has been a kind of showing-off and inconsiderate attitude behind the announcement of this news,” he told an Iranian television channel. “Naturally, the Russians are keen to show that they are a superpower and an influential country and that they are active in security issues in the region and the world,” Dehghan said…” Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 1, 2017",Northrop Grumman’s T-X Jet Trainer Contender Emerges at Mojave Air and Space Port,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Prime aerospace defense contractors are throwing everything they have into the competition to replace the venerable T-38 Talon as the United States Air Force’s next jet trainer. Dubbed the T-X program, this new jet is supposed to bridge the gap between primary training on the T-6 Texan II and the advanced fighters that student pilots will one day fly, such as the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. About 350 jets are envisioned to be initally ordered by the USAF, but that number could grow substantially as export customers emerge—and if the aircraft ends up providing additional duties for the Pentagon. Namely, a version of the T-X, which will be far more maneuverable than the already-nimble T-38, could find a serious niche in the adversary support mission. A T-38A in formation with an F-22A., USAF This is especially true as fifth-generation stealth fighters continue to fill USAF flight lines. These aircraft are more expensive to fly and maintain than many of their geriatric fourth-generation counterparts; flying them against one another for basic training, thus, is a huge waste of money. This massive demand for third-party adversary support is something I predicted years ago , and now we are seeing large growth in the marketplace and the inclusion of T-38s in fighter wings flying F-22s. You simply don’t need an F-35 to act as a target for another F-35. The USAF is coming to terms with this reality, and the expansion of the F-35 fleet will only force the subject further into the limelight. With few major aircraft contracts out there these days as the Pentagon aims to cut the number of different types of aircraft in service, the T-X represents a massive opportunity for manufacturers to stay in the high-performance tactical aircraft game. With this in mind— and seeing that the T-X requirements are for a highly-agile trainer , which shares many charistics with front-line tactical fast jets—some of the competitors have gone all out in an attempt to bring “clean sheet” designs to life. Of the competitors, Northrop Grumman-BAE and the Boeing-Saab consortiums will put forward entirely new designs. Originally, Northrop Grumman intended to run with an updated version of BAE System’s Hawk T2 trainer, but that idea was axed when it was clear that the 40-plus-year-old design would not meet the USAF’s lofty performance requirements. Following this change in strategy, Northrop Grumman’s design process became especially secretive—although it was widely known that Scaled Composites , a company that dramatically changed aviation under legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan and was acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2007, would be heavily involved. Scaled Composites effectively led the industry into the world of large composite aircraft structures and rapid prototyping, although this technology has become widespread throughout the aerospace industry in the last few decades. Still, the name Scaled Composites carries a lot of cache, and they usually are at least one step ahead of the competition when it comes to aerospace technology. This unique Scaled Composites-Northrop Grumman heritage was clearly evident when the company’s T-X broke cover on Friday. Dubbed the Model 400, the aircraft looks like a modernized, composite hybrid of the T-38 Talon and the F-20 Tigershark . It packs a single F404-GE-102D engine,  a derivative of the same engine used in the F/A-18A/D, the JAS-39A/D (Volvo RM12), the F-117A, and India’s Tejas light fighter—as well as Lockheed’s T-X competitor, the T-50A.  The engine/airframe appears to lack an expanding nozzle usually indicative of an afterburning capability, so either Northrop-Grumman’s design is made to perform on dry thrust alone, or it will add afterburning capabilities on a later prototype. That said, it is also possible that a simpler, internal nozzle could be built into the design, which could enhance aerodynamic performance, save weight, and lower costs. Northrop-Grumman's “Model 400” being towed at Mojave Air and Space Port, home of Scaled Composites., Used with photographer’s approval It is likely that BAE Systems and its partners (L-3, primarily) will provide much of the aircraft’s avionics systems integration, including its high-end synthetic tactical training suite . Decades of developing this system for the Hawk may pay off huge for the T-X competition, as the system is proven and can save money in more abstract ways than flight hours and sustainability costs alone. Ultimately, this design can potentially be pitched as an entirely new aircraft while still leveraging Northrop’s hugely successful T-38 Talon lineage—a strategy that has proven itself in the past. Take the Super Hornet; it is effectively an all-new design, but was easily pushed through the Pentagon, the White House, and Congress because it could be pitched as a cost-effective “evolution” of an existing (and proven) aircraft. A “composite T-38” could accomplish this as well. If the jet’s price tag is also appealing, it could be very tough for its competitors to beat. It is thought the Model 400’s official roll-out and first flight will occur sometime early next year. In the meantime, Lockheed has been touting its highly-mature T-50A , while Raytheon and Alenia Aermacchi’s M-346/T-100A is already serving the Italian, Singaporean, and Israeli Air Forces, with Poland to receive its jets soon. Israel's M346 Lavi in operation., Oren Rozen/wikicommons The closest competition to Northrop Grumman’s clean-sheet design route, then, may be the Boeing-Saab consortium. Their new design has only been teased in a few limited renderings, but these two companies are a good match and have proven to be able to build cost-effective, sustainable, and highly-relevant tactical aircraft while staying on budget in the past. Concept art of Boeing-Saab's T-X contender. , Boeing Lara Seligman over at Aviation Week put together this cool little primer on the competition ; it’s well worth clicking through if you need to be brought up to speed. With billions on the line, the T-X competition will be a literally a fight-to-the-death for some of the aircraft involved. Clean-sheet trainer designs that lose competitions don’t have a great track record of going on to great things. The USAF is seeking to release its final RFP by the end of the year and aims to make an award in 2017, although that date seems optimistic. Initial operational capability is slated for 2024, but depending on the state of the USAF’s budget and the development of the chosen trainer, this could also slip. Then again, with the rise of unmanned aircraft and the great potential advanced unmanned combat air vehicles hold , how many advanced new jet trainers that will supposedly operate for decades to come does America’s air force really need?

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 27, 2016",F-22 Raptors Swoop in to Protect US Special Ops Forces in Northwest Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Syrian fixed-wing tactical jets have begun appearing in northwest Syria, a place where the Assad regime has little control and where hundreds of US special operations forces are “advising” and “training” Syrian Democratic Forces. This allied fighting group is comprised of people from various religious backgrounds, all aimed at taking out ISIS. The vast majority of them are hardened Kurdish YPJ and YPG fighters. On Thursday, the United States scrambled jets to intercept Syrian aircraft conducting a series of air strikes close to the city of Hasakah. This population center is important because it’s home to American operators based alongside their indigenous counterparts. By the time the US fighters arrived, the Syrians had left. During their time overhead, the Syrian jets had attacked Kurdish positions on the outskirts of the city, and they did not respond to Kurdish forces who desperately tried to hail them on an emergency frequency. After the incident, the US warned the Syrian regime not to conduct flight operations—especially air strikes—in that part of the country. It is unclear if Assad’s representatives responsed to the US warning. Following the brazen attack, the Pentagon immediately assigned around six fighter aircraft to provide continuous combat air patrols in and around Hasakah. Then on Friday, two Syrian Su-24 Fencers approached the same area. This time the US was ready, and super-cruising F-22s swooped in to confront the Soviet-era swing-wing attack jets. According to a US official quoted by ABC News , the F-22s “encouraged the Syrian aircraft to depart the airspace without further incident. No weapons were fired by the coalition.” The Raptor has been active in Syria since airstrikes commenced in that country nearly two years ago, striking targets with small diameter bombs and JDAMs, and providing counter-air escort duties for strike packages. In fact a handful of Raptors, usually around six, has had a continuous presence in the Middle East long before air strikes on ISIS and Al Nusra in Syria ever began. In 2013 a pair of the stealth fighters even came to the rescue of a US MQ-1 Predator drone that was being harassed by Iranian fighters. A F-22 tanks from a KC-135 at night during combat operations in the Middle East. , USAF While this latest incident sets a new precedent for the Syrian Air Force, which has remained active almost exclusively in the western part of the country, Russia executed a similar attack just last June —one that clearly had ulterior motives . It is not clear whether Thursday’s airstrike by Syria were meant to push the US into sharing intelligence information with the Russians (who will then share it with the Assad regime). If the Assad regime were to open up another major front in western Syria against Kurdish forces, it would complicate an already extremely complicated conflict. It would also disrupt the Pentagon’s plans to use these forces to eventually exterminate ISIS from the country. If US forces were killed in a Syrian or Russian air strike or ground action, it could also lead to a much wider and far more unpredictable war. Another complication: Turkey is in the process of pivoting toward Moscow and possibly away from the US and its long-established NATO ties. The Kurdish Workers Party, known as the PKK, are enemies of Turkey, and have been linked to multiple terrorist attacks in that country. Recently, the PKK even shot down a Turkish Cobra attack helicopter . Turkey has fought the PKK’s militia arms, the YPG and YPK, for decades, bombing them seemingly at any chance they get . It is a bitter and bloody conflict with no end in sight. The fact that the US is actively training and equipping these forces also doesn’t sit well with Ankara. Syrian Kurdish fighters with their three major weapons of war: The AK-47, RPG, and Toyota pickup truck., AP With this in mind, the Assad regime’s forces could begin attacking Kurdish positions at the request of Moscow who itself would be making such a request on Turkey’s behalf and to solidify Assad’s rule over Syria as a whole. Clearly, Damascus, Ankara and Moscow fear what could happen once ISIS is eliminated and a large hardened fighting force of US trained and equipped Kurds and other groups turn their gaze westward toward the Assad regime. As such, Syria’s air strikes Thursday could be the start of a preemptive collaborative campaign between Russia, Turkey and Syria to neuter Kurdish combat capability in the western part of Syria, or at least to forestall its further growth. Putin and Erdogan bury the hatchet after nine months of tensions following the shooting-down of a Russian Su-24 by Turkish F-16s. , AP Turkey calls the Kurds terrorists, Russia and Assad calls anyone who challenges the Assad regime also terrorists. If they joined forces they could potentially give the Erdogan Administration what it has always wanted—a way to crush the Kurdish threat from within Syria’s own borders using someone else’s army.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 30, 2016",Here We Go Again: USAF Aims to Stand Up Dedicated F-16 CAS Squadron At Nellis AFB,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even though the USAF has shuttered the 65th AGRS based out of Nellis AFB , its only F-15C/D aggressor squadron, our friends at Combat Aircraft Monthly say a new F-16 unit is slated to be activated at the base . This new unit will be made up of eight Block 40 F-16C/Ds, with the squadron envisioned to grow to 16 aircraft as the F-35 comes on line and replaces the Viper in front-line units. The F-16s’ mission will reportedly be tightly focused on close air support . Combat Aircraft writes: “The CAS Integration Group’s mission will include high-end training as well as an increased emphasis on tactical level CAS, with experts to integrate fires in joint operations, advancing the joint CAS enterprise and preserving the USAF ‘CAS culture’. Gen ‘Hawk’ Carlisle, commander of ACC said: ‘The changes we’re making at Nellis are an important step in refining our CAS skills through future generations of Airmen so we can continue to provide ground forces with all the advantages air power brings to close combat.’” This all sounds good and well. But there are a few tells here that indicate this new unit could be forming to help bolster the case for retiring the USAF’s most underappreciated tactical asset—the A-10 Warthog. “Preserving the USAF CAS Culture” has been a major issue raised in regards to retiring the A-10; you don’t just retire the plane, you also retire the community that supports it. And that community has been laser-focused on providing extremely high-quality close air support under the most challenging conditions for nearly four decades. Multi-role fast jets and their aircrews have to accomplish many tasks as well as CAS, and although they are capable of the mission—especially when spooled up for it via intensive training before deployment—America’s CAS “brain trust,” so to speak, exists within the A-10 community. If it goes by the wayside, all the experience built up over decades of testing tactics in combat environments will slowly decay. This phenomenon is largely referred to as “brain drain” in Pentagon parlance. With this and the USAF’s dogged determination to quickly retire the A-10 in mind, moving some of that brain trust over to an F-16 unit gives the impression that the Air Force is trying to check off a box on the Warthog’s death warrant. A-10s on the line at night., USAF Thing is, the USAF has long lusted over the idea of replacing the Warthog with Vipers. The force even went so far as to strap a 30mm cannon pod onto the F-16’s centerline, load up the jet with new avionics, paint a batch of them green and stand up a constellation of units to focus on CAS tactics and development. (One of these, in fact, was based at Nellis AFB two and a half decades ago.) The big gun-toting F-16, dubbed the A-16 and the F/A-16 at various points, failed miserably at its job. The vibration from the cannon was far too much for the “electric jet” to withstand, and accuracy was piss-poor. Even with its cutting-edge technology, the attack Viper simply didn’t hold a candle to an aircraft designed from the ground-up for low-level CAS and battlefield interdiction—and to survive taking one or many hits in the process. Read all about the A-16 program and how it tried to shoot down the A-10 once and for all in this feature I wrote in 2014. CAS-optimized F-16s sit on ramp at Nellis AFB circa 1990. The announcement of a USAF F-16 squadron dedicated to CAS also comes as the USAF continues to spastically put forward initiatives to replace the A-10— not with the F-35 as it has tried to justify in the past , but now with a pair of ambiguous new platforms . I predicted the Air Force would do exactly this , and I also maintain that all this is just vaporware . In fact, even after all the USAF’s bluster about a “two platform solution” over the summer and the salivating media carrying the story as fact, Secretary of the Air Force Deborah James proved it is indeed all talk : “So far I have read about this in the news. I have not actually seen a proposal on any of this that has come forward to me. So it sure is pre-decisional. It hasn’t been decided on,” she said. “Where would we get the money? Not at all clear to me.” The A-10 in its element., USAF The Secretary, who has been very forthcoming about controversial issues that past USAF brass have traditionally “circled the wagons” around, stated there is no money for any of these plans. Flight hours for aircrews are already in the toilet , and the USAF will not be able to afford the tactical aircraft fleet it currently has by 2021 according to their own numbers. (Interestingly enough, 2021 is the same year the USAF plans to sneakily put the A-10 out to pasture .) And on top of that, the Air Force still has multiple big-ticket items in development, many of which are still fiscally unpredictable (B-21, F-35, etc). The USAF says it cannot even afford the A-10—which it owns outright and has recently upgraded—today. The A-10 is Air Force’s cheapest manned tactical asset to operate. So how is it going to be able to afford to develop, procure, and operate a two-aircraft CAS solution? Simple answer: It can’t, unless it wants to give away some very high-profile programs that have missions far more sexy than CAS. Which it won’t. Now we have reached the point where it seems as if the USAF is willing to build a little time capsule for CAS expertise by standing up an F-16-equipped mini-squadron at Nellis, as if doing so would give the service access to all the CAS lessons learned in the past. News flash: CAS is what the USAF is doing combat-wise today, every day, against an enemy that shows no signs of fading into the history books. The best aircraft for that mission remains the A-10, and the best place for safekeeping of CAS expertise is within the A-10 community—the same place it has been vested successfully for nearly 40 years. An A-10 pilot sitting in the jet's “titanium bathtub” cockpit., USAF So next time you read a headline toting the USAF’s grand plans to replace the A-10, rest assured it is just more mental masturbation coming from a flying service in total denial of the fiscal realities that will continue to mount in the coming decade.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 11, 2019",European News Outlet Claims U.S. Has Transferred Nukes From Turkey To Romania,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Only a couple days after we broke down America’s risky nuclear weapons policy in Turkey , European news outlet EurActiv reports that the U.S. has redeployed at least a sizable portion of its arsenal of B61 nuclear bombs from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to Deveselu Air Base in Romania. The Romanian base is the home of America’s highly sensitive Aegis Ashore anti-ballistic missile facility , which includes a magazine of advanced SM-3 Block 2B missile interceptors . Closed in 2003, the base fell into an increasingly dilapidated state for nearly a decade before the U.S. selected it for its missile defense initiative in 2011. Beginning in late 2013, the facility was rapidly overhauled and adapted for the anti-ballistic missile mission. The Aegis system was certified operational just last May , and while it is designed to defend against low-volume launches of medium-range ballistic missiles from rogue states, Russia still detests its existence . Having sought verification for the claims made by its sources, EurActiv writes: NATO sent EurActiv a diplomatically worded comment which implies that allies must make sure that US nuclear weapons deployed in Europe remain “safe”. “On your question, please check the Communiqué of the NATO Warsaw Summit (published on 9 July 2016), paragraph 53: “NATO’s nuclear deterrence posture also relies, in part, on United States’ nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe and on capabilities and infrastructure provided by Allies concerned. These Allies will ensure that all components of NATO’s nuclear deterrent remain safe, secure, and effective,” a NATO spokesperson wrote to EurActiv.” Which certainly sounds like a fuzzy answer to a question that could be easily denied, although murky official responses as to inquiries regarding U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe have been the norm since the bombs first arrived there more than half a century ago. It is against NATO’s own policy to forward-deploy nuclear weapons to the territory of “new” eastern European NATO members such as Romania as defined by The Founding Act of 1997, which states : “The member States of NATO reiterate that they have no intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members, nor any need to change any aspect of NATO’s nuclear posture or nuclear policy – and do not foresee any future need to do so. This subsumes the fact that NATO has decided that it has no intention, no plan, and no reason to establish nuclear weapon storage sites on the territory of those members, whether through the construction of new nuclear storage facilities or the adaptation of old nuclear storage facilities. Nuclear storage sites are understood to be facilities specifically designed for the stationing of nuclear weapons, and include all types of hardened above or below ground facilities (storage bunkers or vaults) designed for storing nuclear weapons.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=O5BEu6EdEZc Unlike NATO, Bucharest is flatly denying the report . Beyond the unprecedented political and policy complications that would come with establishing a U.S. nuclear presence in Romania—including the impact it would have on already-shaky Russian-Romanian relations—there would be physical issues with transporting, storing, and deploying the weapons from Deveselu Air Base. First off, Deveselu Air Base is effectively no longer an air base at all. Its 8,500-foot runway was eliminated as part of the Aegis Ashore facility construction plan and the surrounding infrastructure that was built up around it. ( See satellite imagery of the facility here. ) This means the weapons would have to flown into another airport located dozens or hundreds of miles away, then moved by road to Deveselu. Such a complicated logistical scenario would represent a massive set of security issues, both at the non-U.S.-controlled airfield and along the route during ground transport. Helicopters such as the CH-47 or CH-53 could be used, but doing so would require a deployment to Romania. In addition, using vertical-lift assets for this type of mission would represent a host of security and health contingencies that would have to be addressed at length. Aegis Ashore facility in Romania., DANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP/Getty Images And because there is no runway at Deveselu, how would said tactical nuclear bombs even be put to use during a time of war? They would have to transferred to another facility equipped with a long runway, where they would meet tactical aircraft that would have to deploy there on sudden notice (likely days, not hours), along with personnel and equipment that would enable a sortie to be executed. And once at that airport or air base, where would the weapons be safely stored? Even the nuclear weapons stored at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey have questionable utility , as there are no aircraft assigned or consistently rotated through there with trained crews waiting for the doomsday klaxon to sound. But at least the capability could theoretically be provided on a relatively short notice. At Deceselu, even that would be impossible. Weapons Storage and Security System vault in raised position holding a B61 nuclear bomb. The vault is within a Protective Aircraft Shelter., Public Domain/WikiCommons Then there is the question of how these nukes would be stored at Deveselu in the first place? The base lacks the WS3 vaults designed for this purpose, as it is only meant to be equipped with SM-3 hit-to-kill interceptors. So unless the base has a secret storage facility, it cannot contain thermonuclear weapons in a manner up to the needed standards of security. So when you take all this into account, all the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that EurActiv ’s report is likely false.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 15, 2016",Russia Has Revived its Armored Trains,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s ongoing campaign to reinvigorate its armed forces has included the addition of new weapon systems and the refurbishment and upgrade of Cold War relics. Now it appears that armored trains, once a mainstay of Russian combat logistics, have been brought out of mothballs and thrust into drills. It is the first time these trains, named Baikal and Amur , have participated in exercises in a decade and a half. The logistical exercise starts in the Volograd region and will move through Krasnodar before heading to North Ossetia and finishing in Crimea, the peninsula Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. The four armored trains from Russia’s post-Soviet era saw limited service in Chechnya and Georgia, but experts believed they were partially dismantled by the late 2000s. Now, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has ordered these trains back into combat-capable service—probably not a cheap move. The configuration of Russia’s armored trains can vary, but they are capable of carrying tanks and APCs, and usually have platforms and armored cars that carry anti-aircraft guns and artillery. Armor-clad troop cars are also a standard feature, and the locomotives are substantially hardened against kinetic attacks. In any form, they look intimidating as hell. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Rk0B5viWDFM The traditional mission of these trains is to escorts supply trains, repair tracks in a combat zone, clear mines, defend key logistics positions and support infantry. They can also transport very high-value material or personnel. It all sounds very World War II, right? But there is something to the concept as the rails remain Russia’s most critical military logistical conduit. Moscow’s ability to rapidly morph its force posture along its western border, often using trains to do so, has even been identified by NATO leaders as an impressive and downright frightening capability. A Russian armored train during WWII., Iconic Archive/Getty Images It is notable that although these trains are back in service, they don’t seem to be upgraded with modern weapons and sensors, which mutes the concept’s relevance. One can imagine a modern armored train that is Kashtan or Panstir S1 equipped and features guided “smart” artillery. The thing is that in an age of precision guided weapons and massive information, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, totally predictable trains are vulnerable whether they are armored or not. Although when not fighting against a peer-state competitor—one without access to precision guided weapons and advanced ISR capabilities—the armored train is just as relevant as it was decades ago. Russia obviously has some reason to put these trains back into service and to thrust them into this elaborate training exercise. Let’s hope one of them doesn’t make an appearance in eastern Ukraine or in the Baltics as part of a larger operation. These armored trains are not the only way Russia is weaponizing the rails. The Kremlin is working to bring back rail-deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles with the project named Barguzin after the strong eastern wind that blows off Lake Baikal. The trains will have reinforced missile erector-launchers disguised to look like typical refrigeration cars, just as the Soviet-era versions did before they were retired in 1993. These new nuke trains will tote around RS-24 ‘Yars’ ICBMs , Russia’s most capable and modern operational weapon of mass devastation. Like their ground-mobile ICBMs cousins , these trains will roam the Russian countryside, although in an ever more inconspicuous manner. Russia aims to have the trains in service by 2019.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 23, 2016",Russia Flies First Bomber Strikes From Iranian Base Under Unprecedented Agreement,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday we reported on photos and reports emerging out of Iran depicting Russian Tu-22M3 Backfire bombers and IL-76 tanker-transports descending onto Hameden Air Base, in the western expanse of that country. This was not just a pit stop. As predicted, the bombers were part of a forward basing scheme that ushers in a whole new realm of Russian-Iranian military cooperation. This deployment has since been confirmed by the Russian Ministry of Defense, and the bombers have already flown their first combat mission, passing over Iraq and into Syria. The bombers hit targets in and around the besieged eastern Syrian city of Deir-ez-Zor. They were accompanied by Russian Su-30 and Su-35 who flew their portion of the mission out of Russia’s air base outpost south of the Syrian port city of Latakia. Here is supposed footage from the mission: https://youtube.com/watch?v=dnxlcupfzCc The deployment is part of a signed military agreement between Russia and Iran to station an unknown amount of aircraft at Hamadan Air Base. It may also include the sharing of other facilities. Iranian news outlet IRNA said Ali Shamkhani, the Secretary of Supreme National Security Council, stated the following regarding the arrangement: “Iran and Russia enjoy strategic cooperation in the fight against terrorism in Syria and share their facilities and capacities to this end.” Reports also state that Russia is requesting overflight permission for more Kalibr cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea by its heavily armed missile boats stationed there. A tactic that was odd to begin with, and even more so now that Russia has heavy bombers positioned in-theater. Russia’s lack of a robust and heavy-hitting aerial precision attack capability may necessitate the use of these cruise missiles for certain high-priority target sets. This leap from “mutual cooperation” to Iran allowing forward basing of some of Russia’s most destructive aircraft could have significant strategic implications. Now Russia has bases in Syria and Iran, sandwiched in between is war torn Iraq that is fractured along sectarian lines. Iran is heavily involved with backing the increasingly powerful Shiite militias in Iraq , putting its own commanders on the ground to lead them in battle as well as providing them with material and air support. Meanwhile, the US backs the more diverse Iraqi Army and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, among other smaller factions. A Tu-22M departs in full reheat. , Alex Beltyukov/wikicommons Today, these factions have a common enemy in ISIS, but once that enemy is removed from the equation, a major fight for control of Iraq seems likely. If Iran can exert proxy control over Iraq, leveraging the Shiite majority in that country, Russia would be able to draw a line of great influence traveling from the Iran’s eastern border with Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf, to Syria’s coast on the Mediterranean Sea. This all begs the question: Would Russia use its air power and newly established nearby basing to support Iran’s bid for proxy control of Iraq? It is very possible. Such a situation, one where once again the US would find itself diametrically opposed to Russia’s will, could be far more volatile the than the one in Syria today.

Photos (below) show them accompanied by at least one IL-76 tanker-transport. The Backfires have supposedly been deployed there for air strikes again ISIS. If these reports prove true, the deployment would be an unprecedented sign of Iranian-Russian military cooperation, and another indicator that Russia is far from finished with its use of fixed-wing air power in the region . Tu-22M3s have been suddenly active once again over Syria, flying long-range missions originating from within Russia’s borders and accompanied by forward-deployed Flanker derivatives once entering Syrian airspace. Basing the bombers at Hamedan Air Base would cut flight distance and time by nearly two and a half times when compared with originating sorties out of Russia, thus drastically increasing Russia’s sortie rates while using the same amount of aircraft. Russian bombers have transited Iranian airspace on their way to Syria many times before. They have even been escorted by Iranian F-14 Tomcats while doing so , although they have not flown combat sorties out of an Iranian base before. Backfires have been especially focused on attacking targets in and around Deir-ez-Zor, an eastern Syrian town along the Euphrates River that has been under ISIS siege for many months. The Tu-22M3s do not deliver precision air-to-ground weapons on these sorties, they use dumb bombs dropped from medium to high altitudes, which puts in question their effectiveness for counter-ISIS operations and the toll their strikes take on innocent lives in the process.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Twenty-five years ago, the a B-1B rolled into the then-brand-new Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB, which remains the largest anechoic chamber in the world. This marked the first defensive systems test for the BAF. Now, two and a half decades later, the B-1B headed back into the sci-fi-like facility for another round of tests on its notoriously complicated ALQ-161 Threat Protection System. Rodney Brooks, of the 579th Software Maintenance Squadron describes this system like this: “The ALQ-161 receives all of the radio frequency energy when it’s flying and will process it and determine if it’s a threat, and then it can set up automatic jamming to jam that RF (radio frequency) energy from a missile, aircraft or ground missile.” The system has long been a reliability headache for the USAF, but upgrades have made it more stable and effective in recent years. Stuffing a full-on B-1B into the BAF allows engineers to collect data on the system under extremely tight laboratory conditions so that it can be further improved. Now, in an age of sensor fusion and highly capable and widely proliferated integrated air defense systems , the B-1B needs the BAF more than ever, as its self-protection suite has to keep the jet alive in medium- and higher-threat environments. This is why successfully integrating new technologies and software into the suite is so critical. Some of these past upgrades have included towed decoys that are doghoused in the B-1B’s empennage, and enhanced digital signal processing. B-1B sits inside the cavernous BAF for electronic warfare system testing. , USAF The BAF was actually designed during the Reagan era, primarily to support the B-1 and its faltering electronic self-defense suite. Since then, it has serviced aircraft from around the globe. The facility is even named after Rockwell chief test pilot Tommie “Doug” Benefield, who perished on August 29th, 1984, in a crash of a B-1A—the faster Carter-era progenitor of the B-1B. The DoD has many unique and elaborate soundstage-like testing facilities. Some develop missile seekers , others test airplanes and other equipment under extreme temperatures . Even Edwards AFB’s BAF is just one of multiple anechoic chambers available for military testing, although its massive size, able to accommodate any aircraft in the Pentagon’s inventory, makes it unique. The other-worldly interior of the BAF is described by the USAF: “The chamber is filled with polyurethane and polyethylene pyramids, radar absorbing material designed to stop reflections of electromagnetic waves. The size of the pyramids, which are painted dark blue or black, varies depending on the particular frequency and test procedure being conducted. Aircraft systems can be tested and verified that they work properly prior to actual flight test.” B-1 sits inside the BAF during testing, decades ago., USAF A big part of the tests that BAF and other anechoic chambers do regards how the aircraft’s electronic systems and emissions interact with one another, and with those from the outside world. For aircraft with advanced electronic warfare suites, like the B-1B or the EA-18G, getting the aircraft to not jam itself can be a major undertaking. B-1B rolls out of the BAF after two weeks of intensive testing. , USAF After two weeks of testing, the “Bone” rolled out of the chamber this morning, and Edwards AFB posted this little gem showing the B-1B doing nap-of-the-earth flying over the Mojave Desert.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 4, 2018",Marine Corps Considers Deploying Small Drones at Squad Level,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Drones are getting smaller, more capable, easier to interface with, and cheaper with every passing day. The USMC is well aware of this, and is pushing to migrate practical tech into the tactical environment on a large scale. Portable unmanned aircraft systems are morphing from niche capabilities used by special operations forces, such as the Raven, to systems similar to those you can buy at your local hobby store. In fact, in some respects the deployed military capabilities actually lag behind the civilian and commercial drone market. But it’s not just about buying the right drones for squad-level operations, it is also about integrating them into operational fabric of these basic but incredibly deadly fighting units in as seamless a manner as possible. A Marine about to release an Instant Eye quad-copter surveillance drone during urban warfare exercises. , USMC All this summer, including during RIMPAC 2016 , the world’s largest multi-national naval exercise that takes place biannually in and around Hawaii and southern California, the USMC has experimented with integrating relatively simple and easy to control drones into Marine squads, with great results. The two primary platforms that the USMC seems most interested in are the MK2 Instant Eye quadcopter and the almost insect-sized Black Hornet. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NNezrVRfBoQ The Black Hornet in particular has garnered high interest from the US Army , and is already in service with the UK’s fighting forces. The more powerful Instant Eye offers a more stable platform, larger payload, and is more capable of operating in adverse environmental conditions than the diminutive Black Hornet. Together, they actually offer a good capability mix for small ground combat units operating in the field. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Robert Neller, is especially bullish on integrating drones directly into Marine rifle squads. This may include adding a new position in every squad just for this capability—a move that may disturb some traditionalists inside and outside the USMC; alternately, the new Assistant Squad Leader slot could take on the role. The pocketable Black Hornet helicopter drone. , USMC The potential situational awareness advantages that organic done capabilities add to Marine rifle squad are massive. No longer would line of sight restrict a squad’s knowledge of what lies around the next corner or beyond a tree line. Putting small drones to use at a squad level also means that having to constantly seek an elevated position to obtain better situational awareness will no longer be so rigidly necessity as it once was. It will also allow Marine rifle squads to operate more independently, and give them the ability to react to aerial intelligence quicker than relying on centralized aerial assets and a longer intelligence chain, like they do today. There is also the reality that these micro- and nano-drones will eventually morph into optionally suicidal loitering munitions, something we discussed in depth recently . That same drone operator position in the Marine rifle squad could one day (probably not far off) choose a Black Hornet with orange bands on it, loaded with a small explosive charge, and fly it right into the window where an expected sniper is hiding. BANG! No more sniper. This is already being done in the lower end of the winged unmanned aircraft market, with the Aeroviroment Switchblade and IAI’s Harop suicidal drone leading the way. In fact, irregular forces, including ISIS , are already using the concept and getting better and better at it quickly. This has prompted the US military to deploy anti-drone jamming rifles to battlefield Iraq and Syria. A Marine holds a Black Hornet micro-drone., USMC This vision of future combat presents incredible possibilities but also massive security risks , especially as drones become smaller and harder to defend against. Four years ago I wrote the following in my piece “Tyler’s 10 Thoughts On The Future Of Drone Warfare” : “#3 Drones will get smaller: The days of thinking of “small drones” as those that fit in a Navy SEAL’s backpack are numbered. Soon we will see operational drones the size of a grapefruit, then the size of a dragonfly, and eventually, maybe in 30 years time, we won’t be able to see them at all. “As drones shrink so will the weapons they carry. Today we see the sub 50lb smart munitions being deployed on smaller drones, yet these cutting edge micro-munitions may prove to be comparatively colossal in time. Eventually miniature UAVs will use sub 5lb guided bomblets and even guided bullets to deal death from on high. Even smaller drones will eventually be capable of taking out the enemy by “biting” or “injecting” them with poison, lethal and non-lethal, very similar to the ways in which insects have operated for millions of years. “On the sub-micro end of things, nanites or nanobots, which are microscopic robots, will be able to infiltrate computer circuitry or even the human circulatory system in large numbers and conduct repairs or cause catastrophic damage. “In the end the smallest drones may end up being the most useful and dangerous of all, , living in our bloodstreams and able to act like lifesaving mini-surgeons or as self-replicating weapons of mass destruction for which the only defense may be, dare I say it, anti-nanobot nanobots. “It is bewildering to think that the world’s most lethal future wars may be fought on a microscopic battlefield.” A Marine releasing an Instant Eye drone., USMC In the meantime, the Marine rifle squad will become even more deadly than it already is, by doing what is seemingly long overdue—using relatively inexpensive surveillance drones, and someone who is trained to use them even under the most stressful and austere combat conditions.

It was known that B-1Bs would replace a contingent of B-52Hs currently on rotational deployment to Andersen AFB in Guam, but the arrival of B-2A’s came as a surprise. As a result of the secretive deployment, examples of all three of America’s heavy-hitting bomber force sat on the tarmac together today at America’s master air base in the Pacific. The deployment comes just days after a handful of B-2s and B-52s flew over the North Pole for a major global strike readiness exercise dubbed “Polar Roar.” Each bomber brings a different mix of capabilities to the region. The B-1’s arrival packs with it the USAF’s heaviest-hitting conventional strike capability and considerable speed. The B-2, well, it can do what no other aircraft can—fly thousands of miles into enemy territory unrefueled and undetected and unleash a massive conventional (up to 80 independently targeted 500lb GBU-38 bombs) or nuclear payload. The B-52, like the B-1, also has the ability to drop laser-guided bombs and target them via their Sniper targeting pod. The venerable bomber also employs a host of other smart and dumb conventional munitions, and packs a big nuclear strike capability as well.

This is the first time the B-1 has taken up the mission and the first time it has deployed to Guam in over a decade.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s island building operation in the South China Sea has been relentless. After declaring its major runway on Fiery Cross Reef operational last Winter, and having deployed fighters to the new base , China has moved to activate two more runways located in the disputed Spratly Islands archipelago. The Center for Strategic and International Studies , more commonly referred to as CSIS, has obtained recent satellite images of these burgeoning outposts, and their analysis of just how much air power can (and likely will) be based there is both straightforward and bewildering. You can access the imagery and analysis here . CSIS concludes that each airport outpost is being tailored to accommodate at least 24 fighter aircraft and up to about a half dozen larger aircraft on a permanent basis. That might include Xian H-6 bombers , maritime patrol aircraft, transports , ELINT aircraft, AWACs and tankers. That mix of assets will likely include rotary-wing submarine hunting platforms and eventually larger unmanned aircraft as well. The bases also have space that can be developed into more aircraft parking for surge and transient operations. Also depicted in the satellite images are more of the strange structures that have popped up on the islands, including large, multiple-celled hexagonal emplacements that have stumped many defense image analysts. Additionally, a set of three towers, one taller than the others, have appeared on all three island outposts. Although the US continues to put carrier groups into the South China Sea and executes “freedom of navigation” drills that challenge China’s exclusivity to the territory around their man-made islands, there is no coherent strategy from Washington concerning the islands and forestalling the arsenals that will occupy them in the near future. Once combat aircraft, missiles and naval vessels are in place, China will be able to activate an invisible, interconnected anti-access/area denial wall at will , one that spans great swathes of the South China Sea. Chinese H-6 strategic bomber patrols the South China Sea., AP It’s just a matter of time before China has incredible leverage in the region, and demilitarizing their man-made islands would take a miraculous shift in China’s policy. The window where a combination of hard diplomacy, innovative military concepts, and American economic power might effect a change in course of China’s South China Sea ambitions is coming to close, if it has not already slammed shut already. Thus far, international pressure has only seemed to stiffen Chinese resolve. The Hague’s much publicized ruling against China’s claims has had zero effect on Beijing’s policy. Stateside, the Obama administration’s answer to the issue has been an almost laughable three-pronged strategy: Provide some sort of semi-constant US military presence in the region, enhance ties with countries with claims on the strategic body of water, and build-up indigenous fighting capabilities weapons exports and cross-training . This therapeutic approach to strategic problems is nothing new for the administration. When it comes to this strategic concept’s application to China’s extra-territorial ambitions it has had little effect. At this point defacto control over the South China Sea via the militarization of China’s man-made island outposts is all but ensured.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Oregon is Eagle country, with over 50 of the world’s most proven air superiority fighters calling the state home. But before that, Oregon was Viper, Phantom, Delta Dart, Voodoo, Delta Dagger, Scorpion, Starfire, Sabre, Shooting Star, Mustang, and Thunderbolt country. So, to put it lightly, the state’s Air Guard has a rich and diverse flying heritage. Our good friend and warbird photographer extraordinaire , Lyle Jansma, took to the air with the Oregon Air National Guard’s gorgeous “screaming Eagle” 75th anniversary F-15C, as well as the P-51 Mustang “Val-Halla” and the T-33 Shooting Star “Ace Maker II” for what has to be one of the coolest heritage photo flights of all time. In typical Jansma fashion , Lyle framed the Eagle and its wingmen perfectly against Oregon’s iconic Mt Hood. A breathtaking formation on an equally as breathtaking backdrop. , Lyle Jansma After the sunset photo flight concluded, the trio recovered at Hillsboro Airport in front of a big crowd that had gathered for the Hillsboro International Airshow’s evening show.

But air sovereignty is just one of the unit’s missions. The USAF has shrunk in size markedly over the last decade or so; as such Guard units are now really front-line, and are regularly called upon for deployments . Their gear is also no longer years removed from their active force compatriots. The F-15Cs flown by the Redhawks, many of them outfitted with the incredibly powerful APG-63V3 Active Electronically Scanned Array radars, are just as capable, if not more, than the jets flying with the three active USAF F-15C/D squadrons that remain. An impressive formation paying homage to the Oregon ANG's heritage. , Lyle Jansma The 114th Fighter Squadron, based out of Kingsley Airfield in Klamath Falls, also flies the F-15C/D, but for a very different mission: it’s the Air Force’s sole F-15C/D training unit. Dubbed the “land of no slack” due to the extremely high standards to which Eagle Driver trainees are held, the 114th has a critical role, now more than ever, as the Eagle is slated to continue in service for decades to come. By the time they’re finally retired, the youngest airframes will be over 50 years old—or about double the age of the young aspiring Eagle pilots that the squadron will be training at the time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 18, 2016","The USAF Declares Initial Operating Capability For The F-35A, But it Still Has a Long Way to Go","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On August 2nd, the USAF finally declared Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for a Hill AFB-based squadron of its growing fleet of F-35As. It’s been 15 years since Lockheed was awarded the contract to produce the F-35, and a decade since it first flew. The milestone is a big one for both Lockheed and the USAF, and builds on a ton of media hype the jet got after it crossed the Atlantic and landed in the UK for the first time. But the F-35 program has chronically shared an absurdly bright view of the F-35’s progress, even though the facts have suggested otherwise. Case in point: the Marine’s declaration of IOC on their F-35Bs last year following a major shipboard test that supposedly went glowingly. We found out months later that it went anything but. How the F-35 actually performs in the field, both in terms of reliability and combat effectiveness, also remains unclear, with only anecdotal evidence and seemingly cherry-picked facts offered for public consumption. Obviously the jet, which packs low-observability and an avionics suite that provides unprecedented situational awareness , should be able to vanquish other aircraft and ground-based threats that were developed decades ago. Yet exactly how good it is at getting off the ground so it can enter the fight remains questionable. It’s commonplace for major weapons programs to “stack the deck” to a certain degree during early trials via flooding squadrons with spare parts and having contractors on hand to fix any issues. USAF-distributed graphic attempting to show the F-35's outstanding performance during a recent exercise, although we have no background details on the claims it makes. , USAF The reality is that the F-35, under the damning auspices of “concurrency,” was put into production and has now been pushed to operational status long before testing has concluded. In fact, the jet has not even started operational testing, which has been pushed back to early 2018 . Additionally, after many delays the USAF lowered the bar for what it considered the minimal capabilities to be considered operational, in order to claim this critical milestone as early as possible. This mainly has to do with opting to go operational with Block 3i software loaded onto the jets instead of the much more comprehensive Block 3F software that was long envisioned as the minimum threshold for declaring IOC. F-35A and F-16C from Luke AFB break formation., Lockheed So when will the F-35 see action, or at least a deployment overseas? I would predict it will be far sooner than most would assume—though this is not indicative of the aircraft’s developmental state. The F-35B will sail from Japan aboard a Helicopter Landing Dock in 2018, which right now is the first slated actual operational deployment of any F-35 variant. The Air Force, on the other hand, may toss the F-35A into the European, or even the anti-ISIS, conflict far sooner. Aviation Week reports : “’I would like to deploy it to both the European and the Pacific theater in the not-too-distant future, so I would say within 18 months I think I’ll try to get to both those theaters,’ said ACC commander Gen. Herbert Carlisle, adding that if U.S. Central Command asks for the F-35 in the Middle East, he would send it in a heartbeat.” Whether any of this is a good idea is debatable, but considering the jet has yet to go through its operational test plan and has a limited list of weapons it can employ, it seems like doing so would be a PR move more than anything else. Then again, just as I’ve predicted for years, declaring IOC with the aircraft still so immature is really just that, a PR move, and I’m not the only one that thinks so. Last year, POGO came to the same conclusion about the Marines seemingly unsubstantiated F-35B IOC milestone: “The read on Congress from Maj. Gen. Tod Wolters, [from the] Air Force Legislative Liaison Office, was that there was more support overall for an early declaration in [calendar year] ’16 as opposed to sticking to Block 3F with a CY ’18 declaration. These opinions came from the negative connotation with having over 180 F-35A aircraft parked on runways without IOC and also being two years behind the Marine.” Pogo continues: “…to meet a deadline that Congress found acceptable, the Air Force decided to debut F-35s that it knew full well wouldn’t actually be combat-ready in any meaningful sense of the term. In May 2013, the flying branch submitted its F-35 IOC date to Congress and then, according to the history, began the tense wait to see if the JSF program could fulfill its promises over the next three years. “Traditionally, declaring IOC has depended upon completing combat-realistic testing, as was the criteria for the F-22’s IOC declaration in 2005…The Marine Corps admits the ‘initial’ deployments are several years down the road. F-35Bs will not be deployed to Okinawa until 2017 at the earliest, and won’t be deployed on amphibious assault ships until 2018.” Pogo concludes, “…it’s clear that the F-35B’s IOC declaration does not establish that any necessary combat capabilities have actually been achieved. It simply establishes that the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office and the Marine Corps were doggedly determined to reap the public relations benefits of meeting their artificial IOC deadline—even if in name only—no matter what.” F-35 rolls over, showing its belly while flying over the California desert., Lockheed Martin Although the F-35 has made progress over the last year, it’s being declared operational under discounted requirements and there is still a long road of testing and development ahead—as well as many remaining problems with the aircraft to solve.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just yesterday, at 10:45AM, an F/A-18C belonging to VMFA-232 “Red Devils” crashed ten miles from Naval Air Station Fallon in northern Nevada. Thankfully the pilot ejected and survived the incident. The jet was on a functional check flight (FCF) when the crash occurred. FCFs follow critical and deep maintenance evolutions, like test drives in the sky, where the pilot shakes out the jet to find any remaining issues or anomalies. The Hornet that crashed was on loan to Strike Fighter Wing Pacific Detachment Fallon. It isn’t clear if the pilot flying the Hornet also belonged to the VMFA-232. The crash comes after a string of high-profile fast jet crashes and just five days after another of the Red Devils’ F/A-18Cs crashed during training at MCAS Ground Combat Center 29 Palms. Sadly, that jet’s pilot, Major Richard Norton, perished in the incident. Norton was 36 years old, had multiple deployments under his belt and was decorated with multiple medals. At 10:30 pm, the jet departed from MCAS Miramar, the Red Devil’s home base, to perform a night close air support (CAS) mission. The mission was part of Integrated Training Exercise 5-16, a pre-deployment training evolution that brings a wide spectrum of Marine warfighting capabilities together for cooperative training. Colonel William Swan, the Commanding Officer of Marine Air Group 11, which the Red Devils are a part of, stated the following about Major Norton: “He was one of the best and brightest Hornet pilots our nation had to offer. Our thoughts and prayers out to his family.” Major Richard Norton standing in front of an F/A-18., USMC Both crashes follow the loss of another Red Devil F/A-18C and its pilot, Major Taj “Cabbie” Sareen, last October (make sure to read all about Taj in this previous post from The War Zone ). Sareen was taking off from RAF Lakenheath in the early morning hours as part of the second leg of a ferry operation to bring VMFA-232’s jets back from a combat deployment to the Middle East when something went terribly wrong. Sareen is credited with choosing to fly the stricken aircraft away from homes before making an unsuccessful ejection attempt. Having a Marine fighter squadron Lose a quarter of its aircraft inventory and two of its pilots in just nine months is as peculiar as it is tragic, but it is worth noting that Marine Air is in very poor shape overall. The service is just now trying to get on top of long deferred maintenance and absolutely abysmal availability rates of its aging aircraft, something that has resulted in plummeting flight hours for Marine Aviators . A pair of Red Devil F/A-18Cs takeoff in formation., USMC Delays in the F-35 program, not procuring the Super Hornet, and 15 years of continuous warfare in the Middle East have pushed Marine Hornets far past their design life. With continued losses further aggregating the situation, the USMC has resorted to pulling 30 Hornets from the boneyard and will revamp them into F/A-18C+s at great cost in order to forestall a further collapse of the fleet. These revamped jets will serve for another 2,000 hours before finally being retired. It is too early to tell if the recent rash of losses of VMFA-232 aviators and aircraft are somehow systemic, or if the aircraft’s age and overstressed support infrastructure were to blame. But replacing lost aircraft is one thing, losing dear comrades is another. The squadron has roots dating back almost a century, and it will have to recover from such a horrible string of events—and that won’t be easy. Our thoughts are with the Red Devils and their families.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USAF is deploying B-1B Lancers to Andersen AFB in Guam this August as part of Pacific Command’s continuous bomber presence mission. The big swing-wing bombers will replace B-52Hs that have been fulfilling the mission for months— one of which recently crashed . The odd thing is that the bomber rotations through Guam have been supported exclusively by nuclear-capable bombers—the B-2 and the B-52—bringing an aerial strategic nuclear capability to the theater. The B-1 is strictly a conventional bomber, having lost its nuclear mission in the 1990s. Just because the B-1 hasn’t been to Guam for 10 years doesn’t mean it hasn’t been busy. They have had a persistent presence the Middle East for 15 years straight, until they were replaced by Sniper targeting pod toting B-52s . B-1Bs refuelling from a KC-135R., USAF The B-1 fleet is undergoing a series of much needed upgrades that will give the big jet greater network connectivity and a glass cockpit, among other enhancements. The B-1 will bring America’s heaviest hitting conventional air-to-ground capability to the Pacific, and its supersonic speeds mean it can cover more distance faster than its nuclear capable stablemates—a big deal in the massive Pacific theater. This issue is often referred to by the Pentagon as the “tyranny of distance.” The B-1B's much needed new glass cockpit., USAF The B-1’s crewsbring extensive combat experience from Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Inherent Resolve—the fight against ISIS. During anti-iSIS operations, B-1 crews became the all-stars of the conflict , putting the jet to work as a long-endurance close-air support asset with a huge arsenal of diverse weapons. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jjz0dOAvp7k The maintenance-intensive B-1s will be accompanied by around 300 Airmen from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. With Bones in the region, there is a good chance they will show up in South Korea and Australia, and may even make an appearance over the volatile South China Sea . Rumors of B-1s basing as far forward of Australia have irked the Chinese government in the past, so bringing the B-1 into the mix—even if just for long-range overflights—may be the Pentagon’s next logical step in its ongoing efforts to counter-balance China’s presence in the region. A Bone flies alone over the sea., USAF Since then, China’s own H-6 bombers have been much more active over the disputed body of water . Now that China’s largest man-made island, Fiery Cross Reef , has activated its massive runway, there’s a chance these bombers will be regularly rotating in and out of the island outpost. It’s remarkable to see the B-1 in such high demand. The jet was once branded as a plane looking for a mission, a stepchild of the Air Combat Command of sorts, and its future was always questioned. That is certainly not the case anymore, and even a more extensive upgrade, revamping the jet into a true flying arsenal ship is a possibility, although its B-52 stablemate could easily be tapped for the job. We will keep you updated as to the Bone’s Pacific Theater exploits once it touches down at Andersen AFB this August.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-35A has already fired its internal GAU-22 25mm cannon both on the ground and in the air , and now the gun pod intended for the B and C models, which lack an internal cannon, is being test-fired on the aircraft for the very first time. The gun pod is housed in a semi-low observable (stealthy) enclosure attached to the F-35B and C’s centerlines, between the weapons bays. The gun’s “common” enclosure design can also be used to house other bolt-on systems in the future. A F-35B loaded with GBU-12 laser guided bombs, AIM-9X Sidewinders, and a gun pod., Lockheed Martin The GAU-22 is actually a lighter, four-barrel (instead of five) version of the GAU-12 Equalizer cannon that’s pod-mounted on the AV-8B Harrier and also found on the AC-130U gunship. The F-35’s gun pod holds 220 rounds of 25mm ammunition in a helical magazine that spirals around the gun itself and has a rate of fire of around 3,000 rounds per minute. This equates to about 50 rounds per second, or half the rate of fire of the M61 Vulcan 20mm cannon found on all other American jet fighters. For what the GAU-12 lacks in rapidity it makes up for in destructive power. Its 25mm ammunition has a far greater effect than its 20mm little cousin. This makes it more ideal for attacking ground targets, but less so for close-in dogfights with other aircraft. With 220 rounds available in the F-35’s gun pod, the pilot has 4.4 second of “trigger time” until the magazine runs empty. This equates to about four short trigger pulls if the pilot is miserly. The F-35A, with its internal cannon, carries even less ammunition—only 182 rounds—equating to about three trigger pulls at best. In comparison, the Harrier carries 300 of the same 25mm rounds in its cannon pod system. The internal components of the F-35's GAU-22 gun pod. , General Dynamics/JSF JPO The A-10, with its massive GAU-8 Avenger 30mm cannon and 1,174-round magazine offers a whopping 12 to 15 trigger pulls, and much more punch that the 25mm—although comparing the two really isn’t t fair. The F-35 is only competing with the A-10 in the close air support department because the USAF pitted them against one another. Not just that, but the USAF already has a miserable record when it comes to trying to justify the A-10’s retirement by, in part, by strapping a gun pod onto a much more fragile fighter. The A-10's massive GAU-8 Avenger 30mm cannon next to a VW Beatle. , USAF In the long run, at least the F-35A has an internal cannon, and its B and C variant brethren have the option to trade some stealthiness for one of their own. Still, it would have been nice to see at least the C model get an internal gun like its USAF comrade. For now, all the gun-slinging is for physical testing because the software needed to aim and employ the cannon in combat is still far from complete and vetted. This is known as the Block 3F software suite that will give the jet its true baseline combat capabilities. This was originally seen as the minimum threshold for declaring initial operating capability by the Air Force, but the bar was lowered as delays piled up . Now, the F-35A will enter service with the less capable Block 3i software suite . As for when Block 3F will be ready, well, the USAF promised 2017 , but that guarantee is eroding fast, with only testing of the 3F software suite scheduled to commence in the early part of 2018. Yes, that means the USAF will declare the F-35A operational anytime now, even though its pilots can’t even aim and fire its internal cannon.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just as China is rolling out its big new multi-role amphibian , the largest flying boats ever flown operationally—the World War II-era Martin JRM Mars—are being put up for sale. The aircraft served the US Navy until the mid 1950s, after which they were acquired as surplus by a Canadian company that modified them for firefighting operations. After already performing decades of air tanker service, they were bought by Canada’s Coulson Flying Tankers Inc., in 2007. An amazing shot of four Martin Mars flying boats in formation. Only seven were built, of which two were prototypes., US Navy Originally, the Mars, which has a wingspan of 200 feet and a max takeoff weight of 165,000 pounds, was designed as a cargo transport and patrol aircraft, and was the largest allied seaplane built during World War II. By the time the Mars was in production its patrol mission was dropped and the aircraft were to be used primarily as transports. In total, only seven of the big flying boats were built, with just two surviving today; those are the Hawaii Mars II and the Philippine Mars, both owned by Coulson. Both of Caulson's Martin Mars flying boats seen on dry land during maintenance. , RuthAS/Wikicommons From their picturesque operating base on Sproat Lake, British Columbia, Hawaii Mars II and Philippine Mars flew contracted firefighting contracts for decades. Although in recent years they’ve had trouble finding steady work, even as America’s similar jet-powered Very Large Air Tanker capabilities have expanded . Yet the Mars can do something their modern successors can’t: they can scoop up massive loads of water on the fly. Skimming the surface of rivers and lakes at 60 knots for about 30 seconds is all it takes for the Mars to pick up 7,200 gallons of water. This capability drastically increases their attack rate compared to tankers that require refills at airfields after each evacuation. Each Mars also has a 600-gallon tank of foam concentrate that can be injected into their water-loads. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qa7BvWyZb9w The fire season of 2015 was the last time a Martin Mars fought a fire, and that was on a very limited basis. British Columbia Wildlife Service had one of the big tankers under a short-term contract during which the aircraft was used five times on four separate fires. The cost of the contract was $736,000 . In 2015, the Caulson was also contracted to train Chinese test pilots in how to handle a large flying boat. The training was needed in preparation for the flight test program of China’s new AG600. The pilots, who were attending International Test Pilot School, collectively spent 22 hours behind the yoke of Hawaii Mars. Now, with no contracts to fulfill, the Coulson team brought the Mars to Oshkosh for America’s biggest air show, and as you can imagine, it’s quite the star. A buyer could step in with hopes of putting the antique flying boats back into firefighting service, possibly using Philippine Mars for parts to sustain Hawaii Mars II more economically. Although, considering Caulson’s view that these boats need a new purpose, this seems doubtful. Additionally, beyond relocating them and their infrastructure, the planes’ business case as firefighting aircraft has proven to be weak at best. This doesn’t mean they’re irrelevant, or even not cost-effective, but the air tanker business is volatile for a number of reasons, including high fixed costs with a very elastic demand along with all the politics and complexities of having government organizations as the sole customer base. If aircraft are not flying and earning money, they’re very expensive to maintain in a ready or semi-ready state. The fact that the Mars are 70 years old with no existing support base—not to mention that they’re gigantic and operate on water—only makes this scenario much more fiscally treacherous. The Mars follows Caulson's S-76 lead/spotting aircraft. , Caulson/martinmars.com Still, someone with deep pockets could purchase the aircraft and convert at least one of them into one hell of a flying adventure palace. For the person that has the super yacht and a Gulfsteam 650, this would be an awesome addition. Yet another issue, though, is that these aircraft are not amphibians; they depend on water for operations and have to be winched ashore for servicing. This severely limits their servicing flexibility and increases their operating costs. Still, having an antique flying mansion would be pretty amazing. These last examples of the Martin Mars may be best utilized as promotional tools instead of being stuffed into a museum or put back to work drenching fires. Companies like Red Bull and Breitling have invested heavily in exotic warbirds and antique aircraft as brand ambassadors. The Martin Mars, with its tremendous range, huge scale and sea-side visibility, could travel the world as a flying interactive branding tool. There really is no better aircraft for this type of work, as the Mars can plant itself right in front of the coast cities instead of being relegated to airfields. We’ll keep an eye on these amazing aircraft, and will let you know where they land.

HMS Ambush , one of the Royal Navy’s newest nuclear fast attack submarines (SSN), collided with a commercial tanker off the coast of Gibraltar. The resulting damage was not superficial; a big dent has been made in her conning tower and will require significant repairs. The HMS Ambush puts back to port with a huge dent in her conning tower., AP The Astute class of SSNs are some of the most advanced submarines ever put to sea, and they aren’t cheap. The first three boasts in the class, of which Ambush is the middle child, cost $2.4 billion each. If it cost a lot to build, it isn’t cheap to fix. Ambush being put out of action for considerable time will be a blow to the Royal Navy’s relatively tiny fast attack submarine force, which is made up of just seven boats total (three Astute class plus four older Trafalgar class). The event occurred last Wednesday at 1:30 PM when Ambush was executing a surfacing drill as part of the extremely challenging Submarine Commander Course , ominously nicknamed “The Perisher.” It is unknown if a trainee was commanding the sub at the exact time the incident occurred.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 25, 2017",China Rolls Out Massive New Amphibious Flying Boat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Aviation Industry Corporation of China, better known as AVIC, rolled out its massive quad-turboprop amphibian, dubbed the AG600, on July 23 at its Zhuhai assembly plant. The aircraft’s unique lines and throw-back pedigree are sure to make it an aerospace aficionado favorite, but a real military capability lies beneath all the nostalgia. Amphibians and flying boats hold a special place in aviation history. At one time they were commonplace, now they are exceedingly rare. The US even eyed an amphibious C-130 at one time , although the idea never got off the ground. With long runways existing all over the place after WWII the design tradeoffs of making a plane also a boat became unfavorable. This was especially so after the jet age hit and by the 1980s amphibians and flying boats were oddities. With this in mind, and also considering that putting a new type of aircraft into production is very expensive, especially one with limited marketability, the AG600 clearly must fit a strategic hole for the Chinese that needed filling. Actually, China is no stranger to amphibious aircraft, with a handful of SH-5s still in service , but the AG600 is a whole different animal. It is the largest amphibious aircraft currently being produced, beating-out Japan’s ShinMaywa US-2 which previously held the title. The AG600 has a max gross-weight of nearly 110,000 pounds and a wingspan of 127 feet. It is powered by a quartet of WJ6 turboprop engines, each putting out 5,100 horsepower. It can fly for 12 hours, has a range of nearly 3,000 miles and a top speed of 350 mph. It can carry up to 50 passengers or 12 tons of water for firefighting operations. Most notably, the AG600 only needs about eight feet of water to operate in, making it ideal for flying in and out of shallow littorals. Although China’s official stance is that these big amphibians will be used for dousing blazes and maritime rescue operations, they will most certainly also be used for patrolling large swathes of water, namely the contested and resource rich waterways of the South China Sea. Similar to how China’s super-sized “coast guard” ships are used in the region, the AG600 will likely be used for spotting, monitoring, and tracking fishing fleets, energy exploration vessels and other nations’ claims and readouts around the highly disputed body of water . The AG600 may also offer enhanced access to China’s smaller man-made island outposts in the South China Sea, especially those without runways. By using a hub and spoke system, leveraging China’s new runway on Fiery Cross Reef , which is capable of handling any aircraft, the AG600 could deliver personnel, fuel and other supplies to smaller islands that were only accessed by vessels and helicopter in the past. With the aircraft’s long-range It could also fly missions to these locales direct from the mainland while still offering a large useful load. By adding fixed-wing accessibility to more of its man-made islands, China would drastically up their strategic value and utility. Really what China has in the AG600 is a new amphibious platform that can be adapted to a whole variety of roles than a specific plane for a specific task. And like so many indigenous Chinese designs, we will likely see multiple variants of this type in the not so distant future. The AG600 could easily be weaponized at least in the surveillance role. Even adding a fighter-sized radar under the aircraft’s large radome and a data-link could allow the aircraft to provide real-time remote targeting of naval vessels for land-based and sea-based anti-ship missiles. It will also be interesting to see if future iterations include under-wing hardpoints for mounting stores and sensors. If so, the AG600 could be turned into a deadly amphibious sea-control platform or a more elaborate anti-submarine warfare aircraft. The AG600, like the giant Zubr class hovercraft , is just another unique platform that China has procured as part of an ongoing initiative to fortify its abilities to operate in shallow waters and to sustain small cadres of personnel on remote islands far from the mainland. It is also another reminder of just how militarized the area is becoming . Beijing has ordered 17 of the amphibians so far and is looking to export the plane as well. We will let you know when it takes to the air for the first time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 8, 2016",Is Moscow’s Finger On The Scales Of The US Presidential Election Via Hacking?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Putin has every reason to be actively supporting Donald Trump’s bid to become the President of the United States. A recent play to support him, which seems to have come from Moscow , is nothing new either – but the tech behind it is. The motivations behind the recent hacking attacks seem to come right out of the Cold War playbook; meddle in a foreign election by subverting the unfavored candidate via psycho-political clandestine operations. The difference here is that hacking was used to gain access to sensitive and damning material instead of classic “analogue” espionage. Additonally a non-state actor, WikiLeaks, was used as a third-party delivery system for that material. Putin’s playbook may seem unpredictable, but it’s rooted in tradecraft that the KGB used for decedes. In essence, Putin’s use of “hybrid warfare” is just a remodeled and consolidated version of the cocktail of tactics used by the USSR to subvert the will of people in the states it targets. The hacking of the Democratic National Committee (to the tune of 20,000 emails) fits right into this pattern of subversion. Russia has become increasingly aggressive when it comes to meddling in US affairs. In fact they will openly kill to do so. Take their recent and unusual attack on a remote base in Syria along the Jordanian border, a facility where US forces were often present to support and train anti-ISIS Syrian fighters. At the time The War Zone came to the conclusion that this attack was likely a ruse to force the US into doing something Russia has been desperately wanting since getting involved militarily in the conflict late last summer – sharing critical battlefield intelligence with Russia. This would include information regarding where US, allied and coalition-backed rebel forces are on the game board that has become the Syrian conflict. Since then the idea that Russia’s attack on the outpost was one of guile and not mistaken identity is widely accepted as fact . Amazingly, in the aftermath the US seems to be acquiescing to Moscow’s “request.” Putin speaks at a conference., AP The fact that Russia is willing to bomb American allied forces is too harsh a reality for the White House to come to terms with. This is not really that surprising, as the Obama Administration will do seemingly anything to avoid confronting Russia. In the end, Moscow’s crafty little plan appears to have worked, and this fact only invites more “crafty little plans.” In many ways, this has been the post Syrian “red line” reality for the US – and not just in regards to Russia. Russia’s potential hacking of DNC emails, and their release in such a way as to look like it were just another WikiLeaks trove handed over by some independent hacking ring, is a more nuanced way of Russia getting what it wants from the US than the attack in Syria a month ago. In this case, Russia’s political aim is the election of Donald J Trump as the 45th President of the United States, not critical intelligence sharing. The ongoing bromance between Putin and Trump started early in the campaign, and Trump’s subsequent siding with Russia on the Syrian conflict indicate an appetite for tighter relations with Moscow should he become the next American President. But Trump’s alarmingly cavalier position on NATO, specifically on his willingness to abandon the highly successful alliance , is Putin’s greatest dream come true. Even small cracks in NATO’s façade would result in a rebalancing of power in the region – in Russia’s favor. Changes that could be catastrophic to the security situation in Europe as a whole, and especially damning for the Baltic States and the former Russian satellite states in Eastern Europe. Trump’s remarks spurred not just reactions from US lawmakers, retired generals, and European nations, but also a rare statement from NATO itself. In essence, strongman Trump is the best US presidential candidate for strongman Putin’s Russia, and Moscow’s foreign policy goals would be far more easily realized with Trump in the White House than Hillary Clinton, at least if you take Trump by his word. Trump gives his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention., AP A pro-Putin president in the White House and a destabilized Europe would also likely result in the end to crushing economic sanctions that were slapped on Russia following the surprise invasion of Crimea in 2014 and a shadow war in eastern Ukraine. Lifting of these sanctions would not only reinvigorate Putin’s popularity among Russian voters, but it would also mean a huge influx of cash into the faltering Russian economy. This cash could be put to work accelerating the modernization of the Russian military, building new weaponry and potentially bankrolling future hybrid wars abroad. So is it really a big surprise that Russia is using Cold War tactics paired with new technology to influence the US election considering how big of stakes are on the line? Hardly. As for the potential blowback from being accused of doing so by the US, well Putin only needs plausible deniability and will spin such accusations for his own good domestically. Even now there are accusations that some of the files published were tampered with before being sent to WikiLeaks for distribution. Amplifying existing information before circulation accomplishes a number of goals at little risk. It gives the initial impact of the documents a greater impact, while retracting a story after the news cycle is nearly worthless. It also provides a greater sense of distrust about everything and everyone involved – with both the hack and the DNC’s political operation as claims and counter-claims fly. The narrative emerging from the hacked emails, true or not, supports Donald Trump and Bernie Sander’s claims that the democratic process in the US is essentially rigged. This weakens the US as the leader in democratic values around the globe. Another big win for Putin’s Russia, and its degrading democracy. In the end, tampering with leaked information before its release makes for just another reason not to believe everything that you read on the internet. But, like most of what we see posted on social media, the truth does not exactly matter – the level of interest does. Foreshadowing of things to come? Putin questioned the legitimacy of US elections and made it oddly clear that he does not meddle in US elections during a conference last month: But that’s not the end of the story. The story started weeks ago, when word came that Russian hackers supposedly broke into the DNC’s servers, stealing all their opposition research on Donald Trump . Who knows how this critical information could be exploited. Was Moscow doing its own vetting of Mr. Trump before putting all its chips behind him with this massive email leak? Was it just for Russia’s intelligence services’ internal use? Will Russia try to clandestinely back channel key parts of this information to the Trump Campaign? We just don’t know, and might never, but that information was not sought out for stealing without reason. In the long run, even if some of the information in those 20,000 emails is slightly altered or not, there’s enough truth in them to do major damage to the DNC at the most inopportune time, right as its convention kicks off in Philidelphia. All talk of Trump’s media-branded “dark speech” about a near apocalyptic America has ended, and the news cycle has changed in favor of The Donald. Mission accomplished for Moscow and its hacker cutouts.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 13, 2020",Watch This Epic Retardant Drop Run By A Firefighting DC-10,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Another summer, another crazy-busy firefighting season in America’s southwest. With two major fires burning in California , Cal Fire’s air tankers are hard at work, even deploying some of their more spectacular contracted aircraft. Enter the 10 Tanker Company and its firefighting DC-10s. Dubbed Very Large Air Tankers, or VLATs for short, these behemoths can lay down massive buffers of fire retardant in one single pass. The pilots of these big jets are known to pull off some amazing, stomach-churning feats, diving down mountainsides, skirting cliffs and executing very low altitude drops in close proximity to firefighters and endangered structures on the ground—and almost always done in abhorrent visibility conditions. Sometimes, people take videos of 10 Tanker crews’ escapades, one of which popped up just yesterday and it is pretty damn awesome. Check it out: The jet you hear zoom overhead in front of the DC-10 is a Cessna Citation, which is used as a spotting aircraft for the tankers making drop runs. The Citations use smoke to mark the drop spot, or they literally fly the run in front of the tanker in a game of follow the leader. There was also this terrifying little gem from a week ago: 10 Tanker’s DC-10s have long been the biggest operational air tankers on the block. Now defunct Evergreen Aviation’s 747-100 based Super Tanker showed much promise but failed to find steady work. Yet in retrospect the idea may have been ahead of its time as now another company, Global Super Tanker Services LLC , has ported over Evergreen’s design and the actual system into their own much newer 747-400. From all accounts this marriage between a more capable and supportable jet and Evergreen’s Super Tanker concept and design seems copasetic, although it is awaiting its first operational drop. Global Super Tanker is aiming to be more of an on-call service, operating out of its centrally located headquarters in Colorado Springs. This location allows it to be anywhere in the lower US in just two and a half hours, or anywhere in the world in under a day. With this in mind, the modified 747 freighter could be used to put out oil platform fires in the Gulf of Mexico and fly home to refuel and rearm. The Super Tanker can just under 20,000 gallons, nearly double that of 10 Tanker’s DC-10s. https://youtube.com/watch?v=K-77eZsHXGw With 10 Tanker fully established and new medium-sized tankers coming online , it will be interesting to see if the business case for a 747 VLAT pans out. In the meantime, expect more crazy videos of firefighting DC-10s in action as the fire season has many months yet to go.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 24, 2016",North Korea Says Latest Missile Launches Were Practice For Nuking Air Bases and Ports,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea has been slinging ballistic missiles like crazy this year, and making very worrisome technological progress . Yesterday, three more missiles, including a pair of short-range Scuds and a longer-ranged Nodong, were launched from a location south of Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un, aka “the Young General,” was in attendance to “lead” the drill. The missiles traveled as far as 360 miles—over half the width of the Korean Peninsula—before slamming into the sea off North Korea’s east coast. Although these shorter-ranged ballistic missiles aren’t as headline-grabbing as their more advanced intermediate and long-range cousins that can threaten the entire region and beyond, they are more tactically relevant. During a time of war, the opening strike from the North would include a storm of ballistic missiles showering South Korea, with an aim to preemptively strike and putting out of commission, even if only temporarily, key military facilities. AP North Korean state media reported: “The drill was conducted by limiting the firing range under the simulated conditions of making preemptive strikes at ports and airfields in the operational theater in South Korea where the U.S. imperialists’ nuclear war hardware is to be hurled. And it once again examined the operational features of the detonating devices of nuclear warheads mounted on the ballistic rockets at the designated altitude over the target area.” At its farthest point, the Demilitarized Zone is only about 310 miles from the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula—well within the missile’s demonstrated 360-mile range. By cratering the runways and causing general mayhem at airfields where American and South Korean tactical fighter and attack aircraft are based, North Korea could not only take them out of the fight during a time when they are most needed, but could leave them vulnerable to ground attack. This is why American and Korean combat aviators and ground crews train tirelessly to get as may armed jets in the air as fast as possible. Naval vessels in port can’t deploy as rapidly as tactical aircraft, which makes them vulnerable to this type of attack. However, a successful attack on docked ships—relatively small targets—comes down to a combination of luck and volume of fire for North Korea’s not-so-accurate ballistic missiles. Knocking out larger targets such as fuel storage farms is much easier proposition. Conventionally armed ballistic missiles are one thing. What North Korea is talking about here, however, is detonating nuclear weapons over these installations, which would result in an immediate and catastrophic loss of combat power, not to mention life. North Korea may have a miniaturized nuclear warhead design in the works, but that is far cry from proving that it can be delivered reliably via ballistic missile. Tests like this, where missile targeting capabilities and warhead fusing concepts can be tested, are part of the ongoing process to make Kim Jong Un’s nuclear ambitions a reliable front-line reality. With this sudden rash of rapid and high-profile testing— even of their most mysterious weapons —the timeline seems to be accelerating. This is clearly forcing South Koreans to develop its own ballistic missiles, and even submarines capable of launching them . This launch was likely a response to South Korea’s agreement with the US to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile system to the mountains about 170 miles southeast of Seoul. The basic THAAD concept., Lockheed Martin THAAD should be able to shoot down any short to medium-range ballistic missile aimed at installations like Camp Humphreys or Osan Air Base and Kunsan Air Base. THAAD can also intercept missiles flying at higher trajectories and altitudes than other multi-role air defense systems, such as the MIM-104 Patriot . The Nodong-1, for instance, can fly much higher than its evolutionary predecessor, the Scud, though it sacrifices range. The fact that the Nodong flew shorter than its theoretical range during yesterday’s test may have been to evaluate a more survivable high-trajectory attack profile. North Korea’s provocative missile launches are teh reason why the controversial THAAD was introduced to the Korean theater . Even so, Pyongyang absolutely abhors it, and the generals have already threatened to launch an attack. Yesterday’s ballistic missile test was likely North Korea’s way of reminding the South and the US that they can back up their threats. Relations between North Korea and the US have continued on a downward spiral in recent days after Kim Jong Un himself was put under sanctions for the first time. Ten other regime officials and five state entities were also included in the new sanction regime. The US’s justification is widespread human rights abuses. An official inside the Obama Administration told Politico.com : “It is not an easy thing to identify those responsible for these kinds of abuses within the North Korean system. This is not a government that publishes a phone directory of its personnel or an organizational chart. It sends a message to people within the North Korean regime… that if you become involved in abuses like running concentration camps or hunting down defectors we will know who you are.” Kim Jong Un, AP All foreign assets within US jurisdiction will be frozen as part of the sanctions initiative. What type of actual impact this will have on Kim and his inner circle is highly questionable, but still Pyongyang was not happy with the move calling it an “open declaration of war against DPRK” and “the worst crime that can never be pardoned.” Maybe most concerning is that North Korea cut the only direct communication channel left with the US as part of their protest, a dangerous move considering the high-tension and massive amount of military hardware staged on a hair trigger throughout the Peninsula.

Right after he had left the hotel, 25 commandos descended onto the structure from out of the night sky, fast-roping from helicopters, guns ablaze. When the commandos came up dry, they pursued Erdogan’s trail, attacking locations where he had stopped after fleeing the hotel. A senior source told Reuters that the President of Turkey had avoided death “by minutes.” It was more than an hour of driving from Marmaris to Dalaman Airport, where a Gulfstream IV jet belonging to the Turkish Government was waiting to extract Erdogan and his aids. Once airborne, the Gulfstream was joined by a pair of F-16s from the Turkish Air Force – flown by loyal Turkish pilots whose mission was to protect the jet’s political cargo. During this time another pair of F-16s, supposedly flown by pro-coup pilots, materialized nearby, poised to take out the President once and for all. But that didn’t happen. Another Reuters -trusted source states: “At least two F-16s harassed Erdogan’s plane while it was in the air and en route to Istanbul. They locked their radars on his plane and on two other F-16s protecting him. Why they didn’t fire is a mystery.” Turkish Government GIV., Alec Wilson Eventually it was decided that the aircraft would land at Istanbul’s Ataturk International Airport. The facility was officially closed, and had already been a target of Erdogan’s opponents. After Erdogan told his supporters to fill the streets and stand up to the military over FaceTime video, Turkish civilians overran the airport. Even the presence of the same armored vehicles that had blitzed their way to the airport’s entrance did not intimidate the crowd. The Daily Sabah states that Erdogan asked the Gulfstream pilot if he could land the jet in Istanbul and taxi without radio communications, using the jet’s lights only instead. The pilot laid out the risks (which were probably substantial) to the President, and Erdogan ordered the pilot to follow through with the plan. It worked uncannily well. Soon after landing the embattled President was on television giving defiant speeches and proclaiming the coup had failed. Next he was seen venturing onto the steps of one of the airport’s buildings , greeting thousands of supporters triumphantly, while also telling them that those who perpetrated the coup would suffer the consequences. The rest is history. It’s an incredible story, seemingly more fit for a Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster than reality. Not to say that it isn’t largely accurate, but at the same time I ask you: could Erdogan’s loyalists come up with any more of a fairytale-like account of what went on that night? I think not. AP As Erdogan’s crackdown against his enemies continues, we’re also getting a picture as to where the aerial portion of coup originated, and who was involved. Reuters states that the core of the aerial force taking part in the coup originated from Akinci Air Base, located between Ankara and Istanbul. About a half dozen F-16s and 15 pilots from the base were said to have been involved. These jets were likely the same aircraft captured on video flying down urban city streets with their afterburners lit, making sonic booms throughout the night. https://youtube.com/watch?v=KfTUhxX_-l8 Two Turkish Air Force KC-135R tanker aircraft supported the aerial rebellion, allowing the F-16s to stay airborne throughout the night. These aircraft originated from Incirlik Air Base, the same base that American forces use for combat air operations in the region. It is also where a fairly large arsenal of American tactical nuclear weapons is stored. The involvement of personnel at Incirlik Air Base is likely why the Turkish Government has cut the power, and shut down the surrounding airspace . The lockdown has severely happened anti-ISIS air operations for the US, but was likely viewed as necessary in order to isolate the critical base until the Turkish Government was certain that soldiers involved with coup had been removed from the sensitive installation. Flying operations at the base have since been restored. Black Hawk helicopters and Cobra gunships from the main Army Airfield in Ankara (Guvercinlik Army Base) are also suspected of taking part in the battle. It was likely a AH-1 Cobra, with its 20mm cannon, that was captured firing over the capital. Closed-circuit video from Ankara shows security personnel on the ground slugging it out with a helicopter gunship the night of the coup. It is also reported that midway through the night, as military units loyal to the government began to react to the situation, F-16s from Eskişehir Air Base launched to pick off rebel aircraft and bomb rebel armor. One helicopter was said to have been shot down and targets
 in Ankara were shown to have been struck . As for the F-16s and KC-135s used by the rebels, they seem to have remained elusive, or to have landed back at their bases before pro-government F-16s could engage them. As far as accounting for all the aircraft used by coup participants, there are some signs that Turkey is still missing helicopters . CNN Turk has reported that a whopping 42 are still unaccounted for. Even if these numbers are exaggerated, any missing helicopters present a problem for the Erdogan Government. It is possible that they could be used for a highly focused decapitation strike, seeing as their operators would have little to lose. Those contingency plans would have had to have been put into place before the coup began, though. You can’t pull a S-70 Black Hawk up to a gas station to refuel, or land a Cobra at a local sporting goods store to rearm. Perhaps because of the missing aircraft, the Turkish Air Force has ordered F-16s into the air for constant combat air patrols since the coup occurred. Additionally, an E-7 Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft , one of the best tools for detecting low-flying helicopters, has been tracked orbiting Ankara over the weekend. Turkish Air Force E-7 Akın Öztürk, the former head of the Turkish Air Force has been identified as the ringleader of the coup, although in a bizarre twist Erdogan himself claims the man behind the scenes is Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania . Gulen says Erdogan was behind the coup , and seems unconcerned about Turkey’s extradition demands. Of course, the arrest of Akın Öztürk is just the beginning of a political purge. Around 6,000 soldiers have been arrested, as well as thousands of police. But it does not end there: magistrates, judges and bureaucrats have also been detained, along with 30 governors . Hey, why waste a good coup when it comes to purging your entire government of opposition, right? As for those soldiers arrested following the coup, many of whom are conscripts, they have been stripped
 down with their hands bound and thrown into fields and warehouses at military bases and government installations. Their present treatment might be the least of their worries. Erdogan may move to reinstate the death penalty for those involved . Meanwhile the top brass of Turkish Armed Forces appear to have escaped any accusations of involvement. Just a little peculiar, considering this coup supposedly involved thousands of their troops taking up arms against the government right under their noses. It’s hardly a signal of their competence. In the end it is amazing to think that the coup – even with its flaws – may very well have succeeded if the raid on Erdogan’s coastal resort came just minutes earlier. The same can be said for the coup’s second chance at decapitating the regime. If those rebel F-16 pilots pulled the trigger, taking down the President’s Gulfstream jet, the course of history would have changed dramatically. From two narrow escapes to triumph in front of crowds and cameras? Stranger things have happened, but it all seems so convenient.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The US Navy’s massive Rim of The Pacific (RIMPAC) multinational exercise is underway off the coast of Hawaii, and part of the biannual drills involves at least one live-fire ship sinking exercise, also known as a SINKEX. This year the decommissioned Oliver Howard Perry class frigate USS Thach (FFG 43) was used for target practice with ships, submarines and aircraft from the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea taking shots at her. Oliver Howard Perry class frigates are old-school tough fighting ships. In the past they have taken massive mine blasts and stayed afloat . The type continues to serve around the world, and in some cases in greatly enhanced configurations . The video below gives us a reminder of just how damn hardy these ships are. The Thach takes multiple hits from torpedoes and anti-ship missiles and stays upright, even though its aftdeck and foredeck have buckled and the ship’s hull is chocked full of holes. It is not clear if all the weapons fired at the ship were loaded with live warheads, but they seem to have been and definitely the torpedoes were. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xa5KqLGvXsw The comparatively flimsy aluminum-hulled Littoral Combat Ships that have replaced the Oliver Hazard Perry class in the US Navy are just now going through shock trials (see the disaster that is concurrency )— after many of these ships have already been built. And shock trials pale in comparison to the gauntlet thrown down during a SINKEX. It would be very unlikely that either LCS class would be able to withstand anywhere near the damage shown in the video and still stay afloat. They simply were not designed to anywhere near the same survivability standards . A shallow draft, a small crew complement, and speed are prioritized over combat durability. Building a fleet of dozens of surface combatants worth tens of billions of dollars with the idea that they will never be successfully attacked is one arrogant, dangerous and glaringly near-sighted concept. The Freedom class LCS USS Freedom refuels from the USS Carl Vinson., USN These big jet boats are being used not just as speedy brown-water gunboats, but also in more traditional frigate-like roles in blue water situations fo rwhich they were never optimized. Now, with the schizophrenic LCS still searching for an identity , the Navy is actually increasing weight by adding weapons and armor on these ships , and slowing them down. This added weight and cost won’t even include area air defense capability , a major deficiency that will keep the LCS from operating independently in medium- to high-threat environments. They are even calling this “up gunned” LCS configuration a Frigate. The whole concept has just become a bastardized joke of what was already a bad idea to begin with. Oh and two shipyards are building these things in two separate classes (for now). The definition of pork. And to think that the F-35 couldn’t even get an alternative engine . No less than 27 nations, 40 ships and submarines, 200 aircraft and 25,000 personnel are participating in RIMPAC 2016. The exercises includes everything from visit, board, search and seizure drills and disaster relief exercises to testing new tech in a very high-profile training enviroment. Take this little tracked battle-bot for instance. It’s pretty cool but reminds a lot of its questionable Russian counterparts. https://youtube.com/watch?v=z7U_Evj1ZUk The LCS will also be proudly “showing off” Harpoon Anti-Ship Missiles bolted onto its foredeck like an afterthought during RIMPAC.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 16, 2016",The Morning After Turkey’s Smart Phone Coup,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday’s events read as if they were right out of a military-political pulp thriller. The peculiar and poorly executed attempt to oust increasingly powerful President Erdogan fizzled as fast as it had begun. Now the world wakes up to a Turkey that is far less stable and whose future is far less certain than it seemed 24 hours ago. Make sure to read our rolling coverage of the coup attempt from yesterday for full context. BULENT KILIC/AFP/Getty Images Last night ended with Erdogan giving a scathing speech in front of thousands of supporters at Ataturk Airport. In it, he vowed to purge the military of anti-regime elements. Such a move is not new to Erdogan, having done so as recently as 2012 , and experts warned of the need to do so again just last May. We are now finding that this coup was largely orchestrated using encrypted
 smart phone chat app Whatsapp . This was reportedly the primary form of communication among coup participants. At the same time, Erdogan’s administration used smart phone tech in a massive way to counter the military coup. Not only did Erdogan use FaceTime to speak to his constituents in the hours immediately after the coup began, telling his supporters to fill the streets and stand up against the military’s power-grab attempt, but the government
 also sent out millions of SMS emergency text messages to everyone in population centers telling them to do the same. AP Erdogan’s call to his supporters to disobey the military’s evocation of martial law and their demand for people to stay inside was the largest factor in Erdogan’s political and possibly physical survival. All this underscores how powerful non-traditional forms of electronic communication have become during major geo-political and military conflicts. As far back as the Iranian Presidential Election protests of 2009 and the Arab Spring that followed, smart phones and social media played a big role in putting collective frustration to work against the prevailing government power with unprecedented efficiency. But yesterday’s coup attempt seems to be the first time two opposing government factions used the technology as primary forms of communication, and frankly, as weapons. AP Meanwhile, the current toll from last night’s events includes 265 killed, over 2,800 arrested and roughly 1,440 wounded. The arrests are mainly made up of soldiers and officers that were involved with the coup. Yet not all were willing to surrender. One Turkish Black Hawk full of officers has defected to Greece, while it is also reported that the Turkish frigate TCG Yavuz has been seized by pro-coup naval officers . The head of the Turkish Navy and the Turkish Air Force are also said to be held captive. As the aftershocks of the coup attempt continue, Turkey cut power to and closed
 the airspace around Incirlik Air Base, a major outpost for American air power—much of which is participating in the air campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. This has resulted in the cessation of coalition air operations out of the base. The closure supposedly has to do with the Turkish Government’s lack of confidence in exactly who is controlling the Turkish Air Force. Gokhan Tan/Getty Images As this erratic situation in Turkey stabilizes the winners and losers of this event will become clearer, although it is safe to say that Erdogan is the biggest winner on multiple levels. He now has been legitimized outside the voting booth on a massive scale and after more than a decade of slowly consolidating power, he will now be able to continue doing so with ease. Also, that purge of the military he wanted, well now he can do it at zero political risk. The military, who has enforced constitutionality of past governments in Turkey since the time of Ataturk, will now be severely weakened and the integrity of the institution overall questioned. This could greatly effect future military cooperation and arms deals. Especially in question is Turkey’s status as F-35 program partner. Delivering such a sensitive and advanced weapon system to an air force that is not even fully loyal to its civilian leadership is troubling, especially seeing as Turkey’s aerial weaponry was used against its own population last night. AP There have been strong voices calling for Turkey to be dropped from NATO for some time, and last winter when a Turkish F-16 shot down a Russian Su-24 for only breaching Turkish airspace for seconds, those voices increased in number and volume . But now, after this great show of instability, those calls will only grow stronger. Any weakening of the NATO alliance benefits Vladimir Putin more than anyone else, whose greatest aspiration is to break-up the 67 year old alliance, and any other type of pan-European unity for that matter. Turkey’s tourism economy, which has already taken a massive toll follow multiple terror attacks, and especially after the attack on Ataturk International Airport just a few weeks ago, will likely be gutted following this unforeseen and quite deadly coup attempt. This will effect Turkey’s ability to fund its own priorities, including its fight against extremist elements, which includes the PKK , a group whose military offshoots are fighting alongside the US in Syria, as well as ISIS, al Qaeda, al Nusra and other terror groups. Stringer/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images As for what comes next, Erdogan has called for his supporters to fill the streets again tonight . Obviously this was the most effective tool for blunting last night’s coup operation, so the fact that he is calling for it again shows that the regime is not totally confident that they have the situation fully under control.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 16, 2016",Watch This F-16 Fly Down A City Street at Night As a Possible Coup Begins In Turkey (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A coup may be under way in Turkey. Both bridges over the Bosphorus have been closed without any stated reason, and there are reports of tanks in the street in the capital of Ankara. This amazing video shows what appears to be a Turkish F-16 making a very low show-of-force pass in afterburner down a major thoroughfare in Turkey’s capital. If the news of an attempted coup is true, the repercussions could be absolutely massive. Turkey is a key NATO member state and ally of the U.S. If a coup were successful, the deep diplomatic ties Turkey currently enjoys with Western Europe and the U.S. could surely be greatly degraded, if not cut altogether. Currently, U.S. forces are using bases in Turkey and transiting its airspace in the ongoing fight against ISIS in Syria; this access could also be put at risk if the Turkish government is militarily overthrown. Tensions between President Erdogan and the Turkish military are well known and have increase in recent months. The terror attack on Istanbul International Airport only elevated these tensions in the last few weeks. It is possible we are seeing these tensions come to a head right now in Ankara. We will keep this post updated as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 2:10pm PST- The Dogan Turkish New Agency has reported that the Turkish Armed Forces have seized control and that they did it “to reinstall the constitutional order, democracy, human rights and freedoms, to ensure that the rule of law once again reigns in the country, for the law and order to be reinstated.” The statement continued “all international agreements and commitments will remain. We pledge that good relations with all world countries will continue.” Just because this statement was made does not mean the country’s government has actually fallen. Prime Minister Binali Yildririm told another Turkish network: “There are certain groups who took the arms trusted to them by the state and pointed them toward state employee… We shall determine soon who they are. Our security forces have acted against these groups.” So as it sits right now it seems that a coup attempt has been made, and remains in progress, but there are no clear reports as to how far along it is. Meanwhile photos of tanks rolling through Istanbul are popping up and the country does seem to be falling into a state of emergency. It is not clear how such an overthrow would be regarded by the Obama Administration. They turned their back on the el Sisi government after the military overthrow of the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood-led government in Egypt even though el Sisi’s views would be much more closely aligned with those of the US.  Although Turkey is a NATO partner, the idea that the military can just unseat a similarly elected government at will is likely to be a major issue when it comes to US-Turkish relations going forward if this coup is indeed a success. Update: 2;55pm PST- Possibly soon to be deposed President Erdogan made
 his first post-coup address via Skype , which is not a good sign. In his statement he told Turkish citizens to go outside. This is a big contrast to the military’s declaration of martial law, telling citizens to stay inside. Meanwhile soldiers have been seen taking over local news outlets while full-on armor columns are rolling through the streets of Istanbul: What’s most concerning is that weapons fire has been widely reported, including this video supposedly showing a helicopter firing at a target below: There remains no clear individual or military faction that is responsible for this coup and it is very possible that a counter-coup may evolve with opposing factions within the military or the police taking up arms. In fact that may already be happening considering the reports of gunfire and the video coming out of the region. Such a situation has the possibility to evolve into a very bloody and protracted affair. UPDATE: 4pm PST- Reports stated that Twitter, Facebook and Youtube are being blocked within Turkey’s borders but now it seems that these social media services are available and operating. Meanwhile, the commanding general of Turkey’s 1st Army has said that this coup
 was orchestrated by a small faction within the military and is not indicative of the military’s stance country-wide. Obviously that faction cannot be that small considering the amount of armor, helicopters and F-16s being put to use over and in major population centers in Turkey. Images of Turkey’s National Intelligence Headquarters burning have been circulating and protestors have been shot with multiple wounded reported just at the bridgehead of one of the key bridges that crosses over the bosphorus alone, There have also been r eports
 that an F-16 shot down a helicopter , possibly a Black Hawk, in the infighting. Update: 5pm PST- Here is another F-16 low-pass: The besieged Erdogan Government has
 setup a no-fly-zone over Ankara . The US and NATO have come out with separate statements siding with the democratically elected Erdogan Government, which is not a surprise. Many thousands of Turkish citizens have defied the military’s supposed curfew. Photos of protesters climbing over main battle tanks and what looks like a sea of people congregating in Istanbul are splattered all over the internet right now. Update: 5:30pm PST- Erdogan’s Gulfstream IV Jet has landed at Istanbul Airport. Awaiting confirmation that he is onboard. It is the first aircraft to land there in four hours. UPDATE: 5:50pm PST- It appears that Turkish Parliment in Ankara has been attacked by some sort of missiles or explosives. Most reports say the damage was caused by attack helicopters. Here is video of one of the blasts: https://youtube.com/watch?v=DP7JLKqB2yY Update: 6:40pm PST- Erdogan makes public statement, and is defiant and vengeful against those to executed the coup. He also made it clear that this will work as a catalyst to purge the military once again. It is odd that we still don’t know who are the leaders of the coup. Also puzzling is just how poorly it was executed beyond its initial deployment. Using helicopters while knowing full well the Air Force and its fighters are not on your side? For a coup to be successful you have to first arrest the current leadership, take control of all key government buildings, control all media and knock out social media, and finally, and most horrifically, you have to be willing to fire on the opposition and in some cases citizens. None of that has happened. This does not mean the coup is a total failure, it could morph significantly in the coming hours, which makes the situation only that much more volatile. Yet the whole series of events remains peculiar to say the least. Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com UPDATE: 7:50pm PST- Here is a picture that supposedly shows the bomb damage done to Turkey’s parliament building: Reuters reports that over 130 military personnel have been detained by the Turkish Government in connection to the coup. Also video has emerged showing bodies strayed across a curbside with what looks grave injuries from heavy weapons. Erdogan claimed that the hotel he was staying at on the Aegean coast was bombed right after he left, although this claim remains unconfirmed. What also remains unclear is why Erdogan did not go back Ankara, Turkey’s capital, instead of going to Istanbul? This brings into question the state of play of Ankara and the security situation there as a whole.  Also, we should start seeing pro-government military units being deployed to confront the coup-related units deployed in Turkish cities. That is if this coup was indeed spurred by only a small faction within the Turkish military. You can also expect Erdogan to reach for emergency powers to deal with the situation, making him more powerful than ever before. An empowered Erdogan would mean the coup actually backfired horribly. That is if this coup is as it appears in the first place. UPDATE: 8:44pm PST- Soldiers blocking bridge across the Bosphorus walk away from their armor with their hands up in surrender: Erdogan speaks outside Ataturk Airport in front of a crowd of thousands. Says democracy picks Turkey’s leadership not the military, makes it clear he wants revenge.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 26, 2016",These Sneaky Russian Snipers’ Scopes Are Anything But Stealthy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A military sniper’s effectiveness can be as much about their ability to conceal their location and to move without detection as it is about hitting targets at long range in a precise manner. These Russian snipers based in Tajikistan seem to be doing all the right things, donning ghillie suits and creeping into positions that allow them clear shots on targets. Yet the bright silver scopes attached to their SVDK sniper rifles seem like the last piece of kit a sniper would choose for concealed operations. Snipers play a strong role in Russian military heritage and lore. Their work during the Great Patriotic War (World War II, in Russian parlance) elevated the job to near-mythical proportions. Vasily Zaytsev was given the title “Hero of the Soviet Union” for his efforts during the war, during which he took down hundreds of German troops—including many opposing snipers. The movie Enemy at the Gates depicts Zaytsev’s counter-sniper battle with a German sniper instructor, although exactly how accurate the story is remains debatable. In all, Russian snipers were by far the most deadly and prolific snipers of World War II. Vasily Zaytsev (left) with his Mosin–Nagant Model 1891/30 sniper rifle during the Battle of Stalingrad., Public Domain/Wikicommons The elevation of snipers in then-communist Russian culture is interesting, as it highlights the individual soldier, not the collective team. It is not a uniquely Russian phenomenon, though. In the U.S., snipers have also been showcased and sensationalized to a great degree. This makes more sense culturally, as America’s focus on individualism is more suited to idealizing a lone highly-trained sharpshooter heading into enemy territory to single-handedly take on the bad guys. And this is far from a Cold War fluke; Hollywood blockbusters like Shooter and American Sniper continue to prove the sniper myth remains of interest to Americans. As time has passed and technology has advanced, modern snipers now have a whole slew of gadgetry available to them that can help them accomplish their missions. Even guided bullets will likely be an operational tool in the not-so-distant future. But in spite of all this tech, for now, the sniper’s mission is still largely based around the individual and his or her rifle. These two things need to be optimized above all else. So it is pretty sad to see Russian snipers decked out in camouflage…while toting bright silver optics.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fallujah and Ramadi have both been retaken by the long-fledgling but now improving and growing Iraqi Army. The liberation of these war-torn Ambar Province cities from the clutches of ISIS were significant accomplishments, but those endeavors are small ball compared to the looming Mosul offensive. The Iraqi Army and its U.S. “advisors” have been slowly shaping the battlefield in northern Iraq since last winter in preparation to retake Mosul. The establishment of the Nineveh Operations Center in the town of Makhmour, about 40 miles southeast of Mosul, is where the heart of the operation will be located. Near this master base and staging area the USMC has set up Fire Base Bell , which can protect the base and support local operations with its artillery, and could even strike targets in Mosul if the HIMARS GPS-guided rocket system is deployed there . An Iraqi Army tank rolls through Fallujah., HAIDAR MOHAMMED ALI/AFP/Getty Images A secondary positive result of Ramadi and Fallujah being retaken is that more battle hardened Iraqi troops and material can be devoted to the Mosul offensive. As I wrote last March : “Army Col. Steven Warren, a spokesperson for the U.S. led anti-ISIS coalition, stated recently that it would require roughly eight trained brigades of about 3,000 Iraqi soldiers each to take the city ( other reports put the number at 36,000 troops.) The operative term being trained . The quality of Iraq’s forces, even after well over a decade of constant training, is still inconsistent at best. As such, 24,000 well-trained soldiers that will actually stand their ground during intense and bloody urban warfare is something that Iraq’s Army may not have anytime in the near future. There are thought to be between 3,200 and 5,000 Iraqi troops now deployed in and around the Nineveh Operations Center. Clearly this is nowhere near the number needed to start looking toward Mosul as a realistic objective.” Iraqi counter-terror forces., AP With this in mind, it seems clear there will be no Mosul offensive until enough manpower is available to see it through—and even 24,000 trained soldiers may be an underestimate as to how many troops will be needed. Still, the fact that Ramadi and Fallujah have been checked off the Iraqi Army’s to-do list is a very good development that may move up the Mosul offensive timetable. There are also reports that the training of Iraqi troops has accelerated over the last few months, resulting in more available troops than originally predicted. As combat forces continue to amass at the Nineveh Operations Center to the southeast of Mosul, the Iraqi Army recently executed the largest armor assault since invading Kuwait in 1990 to gain control of Qayyarah Airfield and the ISIS held villages surrounding it. The strategic airbase, located about 35 miles south of Mosul,will become the central hub for air support during the offensive, as well as a logistics artery for U.S. and Iraqi forces. Qayyarah Airfield, Iraq., Google Earth To secure and support operations at the war ravaged air base, the Obama Administration has announced that 560 more troops will be sent to Iraq, with the vast majority of them working at the base. It remains unclear exactly what aircraft will be based at Qayyarah Air Base, but the runways and facilities are said to be in poor condition. If the U.S. plans on basing aircraft there—which they most likely will—American attack helicopters and possibly A-10s and/or AV-8Bs will be deployed first, along with some short-ranged ISR (information surveillance and reconnaissance) assets and assorted Iraqi aircraft. If the runway can be brought up to fair condition, fast jets such as F-16s may end up using the base to increase sortie rates over Mosul during the offensive. Iraqi Bell 407 light-armed recon helicopter over Iraqi troops., AP From the north, Kurdish Peshmerga brigades, which are largely equipped and supported by the U.S., are moving to encircle the city. This “hammer and anvil” strategy is key to not letting ISIS forces escape the city in order to re-group elsewhere. Although, as we saw last week, trying to move anywhere en masse on Iraq’s desolate highways while the nearly-panoptic fleet of U.S. and Iraqi ISR assets overhead can mean certain death . If ISIS were to try to retreat north and bust through Peshmerga lines, they would likely meet their end from airstrikes while still driving down the highway. Peshmerga standing watch with his AK-47 in northern Iraq., AP Although these are all positive developments, when it comes to the act of retaking Mosul, peril lies seemingly around every corner. Improvised explosive devices are said to line the highway leading into the city from the south, all of which have to be neutralized. And once inside the city’s perimeter, Iraqi troops will meet more booby-traps and roadside bombs, possibly on an unprecedented level, as well as ISIS artillery and a nearly-endless number of human shields. Urban warfare is known for its brutality, but it is also known for its ability to quash either side’s technological advantage. Airpower in particular is dulled during urban combat operations because of the close distances between friend and foe, as well as the complex targeting challenges inherent in densely populated areas. Attack helicopters and A-10 Warthogs, which can fly low over the area to quickly ascertain a picture of what is happening and make shallow-angled attacks on structures and personnel, will likely be essential for supporting troops as they push through the besieged city. Mosul, Iraq., Google Earth What may be most concerning is the humanitarian catastrophe sure to follow such a battle. Once upon a time, 2 million people lived in Mosul; today the estimate is closer to 700,000 . All those people have spent two years under the tyranny of ISIS, and have experienced constant shortages of the staples of daily life. By all accounts, those trapped in the city say conditions are terrible . After living through all that and what will be almost certainly an incredibly bloody battle, how will these people get back on their feet? And how will Mosul stabilize into any type of normalcy? My overall point is that Mosul will need to be put back together again. Its police force and court system will need to be reestablished, electricity and running water made more reliable, and something resembling a local economy will need to be rebuilt. But before all that, its people—many of which will sadly get caught in the battle’s crossfire—will need critical care and attention. These will need to be provided in what could be a very dicey security situation that could persist for months after the Iraqi Army takes back control of the city. Refugee camp for those who escaped Mosul in Makhmur District, Iraq., Hemn Baban/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images If anything else, America’s fumbling excursion into Iraq has proven that a plan for what happens when the fighting ends is as important as the initial battle plan itself, if not more so. The U.S. was once again caught with no plan when ISIS stormed into Mosul more than two years ago. After exiting the country militarily in 2011, contingency planning for what was clearly a growing threat from ISIS never occurred. Hopefully, the U.S. and Iraq have learned their lesson and are prepared to handle what comes next in Mosul once ISIS is routed from the traumatized city. As for the question of when troops will actually push towards the outskirts of Mosul, that remains unclear. The pieces are certainly falling into place, but conflicting messages from Iraqi and U.S. officials do not point to a definitive time frame. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has promised to retake Mosul by the end of this year , while U.S. generals have openly stated that even starting the offensive this year will be a major challenge. Remnants of ISIS sniper bullets on an up-armored Iraqi Army Humvee., AP However, this evaluation may have changed after the recent success in Ambar Province and the capture of Qayyarah Air Base. It may now be possible to start operations in the fall—but slowly working through Mosul and carefully clearing the city of ISIS fighters will take time, as well as the steely will of an Iraqi Army that is just now proving its mettle. Regardless of when the offensive begins, taking back Mosul decisively will be absolutely critical when it comes to bringing about the end of ISIS as we know it. Without holding major population centers in multiple countries, the organization’s legitimacy will be heavily damaged, and its self-proclaimed caliphate will be redefined by rapidly decreasing territory and geographical influence. Iraqi troops fire off heavy artillery., AP Although taking back Ramadi and Fallujah were necessary steps in solidifying Iraq’s precarious security situation, big wins against ISIS have been slow to come. The air war against the Islamic State may have truncated the group’s ability to operate freely in the open and spread linearly, but the fact that it has withstood two years of constant bombing by the U.S. and its allies is a clear propaganda win for them. Putting forward air controllers on the ground and unleashing America’s special operations forces on ISIS long ago would have resulted in more tangible results, but the Obama Administration has ignored the limitations of airpower and has decided to go the slow (and very low-risk) route instead. The Islamic State has proven to be incredibly resilient to this strategy. Hopefully, the long-awaited Mosul offensive will decisively turn the tide and mark the beginning of the end when it comes to the group’s ability to hold ground across Mesopotamia. AP Finally, there remains the question of how Iraq will find peace once ISIS no longer holds territory within its borders. With Iranian-backed Shiite militias, U.S.-backed Kurds, and the Iraqi Army itself empowered and armed like never before, can Iraq keep itself from falling into civil war? And what is America’s plan should that occur…or is there one at all?

After making its last catapult launch from France’s nuclear aircraft carrier the Charles De Gaulle last March, the end was clearly near for the subsonic, swept-wing naval attack jet. Now, the curtain has finally dropped on its amazingly productive career. The Super Étendard Modernisé, or SEM as it’s lovingly called, took the fight to France’s enemies right up until the end, providing targeting support and striking ISIS following the terrorist attacks on Paris last winter. The fact that SEM was still in the fight at all nearly 40 years after it entered service was pretty amazing considering its age, and its less-than-cutting-edge performance. A series of bolt-on modernization efforts during the jet’s golden years kept it relevant, but, alas, the time has come to pass the torch to the Dassault Rafale-M, a jet that has itself been in development and operationally evolving for decades. Although France’s small SEM fleet has flown its last flights, Argentina still maintains about a dozen Super Étendards—though the actual flyable number may be about half that number. It’s unclear if parts from France’s fleet will be used to augment Argentina’s struggling force, or if France’s SEMs will be marketed for resale, though it’s doubtful. Originally best known for its ability to sling Exocet anti-ship missiles with devastating results , and for providing laser targeting support in its later years, the SEM will be missed.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The RQ-170 Sentinel has been in the public eye for nearly a decade, but it still remains an incredibly rare (and shy) specimen. The USAF doesn’t have much to say about its flying-wing spy, and there are indications that the design may have been spun off into the murky realm of unmanned combat air vehicles. What we do know for sure is that a number of these exotic aircraft operate alongside MQ-9 Reapers and MQ-1 Predators out of Creech AFB, located north of Las Vegas. The Sentinels migrated there over the last few years as part of the secretive 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, after spending an undefined amount of time operating clandestinely out of Tonopah Test Range Airport. A year ago, the RQ-170 was caught on the ramp at Creech AFB by a commercial satellite. Here’s part of what I wrote at the time: “On a small handful of occasions the RQ-170 has been photographed flying the pattern around Creech AFB as the main runway runs parallel to the highway. A video was also shot of the Sentinel whizzing around the Nevada Test and Training Range a couple years ago. But beyond these few occasions, the Sentinel has remained an elusive aircraft, with more imagery existing of it from overseas, namely from Iranian state news , than from here at home. This is quite amazing, considering that it has been the better part of a decade after the Sentinel was first spotted at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan, and was subsequently dubbed the ‘Beast of Kandahar’ by Aviation Week’s Bill Sweetman.” With the RQ-170 likely being born from the ashes of the RQ-3 Darkstar program—greatly accelerated after the events of 9/11 but having conceptual roots dating back to the late 1970s —the aircraft could now be well into its second decade of service. It’s known to have spied over Iran and Pakistan, helped nabbed Osama Bin Laden, and has operated in the Pacific Theatre. It has even practiced providing bomb-damage assessment , among the most perilous jobs in air combat, for the B-2 Spirit. With this, and all the inadvertent press the aircraft has received, in mind—not to mention the fact that one example was dissected by Iran—it’s puzzling that the USAF keeps it so shrouded in secrecy. Then again, highlighting the existence of the RQ-170 would almost certainly open the door to questioning the non-existence of the Air Force’s advanced unmanned combat air vehicle program .

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 17, 2016",This Has To Be One Of The Most Terrifying Carrier Landing Videos Ever,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The video below, shot from both the flight-deck’s PLAT camera and from the carrier’s island super-structure, depicts a March 18 landing mishap in terrifying fashion.  The event occurred aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower while operating off the eastern seaboard. Upon landing, the E-2C Hawkeye caught one of the cross-deck pendants, more commonly known as “wires” or “cables.” The cable then came loose from its port side seating and whipped through the air toward the carrier’s superstructure. Eight of the Eisenhower’s crew were injured in the incident, some of them very seriously. Amazingly, nobody was killed. Although the E-2 Hawkeye is slowed as it advanced down the carrier’s landing area, it was nowhere near stopping. As a result, the aircraft careened off the angled deck, diving toward the ocean below. Amazingly, the crew was able to get the aircraft back into the air—even after disappearing entirely from view. There was zero margin for survival in this scenario, and according to one sailor quoted by the Navy Times “It (the E-2) came back, but it had friggin’ salt water on the bottom of it!” The Hawkeye returned safely to NAS Norfolk following the incident, although the crew was very shaken up which is understandable considering they probably thought they were about to die. Keep in mind the E-2 does not have ejection seats for its pilots nor for its radar controllers. Hawkeye crews are a brave breed indeed. According to WAVY.com , an inquiry into the mishap found that the sailors aboard the “ Ike ” didn’t follow procedures to troubleshoot the arresting gear, with one and potentially two critical steps being missed.  Yet at the same time, the mistakes were not necessarily negligent according to the report: “Based upon their training, the sailors reasonably believed they had properly and conscientiously completed troubleshooting procedure… Phenomenal airmanship by the E-2 mishap aircrew prevented any casualties among the aircrew and the loss of the aircraft, while the quick response by flight deck and medical personnel facilitated timely medical treatment and evacuation of the injured personnel.” You can read the whole report here . Cross-deck pendants  are replaced regularly after a prescribed number of arrestments. As such breaks are very rare, but when they do happen they can be incredibly dangerous, sending the cable whipping across the deck at speeds capable of cutting a sailor nearly in half. The Virginia Pilot states that before this incident there had been just three arresting-gear related deaths and 12 major injuries since 1980. The amazing video below shows an F/A-18 Hornet that suffered a cable snap on landing. The pilot ejected just as the jet was about to roll of the deck but maybe the most amazing thing is the yellow shirt’s seemingly Jedi-like intuition to jump over the speeding cable, not once, but twice, and all with his back turned! It is said that life on a carrier’s deck is like living in controlled chaos, and these videos support that claim. It’s a dangerous business indeed.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 7, 2016",Dallas PD’s Use of a Bomb-Toting Robot to Kill Shooter Is a Sign of Things To Come,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After hours of trying to negotiate with Dallas shooter Micah Xavier Johnson , the Dallas Police Department apparently used an unorthodox method to end the standoff. They sent one of their Explosive Ordinance Disposal robots in with an explosive device and detonated it near Johnson, killing him. It is thought to be the first time police have used a robot to kill a human. Earlier in the night, Dallas Police Chief David Brown mentioned during a press conference that he had to get back to the command post to review “options” for ending the standoff. This hinted that there was likely no apparent conventional manner to do so. We still don’t have details as to why exactly a robot-borne IED was used, although the dynamics of the standoff could have left Johnson and his officers in a situation where sharp shooters were useless and exposing even swat officers in order to get a clear line of fire may have been deemed far too risky considering the man was already a cop killer and armed with a long gun. Using a large tactical vehicle like a Bearcat to provide cover may have not been an option due to the low ceilings heights found in urban parking garages and the tight maneuvering area inside. Expensive robots have long been used by SWAT teams’ EOD divisions. Another high-profile incident saw Dallas PD’s robot detonating explosives in an armored van a year ago. Yet proliferation of EOD robots exploded following America’s withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan. Throngs of EOD robots that the Pentagon bought to support the fight against improvised explosive devices on the battlefields of the Middle East were distributed to domestic police departments under the Pentagon’s controversial 1033 program. A US Navy EOD robot in action., USN While these robots are usually used to inspect, manipulate, disarm and detonate potential explosive devices, they can also be used for basic reconnaissance, delivering items during hostage negotiations, and other more or less benign functions. But just like aerial remote controlled drones, these small tracked robots are nearly ideal weapons delivery systems. The threat from small aerial drones is something the Pentagon and Homeland Security are slowly coming to terms with. But adapting small unmanned systems for offensive purposes has been a more shadowy affair. Some small, military-grade, man-portable drones like Switchblade can be used for surveillance and as a kamikaze attacker, putting a small explosive charge to use to kill enemy combatants or disable vehicles. But simply wheeling an explosive device within proximity of a crazed gunman is an even more logical and attainable capability. In fact, some tracked robot concepts are built around the idea of taking out the enemy remotely without damaging the robot . Military and police units have been slow to adopt these systems, but that could now change. The concept of using unmanned systems to end standoffs and hostage situations has been looming for some time. As they evolve and become more creature like— something the Pentagon is actively working on —their use in such situations will likely become not just commonplace but a primary solution not a secondary one. Prox Dynamics' PD-100 Black Hornet that the Army is testing now., US Army I have talked about this in detail over the years. As unmanned systems become insect-sized, their potential to take out enemies even while concealed in hard-to-reach places will become undeniable. I wrote the following in 2012: “By arming these micro UAVs with explosives you create a suicide robot that would be feared psychologically by the enemy on truly unprecedented levels, as they would literally be able to sneak in a cracked window at night and detonate themselves above the enemy as they sleep… Imagine a scout sniper team being able to recon their area while still remaining hidden almost as if they were doing it on foot. A micro-UAV system would give them the ability to go inside open buildings and peer around corners. All the swarm’s intel could be recorded in real time as well. Further, micro-UAV swarms could be used as a weapon instead of a tell-tale sniper shot which often gives away a stealthy scout sniper team’s hiding position. Instead they could spot their target and fly a little drone too it, detonating next to the target by surprise when it comes within lethal range. No loud muzzle report or bright muzzle flash needed. In many ways science fiction has already portrayed such drones as the ultimate in persistent search and destroy weaponry, too hard to kill and relentless in their pursuit.” Then in this piece, Tyler’s 10 Thoughts On The Future Of Drone Warfare , I wrote: “On the tiny side of things, mechanized dragonflies and mosquitoes will become the ultimate tools of clandestine warfare. Able to penetrate almost any structure, these tiny drones could be used to literally look and listen in on the enemy’s most sensitive conversations without being detected or requiring risky planting before such a meeting took place. Further, these types of mechanical micro-insects will be able to track an enemy high value target by simply attaching to their vehicle or clothes. Even machinery and computer networks could eventually be infiltrated with tiny mechanical spiders, still far larger than the aforementioned nanobots, that could wreak havoc on hardware from inside the computers themselves. Finally and the most sinister of all, mosquito, wasp, or even ant like drones could use their organic pseudo-pedigree in deadly ways, injecting the enemy with poison even while they are fast asleep. What at first would seem like a harmless series of bug bites would soon turn out to be a death sentence. With this insect like drone technology there will no longer be a need to blow up a building with a Hellfire missile in order to kill a single high value target inside. Instead war-fighters could just drop a swarm of mechanical mosquitoes over the building in question and proceed to deal death with microscopic accuracy and finesse. These tiny drones represent the ultimate in low collateral damage stealth weaponry. Yet the technology also represents a massive threat to our forces as well. How do you adequately protect the common soldier, yet alone people like the President or other highly important figureheads when just a drone-mosquito bite could mean certain death? Once this technology gestates, what once were traditionally safe havens, such as inside known structures or surrounded by security personnel, will no longer be considered so. The only true defense against such an insidious capability would be to live within totally sealed structures at all times. What I am trying to say here is that this type of micro-drone, insect-like technology, once developed, has the ability to change the way we live totally, and if it were to fall into the wrong hands it could be incredibly dangerous.” Just like the topic of autonomous and swarming unmanned air vehicles , such capabilities may be a hot debate issue among legal scholars and technologists now, but the reality is that they represent too sweet of a tactical apple to be left hanging on the tree. US Marshalls in action during the night of the Dallas shootings., AP After this morning’s robotic end to the standoff in Dallas’s El Centro parking garage, police departments’ playbooks around the country and the world will likely change, and the weapons industry will be right there with “offensive drones” waiting to streamline this new concept. And why use a bomb when you can use a drone-mounted gun, or one day simply inject the enemy with poison as if it were a mosquito bite? In other words, the “police improvised explosive robot” will likely be short lived, with departments turning toward buying lethal robots for just this type of situation. And from there the technology will quickly evolve, for better or for worse. Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com A personal note from the author: I saw some incredibly heroic police work last night. The United States is going through a tough period of police-community relations, but last night showed just how many brave and selfless policemen and women are serving in this country, and the complexities of the challenges they face daily.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 21, 2018",Just Allow The F-22 To Be Exported To Japan Already,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japan always wanted the F-22—badly. But nearly two decades ago, Congress barred the super-fighter from being exported to anyone , including America’s closest allies. This act slashed Japan’s F-22 dreams, although they kept asking. Times have changed, and with Japan facing down a drastically more aggressive and advanced Chinese military—one that has territorial ambitions in direct conflict with Japan’s own claims. The tension has manifested in the air-to-air realm, with Japan intercepted a whopping 199 Chinese aircraft between April and June of this year, and those intercepts are getting more aggressive. Combined with threats from North Korea, this new reality has been taken very seriously by Japan, which has put in place aggressive initiatives to upgrade existing fighter aircraft and acquire new ones with greatly enhanced lethality. Japan's aging F-15Js remain the backbone of their air defenses., USAF The F-22’s technologies are also no longer experimental. In fact, they are decades old. In many ways, the exportable F-35 is more technologically advanced than the F-22. At this point, the export ban on the F-22 is more of a protectionist tool to bolster the F-35’s production numbers than a national security play. But now a $40 billion tender is being put forward by Japan to indigenously develop or import a new super fighter design. Although Mitsubishi’s X-2 technology demonstrator has just taken flight , it is just that: a technology demonstrator. Despite inaccurate press reports that the X-2 is a prototype, there’s is no guarantee it will make it into production in the coming decade. Think of it more as a Bird Of Prey than a YF-22 . X-2 with F-2 chase plane on maiden flight, Kaz Photography/Getty Images The USAF is finally looking at restarting the Raptor production line , but the chances of that happening are almost nil, because doing so would directly challenge the F-35 program. And although the F-22 is the only existing fighter that can actually fulfil Japan’s $40 billion tender, it will likely be shot down by Lockheed, the USAF and Congress. Meanwhile, Japan is already a F-35 customer, with 42 of the jets on order. This sounds crazy. There may be an opportunity here for Japan to foot the cost of restarting F-22 production, which is supposedly the major barrier keeping the USAF from buying more Raptors. However, the reality is that a dollar spent on a new F-22 is a dollar taken away from producing more F-35s. So although the increasingly positive platitudes from high-up USAF officials have hinted that they would love to have more F-22s, the abstract effects of doing so are politically unpalatable. Anything to protect the F-35—and I mean anything . So what we will probably end up with is a situation where a major US defense aerospace prime contractor, let’s say Lockheed Martin, works with Japan’s Iron Triangle supported defense industrial base to build, well, pretty much an F-22, although not an exact copy. This will come at far higher cost than just restarting the line, but doing so will not endanger the F-35’s budgetary supremacy within the USAF and the Pentagon as a whole. This has actually been done before to a certain extent, see the Mitsubishi-Lockheed F-2 , Japan’s semi-indigenous F-16. These jets, of which Japan bought a similar number of around 100, ended up costing well over $100 million each when they could have just bought advanced block F-16s for a third of that price and left comparatively little capability on the table. F-2 strike fighter It all sounds pretty stupid doesn’t it? Here there is a real opportunity to get the F-22 back in production and likely in an upgraded fashion with more advanced and serviceable avionics and other components, potentially all on Japan’s dime. The USAF could piggyback the JASDF order and bolster its fleet of just 183 F-22s (of which only about 125 are combat coded at any given time) for largely the unit cost alone. But this super-logical offering will likely never happen, because nothing can endanger the F-35, both from a manufacturer’s point of the view and Washington’s. Japan is slated to make its “F-3” fighter choice in the summer of 2018 so there is still a couple of years for Washington to come to its senses and make an about-face on its F-22 embargo, although I wouldn’t hold my breath.

The Video was taken on the Sundeck (Deck18) on the Norwegian Breakaway (NCL) on a 7 day round trip cruise from New York to Bermuda, at 4:30 PM at St. Gerorge, Bermuda June 24, 2016.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=pAMYeRqy5DA News flash to all those adventurous cruisers out there, the rich ecosystem of territorial control, maritime surveillance, safe passage and pretty much everything else that goes on every day on the high seas does not stop for your entertainment cruise. If anything this should have been an exciting thing to experience, seeing a maritime patrol jet doing what it does, which includes protecting you and your disgustingly proportioned cruise liner (really the ship is pretty atrocious looking). Lewis William Harris/Wikicommons In fact, this isn’t a rare occurrence. I have been on quite a few cruises in the past and on a few of them we had maritime patrol aircraft check us out. We even had Greek fighter jets rip overhead one time. Everyone seemed to think it was neat and really unique stuff like this is what makes cruising a fun experience. Then again it has been years since I have ventured back onto the lavished seas so maybe in the post 9/11 world, one where everyone has a dedicated “safe place,” and anything people don’t immediately understand is deemed oppressive, this may no longer be the case. I find that sad. The thing is that this is not just some random video that a kid threw up on YouTube, it was featured on many media outlets, including the notoriously wind-baggie morning cable news program Fox and Friends . The teleprompter reading talent said the jet almost hit the water slides and they acted taken aback and very concerned by what the video showed. The two dimensional world of photography can be so hard to dissect sometimes right? Hardly! That jet didn’t come anywhere near those slides and posed no danger to that ship. But why analyze anything before putting it on the air right? The scary thing is that these are the people providing information to the mass public in a visual medium. But it is nothing new. How many times has the same program and others shared “incredible images” of “sonic booms” from air shows which are nothing of sort and are not even good quality images at that, but why even google it before running it right? I am amazed that with all the information so easily at our fingertips today that people appear to be getting stubbornly dumber, not smarter. I addressed this recently when it comes to the media and gun control, but even small, simple issues seem to be a big challenge for many to get right these days. The French Navy doing its job is just one more fake personal offense (also catch-phrased “micro-aggression”) that the ever more insular big media can play along with and parade in front of viewers eyes to fill airtime and get clicks. A simple YouTube or google search would show up many similar occurrences that lacked the YouTube poster’s hyperbole-filled description and thus went unsyndicated all over the country. Here is actually another perspective of the event in question and a description that tells us just how benign the Falcon 50’s little air show was: “Captain Kate of Celebrity Summit came on the loudspeaker on June 24, 2016 saying there was a French Navy Jet that was doing drills and asked for permission to fly around our boat. We were just off of the coast of Bermuda. It was a really cool experience and thanks to Captain Kate, there was no confusion or worry about what was going on. The real story.” In the end the media’s headline for this piece should have been: “French military jet gives cruisers impromptu air show,” not clearly embellished talk about how this was some sort of dangerous or mysterious encounter.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Republic Of China Navy (ROCN) missile boat was conducting a drill while docked in port when one of the vessel’s supersonic anti-ship missiles inadvertently fired. The missile flew nearly 50 miles into the waters off Penghu, a strategic Taiwanese controlled group of islands located in the volatile Taiwan Strait. Sadly, it homed in on a fishing vessel and struck the ship—just as it is designed to do. The captain was killed and three fisherman were wounded. The fishing boat was also from Taiwan. At the time the launch occurred, the Ching Chiang class patrol ship Jin Chiang (PGG-610) was docked at Zuoying naval base, on the southwest shore of Taiwan. A ROCN Admiral told reporters that it seems like the drill the crew was doing was not executed “in accordance with normal procedure.” So it looks like a human factor caused the unintended launch at this time. ROCN Ching-Chiang class patrol boats., © CEphoto, Uwe Aranas / CC-BY-SA-3.0 The missile involved was a ram-jetpowered Hsiung-feng III (Brave Sword III) supersonic anti-ship missile, one of Taiwan’s most advanced anti-ship weapons. Details of the indigenous design remain shadowy, but the missile is thought to have a range of around 150 miles, fly at over mach two and resemble a modernized version of the Russian-designed P-270 Moskit (NATO reporting name SS-N-22 Sunburn), which China stockpiles en-masse. The Hsiung-feng III is also known to use inertial guidance for cruise and onboard active radar homing to attack its target during its terminal phase of flight. In this case it must have detected the fishing vessel and prosecuted the target just as if it were a military one. A shore-launched version of the Hsiung-feng III anti-ship missile., Globalsecurity.org For the better part of a century, many anti-ship cruise missiles have had an autonomous targeting capability that allows the launch platform to send missiles into a certain area, where it will then search for targets on its own. This allows ships or aircraft to fire anti-ship missiles far over the horizon, even when external targeting support in unavailable or when the launch platform too far away to guide the missile to its final destination. In other words, instead of being specifically targeted at one ship, the missile independently searches for a target where hostile is predicted to be by the time the missile shows up. It sounds like an incredibly dangerous and antiquated form of warfare, and to some degree it is. High-end anti-ship missiles increasingly use imaging infrared sensors with image matching, electronic emissions sensing gear and other sensors, as well as being networked to leverage multiple external targeting feeds, to better identify catagorize and priortize the vessels they attack . The Hsiung-feng III is not one of these weapons. They are meant to be salvoed at Chinese warships speeding across the Taiwan Strait during a time of outright conflict where collateral damage to innocent vessels will be a footnote when it comes to the level of destruction resulting from such a battle. Here is the Hsiung-feng III undergoing testing and below that is footage of the fishing boat that was struck during this freak incident: Shortly after the accident, helicopters and maritime patrol aircraft were sent to the area. At the time, it was thought the missile crashed safely into the water. Taiwan has not disclosed whether they alerted Beijing of the accidental launch, though probably not, considering communications between the bitter foes has supposedly been totally cut off since last week. The idea of an errant supersonic cruise missile heading in China’s direction from Taiwan’s shore is troubling to say the least. The region is bristling with anti-ship, cruise and ballistic missiles, and it wouldn’t take much for a simple mistake to snowball into a much larger conflict.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Days after Iraqi forces, backed by US airpower, swept ISIS from war-torn Fallujah , a convoy of ISIS vehicles traveling west on a desert highway leading toward the Iraqi-Syrian border was identified and tracked by a US surveillance aircraft east of Ramadi. US and Iraqi aerial attack assets swooped in on the convoy, laying waste to an estimated 200 vehicles loaded with supplies, and killing an estimated 250 fighters in the process. The event is reminiscent of the Highway of Death incident that occurred at the tail end of Operation Desert Storm , albeit on a smaller scale. The convoy was probably escaping Iraqi forces and repositioning to support ISIS fighters under attack in the Iraq-Syria border town of Abu Kamal. The far western Syrian city is a major artery for ISIS fighters and material, and has been recently under assault by US-backed and trained Syrian troops. A small airbase outside of the city was briefly seized by these forces, dubbed the New Syrian Army, last week, but then an ISIS counter-assault took it back. A large stockpile of munitions were looted in the process. Another convoy of around 55 vehicles tried to escape from one of Fallujah’s western suburbs but was also pummeled by airpower. Although Iraq said Fallujah has once again been liberated from extremist control, there are massive population displacements due to the fighting, and aid is in short supply. The questionable security situation has only made getting aid to those in need that much more perilous. What makes the airstrikes on the convoys odd is that ISIS fighters had adapted to US airpower early in the coalition bombing campaign, and don’t usually travel in dense convoys like the ones attacked yesterday. https://youtube.com/watch?v=-vRVyEViXx4 Clearly, pressure has increased on ISIS as airstrikes have ramped up to an unprecedented degree and with the Iraqi Army recently kicking ISIS out of Ramadi and Fallujah, and with Iranian-backed Shiite militias evicting Islamic State fighters from Tikrit months ago . There is also pressure being put on ISIS in Syria. From the west, Assad’s forces, backed by Russia, are marching east toward ISIS’s de facto capital of Raqqa, while Syrian Democratic Forces, mainly made up of Kurdish Worker’s Party affiliated fighters , are arrayed to the north of the city. Still, kicking ISIS out of places like Fallujah or Palmyra is a far cry from executing a similar operation in Mosul or Raqqa. By all accounts, anti-ISIS forces of any type are many months—and more likely years— away from doing so , and the resulting battles could be some of the bloodiest in modern history. Meanwhile, ISIS’s reach is expanding in other places , including online with its so-called virtual caliphate, and its ideology is becoming more ingrained across the world. The terrible proof of which we’ve seen in terrorist attacks both at home and abroad. Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com UPDATE: The USAF has released some incredible footage of the opening shots of this attack and disclosed that F-15Es, A-10s, B-52s and MQ-1s were all involved with the onslaught. You can see the “bookend” strikes at the front and rear of the convoy to trap it, then it looks like possibly a Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) with a CBU-87 cluster munition or the A-10’s cannon was used to pulverize the central part of the convoy.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a two year delay, the F-35B finally touched down in the UK. A trio of Joint Strike Fighters—two from the USMC and one in RAF badging—were “dragged” by a KC-10A Extender across the Atlantic, with the jets landing at RAF Fairford at around 8pm local time. No PR or marketing dweeb on the planet could have dreamed up a better backdrop for their arrival, as double rainbows framed the jets on the tarmac perfectly. Matt Cardy/Getty Images Undoubtedly, it was a good day for the UK Ministry of Defense and the F-35 program. The flight was delayed 48 hours due to issues with the KC-10 Extender that was scheduled to meet the F-35Bs at MCAS Beaufort before heading out across “the pond.” After the KC-10 was repaired, the flight made its way to the UK without any reported issues. Of course, when it comes to the F-35, we often find out later how things really went. RAF Typhoons formate on the three-ship of F-35Bs as they approach the UK, RAF The jets will be displayed at the Royal International Air Tattoo on July 8 and 9, and then at the Farnborough Airshow the following week. One of the F-35Bs will reportedly perform a vertical landing for air show goers on a specially constructed aluminum pad at RAF Fairford. It is widely known that F-35B’s super-heated and crushingly powerful exhaust has the ability to do major damage to runways and deck surfaces without elaborate fortifications. A USMC KC-130J was also sent to the UK to perform a mid-air refueling demo with the F-35B in tow. The F-35B is arguably the most relevant and promising Joint Strike Fighter variant . While at the same time it’s short-takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) requirement dictated the design of the F-35 overall, handicapping its carrier-based and conventional counterparts in the process. Only about 15% of the Joint Strike Fighters slated to be produced will be the STOVL F-35B variant. The Royal Navy and RAF are hoping to procure 138 of the jets in total over the coming decades. By 2023, the MoD plans to have 42 of the jets ready by 2023, with 24 being used to equip the Royal Navy’s new carrier, the HMS Queen Elizabeth , and 18 will be used for training . BAE Systems Although the successful arrival of the F-35 in the UK is a good step forward for the troubled program , it is being treated absurdly by some aviation fans out there, bashing F-35 “haters” for criticizing the program in the past. First off, calling critics of the program “haters” is ridiculous. It is a very complex issue, with many facets, and using rival sports team-like labels is a huge oversimplification of a clearly debatable issue. They might as well also call the Pentagon’s head tester , POGO , the GAO the Secretary of the Air Force and many other official organizations that have provided data and highlighted the shortcomings of the program, and the concept of concurrency that it was built on , haters as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=52JXSUFxmGo Second, crossing the Atlantic in an amazing accomplishment if you are living in the late 1920s or early 1930s. For the most advanced fighter jet in the world —one that has been flying for a decade and is many years behind schedule and cost tens of billions of dollars to develop this far—doing so is a long overdue step forward for the program—nothing more. Originally, after years of prior delays, the flight was supposed to happen occur years ago but was cancelled after an F-35 burned on the runway due to an engine fire . News that the program had rescheduled the mission to this summer was released only early this year . Matt Cardy/Getty Images In the end, the F-35 program and the MoD deserve a day in the sun for finally getting the F-35 across the Atlantic to the UK. But the reality is that after ten years of flying and piles of cash, the idea that simply ferrying an F-35B from the US to the UK is some sort of massive triumph is as much a sign of just how low the bar has fallen for this program than how far it has come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 29, 2016",Here’s The Other Side Of That “US Destroyer Cuts Off A Russian Frigate” Story,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, Russia protested what it called a “dangerous act” executed by the US Navy in the Eastern Mediterranean, releasing a video clip that appeared to show the USS Gravely pulling alongside and then cutting across the Russian frigate’s path . Now, the other side of the story is emerging, and there seems to be more to it than just what that video clip showed, and what the Russians are claiming. The whole encounter lasted over and hour, according to Defense News . The ordeal began as the Gravely was escorting the USS Harry S. Truman during normal operations, with the Russian frigate shadowing them from a distance. Then the frigate began maneuvering towards the carrier, eventually getting so close that its presence affected the big flattop’s ability to maneuver. Carriers have to be pointed into the wind when conducting flight operations ; as such, containing their movements can severely disrupt flight operations, and even endanger aircrews under certain circumstances. The Gravely broke from formation with the carrier and attempted to put herself between the now much closer Yaroslav Mudry and the Truman . It’s at that point that the Russians apparently used a bit of guile in an attempt to continue to disrupt the carrier’s operation and draw the destroyer closer. Defense News’s source familiar with the encounter describes it in detail: “The interaction was assessed as unprofessional because 777 (the Yaroslav Mudry’s hull number) displayed an international signal for being restricted in her ability maneuver, but then freely maneuvered in both course and speed as Gravely changed course and speed… This demonstrates that 777 was not restricted in their ability to maneuver.” Russian frigate Yaroslav Mudry before her hull number change to 777, FAndrey/wikicommons The defense official continues: “777 had raised day shapes ‘ball-diamond-ball,’ which is the international signal a ship displays when restricted in her ability to maneuver, when she took position two nautical miles off Gravely’s starboard quarter. Then, 777 repeatedly asked Gravely over VHF radio to maintain ‘a safe distance, while 777 continued to maneuver to get closer to Gravely … As Gravely changed course and speed, 777 also changed course and speed. The maneuvering demonstrates that 777 was not in fact restricted in her ability to maneuver, and was thus intentionally displaying a false international signal… Gravely assessed that 777 was intentionally trying to interfere with Harry S. Truman operations.” According to the source, the incident marks the closest a Russian naval vessel has come to a carrier or a destroyer operating in the Mediterranean Sea in recent memory. If the official’s report is accurate, it seems as if the Russian frigate drew the Gravely in to a certain degree, and does paint the video released by Russia in a different light. Whether it was just an attempt to poke US naval forces operating off of Syria, or a planned attempt to capture some “hey, they harass us too!” footage for propaganda purposes, remains unclear. The Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group has recently taken over air strike operations against ISIS from the eastern Mediterranean, allowing the Truman Carrier Strike Group to finally begin its voyage home after an extended combat cruise.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 9, 2020",This Israeli Drone Ship May Be Small But It Packs A Big Torpedo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Elbit Systems’ 12-meter experimental Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), dubbed Seagull, has been busy testing new capabilities and control concepts in recent months. The idea is that a small swarm of these craft—well, just two right now—can be controlled from a single workstation, deployed either ashore or on a ship. From there, tasks such as harbor patrol and force protection, mine detection, search and rescue and even anti-submarine warfare can be conducted with maximum efficiency. The Seagull’s semi-autonomous control concept , long endurance (up to 96 hours of runtime), advanced sensor suite, and ease of adaptation could allow it to be a major force multiplier for navies in the not-so-distant future. The anti-submarine warfare mission is especially interesting as deploying a small swarm of these boats and ranging them over the horizon from their mothership or homeport could provide an inexpensive and thorough anti-submarine screen. Historically, the problem with using a 12-meter boat for this mission is that even if it detects a submarine, another weapons platform has to prosecute that target. This could be an anti-submarine warfare helicopter or a maritime patrol aircraft , or even the mothership, by way of a rocket assisted torpedo. Still, this complicated “kill chain” takes time to assemble and weapons from other platforms take time to arrive on target. This is an especially critical issue when it comes to the cat-and-mouse game of submarine hunting. Elbit seems to be looking at shortening that kill chain dramatically while still leveraging small boat efficiency. How? By installing a torpedo tube on the Seagull itself, giving it immediate engagement capability against subsurface contacts. This massive “gun” on a small boat even fits with the US Navy’s evolving “distributed lethality” concept , which contravenes the traditional idea that only centralized high-end surface combatants are capable of engaging large targets. Elbit Systems , Elbit System's Seagull Although this was just a fitment and launch test, Elbit could move toward combat system integration with this modular torpedo system. In other words, they could make the Seagull, when fitted with the right sensors, capable of providing a firing solution and engaging subsurface targets from the point of initial detection to kill. This would provide an “end-to-end” anti-submarine warfare solution in a very small and likely inexpensive unmanned package. Fitting Seagull with a torpedo tube and an off-the-shelf torpedo is just another reminder of how semi-autonomous unmanned vehicles are moving from sensor platforms to actual shooting platforms. The unmanned surface vehicle space is also quickly evolving, from swarming small boats to DARPA’s ACTUV sub hunting autonomous drone ship that is has just now entered formal testing off the Southern California coast. ACTUV, also known by its nickname “Sea Hunter,” is not envisioned as an armed weapon system. While finding and tracking submarines for weeks at a time is a niche capability very suited to the US Navy’s global strategy, for most navies, something like the Seagull, which can guard a port or a small flotilla of ships over medium ranges, is much more appealing. This is especially true when an semi-autonomous, desktop computer-like “point and click” interface can control multiple Seagulls at a single time. Additionally, Seagull’s ability to be rapidly reconfigured for different missions, with various modular weapons and sensors available, as well as the capability to launch its own unmanned vehicles, presents a very enticing set of features for navies who can’t afforf to buy unique unmanned assets for every mission. Keep an eye on the Seagull, it may just have wings.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Gravely had a close encounter with the Russian Neustrashimy class frigate Yaroslav Mudry —an encounter that Russia is claiming was dangerous. The incident occurred on June 17 in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, where the USS Harry S. Truman has been on station striking ISIS from Syria’s western shore . It is the first time since 2003 that a US supercarrier has run strike operations from eastern Mediterranean. Russia’s Defense Ministry says that the Gravely breached international navigation safety rules by coming dangerously close to the Yaroslav Mudry . The destroyer supposedly approached alongside the Russian frigate while in international waters, then cut across its bow at a distance of about a ship’s length. Russia says that the Yaroslav Mudry did not deviate in course or engage in maneuvering with the US destroyer. Neustrashimy class frigate of which only two exist., Mil.ru/wikicommons In particular, Russia says that the Gravely violated International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea on two counts. First, the ship did not adhere to Rule 13, which states an overtaking vessel needs to keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken. According to Russia, the Gravely also broke Rule 15, which dictates that a vessel on the starboard side must yield and not cross ahead of another ship. Here is the video Russia has posted of the event in question: https://youtube.com/watch?v=xobL_7QUKCQ While we often hear about aerial confrontations between nations—especially between the US and Russia—this is far from the first time Russian and US Navy vessels have had a close encounter. In fact, during the Cold War the two foes’ naval vessels traded paint on occasion. Russia is clearly not happy that the US has stationed a Carrier Strike Group off the shores of Syria, where it maintains its strategic port in Tartus and an air base south of Latakia. There have also been new signs that Russia is spinning up its fixed-wing warfighting capabilities in Syria once again, and an attack on a US-backed rebel outpost along the Jordanian border under very peculiar circumstances was an ominous sign of this and the ambiguous relationship between Russia and the US. The War Zone predicted that Russia would respond directly to the presence of a Carrier Strike Group executing air strikes from the eastern Mediterranean, and we are likely seeing it in these acts. The Yaroslav Mudry , which is part of the Baltic Fleet, was supposedly sent into the med to bolster Syria’s flotilla operating near Syria. This group of ships has ranged from a hodgepodge of amphibious ships and corvettes to one made up of frigates and a Slava class cruiser in the recent past. With both the Russians and the US operating in the waters off Syria the possibility for close encounters only increases as does the general volatility of day-to-day operations. And with two American Carrier Strike Groups in the Mediterranean at the same time , there is no shortage of American firepower in the region. We still don’t know the US Navy’s side of the story. Was the Gravely trying to head-off the Russian frigate for a certain reason? What were radio communications like if there were any at all? Hopefully the USN will respond to Russia’s claims surrounding this incident quickly. We will keep you informed as more information comes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The reverberations of the UK’s vote to leave the European Union will ripple through world geopolitics and economics for years to come. The extrication alone will take two years once the UK formally invokes Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In the near-term, Russian ruler Vladimir Putin has the most to gain from Brexit. The truth is that the EU and UK never really had the best relationship. Intertwined in the UK’s decision to leave the EU there are the issues of cost of membership, trade, overall sovereignty and of course, immigration . The UK’s exit from the European Union is not going to be pretty, according to EU . The maze of trade deals, tax matrices, employment and travel practices, environmental and product standards regimes (and the list goes on and on) will have to be unwoven. Meanwhile the UK will have to take that same yarn and weave many new policies, including individual trade deals with nations around the globe. It is going to be a wild ride. UK Prime Minister David Cameron who has announced his resignation following the Brexit vote., AP An unraveling of the European Union, or at least a drastic weakening, could cause a “domino effect.” France, Italy, the Netherlands and others could choose a similar path. This may be forestalled by the EU attempting to reform itself from within, but the success of such an initiative is doubtful. Meanwhile, Scotland and Gibraltar are seeking a pathway to stay in the EU . As such, the UK’s choice to exit the EU could leave the United Kingdom, well, less united. All this turmoil weakens the EU, and in doing so weakens ties and cooperation among NATO member states (22 NATO members are also members of the EU). This is precisely what Putin wants. Cracks in European unity will make it far easier for Moscow’s will to go unchecked. NATO headquarters in Brussles., AP Take the harsh economic sanctions, which included asset freezes, travel bans and material embargoes, that were put in place following Russia’s invasion of Crimea and shadow-war in Ukraine. The EU was absolutely paramount in passing and imposing this regime . Not only that, but the UK, which has always been the USA’s best conduit for wielding power within the EU, will no longer be able to serve as a key middle-man. As a result, America’s own power is diminished within Europe with the UK’s decision to exit the EU. Going forward the “special relationship” between the US and the UK will have a much more limited, binary and centralized meaning than it had previously. An increasingly divided Europe will mean it will be harder to not only pass sanctions against Russia or other states for various acts, but it will also make it much tougher to react quickly militarily to the Kremlin’s whims. This is especially troubling considering the realities of Russia’s ever evolving “hybrid warfare” playbook that could be put to work in the Baltics. In fact, some sources state that this is inevitable , including heads of European nations , and other key security players in Europe say that it is actually already underway . Even NATO’s last Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen , has said as much. The Obama Administration and the US military seem to agree with Rasmussen’s assessment. In fact the head of European Command, General Scaparrotti, has come right out and said the Putin wants to break up NATO. Part of America’s response to this looming situation has been Operation Atlantic Resolve , which has resulted in a massive uptick in air, sea and land drills with NATO allies, especially those that exist along or near Russia’s western border. US Armor rolls through Eastern Europe., AP Now this increase in operations tempo is being further escalated, with Germany, the US and the UK moving 5,000 soldiers, or four battalions, to Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and Estonia. This is all part of a wider NATO effort to deter Russia which has been rapidly moving armor, jets and personnel to its borders under a series of snap drills. The speed in which Russia is changing its force posture on Europe’s back doorstep may be what is most concerning for NATO generals . General Ben Hodges, who commands American soldiers in Europe states:  “The thing I worry about the most is freedom of movement. Their snap exercises that they do, I personally am surprised each time they do it. And so you can see why that scares me.” There is also a far more conventional threat emanating just east of the Germany, in Russia’s enclave of Kaliningrad. There, along the Baltic Sea, Russia has deployed nuclear capable Iskandar tactical ballistic missiles, and its most potent long-range air defense system, the S-400. Meanwhile, Russian air power has been anything but passive in the region. All of these chess pieces, and the invisible threat of Russian cyber-attacks, are best countered by a strong and united Europe, not one that is pulling away from itself and mired in economic and political disagreements that are far from just academic. Putin knows this, and he also knows that an enemy is best attacked at its weakest point and when its resolve has atrophied. AP Increased economic turmoil in already hard-hit Europe could also drastically weaken each member country’s ability to fund their military and fulfil their obligations to NATO. The vast majority of NATO nations are already struggling to invest just 2% of their GDP into their military as required. If Europe were to fall back into a deep recession due to economic incertainty and trade gridlock caused by an unraveling EU, massive cuts in defense spending budgets, which have already shrunk to a shadow of their former selves, could become a harsh reality. In the end Britain will survive, although defense exports may take a big hit along with others. British intelligence capabilities will also be affected by the loss of direct sharing via EU policing channels, but they will remain as part of the coveted “ Five Eyes” international intelligence sharing consortium and benefit from continuing to have some of the best intelligence capacities of their own at their disposal in the guise of MI5, MI6 and others. The UK’s strategic prominence within Europe and abroad may also dim following Brexit, but the intangible effects to Europe’s collective ability to stand as one militarily could be severely eroded depending on how things go. With the potential erosion of the EU, the ominous and resource-depleting threat of terrorism hanging directly over Europe, and nationalist sentiment coming into fashion across the western world, Putin could not be handed a better set of circumstances for which to plan his next moves. If the EU does indeed continue to splinter, and key powers within the EU deicide to follow the UK’s example, Moscow could take great advantage of chaos and infighting. Would a distracted, divided and economically diminished Europe going through immense change be ready to deal with a Russian incursion into the Baltics? It’s highly debatable as even dealing with such an event now would stress modern European alliances and military capabilities like never before. It will be interesting to see how NATO plans to address all this at the upcoming summit in Warsaw on July 8th. We will keep you posted as things evolve.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 16, 2021",Even Bill Maher Knows That The Media’s Reporting On Guns Is Largely Bullshit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have never in my life seen such inaccurate, naïve, and downright dishonest reporting than I do whenever the big gun issue floats to the top of America’s consciousness. This is not about whether we should ban guns or increase background checks; both sides have their fair point of view on this complicated manner. It’s about the media going straight for sensationalism and spinning stories out of thin air to push an agenda, or just to get clicks. In doing so, the media only hurts the possibility of having a real debate about America’s gun policy, and how to actually save innocent lives. It’s plain and simple: If you don’t know much about guns, and are not willing to do the research, you should not report on them. How many articles like this one , or this one, or even like this one did I see in the week following the Pulse nightclub shooting, with headlines stating: “I Bought This Gun In Less Time Than ______!” (Insert: “It Took To Renew My Car Registration”; “To Get A Marriage License”; “Order A Bloomin’ Onion At Outback Steakhouse,” or whatever—every article was essentially the same.) AP Whatever the headline was, it didn’t seem like the objective was to inform, or debate, but to shock non-gun-educated people into thinking that the system is crippled, or absurd, when actually they were proving that the system worked for them perfectly. The process of buying a gun was fast, efficient, and it accomplished exactly what it is meant to do based on our current legal framework. They went in and selected a firearm to purchase; the gun dealer did their job of running a background check through the official system, and the customer walked out with their purchase in a timely manner after being cleared to do so through the official channels. So instead of just saying that in most states you can go in, and if you pass a background check, walk out with your purchase, the articles were used instead to convey the writer’s predisposed disgust for firearms. This may be self-satisfying for the writer, but it’s hardly beneficial to their readers. This is just one aspect of imbecilic reporting on firearms that clogs your Facebook and Twitter feeds. It’s entirely understandable that a reporter just hates guns. They may personally believe they have no place in our society. But loading up the public with totally inaccurate information supported by little evidence to suit that viewpoint just makes it that much harder for our society to have a real and substantive debate on the issue. Probably the biggest and most maddening misconception out there is on “machine guns” and “assault rifles,” and it’s largely driven by the media and by pro-gun-control politicians that won’t make their arguments for stricter gun laws on the facts. Even Bill Maher, who is well known for his liberal leanings, thinks this incessant disinformation about what an “assault rifle” or “machine gun,” and on guns in general, is damaging the possibility of real reform: Make sure to forward to 4:15 if the video does not advance to that point automatically. https://youtube.com/watch?v=CQvte7Jl7Yk%3Ft%3D4m15s So yeah, an AR-15 or an AK-47 derivative (and many other types), as sold to the American public, is not a machine gun—it’s the same as the vast majority of firearms sold today: a semi-automatic firearm. For every pull of the trigger, one round comes out of the barrel. A machine gun, on the other hand, lays down continuous or bursts of fire via a single trigger pull. And guess what? The sale of actual machine guns was largely banned by the National Firearms Acts (NFA) and Firearm Owners’ Protection Act (FOPA ), the latter of which was passed during Ronald Reagan’s time in office. So no, you cannot just go out and buy a machine gun, and while an AR-15 or AK-47 or other tactical-looking rifles may look like their fully automatic counterparts, they do not operate in the same fashion. In this business—that of journalism—it seems like everyone is looking for an angle on a major news peg, sometimes regardless of whether it’s valid or not. In the last couple of weeks I’ve had exchanges with other writers on the subjects of “what is a machine gun,” even though the FBI clearly defines that already in the NFA, and even on the “outrageous” nature of the descriptions of ammunition that manufacturers put on their packaging. Upon reading the description in question, it was clear that it was just boilerplate FBI language about wound channel and penetration that is used to describe the effects of ammunition. It should be considered smart to know how ammo performs in testing before loading it into a gun, right?  But to journalists with no experience with firearms it looks like some crazy violent Madison Avenue-derived marketing language. Once again, this all makes a real debate on America’s gun policy problematic. AP If you’ve never shot a gun, or didn’t grow up in an area where guns were a part of life, or just have a predisposed viewpoint about the firearms industry and the people who support it, than anything gun-related probably seems scary and foreign. And even the best reporters sometimes get it wrong. It happens. Case in point: the Orlando shooter did not use a AR-15, he used a high-end Sig Sauer MCX. But the current level of hyperbole around guns is sickening, and it may be the greatest example of media bias that exists today. Let’s talk about real metrics, like how many long rifles are used in mass shootings, or related to overall deaths, compared to handguns. Let’s talk about magazine size restrictions and really attempt to answer the question scientifically if limiting their capacity could realistically save lives. Not just that, but how would such a ban could even be put into place with hundreds of millions of high-capacity magazines already produced? Let’s talk about expanding the background check system and about universal waiting periods and how to keep any gun out of a lunatic terrorist’s hands. Let’s talk about this country’s poor mental health system, one in which in-patient care has been replaced by handfuls of prescription bottles. Let’s talk about gun insurance and mandatory training. Let’s talk about what other countries, Israel for instance, do when it comes to who gets guns, and how they’re allowed to use them, and where they’re allowed to carry them. But let’s drop the bullshit that tactical-looking rifles are actually machine guns, because in reality they do the exact same thing as a rifle without a pistol grip and a wood stock. Let’s also drop the idea that everything the firearms industry does is maniacal. But let’s talk about the power the NRA has over our elected officials. And above all else, let’s address the war currently raging on the streets of places like Chicago, where cheap illicit handguns have already left a whopping 1,873 shot just this year . It’s not all about what happens when one monster goes into a nightclub and kills in the name of ISIS. In the end, understanding and correctly conveying the technical aspects of firearms should be the easiest part; the Constitutional and existential arguments as to who should get them, and how, should be the hard ones.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Blue Angels’ iconic C-130 transport, better known as Fat Albert, has been in the news a lot lately following the loss of Blue Angel #6, Captain Jeff Kuss. The blue, gold, and white Hercules even flew Kuss’s body over the team’s home town of Pensacola, Florida, with Blue Angel #5 off its wing following the tragic crash in Tennessee . Fat Albert has never been shy when it comes to performing for the public; it flies its own demo at every Blue Angels show site, and it’s very impressive. Part of that display includes a takeoff and a low, high-speed transition followed by a triumphant climb. The video below provides an awesome perspective on what this looks like head-on: Before the low transition and steep climb was introduced as the primary opening maneuver for Fat Albert’s demonstration, a Jet Assisted Take-Off (JATO, also known as RATO for Rocket) departure was performed. This was a favorite for spectators, especially during evening shows, as it was a fireworks display unto itself. Each of the eight JATO bottles put out about 1,000 pounds of thrust on ignition, allowing Fat Albert to takeoff in a laughably small amount of distance, and reaching a 45-degree angle of ascent as it clawed its way skyward. Stockpiles of JATO bottles were running low in the 2000s, and by 2010 the Blue Angels had to retire this exciting portion of their act as the bottles were no longer in production. Israel still retains JATO capabilities for its C-130s, and bottles could have potentially been bought from them for Fat Albert’s act, but the cost was deemed prohibitive. JATO is also still used today for C-130 operations in the snowy and icy polar regions. IAF The more nimble KC-130J that the Marines fly today is supposedly capable of nearly the same climbing display as the legacy Hercules with JATO bottles attached. If the Blue Angels get equipped with one of these newer and much improved “Herky Birds,” Fat Albert would be able to show off this increased performance in a particularly awesome fashion. Even without JATO, Fat Albert puts on a hell of a show, and part of that show is for the guests riding inside while the demonstration is underway, who get to experience some pretty sweet zero-g floating time when the pilot pushes the nose over: Fat Albert’s flying display is so dynamic that even getting the big Hercules back on the ground following the nose-dive Khe Sanh approach can be a challenge, as seen in this video: Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020","Israel Wants to Buy at Least 75 F-35s, and Some of Those Could be B Models","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was quite the dog-and-pony show when Lockheed Martin rolled out Israel’s first completed F-35 this week. Once the IAF receives the jet, dubbed “Adir” (Mighty One) in Hebrew, it will be the first F-35 operator in the Middle East, with 33 of the F-35A derivatives on order. Much has been made of the “F-35I’s” unique configuration and Israel-specific modifications , including the possibility of installing conformal fuel tanks in the coming years. Yet the IAF is not only very interested in expanding its F-35A-derived fleet to 50 jets, but also possibly adding the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B to its stable. IAF IAF Chief of Staff General Tal Kelman states: “We want to reach 75 jets…The Israeli F-35 is the first fifth generation fighter to arrive in the Middle East, and it will allow us to open a significant gap in our abilities when facing all of the elements in the area…We want the first 50 jets to be A models, but beyond this, we are examining the options. The F-35B may be limited relatively to the A model regarding the amount of munitions it can carry, but has other advantages that may aid us in different scenarios” Israel’s qualitative airpower edge is nothing new. Since the US began outfitting the IAF with combat jets, and especially after the arrival of the F-15, the Israel Air Force has always held technological superiority over its Arab neighbors’ air arms. The “unique” modifications the IAF makes to American fighters is also nothing new, nor is the manner in which they have employed them. For instance, Israel was the first to convert the F-15 Eagle into an operational attack aircraft and conformal fuel tanks allowed them to strike targets thousands of miles from Israe l. Today, the IAF’s F-15s and F-16s are loaded with Israel-specific communications, electronic warfare suites, and other combat-related sub-systems tailored to the potential threats and objectives they may face in the future. With this in mind, an “Israelized” F-35B—one that can operate from roadways or from small, austere runways—makes sense. Such a capability would not only be useful should Israel’s airfields be attacked and their runways rendered unserviceable, but it would also be ideal for long-range air campaigns where unpredictable forward arming and refueling points can be set up, even possibly in a hostile or neutral country’s own backyard. Doing so would help the IAF sustain higher sortie rates for long-range air campaigns far from home (i.e. Iran) and it would help take pressure off the IAF’s relatively tiny aerial tanker fleet. Lockheed Martin It will be fascinating to see how the IAF evolves their prized F-35s. It will give the IAF the ability to penetrate enemy aid defense systems without the use of standoff munitions in some cases, which is a good capability to have seeing that Iran has equipped itself with the Russian S-300 air defense system. And although the program remains a boondoggle for the US, for certain operators it’s a value. This is especially true in Israel’s case, considering their purchase is subsidized by US foreign military aid.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The world watched this week as North Korea moved transporter-erector-launchers (TEL) loaded with BM-25 Musudan ballistic missiles near the eastern port city of Wonsan, located about 60 miles north of the DMZ. Tests of these intermediate-range ballistic missile have failed, but as The War Zone noted previously, the fact that North Korea went from years of not testing this missile design at all to rapidly doing so represents a massive strategic weapons development pivot , and it would only be a matter of time before it paid off. Now, it’s done just that. The first of two Musudan test launches occurred at 5:58 AM on Wednesday. The missile failed shortly after lifting off, but the second, which launched at 8:05 AM, traveled down-range 250 miles towards the east and reached an altitude of just over 620 miles . This was the sixth-ever test flight of a BM-25, and the first success. North Korean state media quoted Kim Jong Un as stating that the successful test flight of the Musudan was “a great event,” and that “we have the sure capability to attack in an overall and practical way the Americans in the Pacific operation theatre.” NK state media via Twitter Although more tests and design refinements will be needed to prove that the Musudan is in fact a reliable weapon system, Kim is accurate when he says that the missile could give his regime the capacity to strike American interests throughout the Pacific. The Musudan is thought to have a range of up to 2,500 miles, putting it well within striking distance of Guam, and everything in between. https://youtube.com/watch?v=sV5ZppsRZSo An emergency UN Security Council meeting has been held concerning this successful test , but aside from harsh rhetoric there’s little the UN can do beyond the already crushing sanctions put in place against the North Korean regime . That is, without China stepping in unilaterally and threatening to cut off of energy- and food supplies, and pretty much everything else that North Korea depends on for day-to-day life. Not only is North Korea’s tubrocharged push to develop operational ballistic missile capabilities (as well as the miniaturized nuclear warheads to sit atop them ) fueling increased interest in regional anti-ballistic missile defense systems, it’s also making Pyongyang’s non-nuclear neighbors contemplate developing their own second-strike deterrents. AP If left unchecked, North Korea will likely have a tested nuclear warhead and operational IRBM capability by early next decade. Paired with the “Hermit Kingdom’s” recent advancements in solid-fuel rocket tech , it could result in massive strategic shifts in a region that is only becoming more volatile and heavily militarized .

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 29, 2016",Carrier In Mediterranean Hits Record Milestone As Harriers Pound ISIS From Persian Gulf,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time ever, ISIS is under attack from aircraft emanating from both the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. The USS Harry S. Truman made history last month when it arrived on station off the Syrian coast , and now it has done so again, flying 2,000 sorties against ISIS while dropping a record-setting 1,100 weapons on the Islamic State during the ship’s extended deployment. According to Navy Times , the USS Theodore Roosevelt previously held the weapons-dropped record, while the USS Carl Vinson still holds the record for the most combat sorties against ISIS, with 2,300 executed during the ship’s last cruise. USN At the same time, the Amphibious Helicopter Dock USS Boxer has arrived in the Arabian Gulf, sending its AV-8B Harriers into the fight against the Islamic State. This marks the first time sea-based fixed-wing tactical jets are hitting ISIS from two separate theaters. USN Meanwhile, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and its escorts made their way through the Strait of Gibraltar last week, putting two Carrier Strike Group in the Navy’s 6th Fleet area of operations at the same time. The Eisenhower is not yet taking part in airstrikes against ISIS, and will likely push through the Suez Canal and onto the Persian Gulf in the coming weeks. Part of the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group’s mission is also to test green fuels and technologies as part of the “Great Green Fleet” initiative , which could have a broad impact on US naval operations going forward. With two supercarriers in the Mediterranean, and both the USS Ronald Reagan and the USS John C. Stennis prowling the Philippine Sea, the Navy is putting on quite a show of American naval firepower—one that spans both halves of the globe. Still, this impressive Naval and Marine air power display contrasts with the poor state of Naval and Marine aviation back in the US , and the tempo of these deployed operations have likely added drastically to the ongoing readiness crisis. Additionally, although large munition drop numbers do show how active our air forces are when it comes to striking ISIS, it also underlines another crisis. USN The Pentagon is raiding its reserve stockpiles of precision-guided munitions to keep up with the conflict. These munitions are not something the DoD just buys as it needs; lead times on critical components can be many months, or even years. This issue also brings into question how we could sustain a conflict against a near-peer state, with tens of thousands of fixed targets to strike, based on such shallow stockpiles. You can have the most expensive and capable combat jet in the world—hundreds or even thousands of them—but if you don’t have guided munitions for them to use, their whole reason for being is put into question.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",What USAF Chief Probably Meant When He Said He Wanted “A Flying Coke Machine” to Replace the A-10 Warthog,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently, outgoing Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh made a comment on the highly controversial and widely publicized A-10 Warthog retirement plan that made big headlines. In a seemingly cryptic manner, the General described his wish for a “flying Coke machine” as a possible replacement for the A-10 Warthog, and then went on to say there simply isn’t enough money for such an idea to become a reality. What Welsh was actually describing is not a new concept at all. It is called a flying arsenal ship. I have written dozens of articles on aerial arsenal ships from a KB-737 concept, to cruise missile slinging 747s , to unmanned A-10s , to the USAF’s new bomb-slinging AC-130 gunships , to exploring the potential of America’s next bomber design, and everything in between . The reality is that the USAF is already getting an arsenal ship, in the form of converted B-1 or B-52 bombers . But what General Welsh is almost certainly getting after here specifically is not just developing a new weapons platform but taking the entire close air support process and consolidating it into the hands of the Joint Terminal Air Controller (JTACS) on the ground. In other words, removing the aircrew from the CAS loop entirely and basically creating a weapons effects/bombs on demand interface for JTACs on the ground to use, and then applying it to specific aerial platforms—especially unmanned ones. USAF Giving JTACs more control over aerial weapons delivery is already an initiative well underway. Last April, the USMC tested a new tablet-driven hardware and software concept under DARPA’s  Persistent Close Air Support program . The tests were a big success, with follow-on demonstrations quickly occurring. This system could be integrated with a whole slew of aerial platforms and it is just one of an array of initiatives that are clearly leading to a reality where JTACS on the ground are able to order up weapons from on high without a pilot or weapon systems officer acting as a middle man. The idea is that by doing so the “Kill Chain” will be greatly compressed, it will help to prevent fratricide, and it will also increase ground-based JTAC’s and the ground combat units they are embedded with situational awareness. DARPA Pairing this evolving capability with an arsenal ship concept is a no brainer, but doing so with an unmanned arsenal ship could be totally game changing. By leveraging unmanned aircraft’s long endurance, with even MQ-9s Reapers staying airborne for over a day and a half now, an arsenal ship would be able to stay on station for the duration of a ground combat element’s mission. This is without the need for costly and vulnerable tanker support nearby. By “tethering” a drone that can persist for many hours or even days over a ground element, beyond being a weapons mule it could also provide aerial surveillance as well as network relay and critical electronic warfare and communications intelligence gathering functions. The best part is that such an unmanned system could be autonomous when it comes to navigation and flying, and semi-autonomous when it comes to delivering weapons on target at the JTAC’s request. In other words, there would not have to be a man-in-the-loop flying the aircraft like Predator or Reaper unmanned systems are flown today. Instead such a craft could persistently orbit over the ground element it is supporting, and be directed to different areas and ordered to provide different functionality by JTAC’s and controllers in that ground element below. This greatly reduces the cost of operating such an aircraft and unlocks its true potential. The USMC and its Intrepid Tiger II pods use a similar concept , where controllers on the battlefield below control is functionality regardless of what aircraft it is flown on. If such an unmanned system were also equipped with the Orwellian-like Wide Area Aerial Surveillance capability , it could also give troops on the ground a God’s eye view of their surroundings at all times. Different parts of its massive amount of video information could be leveraged by a whole slew of users, down to the squad level on battlefield below and by intelligence analysts thousands of miles away, all at the same time. This could greatly expand a JTAC’s ability to direct fire support over a much wider area and the same aircraft carrying the WAAS sensor could also carry munitions for the JTAC to use. DoD It is possible that for lower threat environments, MQ-9 Reaper airframes could be adapted for this role to start. For the murky “high threat CAS environment” that the USAF constantly pounds away on as a reason to retire the unstealthy A-10, low-observable Unmanned Air Combat Vehicles (make sure to read this piece for full background and context ) could be used instead. Integrating “point and click” JTAC control capability onto these advanced unmanned combat aircraft would make great sense considering they would already be capable of autonomous/semi-autonomous operations and doing so could give them a critical mission after they have already “kicked down the enemy’s door” for the most part by attacking as an enemy’s integrated air defense system as a networked swarm in the opening days of a conflict. By utilizing MQ-9s and multi-role stealthy UCAVs the USAF could greatly decrease the cost of developing an independent “niche” weapons platform just for this task. Eventually larger airframes could be fielded for the CAS arsenal ship role, but the nice thing about using UCAVs and MQ-9s is that if more capacity is needed it is as simple as assigning more airframes to a mission. Under a close air support arsenal ship concept, the fact that these aircraft could be controlled via a line-of-sight ground-to-air data-link loop, one with bursts of data sent only when needed, not continuously, also makes their susceptibility to jamming, detection or cyber-attack incredibly low. The arsenal ship concept coupled with a “weapons on demand” scheme for JTACs on the ground, as well as all the other capabilities these unmanned aircraft could bring to the fight while providing this primary capability, is very enticing and should be pursued. The concept also underscores just how badly the USAF needs a unclassified, wide-spanning UCAV program as it could help solve so many issues facing the flying service today , including justifying the A-10’s retirement. Yet for the conflicts of today, this capability alone does not make the existence of the A-10 invalid, at least not yet. First off, this concept needs to be developed into an operational form. Seeing that the integration of semi-autonomous unmanned aircraft is glaringly obvious when it comes to such a concept, it is doubtful that the USAF, which has proven to be culturally averse to fully embracing unmanned systems, will pursue it. Because a non-stealthy MQ-9 can be swapped with a stealthy UCAV when it comes to providing this capability in highly contested environments, it also competes directly with the F-35 program. Even the best precision guided munitions go awry a percentage of the time. The A-10’s GAU-8 Avenger’s cannon shells do not. Still, the A-10’s gun-based “danger close” engagement success rate depends on the quality of the information the pilot has and the quality of their skills in the cockpit under very challenging conditions. Still, the A-10’s gun, and even the 20mm and 25mm cannons found on other American fighter and attack aircraft, have meant the difference between life and death many a time on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, with laser guided rockets just now coming online, it is very hard to imagine an a semi-autonomous unmanned system making direct attacks on man-sized targets hiding in doorways and window openings . DoD Even with the A-10’s ruggedness, close proximity to the fight, highly trained pilot and devestating cannon being considered, the close air support arsenal ship/bombs on demand capability, along with the F-35 and possibly a the procurement of a light air support aircraft, may be a potent enough mix of capabilities to justify retiring the A-10 one day, but the existence of the F-35 alone surely cannot. So until General Welsh’s unmanned “Coke machine in the sky” actually becomes a proven capability, the idea of sending the ‘Hog to the slaughter house should be completely off the table.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what was the most provocative move made by Russia since becoming militarily involved in the conflict in Syria, Russian jets bombed US-backed anti-ISIS fighters last week at a remote garrison located along the Jordanian border. The area is one that Russia has never really been active in even during Moscow’s high-tempo bombing campaign that supposedly ended last March. A peculiar and brazen attack According to CNN, the target was a remote staging base near At Tanf, less than a dozen miles from the Jordanian border. About 200 US-backed fighters were at the base at the time of the surprise attack, with an unknown amount killed and wounded during the aerial bombardment. As the initial air strikes began, personnel at the base sent an emergency message to the Combined Operations Center in Qatar that manages the US-led air campaign . The US then used the emergency communications channel setup between the US and Russia last winter to tell Russia to stop the onslaught. There was no response. At the same time, American F/A-18 Hornets were redirected to the area to provide air cover. The Hornets came close enough to the Russian jets to visually identify them as they left the area. The Hornet pilots tried to contact the Russian aircraft on a preassigned frequency that was put in place early last winter because of “deconfliction concerns” between the two nations. There was no answer. DoD The Hornets stayed overhead the smoldering outpost for a period of time but had to depart briefly to refuel from a tanker. Once they departed the area, the Russian jets vectored back in on the base and struck it once again. The Los Angeles Times states that the Russian aircraft involved in the attack were Su-34 Fullback fighter-bombers while other reports list them as Su-24 Fencer attack jets. Both could be true, with different sets of aircraft attacking the target during the two consecutive waves. The Su-34’s PESA radar and long endurance would have been beneficial to keep tabs on the Hornets so that they would know when the area was vulnerable again for a second strike. These details raise serious questions. First, is Russia diving back into the Syrian conflict with fixed-wing attack and fighter aircraft? Second, following this brazen airstrike—one where the emergency measures agreed upon by the US and Russia to keep misunderstandings from happening were seemingly jettisoned—what does it mean for the next time US and Russian air power come face-to-face over Syrian territory? Russian fixed-wing airpower returns to Syria This airstrike comes as the US is hitting ISIS from Syria’s Mediterranean shore for the first time via the carrier strike group that is positioned there . It had been thought that Russia had pulled its fighters out of its base near the central Syrian coast, but now it seems some of these aircraft have returned. Additional evidence of this fact surfaced late last week when Russian Defense Minister Shoygu visited the base with an entourage from the Kremlin. In photos from the visit, Su-34, Su-24 and armed Su-35s are all clearly visible. As such, it appears Russia has redeployed its tactical fixed-wing aircraft to the base en-masse, including its most advanced operational air-to-air fighters. Shoygu was also photographed meeting with Bashar al Assad during his trip. Here are some photos taken while Shoygu visited Syria: AP AP AP AP AP It is unclear how all this will affect America’s airstrikes from the Mediterranean Sea. In fact, the redeployment of Russian fighter aircraft to their base located on Syria’s central coast could be a response to the presence of the US Carrier Strike Group nearby. We expected some sort of military response from Russia to the presence of the American flotilla ; this would certainly fit the bill. Still, it is likely that US Navy Hornets and Growlers are already flying routes that circumnavigate around Russia’s air base and the S-400 air defense system that remains there . While Russia’s fixed-wing air component in Syria was thought to have largely vacated region months ago , Russian attack helicopters have been highly active in central Syria , supporting Assad’s forces as they push east toward ISIS’s self-proclaimed capital of al Raqqa. Meanwhile, American-backed forces , some with embedded US Special Forces, are surrounding al Raqqa from the north . Regardless of if or when ISIS’s seat of power will fall, there is clearly a larger conflict brewing that would follow, one for control of Syria either in partial form, or in Assad’s case, “ every inch of the country .” Game Of Thrones , Syria style So far the Obama Administration has left the Assad regime alone, focusing on ISIS instead, even though regime change is the official White House policy. Actually making that happen became much tougher once Russia dived into the conflict militarily late last summer. Although Assad had been helped by Iran during the half decade-long civil war, once Russia was on the ground, Assad’s hold on power became much more assured. Not only was this accomplished by Russian forces basically turning the Syrian civil war around militarily for Assad via the use of ruthless air power and “advisors” on the ground, but it also meant that if the US were to turn their weapons against Assad those same weapons would likely be pointing at Russians as well. Such a move could spark a conflict between the US and Russia that would make Syria look like a sideshow act. In other words, as much as Russia’s excursion in Syria was to keep the beat-down Assad regime from being sacked by rebel groups, it was also a blocking maneuver that made it much harder for the US to take out the Assad regime militarily if it wanted to in the future. In exchange, Russia gained greater influence in a region in which it has struggled for decades. It also kept its key strategic Mediterranean port in Tartus, gained a master air base in the region, and was able to show off all of its military hardware to global arms buyers. Most of all it was able to put on a show meant to tell the world that Russia is powerful militarily once again and can operate far from its own borders just like the US, albeit on a much smaller scale. Now a reenergized Assad regime wants to gain control of every inch of Syria, which could mean the potential annihilation of US backed fighters of various ethnic and religious backgrounds that emanate from the country’s eastern frontier. This force is widely known as the Syrian Democratic Forces and is now concentrated entirely on fighting ISIS. Assad and Russia likely worry that this collective force, trained and equipped by the US, could become a huge threat as time goes by, especially after the danger from ISIS has been decentralized. During Russia’s air campaign in Syria, the vast majority of the targets prosecuted were against those fighting Assad in the west of the country , not against ISIS, which is concentrated in the county’s central and eastern parts. Since morphing from a defensive to an offensive campaign, this has changed. Now it seems like both US-backed fighters and Assad’s Russian-backed forces are racing toward al Raqqa. Think of it as a modern war on terror version of the race to Berlin. Russia’s never-ending quest to get America’s tactical map of Syria Secretary of Defense Carter did not mince words in response to the Russian strike : “Here’s a case where they actually attacked forces that were fighting ISIL. And if that was their intention, that’s the opposite of what they said they were going to do. If not, then it says something about the quality of the information upon which they make airstrikes.” This statement is meant to question Russia’s true objectives in Syria, but it also may indicate the US in falling into the Kremlin’s trap when it comes to their satisfying their incessant demand for acquiring the Pentagon’s rich intelligence and tactical map of Syria. The US-led coalition's Combined Air Operations Center located Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.r , DoD In response, the Kremlin claims it is hard to discern who is who on the battlefield . Such a response is damning on multiple levels. First of all, this was a remote outpost far from where Assad’s forces are fighting, and the strike was obviously well planned. Even for Russia, whose air campaign in Syria was dominated by dumb bombs and questionable targeting , striking an outpost on the Jordanian border—literally in the middle of nowhere—not once, but twice, and even after the US had fighters over the target, is too conveniently incompetent. Then there is the strange silence in the face of US calls to stand down, despite a hotline setup by both parties for just this type of situation—and by the F/A-18 crews themselves. Could Russia’s real goal for this attack have been a strategic one? Russia has long pushed for “intelligence sharing” with the US . Primarily, this includes the assembly of a common map showing precisely where everyone is on the Syrian battlefield. The US-led coalition has been wary of such an endeavor because it would give Russia all the positions of anti-Assad forces, including the locations of US Special Operations personnel. Considering Russia spent the majority of its time pummeling anti-Assad fighters, not ISIS, during its air campaign, giving them America’s situational map of the conflict sounds like a game of “Russian Roulette” if you will. Also, the idea is that if Russia gets this information so would Assad. As such, these forces could be wiped out by Russian air power on a whim, or even by Assad’s forces as they continue to gain tactical momentum. Additionally, Russia, which does not possess the armada of unmanned aircraft and intelligence gathering resources that the US does, would benefit from America’s intelligence products and resources at no cost to them at all. This fits in perfectly with Moscow’s “maximum effects with minimal footprint” model for their operations in Syria, basically fighting the war on the cheap while claiming huge strategic results. So what could push the US to finally agree to supply Russia with this information? How about an “accidental” airstrike on a remote outpost, one full of US-backed fighters but that has no US personnel deployed to it? Russia’s response after the attack, basically saying “the battlefield is just confusing” is also incredibly peculiar, one strangely devoid of the Kremlin’s usual spin, bravado and over-bloated statements of efficiency and accuracy on the battlefield . The Kremlin also stating that the US had not provided Russia with the location of all the rebel groups they support, “making it impossible to take measures to adjust the Russian air force action.” If only they had that map right? On Saturday, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov  also stated the following : “The Russian defense ministry for the past few months has been proposing to its American colleagues to draw a unified map, which would contain information about the location of the forces which were active in Syria. However, no material progress has been made on this issue.” Then on Sunday , after the US and Russia had an emergency video conference about the strike and apparently the information sharing came up immediately, with Moscow going as far as proclaiming that the US had agreed to cooperate with them to avoid future incidents. It is also interesting that General Shoygu was in Damascus right before this attack took place, meeting with Assad no less. So was all this an elaborate ruse to try to finally get the US to give up the positions of all the rebel fighters it backs along with the coordinates of its own special operators?  Considering the long-term coordinated massaging and the odd “all too convenient” circumstances surrounding the attack, it seems very possible. Now we will have to see if the Pentagon is naive enough to bite. Regardless of if this was Russia’s play when it comes to last week’s strange set of air strikes or not, one thing is for certain, heavy Russian air power is back in Syria. The move is somewhat predictable as Putin has shown in Ukraine that flexing forces in and out of a region while making conflicting public statements is a favorite tactic in his playbook. Still, that doesn’t make it any less impactful on the balance of power in the region and on the ever more complicated Syrian conflict.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 19, 2018",Check Out This Picture Of The Pentagon’s Shadowy New Special Operations Mothership,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While “Big Navy” is building its own massive sea bases, one type capable of conveying virtually any ground vehicle in the Marine Corps’ or Army’s inventory, and another capable of acting as maritime helicopter bases , Special Operations Command appears to be quietly building its own. Instead of building such a ship from scratch, the Pentagon purchased an existing and futuristic-looking roll-on/roll-off cargo ship. This vessel is now being heavily modified to special operators’ specific needs. In the picture above, we can see these alterations taking form. The existence of this new mothership-to-be broke over two years ago by our friend David Axe over at War Is Boring . In his piece, David not only identified the 633-foot, 30,000-ton displacement M/V Cragside (you can see pics of the ship before being altered here ) as the ship that will be modified under a $143 million contract, but also conveyed some details about the modifications that would be made. These details and many more are available in the Pentagon’s official RFP for ship, which you can read here . The Cragside appears to have been a pretty awesome canvas on which SOCOM could paint their sea-basing dreams and ambitions. Size-wise, the top deck seems very well suited as a flight deck, and the ship’s cavernous interior, open stern, and rear ramp will lend themselves to all sorts of missions and carrying massive loads of supplies, vehicles, and gear with ease. The ship is ambiguously dubbed a “Maritime Support Vessel” and will be operated by the Military Sealift Command . It will be capable of housing 200 at a time. Secure communications systems, a gym, weapons lockers, and the ability to operate even the heaviest helicopters in the Pentagon’s inventory, from Little Birds to MH-53s, are all included in the Cragside’s refit specifications. Additionally, hangar bays are also required, to sustain these helicopters over long periods of time. Overall, the ship will be capable of speeds of 20 knots and can operate independently for 45 days at a time. The Craigside docked in Mobile before modification., Google Earth The Cragside , which has also worn the moniker M/V Ocean Trader , was built in 2011, so it really went from just a few years’ worth of cargo and ferry operations to being gutted and turned into a military vessel at BAE’s shipyards in Mobile, Alabama. As you can see in the picture above, massive hangar facilities have indeed been added forward of the ship’s superstructure. According to the RFP, the hangar can house at least two MH-60 Seahawks or one MH-53 Super Stallion. The ship will also likely operate unmanned systems, which will include space to control these assets and also areas for them to be stored. The RFP also states that the ship must be capable of carrying and distributing a whopping 150,000 gallons of jet fuel. The rear of the ship’s superstructure has also been greatly expanded. You can see in the photo that large openings have been cut down the sides of the ship—four on the side facing the camera. These are likely to be used for launching and recovering boats. At portion of the open stern area of the ship could end up being modified to facilitate deployment of similar craft. The RFP mandates that the ship must have four launch and recovery systems capable of handling 12.5-meter boats. Two of these craft must be launched within 20 minutes while the ship is underway. Eight 12.5-meter boats will be carried in all, and at least four jet skis and four zodiacs must be housed and be able to be launched and recovered with ease as well. Another interesting requirement is that the enclosed craft storage area must not be visible from the outside and must have tight environmental controls. A whole host of other modifications, including FLIR systems, an elaborate conference room, force protection areas for mounting machine guns, a dive locker, a medical ward, and many other interesting requirements can also be found in the RFP. When it comes to this new mothership’s mission, it isn’t crystal clear. Obviously, the basic capability it provides is readily apparent, but the exact way that capability will be put to use is not.  The USS Ponce is still floating in the Persian Gulf supporting everything from minesweeping to special operations to re-arming and refueling Apache helicopters . Will the Cragside be used in a similar manner, but with a more special operations-focused role?  This wouldn’t be anything new, since America’s special operations community has long been users of floating outposts . On the other hand, the ship could be used as something akin to a special operations 9-1-1 vessel that can be quickly loaded with equipment and special operations forces and surged to anywhere in the world in just hours. It could also end up being a little of both, rapidly shipping SOCOM units’ vehicles, equipment, and personnel where they are needed for one mission, then planting itself off the coast of a lawless terror hotspot for the next. We will just have to wait and see, but if the picture at the top of this article hints at anything, it’s that this ship will be highly unique, and highly capable. With this in mind, if you are a bad guy and this thing shows up off your shore, it’s probably a very bad sign of things to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 24, 2022",EA-18G Growlers Appear In The Philippines As China Shadows US Carrier Group Nearby,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon’s premier electronic attack and suppression of enemy air defenses platform has arrived in the Philippines. Four EA-18G Growlers and 120 personnel from VAQ-138, the Yellow Jackets, have been sent to Clark Air Base for bilateral training with the Philippines’ newest fighter, the Korean-built FA-50 Golden Eagle . Yet this is just one facet of the Yellow Jacket’s strategic deployment. According to the US Navy the quartet of Growlers will also be used to “support routine operations that enhance regional maritime domain awareness and assure access to the air and maritime domains in accordance to international law.” In other words, they are there to contest China’s blanket claims to the South China Sea and to challenge their increasingly armed man-made island outposts that dot the disputed body of water. This detachment is part of a new initiative that is seeing US forces being drawn back to the same installations in the Philippines that they had vacated years ago . It is meant to increase interoperability between the US and local military forces, but above all else this inter-governmental agreement exists due to the mutually beneficial need to check Chin’s extra-territorial ambitions. The first of these aerial deployments happened just a month and a half ago when five A-10C Warthogs and a trio of HH-60G Pave Hawk combat search and rescue helicopters deployed to the base. The deployment saw the A-10s flying “freedom of navigation” flights around China’s man-made islands. USN The Growlers now being deployed to the area represent a very different and arguably much more pointed threat to China’s interests in the region than the A-10s did. These jets can jam and electronically attack China’s ship and island-based radar systems and communications nodes, drastically lowering Beijing’s situational awareness and overall tactical picture of what is happening in the region. As a result, this leaves their interests more vulnerable to surprise kinetic attacks. Having this type of capability deployed to the Philippines will definitely be seen as an escalation by the Chinese. Overall it is also is a clear indicator that the Obama Administration is willing to deploy some of the Pentagon’s most effective combat aircraft back to the region in an attempt to counter China’s growing military presence nearby. DoD Meanwhile, the USS John C. Stennis had been tailed by Chinese ships from nearly the moment she entered the South China Sea according to the Navy Times , with Rear Admiral Marcus Hitchcock, the flag officer in charge of the Stennis Strike Group, stating: “We did see PLAN ships quite routinely throughout the South China Sea. In fact, we were in constant visual contact with at least one PLAN ship at any one time, 24/7.” The Stennis and her flotilla have since met up with Japanese and Indian naval vessels to execute a large-scale training exercise in the Philippine Sea, dubbed “Malabar 2016.” The location of the drills, and the fact that India and Japan, both who have territorial disputes with China, are joining the US in the exercise, is clearly news that China is unhappy to hear. Check out the Stennis operating in some nasty weather during Malabar 2016: A Chinese intelligence ship has continued to follow the Stennis during these drills, coming within just a handful of miles from the carrier. Its job is likely to soak up electronic and communications intelligence from the trio of ever-tight knit naval players. This exercise comes as relations between Japan and China hit a new low last week after China sent a naval frigate into the contiguous zone around the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea .  This was the first time a PLAN surface combatant entered the area, although Chinese Coast Guard and other vessels have before. China’s increasingly close watch on the US Navy also comes as the massive Rim of The Pacific (RIMPAC) naval wargames is about to kick off. The biannual multi-national exercise is the largest of its kind, and this iteration will include no less than 27 nations, including China. Five Peoples Liberation Army Navy vessels are currently steaming toward Hawaii for the super-sized exercise. That is one more vessel than they sent in 2014. Well, that is if you don’t count China’s uninvited spy ship as an official participant. China’s flotilla for RIMPAC 2016 consists of a destroyer, frigate, submarine rescue ship, hospital ship and a supply ship. This group will rendezvous with the American Arleigh Burke class destroyers Stockdale and William P. Lawrence on Saturday. Together they will make up one of four group sails that will head to Pearl Harbor where the drills are primarily based out of. RIMPAC 2014, USN You may think it is strange that China is being invited to participate in RIMPAC even as tensions are broiling in the South China Sea. Not only that but also after China executed multiple unsafe intercepts on American aircraft, just weeks apart . Well you are not alone , but the fact is that there is a precedent for this type of thing and RIMPAC is used as much as a diplomatic tool as a military one. As the Stennis Strike Group wraps up its Malabar 2016 exercise it will also head east to take part in RIMPAC. We will keep you updated as the exercise gets underway.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 28, 2021",Photo Emerges Of Stealthy Avenger Drone Fitted With Advanced Multi-Spectral Sensor Suite,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics Predator C, more commonly known as the Avenger, offers a unique capability set. The design takes a balanced approach to stealth and performance versus cost. In doing so it represents the lower end of the unmanned combat air vehicle spectrum and the higher end of medium-altitude, medium-endurance, remotely-piloted armed reconnaissance vehicle spectrum. Let’s just say it is a highly adaptable concept that may not be as sexy as some of its higher-end alternatives, but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t relevant, regardless of whether the USAF wants to buy all that many. You can read all about the Avenger and where it could fit into America’s future air combat portfolio here . There are two configurations of the Avenger. The first was more of a prototype, while the handful of others that followed were stretched in length and had a series of small tweaks, including enhancements to their low observability features and ability to operate over a war zone. The USAF bought just one of these larger versions back in 2011 for testing purposes. General Atomics The 44-foot-long Avenger can lug 3,500 pounds of munitions. Four hard-points on the Avengers wings can accommodate additional weapons weighing up to 2,000 pounds when stealthiness is not needed. It can fly 400 knots up to 50,000 feet for 16 hours at a time. Aside from its endurance, which could likely be boosted by adding auxiliary fuel tanks, the Avenger represents a sizeable increase in capability over the MQ-9 Reaper that is now the mainstay of America’s remotely piloted vehicle force. Yet after a decade of testing, the Avenger doesn’t seem to have any buyers. Despite that, the USAF’s lone Avenger appears to have remained useful in recent months. It was reported that the drone would fly a series of test missions with the shadowy MS-177 multi-spectral sensor suite. Although these tests are said to have occurred last winter, no images of the Avenger outfitted with the cumbersome sensor have emerged, until now. As you can see, the MS-177 is a fairly massive device, changing the underbelly lines of the Avenger entirely. The sensor system is destined for the USAF’s Block 30 RQ-4 Global Hawk but was previously tested on a E-8 J-STARS in a bay area located behind the militarized 707’s APY-7 radar. It has also flown on Northrop Grumman’s Gulfstream V test jet that is uses as a surrogate for J-STARS related development and testing. It is supposedly capable of taking one-meter resolution “fused” footage/imagery, where it combines a wide spectrum of infrared and optical wavelengths into a single image, over long distances.  MS-177 is supposedly superior in many ways to the SYERS2 imaging sensor suite that has been deployed on the U-2 Dragon Lady (check out all the U-2’s configurations here ) and is now being tested on the Global Hawk. The test aboard the E-8 allowed operators to use the sensor creatively alongside the aircraft’s radar, which is optimized for detecting movements on the ground. This could drastically increase situational awareness below. Mike Mos, director of Joint STARS architectures and concept demonstrations for Northrop Grumman stated : “From long distances, the APY-7 radar combined with the MS-177 camera could identify very clearly people, buildings, automobiles and ships… Coupling the electro-optical/infrared [EO/IR] capability of the MS-177 camera with the GMTI capability makes the system an even stronger force multiplier.” Stills of MS-177's multi-spectral imagery taken five years ago during tests., Northrop Grumman via Global News Wire The Avenger’s test of the MS-177 took place over seven flights last January and February. Various objects were observed and the ability to data-link the sensor’s imagery efficiently was successfully tested. Next the sensor will fly on the  higher-flying Global Hawk with hopes that it will become operational as a sensor option in 2017. The effort to mate the MS-177 with the Block 30 RQ-4 is part of a larger initiative to advnace the RQ-4 far enough so that the U-2 Dragon Lady can be retired. A “universal payload adapter” has been built for the Global Hawk so that it can accommodate an array of sensors, including some of those used by the U-2, such as its SYERS 2 suite and its Optical Bar Camera system . This initiative can help get the RQ-4 on par with the U-2, as well as save money by allowing the Global Hawk to host sensors that the USAF has already paid for. Block 30 RQ-4 shown carrying the U-2's SYERS 2 sensor via its universal payload adapter., Northrop Grumman Over time, the MS-177 could also find itself on other platforms, such as the replacement for the E-8 J-STARS that will likely be based on a long-range business jet design . Even a stealthy penetrating reconnaissance aircraft could make use of the high-fidelity sensor. As for the Avenger’s future, it doesn’t look all that bright, at least when it comes to expanded service within the USAF. A representative from the USAF’s Big Safari rapid capabilities office stated that there are no future plans for the USAF’s single Avenger demonstrator: “In accordance with the 2011 defense appropriation act, the air force procured prototype demonstration capabilities of the Avenger system… The demonstration has completed and there are no current plans for future demonstrations.” Still, General Atomics has hopes that the Avenger can find a role with the US Navy. Seeing that the service has reduced its requirement for its first carrier-based unmanned tactical aircraft to be focused more on tanking and sensors carriage than striking deep in enemy territory, it may very well have a shot. There is also the potential of exports to countries that either cannot afford a high-end unmanned combat air vehicle, are not allowed to import one, or want the “blended capability” that the Avenger offers. You can see in the video below just what General Atomics thinks the Avenger can be capable of if given the chance, with both man-in-the-loop control and semi-autonomous control being a possibility. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0ofIRiXb-90 Contact the author at tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 1, 2016","30 Hornets Pulled From Boneyard, Navy Eyes Ditching New Carrier Arresting Gear","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In Pentagon parlance, concurrency is when you put something into production while it’s still in testing, or even before it enters testing at all. It is a high-risk sucker’s game that has proven a total loser for the DoD’s highest ticket and highest profile weapon systems. The F-35 and the Navy’s new aircraft carrier, for example, have suffered horribly under this dismal procurement concept . Now there are two new victims of concurrency, both perfect examples of how this concept has rippled through the Pentagon’s warfighting portfolio. Sadly, both were totally predictable. The USMC is resorting to pulling retired Hornets out of boneyard and totally revamping them in order to squeeze another 2,000 hours of flight time out of the their tired airframes. We are not just talking about regenerating a couple attrition replacements here : in fact, a whopping 30 legacy Hornets will be returned to flight. In a statement to Janes , Boeing’s senior manager for F/A-18 operations said : “The USMC wants 30 Hornet aircraft – two full squadrons – recovered from the boneyard and ‘reconstituted’ for fleet service. These aircraft were never meant to fly again, but Boeing is bringing them to Cecil Field and extending their airframe lives from 6,000 hours to 8,000 hours, replacing all the old avionics with the latest systems, and returning them to the marines.” This will not be a cheap affair, as the process of returning one of these jets to flyable status takes more than 18 months at the Navy’s traffic-jammed Hornet depots . These depots are already dealing with recapitalizing fleet Hornets and Super Hornet that are rife with corrosion and extending their lives from 6,000 to 10,000 hours in an attempt to fill NAVAIR’s looming fighter gap . Also, these jets are not being regenerated as short-term airframes that can fill-in for training purposes or adversary support duty. They are being loaded with the most advanced gear found on an F/A-18C, including JHMCS, Link 16, color MFDs, and new ejection seats and other upgrades. In other words, these jets, designated F/A-18C+, are meant for front line combat units. The size of this initiative is also telling, as it points to the reality that the USMC’s Hornet fleet, which is known to be cannibalizing itself for spare parts, is indeed in poor shape . Yet above all else it highlights the fact that the F-35s that are supposed to replace these jets are not coming online fast enough in the near term even after already being delayed for many years. The USMC is especially impacted by the incessant delays in the F-35 program because it never procured Super Hornets like the Navy did. As such, their newest Hornet was built in the 1990s, with much of the fleet dating back far before that. Add a decade and a half of perpetual warfare, inadequate program funding to reflect this operational tempo, and the result is that Marines’ flying gear is simply worn out. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images) Meanwhile, the Navy’s new carrier, the first in its class USS Gerald R. Ford , is being bit by concurrency in a most critical manner, and one that was also entirely foreseeable . The ship’s Advanced Arresting Gear, which uses water turbines and an induction motor to bring aircraft to a stop on the Ford’s landing area, is untested, ridiculously expensive, years behind schedule, and of questionable reliability. Right now, the AAG is 130% over budget, going from a 2009 estimated cost of just under $500 million to a whopping $1.4 billion in 2016, according to USNI . Not just that, but since the Ford is already built and about to be commissioned , the AAG could keep it from actually operating aircraft even after its operational date has passed. Even more damning, the AAG system had to be redesigned and the new version that has taken two years to develop is now being installed on the carrier. The big problem is that this new system is not nearly fully tested and design changes could mean ripping it out of the Ford and replacing it with yet another version—if they can get it to work reliably. So its concurrency hell Act Two for the AAG and the USS Gerald R. Ford. General Atomics The AAG is supposed to be less cumbersome than the very proven but massive hydro-pneumatic Mk 7 arresting gear system found on America’s carriers today. Its design was paired down in recent iterations, from the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) onwards, when the ships swithed to three arresting wires instead of four. The AAG is also supposed to accommodate a wider range of aircraft weights, and features a softer “catch” than the Mk 7 system, which could theoretically save on airframe fatigue and allow lighter aircraft, like unmanned ones, to use the system. But the risk, cost and uncertainty surrounding the AAG, even after many years of development and piles of cash invested, have left the Navy looking back to the Mk 7 for its future Ford class carriers. The second in the Ford class of carriers, the USS John F. Kennedy , is already under construction , and building of the USS Enterprise will begin in 2018 , so the decision to revert back to the Mk 7 arresting gear system has to be made soon if it’s to be retrofitted back into the Ford class design for these ships. This is precisely what the Navy may decide to do so they don’t end up with multiple carriers equipped with useless arresting gear that will need to be replaced, at incredible cost, with the Mk 7. In fact, the Navy has already changed course on another major Ford class concurrent developmental controversy— omitting shock trials from the carrier’s test plan in order to save time. USN Arresting gear is a critical part of a carrier’s design, which makes the Navy’s decision to just throw it into the Ford design unthinkably reckless. A similar concurrency boondoggle is also occurring with the Navy’s new America class amphibious assault ship. It needed a major refit after being commissioned to operate the F-35, and yet its deck will not be tough enough to withstand high-tempo F-35 operations even though the ship was built specifically for that mission. An nuclear supercarrier is the most expensive military vehicle on the planet. The Navy gets a new one only about every five years, and just 11 are mandated in service at any given time. So the Navy can’t just build “production prototypes” like it can with the F-35. Simply put, if the AAG does not work it could render a $13 billion dollar asset useless.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of Turkey’s expansive “White Storm” naval exercises on the Black Sea, one of the Turkish Naval Force’s Type 209 submarines executed a sinking exercise (SINKEX) on the Knox class Frigate ( Tepe class in Turkey) TCG Zafer F253. The attack was made via the employment of an advanced, all digital, fiber-optic wire-guided DM2A4 torpedo of German origin . As you can see, the torpedo detonated below the ship’s hull, heaving it upward and cracking it in two. A perfect kill. Eight Tepe class frigates were acquired from the US in the mid-1990s as part of a holistic effort to modernize the Turkish Naval Forces—a program that began in the 1980s. The Zafer was commissioned in 1973 as the USS Thomas C. Hart FF-1092 before being acquired by Turkey 20 years later. The video also shows an MH-60R helicopter taking out a small boat with a AGM-114 Hellfire, and one of Turkey’s new Ada class corvettes firing RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles and its OtoMelara Super Rapid 76mm deck gun at aerial targets. Finally, it shows one of Turkey’s Gabya class frigates , which are surplus (and now highly upgraded) US-built Oliver Hazard Perry class ships, firing RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missile (ESSMs) and Standard SM-1 missiles. Turkey has greatly modified their eight Gabya class frigates, including adding all new combat systems, plus data-links and sensors, including a modern long-range sonar and air search radar. These ships have also received an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system. This gives the ships the ability to fire the highly advanced ESSM, with four rounds packed into each Mark 41 cell, giving the ship 32 missiles to fire. They also retain the ability to launch the SM-1s that are fired via the ship’s original Mark 13 rail launch system, with 40 rounds stored in a rotary magazine below deck. Unlike America’s Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates, which were allowed to devolve into tactical obscurity before their retirement , Turkey and a handful of other countries have kept the class exceedingly potent and capable of area air defense. This, along with the fact that these ships were built tough, adhering to true naval warfare survivability standards, are things that America’s troubled Littoral Combat Ships lack. AP We could learn a lesson from our allies who have to do more with less. Sometimes, the hype of a new weapons concept seems to take precedence over logical upgrades to existing platforms. Then again, no defense contractor is going to get rich upgrading existing gear, nor are higher-ups in the Pentagon likely to earn another star for their work on such a meager project. Still, even Turkey’s newest warship, the LCS-like Ada class, carries ESSMs, giving it the ability to protect itself and other ships around it at range even in higher-threat scenarios. The Navy just won’t add this anti-air capability to the LCS, even as they have supposedly “up-gunned” the design, despite the fact that potential export customers have demanded it . As such, missions like convoy escort or operations in medium- and high-threat environments without a multi-billion dollar destroyer nearby are out of the question.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 16, 2016",What If Iran Started Flying Combat Missions From Syria?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The wars in Syria and Iraq feature long list of stakeholders that are connected to a tangled web of shaky alliances, tacit allowances and contradicting goals. Yet since Russia pulled its fixed-wing tactical fighters and attack aircraft out of Syria, the US appears to be enjoying less complex and volatile skies over the war-torn country. Yet if anything this conflict has proven to be, it is unpredictable, and there are certainly many hands vying for control and influence if and when ISIS no longer exists as centralized threat to the region. Iran in particular is deeply involved in both the fighting in Iraq and Syria. Iraq’s so called Popular Mobilization Forces are dominated by Shiite militias backed by Iran, which the US does not support. Iranian advisors, fighters and airpower have supported these militias directly. This 60 Minutes report by Lara Logan gives a unique “on the ground” insight into how powerful these Iranian-backed forces have become . Iranian air missions into Iraq are not coordinated with the US-led coalition’s Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) , so at times over the past couple of years the skies over Iraq have been a little bit like a high school hallway where two schoolyard foes pass by one another at a safe distance. Shahram Sharifi/Wikicommons In Syria, Iran’s long-time proxy, Hezbollah, is actively fighting for the Assad regime . Iran opened up their airspace to Russia, providing a vital air route during the rapid build-up to air operations from Moscow’s Syrian air base south of the port city of Latakia. Even Russia’s cruise missiles flew through Iranian flight corridors on their way to Syria from the Caspian Sea , with some of them even crash-landing on Iranian soil. Now, with both sides rushing towards the outskirt of the ISIS capital of Raqqa (those being Assad’s military, with Russian and Iranian support, and the US coalition with its Syria Democratic Forces ) it’s possible Iran will step in to provide fixed wing air support just as Russia did when it came to taking on anti-Assad forces in the country’s west. Such a move would greatly complicate the American-led air war over Syria. It’s one thing to fly sporadic strikes from another country, and an entirely different thing to actually base jets in that country. Russia had a few dozen fighters and bombers in-country, and the skies over Syria became crowded and volatile. Considering that Russia’s aviators are a more predictable commodity than Iranian ones (especially those belonging to the IRGC), and relations between Russia and the US, although severely strained, are far more intimate than relations between the US and Iran, the constant presence of Iranian tactical jets over Syria could be downright volatile. The US is clearly ramping up its air campaign in Syria, with greatly expanded drone operations out of Jordan and a US Carrier Strike Group attacking from Syria’s shore for the first time since the conflict began . The arrival of a US Carrier Strike Group was almost certainly made possible due to the greatly decreased Russian presence in the region. If Iran were to use Russia’s facilities, which are still manned and defended, it’s likely that striking from the Mediterranean would not remain such an attractive option for the US Navy. The positioning of Iranian fighters and attack jets in Syria (especially in western Syria, if that were to be the case) would also likely draw great concern from Israel, which has never had Iranian air power stationed so close to its borders. Khashayar Talebzadeh/wikicommons The thing is, this hypothetical may actually become a reality. There have been reports and rumors that Iran has requested to fly 16 aircraft through Iraqi airspace on their way to Syria. These reports have not been corroborated with an official announcement, but the idea of Iran using its airpower in an expeditionary manner in Syria is interesting, to say the least. Not only would it have an impact on the Syrian conflict and the push against ISIS, but it would also signal a change in Iranian military strategy, and in their ability and willingness to project power abroad. The presence of a full-on Carrier Strike Group off Syrian shores, and another one heading to the region soon , could be a catalyst for a response from the Assad-Russia-Iran alliance. In fact, we predicted something like this would occur —although from Russian origin, not Iranian. It’s quite possible that these rumors and reports are false. But now that the conflict is accelerating on multiple fronts, and seeing that Russia has proved the model, and has a base totally ready from which to operate Iran’s aircraft, and that Iran has increasingly been more aggressive when it comes to their willingness to become involved in foreign conflicts , the idea of forward-deployed Iranian air power in Syria is well within the realm of possibility.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what has to be one of the strangest and most horrific spate of crashes in aviation history, the Russian Knights flight demonstration team lost a Su-27 Flanker and the Patrouille Suisse display team lost an F-5 today during totally separate incidents that occurred just hours apart at different locations. Sadly, Russian pilot Major Sergei Yeremenko died in the crash, which occurred near Moscow. The Swiss pilot is reported
 to have ejected, is uninjured, and there are no reports of casualties on the ground . It remains unclear what caused the Flanker to crash. The team had flown in support of a ceremony for a monument dedicated to Russian aviators in the village of Anushkino , but only five of the six jets returned to their base. The reason behind the F-5 crash is more certain; it seems the jet collided with another team jet’s elevator. You can see the damage on the surviving F-5 as it made an emergency landing back at Leeuwarden Air Base, in the Netherlands. The team was preparing for a local air show. Within one week, the Blue Angels, the Thunderbirds, the Russian Knights, and the Patrouille Suisse—all top jet demonstration teams—have had crashes, two fatal. This comes as the US has also lost four fleet fighters in the last couple of weeks. Both incidents were mid-air collisions with two Super Hornets and two F-16s destroyed . All aircrew ejected safely and were recovered without any major injuries. As to how so many major jet teams could have crashes in the span of a single week? I have no idea, but it’s absolutely bizarre. Our thoughts are with the Russian Black Knights and their comrade Major Sergei Yeremenko, who lost his life today.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",This is Likely Why the Navy Is Causing a Massive and Mysterious GPS Outage in the Western US,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Picture a giant, invisible, upside-down cone rising up from the desert floor near Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. It ranges over 500 miles in every direction, covers more than 500,000 square miles in total, and reaches up higher than any civilian aircraft can fly. Inside the cone, GPS-related systems fail to function. That invisible cone will be a reality this month, at least intermittently, and the FAA is warning pilots that GPS-related systems may fail to work in the area over the next three and a half weeks ( see flight advisory here ). Today, Gizmodo posted a story about the strange flight advisory and contacted Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, which is one of the Pentagon’s multi-use test centers in the baking Mojave Desert , about the restrictions. Not surprisingly, the spokesman for the base couldn’t give any details as to what will cause such a widespread electromagnetic disruption, or why such a potentially hazardous series of events is being executed at all. But we can infer some things from the nature of the FAA’s flight advisory. First, it’s not an airborne jamming system being tested, as the effective area and altitudes are indicative of an omni-directional emitter placed on the ground, with the curvature of the earth creating a line-of-sight blind cutout that increases in altitude with distance. With this in mind, and noting that this emissions source has a high risk of jamming GPS signals, we can confidently hypothesize why such a scenario would be used for by NAWS China Lake testers. The Defense Department is coming to terms with its acute addiction to GPS. Navigation on sea, in the air, and on the ground all largely rely on GPS. Many weapon systems, like cruise missiles and GPS-guided bombs, also rely on the technology, at least partially, to hit their intended targets reliably and accurately. These systems are largely paired with inertial navigation systems, so that if GPS is not available or degraded during flight, they can still find their final destination. ( You can read all about INS with embedded GPS here .) But the reality is that, if the GPS lights go out so to speak, our fighting forces would be severely crippled. The enemy knows this, and our GPS satellites can be attacked in multiple ways, both kinetic (anti-satellite weaponry, orbital tampering, etc.) and non-kinetic (jamming, hacking, etc). C4ISRNet.com executed an incredibly succinct interview with the head of the Navy’s Communications and GPS Navigation Program Office , Captain Mark Glover. In the piece, the Captain described the military’s dependence on GPS: “As you know, GPS is ubiquitous. There is an increasing reliance on GPS across all ranges of military operations, and, of course, we can’t forget our critical civilian infrastructure as well. Additionally, GPS jammers have proliferated around the globe, from large and complex militarized jammers to cheap and inexpensive units you can buy online. That means that not only that our peer and near-peer potential adversaries are capable of impacting GPS, but we must be mindful of non-state actors, as well. Furthermore, we are trying to predict other methods that might be employed against our systems, such as cyber threats. Because it is not just a threat against the radio frequency signal, it is a threat against the actual systems that control those. Over the past 20 years, GPS has been a force multiplier for our military. But we cannot assume that any longer. We have to be proactive in protecting this valuable resource. ” The Captain continued, discussing the challenges presented by a GPS degraded combat environment: “Let me put a little context on top of it. The GPS satellite signal at a user’s antenna is very low power. To put that in perspective, a 100-watt bulb is [10 to the 18th power] more powerful than a GPS satellite signal at the receiver’s antenna. A low-power jammer can disrupt GPS operations. To that end, denial and degradation of GPS can have myriad effects on our systems. Without protection, our ships, submarines and aircraft won’t be able to properly navigate. Some of our sensors might not function properly, and provide erroneous information to our war fighters. Plus, time and frequency is a critical part of our communications infrastructure. Disruption of time can prevent those networks and communications systems from functioning properly, as well.” With all this in mind, the Department of Defense is coming up with new concepts, and dusting off old ones as well, to deal with a GPS-denied reality. On the low end, one measure once again sees the Navy teaching and practicing celestial navigation . On the higher end, and initiative called Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Assured PNT) looks to explore, and eventually leverage, a series of potential antidotes to the idea of fighting without GPS. A group of these technologies could be part of an entire ecosystem of resilient navigation and timing capabilities used by multiple platforms and weapon system that will be able to fight in future wars where GPS is not a certainty. By distributing multiple types of navigational aids and sensors throughout the battlespace and across many platforms, and even linking them together, highly accurate positioning could exist without relying so heavily on GPS. This “cocktail of solutions” concept also means high-quality timing and navigation is resilient, as it’s not based on just a single solution. As such, Assured PNT won’t simply addict the Pentagon to another vulnerable, blanket navigational concept, like GPS. Part of this new initiative includes developing Inertial Navigation Systems that are more accurate than their predecessors, and also more inexpensive and compact so they can be easily deployed across the battlefield. Another technology being developed by BAE Systems, dubbed Navigation via Signals of Opportunity (NAVSOP), uses the electromagnetic waves all around us, from sources like television and cell phones—and even GPS jammers themselves—to provide positioning information passively. This is an especially attractive set of features for stealthy aircraft that need to stay as emissions-silent as possible. Miniaturizing atomic clocks and making them more accurate is another partial solution. BAE Systems Basically, the Pentagon is shopping for an answer, or a series of answers packaged together, for this major problem. Obviously, defense contractors want to be part of the solution and the gravy train that will go along with it. Brand-new ideas are not the only relevant ones out there; sometimes, using what you already have but in a more automated fashion may at least be a fallback solution. For instance, fighter and attack aircraft have radars that can map the ground with great precision. By matching snapshots of the terrain around them with geo-spatial imagery loaded into an onboard memory bank, the aircraft could automatically increase the accuracy of its INS-reliant navigation system, which, traditionally, is not highly accountable for detecting things like drift. Even using a fighter or bomber’s targeting pod’s laser rangefinder and “squirting” at different known landmarks on the ground can enhance the aircraft’s navigational accuracy when GPS is unreliable. The truth is that even cruise missiles, which have to be very accurate in order to accomplish their singular task, were put to work for many years without the use of GPS. It wasn’t until Operation Secret Squirrel in 1991 that GPS became a part of the cruise missiles’ brains . Before that, terrain contour matching (TERCOM) and INS were effective ways to navigate to their final destinations. When you consider all of this, you can see how ominous of an idea a GPS-less war is becoming within the Pentagon’s collective brain. As such, concepts like those described above, and the very weapons and aircraft themselves that rely on heavily on GPS today, all need to be tested in a GPS-denied scenario. Yes, tests can probably be simulated to a large degree, but testing under real-world conditions, over a wide area, is certainly necessary to prove key theories and predictive models—and to further validate less ambitious tests where GPS denial or degradation was only simulated. There is the possibility that this event is being caused by some other exotic test that just so happens to jam GPS signals as a byproduct, but that’s highly unlikely. Even the idea that we’re testing our own GPS-denial weapon system is possible, but this could be done alongside a test for the umbrella objective of being able to fight in such an environment. So there you have it. NAWS China Lake, which does a sizeable portion of its work under the shroud of secrecy, is likely doing absolutely critical work when it comes to ensuring our combat capabilities are not gutted due to the loss of a single capability—GPS. The Navy would not cause such intense series of potential disruptions over such a large timescale unless the testing was of extremely high importance, and figuring out how we can continue to vanquish our enemies without the help of navigational satellites is certainly that.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 23, 2016",Report Says Canada Will Buy Super Hornets As An Interim Fighter Solution,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the past decade, Canada has lived through its own unique F-35 saga. It even crept into this TV spot where little kids compare their fighter jets . The conservative government of Stephen Harper had a fixation on buying just 65 examples of the stealth jet to replace the country’s overextended fleet of 80 CF-18A+ Hornets. When liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took power early last winter, he made it clear that the F-35 deal was not going to happen . Now Trudeau’s cabinet has reportedly decided to order a batch of F/A-18 Super Hornets as an interim fighter solution, pushing off a potential legal backlash from rejecting the F-35 outright. The Super Hornet has long been the right choice to fulfil Canada’s strategic needs while also sticking to its budgetary limitations ( make sure to read all about why here ). Even buying a relatively small batch of say 24 Super Hornets would be a great solution for taking the pressure off of the RCAF’s aging and over-worked “legacy” CF-18 Hornet fleet. Such a move still leaves the door open for Canada to buy F-35s, or more Super Hornets for that matter, in the future. In essence, by procuring a batch of Super Hornets now, Canada not only buys itself time and lowers its financial risk, but it also allows its air arm to better identify what they truly need in a future fighter by buying and flying the F-35’s most logical alternative. As part of this interim batch, the RCAF would be smart to acquire at least some two-seat F model Super Hornets as they can be converted to EA-18G Growler configuration in the future. This would be highly beneficial if single seat F/A-18E Super Hornets are bought to replace the rest of CF-18 fleet or even if the F-35 ends up in the RCAF’s fighter ranks in the coming decade. Having an organic electronic attack and jamming platform integrated into Canada’s fighter force would drastically increase its Hornets survivability during combat operations and the F/A-18Fs converted to EA-18G standard would be very useful for NATO integrated air operations which largely lack such a capability outside of what the US can provide . USN Australia, who also flies older F/A-18A/B Hornets like Canada , has executed a similar strategy , buying F/A-18Fs as an interim solution before the F-35A comes online . This along with the procurement of the AGM-158 JASSM standoff stealthy land-attack missiles allowed Royal Australian Air Force to finally retire the geriatric and expensive, but greatly beloved F-111 Aardvark . In the future, some of Australia’s F/A-18Fs could be converted to Growler standard as some came from the factory with all the wiring to do so. According to National Post , the move to buy Super Hornets as only an interim solution will also likely stave off a serious set of  expensive lawsuits that could be filed by Lockheed Martin for blocking a potential F-35 purchase entirely, stating: “The Liberals promised during the election campaign not to buy the F-35 to replace the CF-18s. But the government has been struggling with how to fulfil that promise for fear any attempt to exclude the stealth fighter from a competition will result in a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit, according to one senior Defense Department official.” It’s very likely that once Canada is operating Super Hornets they will realize how big of a jump in capability the jet provides for the money and how well suited the type is for their specific needs. Additionally, these new fighters could likely be acquired at a very good price considering Boeing’s need to keep its Super Hornet production line open , and its St Louis fighter plant operating well into the foreseeable future. After years of waiting, Kuwait has yet to be cleared to order a batch of 28 Super Hornets that the Obama Administration has been withholding . Congress has added 16 of the cost-effective and proven fighters to its 2017 and 2018 defense budgets, with more on an unfunded priorities list that could also be added. These orders should keep the line humming for a couple more years at best, but Boeing says it needs to build 24 jets a year to keep the line operating efficiently. As such, if Canada does not place an order soon, and if the Kuwaiti buy stays in limbo or other potential customers don’t put in orders (Malaysia for instance), Canada may not have a Super Hornet option to chose from at all. With this in mind, it is understandable how moving rapidly to purchase Super Hornets is becoming a priority in Ottawa. Although fielding the F-35 sometime in the next decade would still be a possibility for Canada, buying Super Hornets now will also buy Ottawa time to see how the troubled fighter program pans out. This would mean that Canada would be buying a far more mature F-35 than the examples being delivered in the near term. Basically the move is a massive risk reduction exercise that is totally understandable considering just how uncertain the F-35 program has proven to be. USN The fact that the RCAF’s legacy Hornet fleet is failing to meet the country’s military commitments is not surprising either. The National Post quotes an official in Minister of National Defense Harjit Sajjan’s office as stating: “The government is working very hard on this file as it must because today the Canadian Armed Forces are risk-managing a gap between our NATO and NORAD obligations, and the number of planes we can put in the air on any given day… That capability gap is expected to grow in the years ahead, and that’s an unacceptable situation.” The US Navy and Marine Corps’ legacy Hornets, among other key platforms , are also suffering from abysmal availability rates after a decade and a half of continuous warfare . As a result of this, and due to delays in the F-35 program , America’s legacy Hornets and even Super Hornets are having to get their lives extended. This has led to a train wreck at America’s F/A-18 Hornet depots which were never specifically set up to be running expansive life-extension programs. Canada’s move to field a interim fighter before going all-in on the F-35 program also sends a strong alternative message to other F-35 customers who are also dealing with flying ever smaller fleets of aging fighters as they decide to gamble on the F-35 or not. Such a “wait and see” strategy may prove more acceptable, both politically and economically, than being early adopters of the $115,000,000 stealth fighters. It is likely that leasing strategies would be put forward by 4th generation fighter manufacturers to fulfil this very scenario if Canada proves the model with Super Hornets. If the National Post’s report proves to be accurate and the Super Hornet procurement decision is in fact being prepared for official roll-out, it underlines Prime Minister Trudeau’s campaign promise to rationalize Canada’s military posture and weapons procurement doctrine. Considering that he followed through with his plan to pull Canada’s Hornets out of the anti-ISIS bombing campaign, it is not just possible, but probably that he is doing the same when it comes to stopping Canada’s headlong dive into the F-35 abyss.

Fleet Week pays tribute to this heritage, and remains a hugely popular event in San Francisco. Now, one San Francisco city official wants to introduce a resolution that will ban the Blue Angels from even flying over the city. SF’s Fleet Week is one of the Blue’s highest-profile and most popular exhibitions, and the team is the biggest draw of the entire event. Yet last week’s tragic loss of Blue Angel #6 and its pilot, Captain Jeff Kuss , has prompted San Francisco City Supervisor John Avalos to start work on a resolution that would restrict the Blue Angels’ ability to execute their Fleet Week demonstration. According to SFGate , his reasoning for the resolution is as follows: “It’s about them crashing and hitting a building, a place where people live…It’s about the terror that they cause in people when they strafe neighborhoods. That’s something I hear about all the time when Blue Angels fly overhead…Flying over sailboats that choose to be about in the bay when the Blue Angels are flying, I don’t really have a problem with that.” You read that correctly. The City Supervisor for San Francisco thinks the Blue Angels strafe neighborhoods. Obviously, this has never happened. The Blue Angels don’t strafe anything. Hell, the damn M61 Vulcan cannon that’s normally housed in the F/A-18’s nose is removed during the jet’s conversion to Blue Angels team aircraft. The idea of a military air show participant gunning down neighborhoods is beyond absurd—none of the aircraft are armed when participating in air shows. And, no, the team does not have a history of just ramming into buildings. Careful show planning goes into each performance site and all obstacles are identified and accounted for. USN San Francisco’s extremely progressive politics can be shocking to some, but justifying a smack-down of the Blue Angles, a symbol of American pride, right after they lost one of their own and based on total fearmongering bullshit is unacceptable. The Blue Angels may have their problems , and plans to fix those problems are underway , and, yes, this guy has every right to float legislation that will limit the Blue Angels to overwater maneuvers, or even ban them from performing entirely. But doing so while putting forward the idea that the team has literally, if accidentally, attacked American neighborhoods is a low blow. If Mr. Avalos has no clue what strafe means, but is apparently willing to throw around key terms that are alien to him about such a sensitive subject, then he’s a careless moron.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 23, 2016",US Carrier Striking Targets From the Eastern Med For the First Time Since 2003,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Under seemingly unrelated deployments, the US has moved a lot of heavy-hitting weaponry into the European theatre in the recent days. This includes B-52Hs that are being forward deployed to RAF Fairford for exercises over Europe and Africa, P-8 Poseidons that have arrived
 in Germany , and a full-on Carrier Strike Group operating in the eastern Mediterranean . The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, which includes the USS Harry S. Truman , three destroyers, a cruiser, and a fast attack submarine, has moved into the Mediterranean to take on ISIS from the west. Although such a strategy seems logical, it has been rarely executed by the Navies of the anti-ISIS coalition. In fact, it’s the first time an American Carrier Strike Group has flown strikes from the region in 13 years. Although a French-led multi-national flotilla did execute some operations from the Mediterranean for a short time following the Paris terror attacks, the carrier Charles De Gaulle and its escorts were quickly moved to the Persian Gulf. America’s anti-ISIS air campaign plugged along for nearly a year before Turkey opened up its airspace and basing for coalition aircraft last July . Yet even before that occurred, America’s carrier-based air power never took advantage of western access into Syria, and has been relegated to operating solely from the Persian Gulf for the operation. Once Russia became heavily involved in the Syrian conflict last Fall, access to Syrian airspace, via directly flying over the country’s western shore, became a non-option. It wasn’t just the Russian fighters’ presence that caused this. Russia’s deployment of Slava -class air defense cruisers equipped with S-300 surface-to-air missiles off the Syrian coastline shortly after ramping-up air attacks out of their airfield south of Latakia, Syria, greatly complicated the airspace situation. Then, a Turkish F-16 shot down a Russia Su-24 along the Syrian-Turkish border , sending Russian-Turkish relations (and NATO-Russian relations, to a certain degree) into a tailspin. Russia’s subsequent deployment of its advanced S-400 air defense system to their base near Syria’s western shore resulted in a seemingly abrupt end to any coalition air combat operations that included manned aircraft over western Syria. Although Russia still maintains its airbase in Latakia, supposedly including its S-400 air defense system, the Sukhoi fighter and attack jets that once packed the base are gone , as is Russia’s air defense picket ship that was once stationed off Syria’s central coastline. Russia’s much reduced presence in western Syria has likely paved the way for the air strikes being conducted by the USS Harry S. Truman today. In doing so, it opens another front on America’s war on ISIS—one that could take the place of Turkish basing if Ankara’s hospitality turns sour. Although it’s likely that the Navy’s Hornets, Super Hornets, and Growlers are still flying over Turkish airspace to circumnavigate Russia’s defenses, this could change if Turkey were to close its airspace to coalition aircraft. The idea that Turkey would pull US basing for the anti-ISIS campaign sounds strange considering the country’s NATO affiliation, and the threat that ISIS poses to its people , but it is possible considering recent events. The US is actively backing Kurdish YPG and YPJ fighters in northern and eastern Syria. These are the same PKK-affiliated groups with which Turkey is actively at war, and that war is a bloody one. Just recently, PKK militants shot down a Turkish Cobra attack helicopter , and Turkish fighters have been bombing Kurdish installations just as they’ve been bombing ISIS ones since the first day of airstrikes after joining the US-led anti-ISIS air campaign. Making things more complicated, a photo recently surfaced of a US special forces operator wearing a YPJ patch while operating alongside Kurdish units in Syria . The YPJ is the PKK’s female military combat corps, which is a battle-hardened force that has proven to be among the most effective and brave when it comes to fighting ISIS. This enraged Ankara, and the Erdogan Administration, which is already walking a fine line by playing ball with American basing requests while still showing that it draws a hard line when it comes to fighting Kurdish “terrorists.” The presence of a Carrier Strike Group in the eastern Mediterranean, along with B-52s in England, also sends a strong message to Russia, whose Navy has had a greatly increased presence in the region . It also puts the American flotilla on the doorstep of Russia’s long-held port in Tartus, Syria, their only Mediterranean naval facility. As Russia’s Black Sea Fleet continues to be modernized and strengthened, it will become an even more permanent fixture in the Mediterranean. Russian live-fire exercises and other war games and airspace closures in the area have also become a near-constant reality; even as a the Truman Carrier Strike Group plows the shores off Syria, a
 Russian torpedo drill is supposedly underway nearby. As the Cold War taught us, the Mediterranean can become a crowded, volatile body of water. Now, with an American supercarrier sitting off of Syria’s shore, and between Russia’s naval forces and its port in Tartus and airbase near Latakia, Syria, there will likely be some response from Moscow. Part of this response could include Russia sending its only carrier (albeit one with questionable viability) the Admiral Kuznetsov , and its flotilla, which included tugs on standby to tow the carrier when it breaks down, to the same eastern Mediterranean operating location. AP Rumors about this deployment already exist , but now that the US is freely operating in the area it seems like such a deployment would become more of a priority. Still, one has to take reports of the Kuznetsov deploying with a grain of salt, since the carrier always seems as if it’s about to be sent to face off against US interests, at least according to sensationalist news sites and the Russian media itself . It’s very possible that the carrier will remain in port for repairs and upgrades for the foreseeable future , after which it will premiere its new MiG-29K fighters , as has been stated in the past. Either way, we’ll probably know in the coming weeks. Even if the Kuznetsov doesn’t enter the Mediterranean anytime soon, other Russian vessels, many of which were built almost exclusively for sinking US carrier strike groups , likely will. One thing is certain: after decades of declining prominence, the Navy’s Sixth Fleet is beginning to play a much more strategically important role in America’s foreign policy. Beyond having at trio of forward-deployed destroyers at its disposal , Carrier Strike Groups are now flying combat missions under its umbrella, and that fact alone will shift the strategic paradigm in the region.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a bizarre and tragic set of accidents, both the Navy and USAF flight demonstration teams have lost aircraft on the same day, just hours apart, in totally different locations and under different circumstances. The Blue Angels were executing an afternoon practice session in preparation for the upcoming Great Tennessee Air Show when disaster struck. A massive fireball was photographed as a result of one of the team’s F/A-18 Hornet’s impact with the ground. One fatality is reported although it is not confirmed if this was the pilot or a bystander. This year is the team’s 70th anniversary. The Thunderbirds crash occurred earlier in the day, shortly after the team made its annual flyover of the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, for graduation. The event was attended by President Barack Obama. AP The pilot of T-Bird #6, the opposing solo position, flown by Major Alex Turner, ejected from his F-16C safely, due to unknown circumstances. Oddly enough the jet is relatively intact and laying in a field. We will keep you updated on this page as we learn more. Update: 3:47PM PST- It has been confirmed by multiple outlets that Blue Angel #6, Captain Jeff Kuss, has died in the Tennessee crash.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 13, 2016",The USAF’s Pilot Shortage Has Reached Disastrous Levels,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A shrinking and rapidly aging aircraft fleet . An underperforming, “bet it all” fighter program that is grossly over budget and many years behind schedule . A tactical air plan that will be insolvent in just five years . A culture that is laughably slow at adapting to the unmanned aircraft revolution , and a totally irrational vendetta towards the most effective tactical platform it has to fight ISIS, the A-10 Warthog . These are just a handful of the USAF’s many problems. Now, you can add a pilot shortage that has quietly escalated to near dire proportions to the top of the list. It’s hard to argue that the USAF has been managed well over the last decade. Near constant poor procurement calls, the inability to rationalize its priorities, and a seemingly numb finger on the pulse of its own cultural zeitgeist has left it hobbled. It has become a lightning rod for well-deserved criticism. What was a looming issue talked about quietly in defense inner-circles and occasionally mentioned on news sites is now a cancer on the service, one that has infected its very cultural core. Simply put, pilots have had enough of the Air Force and are leaving the flying branch far faster than they can be replaced. And no, it is not just because the airlines are hiring. A near perfect storm has struck at the USAF’s ability to keep flyers in cockpits, but much of that storm was created by the USAF itself. Spencer Platt/Getty Images John Q. Public has done an especially good job at tracking this growing issue. Months ago they brought forward the fact that the USAF Thunderbirds cannot recruit quality and diverse candidates to do what many would think is a dream job , and now they have uncovered just how pathetic the pilot corps retention and recruitment situation has become within the USAF. I would highly suggest you read the article linked here , as most of its conclusions and analysis concurs exactly with what I have increasingly heard from USAF pilots over the last couple of years. Common complaints include how little flying pilots are actually doing, especially when assigned to certain platforms that have low availability rates. Instead they have morphed into flight suit wearing office managers. What’s worse is that multiple pilots I know have stated that the promotional structure they are a slave to has become a self-serving bureaucracy, where those with keen political abilities are promoted over others with a warrior’s mindset and raw talent in the cockpit. Beyond this, the absolutely out of touch and exceedingly anal corporate culture within the USAF has reached such a rigid point of absurdity that it has crushed the quality of life within the service’s squadrons, and there are plenty of absurd cases to support such complaints. Although the USAF claims operations tempo has hurt pilot retention, I have never heard this being posited as a reason. USAF An internal memo obtained by John Q. Public clearly states how bad the crisis has become and seems to point towards the possibility of lowering standards to help solve it. Such a move woud not only put national security at risk but it also puts other aircrews in danger that have to fly alongside sub-par individuals. Barring a massive downturn in the world economy, something has to change, and it has to change fast. Sadly I don’t see this happening, at least not until a leader comes onboard at the top of the USAF that is willing to challenge the thick and oily Pentagon bureaucracy and put their own career on the line in the process. Such a figure would have to make it their focus to restructure how the USAF does business on many levels, from procurement and sustainment of its aircraft fleets, down to how its pilots train and what tasks they are assigned when they are not flying. In other words, the Air Force needs an infusion of warrior culture from the top down, one that puts bottom-line air combat capability above the political fray. Under such an initiative flight hours should be significantly increased, along with all the logistical and budgetary adjustments needed to make that happen, so that our combat aviators are allowed to be just that. It would also include opening up higher ranking promotions to those who are fantastic at their jobs, but who have no interest in ever flying a desk at the Pentagon. Whether the incoming Air Force Chief Of Staff General David Goldfein is such a figure and is willing to pick such a perilous fight, we will have to wait and see. USAF What was once a customary “shrug it off” exercise in hopelessness when it came to dealing with “big Air Force” stupidity has now morphed into an almost nihilistic form of listlessness among many disgruntled flying officers. The idea that those who joined the USAF to fly and fight, and be the very best at doing it, are being told “sorry buddy that’s not the job, if you want a promotion get with the political program” is absolutely counter-productive to the true reason why the USAF exists, which is to use air power to fight and win America’s wars. Other departments within the Pentagon are beginning to adapt to certain people-power deficits that traditional recruitment and career channels are not fulfilling. The Navy is looking at bringing external talent into top officer positions for unique niches like cyber warfare . The Army has its Warrant Officer program and the Pentagon is now trying to compete for Silicon Valley tech talent outside of the traditional civilian recruitment methods . What I am getting at here is that the USAF could start changing for the better by realizing that multiple routes can lead to the same place, and to look at becoming more agile and creative in the people ops department. For pilots this would mean putting less of a premium on the parts of the job that doesn’t include actually flying when it comes to valuing its flyers and promoting them. Or at the very least, the USAF could provide an exciting career route for pilots that don’t want to continue their Air Force career by doing things that don’t have much to do with being in the cockpit at all. This is not Tyler’s perspective really; it is a composite of what my most trusted sources have conveyed to me in great detail over the last few years, some of which have since left the service. Additonally, these are just some components of what needs to be a solution made up of a cocktail of measures aimed at keeping pilots in the USAF and recruiting quality new candidates. Once again, increased flying hours, making a real commitment to modify fleet management and procurement to reflect such an initiative, and maybe easing up on the ultra-politically correct, zero-tolerance culture that has become a counter-productive and over-corrected caricature of itself would all help. And yeah, money is a factor too. It currently costs well over six million dollars to train a fighter pilot . You read that right, six million bucks! So why not just compete more directly with the airlines when it comes to pay for pilots that have hit their re-up milestones? How many years, or even decades, would it take paying a pilot competitively to stay on to actually eclipse the cost of “building” a new one? Also, considering that a single Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kit costs around $20,000 and an F-15C costs $42,000 an hour to fly , competitive pay for experienced pilots is not that crushing of a cost in the big scheme of the USAF’s 100 plus billion dollar budget. USAF In the end the USAF needs to learn from other big institutions that rely on very talented people in order to produce a competitive product or service. It is about money yes, but to attract the best and keep them it is just as much about culture, self worth, career potential and working in a great environment. The USAF and its pilot corps should be no different. In fact, the USAF has something going for it that retention-leading firms like Google don’t . That being the individual is serving their country in the process of making a career for themselves. That is one hell of a draw, but reading that memo it seems like the laughably uncreative USAF power-apparatus may think that is good enough to carry the force alone. Like reading their instruments while flying in bad weather, the Air Force’s head honchos should trust themetrics before them, no matter how dismal they appear. Because if anything they say that service and country just doesn’t cut it alone anymore when it comes to getting and keeping the best a brightest pilots.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 13, 2016",South Korea’s New Sub Could Be Capable Of Firing Ballistic Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports indicate that South Korea is building their locally designed, 3,000 ton, Jangbogo III class diesel-electric submarines with ballistic missile launching capabilities. We already know this new design has a vertical launch system, and while there were rumors it would have short-to intermediate-range ballistic missile launching capabilties, most believed the system was meant to accommodate only land-attack cruise missiles. The Jangbogo III class represents the final installment of a three class submarine modernization initiative, dubbed the “Korean Attack Submarine Program,” begun more than a decade ago. The first step in this process was upgrading nine existing derivatives of the 1,200 (post mid-life hull stretch 1,400) ton German Type 209 boats that were commissioned in the 1990s. The second step was to produce a variant of the 1,800-ton German Type 214 Air Independent Propulsion-equipped submarine under license. This effort is still underway with four out of nines boats currently commissioned. The final class, which will dwarf both of its progenitors, is dubbed the Jangbogo III. It is a unique, non-licensed design that uses indigenous technologies almost exclusively, and will be equipped with the latest lithium-ion battery-based Air-Independent Propulsion . Construction of the first of this ambitious class began just last month . A Republic of South Korean Navy Type 209/Jangbogo I class submarine., US Navy Apparently, South Korea’s move to equip its new submarines with ballistic missile capability is a response to North Korea ongoing nuclear weapons program and their own submarine-launched ballisitic missile initiative, one that the Hermit Kingdom has made significant progress on as of late. The addition of this capability could also explain why South Korea plans to increase the size of the second boat in the class by some 400 tons. Still, why would South Korea really need this capability at all? It already has a conventional second-strike capability , via its submarine-launched cruise missiles, and the country is not a nuclear power. Plus, South Korea is already protected under America’s nuclear umbrella. It is true that even a conventionally tipped ballistic missile is tougher to defend against and hits much harder than an air-breathing cruise missile. Maybe South Korea sees the capability as a unique conventional second-strike deterrent. after all, ballistic missiles are more capable than cruise missiles of destroying deeply-buried North Korean bunkers. This capability could make the North Korean regime more vulnerable to a decapitation strike. Then there’s the possibility that South Korea is baking future nuclear ambitions into its submarine designs. A South Korean Type 214/Sohn Won-Yil class submarine., Republic of Korea Armed Forces As the North Korean nuclear threat grows, and as the American presidential campaign floats potential changes in America’s military presence in the region , South Korea could make a grand strategic pivot and begin developing its own nuclear weapons . The ability to slap a few nuclear warheads onto a ballistic missile and load them into an advanced, long-diving submarine is one very powerful way to independently deter a North Korean nuclear attack—with or without America’s nuclear umbrella overhead. The Korea Herald reports that this new class will be equipped with six vertical launch tubes capable of firing the modern Hyunmoo-2B ballistic missile . The missile in question has a range of about 300 miles and can pack up to a 2,200lb warhead, although under current restrictions it is likely a 1,000lb warhead would be fitted which would maximize the missile’s potential range. Either way, such a weapon should be more than capable of delivering a nuclear warhead if one were developed and deployed by South Korea. If South Korea does plan on pairing its new advanced and super-sized diesel-electric submarines with the ability to sling hard-hitting ballistic missiles it is likely an ominous sign of things to come. Basically South Korea could be setting itself up perfectly with a delivery system and a near ideal second-strike platform if North Korea continues to progress in its nuclear and submarine-launched ballistic missile program. Now how the US would react to a South Korea that decides to become a nuclear power is a whole other story. The inclusion of this type of weapon on a modern AIP –capable diesel-electric submarine is also just another step that further blurs the lines in capability between nuclear and these ever more capable conventionally powered boats.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Special Operations Command is totally bullish on its MRZR tactical all-terrain vehicles . 2,000 of these hardy little buggies were ordered in 2015 to supplement a smaller fleet. Now they are popping up in some of the most dangerous places on the planet—and taking on some of America’s worst enemies. Last December, MAZRs were spotted during a botched arrival of US special operators in war-torn Libya . Now they’re on the front lines in the fight against ISIS in Iraq, near the sacked city of Mosul. In the photo above, the MAZRs look like they have been used frequently by their special forces operators, with some visible ad-hoc modifications. Most notably an FGM-148 Javelin missile system, which you can see on the ground behind the closest MAZR. A bunch of Javelin missile containers, most seemingly empty, are strewn in its rear cargo basket. Yunus Keles/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The special forces operators, likely Green Berets, are wearing the same uniforms as the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters they are there to “train and advise.” By all appearances, these guys are doing far more than that, and slinging $75,000 missiles—well, $200,000 with the reusable targeting unit—certainly has little to do with “training and advising.” Bringing the Javelin, with its multiple attack modes, relatively long-range and thermal optics targeting system, to the fight alongside the Kurds is like bringing an F-22 to an airshow in the 1960s. Yunus Keles/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The Peshmerga fighters are seen with light machine guns, dated anti-aircraft artillery cannons (which are being used for direct fire), light artillery, mortars, some antique T-54/55 tanks and a spattering of Humvees and Toyota SUVs. It’s not exactly a cutting-edge ground force. Yunus Keles/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The Javelin, on the other hand, offers a hard-hitting precision engagement capability without having to field modern armor or attack helicopters. Operated by American special forces on the front lines, the Javelin gives the Peshmerga force an asymmetric advantage. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Tv7sBh5aMv0 Special forces in unarmored all-terrain buggies loaded with hi-tech Javelin missiles to support a far less equipped indigenous force is the epitome of the “small footprint, big punch” concept that these unique warriors bring to the table. Paired with strategy and tactics consulting, training and the ability to call in precision fire-support—not to mention each operator’s own combat capabilities—and you have yourself a massive force multiplier. Still, the idea that the Obama Administration claims our troops are not in a combat role in Iraq, even after the evidence has shown just the opposite, and not just regarding special forces , is a political scam that needs to come to an end. Ideally, this would also come with a much needed change in strategy —an unlikely pivot until a new President is sitting in the Oval Office. Yunus Keles/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Images of US special forces operating in Syria and Iraq have created some controversy. Recently, American soldiers were photographed wearing a YPJ patch. Of course, when a soldier embeds with an indigenous military force, the Green Beret’s winning playbook oten involves wearing local garb, but the YPJ is the all female Kurdish militant force , part of the Kurdish Worker’s Party (PKK). The PKK is Turkey’s bitter enemy , one classifed as a terror organization by the Turks as well as the United States. They are also the most effective anti-ISIS fighters on the planet. Obviously, Turkey is incredibly pissed that a fellow NATO member state’s top-tier special forces have a soldier rolling around in Syria with a big YPJ patch on his arm—and so are US commanders. The Army’s spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve in Baghdad, Colonel Steve Warren, stated : “Wearing those patches was unauthorized and inappropriate and corrective action has been taken. We have communicated as much to NATO ally Turkey.” DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP/Getty Images The soldier wearing the patch was not punished apparently, but obviously his symbol of solidarity was not worth the potential geopolitical ramifications, at least in the eyes of US commanders. The reality is that YPJ and YPG units are absolutely key players in the Syrian Democratic Force which is made up of a consortium of local groups of various religious backgrounds, all aimed at taking out ISIS. This umbrella group, that the US is directly backing, including with precision air strikes, is now fighting north of the ISIS capital of Raqqa, with their eyes set on liberating the city and crushing ISIS’s claim on a Caliphate once and for all. And yes, there are almost certainly US special operators fighting right alongside them. So patches are not ok, but supplying arms to, backing with airstrikes and even having America’s top warriors fighting alongside YPJ fighters is. Talk about one tangled web.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 26, 2016",China Will Send Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarines Into The Pacific: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With the US announcement that it will begin supplying weapons to Vietnam , rising tensions on the South China Sea , and an almost certain deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea , it was nearly a certainty that China was going to make a big strategic move. Now, according to a report by the The Guardian , China is poised to do just that by sending their Jin class boomers on nuclear deterrent patrols in the Pacific for the very first time. This comes as the US intelligence services have also predicted that such a patrol would occur this year There is no doubt that China, which has long acted as a reluctant nuclear player, has become much more militarily assertive over the last decade. Its love for ballistic missiles has also blossomed along with its extra-territorial ambitions, with a seemingly constant flow of new missile types and capabilities being developed for and fielded by PLA forces . These medium-range and short-range ballistic missile systems, which include anti-ship ballistic missiles ( DF-21D ), have been largely focused on imposing a regional area-denial and anti-access defensive strategy . A much smaller arsenal of ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMS) of widely varying capabilities ( DF-4 , DF-5 , DF-31 , DF-41 ) makes up the backbone of China’s nuclear deterrent. With this in mind, ranging their ballistic missile submarines far to the east into the Pacific represents a much more threatening strategic capability than anything Beijing has at its fingertips today. China’s quartet of Type 94 Jin class submarines have been viewed as more of a sea-based deterrent development program than a fully operational capability. They have gone on sporadic regional patrols but these were likely developmental in nature and the boats were most likely unarmed—or at least not fully armed—at the time. Now, if this report is accurate, it would seem that the Jin class and its JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (each boat carries 12) are ready to conduct an operational long-range deterrent patrol. Such a move will drastically up the ante when it comes to China’s first and second nuclear strike capabilities. Ranges of China's ballistic missiles., Public Domain via Wikicommons In executing a long-range patrol, the Jin class submarine would leave the relatively crowded and highly surveyed waters of the South China Sea. Although this means it will be operating far from its home at the massive Yulin Naval Base located on Hainan island, a factor that will increase operational risk, its ability to hide in vastness of the Pacific will lend credibility to China’s undersea nuclear strike mission. It would also provide far better survivability should hostilities break out, and most importantly, it would be far closer to targets on the American mainland. Obviously, monitoring these submarine patrols will be an absolute priority of the US and its allies in the region, a requirement that will only stretch the US Navy’s limited nuclear fast-attack submarine force even more . The Jin class is thought to be nowhere near as quiet as other modern boomers, but that doesn’t mean it can’t disappear—especially in the vastness of the Pacific. At the very least, these boats will tie up incredibly valuable US Navy resources anytime they are on patrol. China is supposedly slated to receive five Jin class boats in all. This should give them the ability to keep one to two of these boomers on patrol at any given time, and possibly surge a third during times of heightened tensions. Navy Office of Legislative Affairs via Wikicommons There are rumors that a follow-on boomer development project with significant improvements in acoustic signature and weapons carrying capability is already underway in China. This new design, dubbed the Type 096 will likely present a much more challenging target for American and allied forces to keep tabs on if it becomes operational. It has taken decades for China to get to this point in its ballistic missile submarine program. Now with territorial disputes in the South China Sea and in the East China Sea , where American allies and America itself are directly opposing China’s will, and the increase in anti-ballistic missile systems in the region, such a change in Beijing’s nuclear posture is almost predictable. This is especially true considering China’s nuclear deterrent is relatively tiny (about 300 warheads) and almost entirely land-based, making it vulnerable to preemptive attack. This strategic vulnerability only increases the necessity of a second-strike nuclear capability, which boomers provide. China could also move to increase its nuclear weapons stockpile in the near future and is already working to deploy their land-based ICBMs in more creative and survivable ways to avoid destruction during a first-strike scenario. Russia is also executing a similar strategy . Whether a Jin class boat goes on a long-range deterrent patrol today or a year from now, clearly China is reacting militarily to increasingly hostile relations with the US and its regional allies. The unsettling thing is that with more nuclear weapons forward deployed, the chances for mistakes and accidents only increase. Although China is a much more rational actor, and its submarine technology far more mature than, say, North Korea’s , operational nuclear ballistic missile submarine patrols are still a relatively new concept for the People’s Liberation Army Navy, and that makes the thought of its boomers prowling the Pacific especially concerning.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 5, 2019",The AH-64 Apache Will Get A Laser Cannon To Play With This Summer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What is scarier than an Apache attack helicopter? One with a laser weapon strapped to its stub wings. Special Operations Command and the US Army is slated to test just that this summer in an effort to see how such a weapon could be integrated onto the world’s deadliest attack helicopter. Raytheon is currently working with the Army’s Apache program office to develop the podded laser for testing. According to National Defense Magazine , Colonel John Vannoy, who heads Special Operations Command’s rotary wing program office, said the following at a recent industry conference concerning this new “Laser Apache” initiative: “There is absolutely a niche I believe for use of directed energy weapons… The lens we are looking at this through right now is: ‘Is it feasible to do this?’ We’re not at the point where we’ve laid out a business case to advance it… We really want to understand the environment on the wing, the beam quality we can get off the wing and the ability to beam steer and keep power on a target.” Now that solid-state lasers are shrinking drastically in size and increasing in power , they’re a great match for rotary-wing aircraft. Attack helicopters typically fight close to their targets—a good thing considering the current energy and atmospheric dispersion limitations of laser weaponry—and they offer a stable platform from which to fire lasers. Modern attack helicopters are all about precision engagement capabilities. Unless you want a fairly large explosion that will obliterate a small building or a few vehicles, the best weapons available to Apache crews are the helicopter’s 30mm cannon and the recent addition of laser-guided rockets . Yet even these surgical weapons, with their highly-localized effects on the battlefield, still use high-explosives to make a big bang; if you want to be extremely precise with almost no chance of collateral damage, lasers are the way to go. If you want a tactical aircraft fighting in a combat zone to destroy a piece of equipment, like a power generator, but without destroying the structure it’s attached to, or to disable a vehicle without killing anyone standing around it, you’re out of luck unless you have a laser. With this in mind, there’s a clear and highly relevant requirement for a weapon that can accomplish such feats, a requirement as yet unfulfilled. US Army Special Operations Command is already all over the great laser revolution. They’re already working on fielding a laser weapon, operationally, aboard an AC-130 gunship by the turn of the decade , a move that will give the lumbering, cannon-shell-slinging aircraft the ability to engage targets with almost no chance of causing harm to anything, or anyone, but its intended target. Again, think about the ability to target a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, on a street without hurting other innocent bystanders going about their business just yards away. Being cooked by an invisible laser beam over the span of a few seconds would be a pretty nasty way for even a bad guy to go, but at least those close by would not have to be sacrificed in the process. If the “Laser Apache” concept proves to be workable this summer, the Army could move rapidly to procure an operational laser weapon system for its Apache fleet. At the very least, SOCOM could even push the capability forward on its own. But really, if these tests are a success, it could open up a whole new avenue for “plug-and-play” laser weaponry—one where the capability, in a modular form, could be applied to a wide array of helicopters and unmanned systems. And that’s a very exciting—or ridiculously terrifying—thought. It all depends on which side of the laser you’re on.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A pair of Super Hornets collided in mid-air while training over waters about 25 miles from North Carolina’s Oregon Inlet. The incident was reported to the Coast Guard around 10:30AM local time and not long after a Coast Guard MH-60T Jayhawk plucked two of the crew from the water and took them to the hospital. A nearby commercial fishing vessel, the Jamie, grabbed the other two officers who were floating in the Atlantic. A Jayhawk then went to pick up the aircrew from the fishing boat and ferried them to the hospital as well. Both aircrews were seen being dropped off at North Sentara General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia and appeared to be in good condition . A spokesman for the Coast Guard told local NBC affiliate WCNC that all four crew were in high spirits and that “it was a textbook rescue. We are so happy we can bring these Navy service members back to their families.” The foxtrot model Super Hornets belonged to VFA-211 “Checkmates.”  The squadron is based at the Navy’s master fighter jet base, Naval Air Station Oceana, located in Norfolk, Virginia. It is never good losing a $65 million dollar jet, especially two of them at the same time. Considering the Navy’s looming fighter gap , it will only make the situation worse. But the fact that both crews got out seemingly unscathed is obviously far more important and absolutely fantastic news.

Even SNL has piled on, lampooning the actor in brilliant fashion . After  a few straight-to-video releases, Cage is starring in USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage, a historical film that pays tribute to the sailors involved in the horrific sinking of the ship during World War II. Nobody expected the movie to be a high-budget affair, and production was plagued by appropriately disastrous events , but now we have a long preview to watch in judgement. What do we see? The production looks sparse, the CGI approaching video-game quality, and Cage seems to be holding back some of his lesser actorly impulses. Overall, it doesn’t look that horrible—I think . Then again, the trailer is embroidered with saccharine phrases—”Ground breaking, emotional, riveting, gripping, intense, epic, historic, stunning, brilliant and powerful”—with no attribution.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 1, 2016",Did ISIS Really Take Out A Squadron Of Russian Attack Helicopters At A Remote Airfield In Central Syria?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Syrian government’s air base between Homs and the ancient city of Palmyra appears to have been partially destroyed. The base has become a key forward operating location for both Russian and Syrian forces as they have pushed east to take the fight to the Islamic State. Stratfor has obtained satellite imagery that clearly shows the spots where Russia’s attack helicopters once sat are now blackened smear marks on the base’s parking apron. The same can be said for a nearby supply depot. The area was once packed with supply trucks, supposedly packed with munitions, now it looks like an ash tray. It would seem that the attack came via indirect fire, and there are enough of Grad rockets floating around Syria at the moment to believe that ISIS could have used the artillery to attack targets it couldn’t otherwise reach with infantry. The base is known to be used by Syrian attack jets, which have been attacking ISIS targets to the east on a regular basis. These aircraft, and Russia’s attack helicopters, were key factors in booting the Islamic State from Palmyra late last March. The base is also along a key supply route connecting the country’s west and east, where ISIS continues to rule. These factors make it a very big target on the Islamic State’s hit list. In fact, the base has been under constant attack over the last couple of years, with ISIS throwing some of its most elaborate vehicle-borne improvised explosives at it. Stratfor states that ISIS claims to have attacked the base on May 14, taking out Russian attack helicopters and nearly two dozen ammunition trucks. Assad’s forces have since said that an accident occurred on the base, resulting in what appears to be a massive explosive chain reaction. Stratfor maintains that the attack claim by ISIS is valid, but US officials say that is not the case and that it is more likely that something like a fuel truck explosion was the culprit. Meanwhile, Russia is pushing off the report as ISIS propaganda, saying the imagery is old and depicts damage to the base from prior attacks that occurred months ago and that all their helicopters are accounted for. The damaged objects and areas shown in the Stratfor satellite imagery are within a about a quarter-mile radius of one another, which is not a large distance in airfield terms. With this in mind, both theories seem possible, and maybe parts of both of them are true. It could be that a single artillery shell or rocket landed on just the right object to set off a devastating series of explosions and fires. Even a suicide bomber could have done such a deed once they infiltrated the sprawling base. Then again, forward arming and refueling operations can be a dangerous business, especially in very austere war zone conditions. Yet a rocket or artillery barrage seems like as good of an explanation as any for the destruction, although the accuracy of what are fairly inaccurate systems seems to have been a bit uncanny in this case. Still,  there is one piece of evidence that may lend itself to this theory. The imagery provided by Stratfor shows that an abandoned MiG-25 Foxtbat that has been parked in the same place at the airfield for years was also damaged. It appears that its right wing trailing edge took a direct hit, and there are scorched marks below it that look like the remnants of small to medium caliber artillery or rocket detonation. It is hard to believe that this type of damage was caused by falling embers or shrapnel from a blast a quarter mile away.  In fact, if the imagery were shown to me without the backstory, it looks more like an attack using precision guided munitions than some artillery barrage. So what do you think occurred here? Did ISIS get the best of Russia and Assad’s forces? Or was it an accident in what looks like an accident prone operating location? Tell us below.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 6, 2016","Surprise, Surprise! The USAF Can’t Afford Its Fighter Fleet Past 2021","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It is a fact that I have been harping on for many years. The USAF’s fighter procurement and operational ambitions are far out of whack with the flying force’s cold hard budgetary reality. Nearly everything has been bet on the F-35 in the fighter department, an aircraft that costs $100 million a pop, not including massive development and infrastructure costs, and the most generous estimates put its per flight hour cost at nearly double that of the jets it is supposed to replace. In fact, some estimates grow as large as nearly four and a half times that number. Then you have the USAF’s almost comical lust for yet another super fighter, the notional 6th generation fighter project dubbed the F-X program , even though they cannot afford the one they have already developed. These high-ticket tactical combat jet programs come as the Air Force struggles to upgrade its rapidly aging legacy fighters that remain the backbone of its fighter force. DoD The F-16 in particular is in need of substantial investment and recapitalization as its life cycle has greatly extended due to incessant delays in the F-35 program. Funding for these absolutely necessary upgrades remains murky at best. Meanwhile, the USAF continues its illogical push to divest itself entirely of its most cost effective and relevant warplane, A-10 Warthog. If the USAF gets its way, by early next decade the A-10 will be totally gone from the USAF’s inventory . This is a whole other issue onto itself, but tossing out nearly 300 of your most affordable and relevant tactical jet aircraft sure does not help the looming tactical jet shortfall and saves little money in the process. USAF The fact is the Air Force cannot have it all and then some (such as a new stealth bomber). They have to prioritize and come up with a force mix that is not just capable and flexible, but affordable. Such an exercise in rationalization is nothing new. During the Cold War, a time of arguably greater strategic stakes than anything we are experiencing today, the USAF did not pursue an all gold-plated fighter fleet because they simply could not afford to do so. Instead a high-low capability mix strategy was put in place. This strategy provided high-end capabilities in smaller numbers, while retaining an ample capacity of less capable but still highly relevant assets. When paired together with tailored tactics they were more than the sum of their parts. USAF In the end, this strategy was good enough to win the Cold War, yet somehow, in an era dominated not primarily by peer state threats but counter-insurgency and counter-terror operations, the USAF has opted to put in place a much more rigid and fiscally unsustainable procurement strategy for its tactical aircraft fleet. This strategy can be described as a high-very high capability mix, which sounds great, and is awesome for defense contractors, the beltway pork machine, and will land many generals cushy careers in the private defense sector, but is glaringly unsustainable. Now, a report from the Pentagon itself , highlighted by Defensenews.com , describes exactly this situation. What is most interesting is that in the report the USAF’s fighter budget doesn’t tank in some far-off future date. Not even close, by just 2021 there will not be enough funding to support the USAF’s current fighter plan. Yes, you read that right, in just five years, the USAF’s tactical fighter master plan is bankrupt. The report states: “The Air Force has insufficient resources to maintain the FY2016 NDAA mandated number of fighter aircraft (1900) beyond the 2017-2021 FYDP. At the current resource levels, projected aircraft service life divestiture outpaces procurement. This will substantially drop the total number of combat coded fighters and fighter squadrons through the 2022-2026FYDP. The inventory drop will continue until it reaches its lowest level in 2031.” F-35.com The reality is that the USAF’s plan to procure 1763 F-35As, a number that Lockheed Martin has conveniently warned against dropping in an effort to supposedly keep unit costs down, will never happen. There is simply not enough money to procure and sustain this force. Even the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee has stated as much. Luckily, this slow train wreck of a master fighter procurement and fleet management plan is not the only option for the USAF, F-35 included or not. Far from it actually.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 10, 2016",US Lifts Ban On Arms Sales To Vietnam Amid Turmoil In The South China Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a move that will only escalate tensions in and around the already very tense South China Sea, the Obama Administration has lifted a 50 year long ban on exporting weapons and military equipment to Vietnam. The once bitter foes have enjoyed ever tightening ties over the last decade, as common strategic and trade interests have superseded a war-torn history. AP The announcement was made during a news conference hosted by both President Obama and Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang. Almost laughably, Obama noted that the move was not in response to China’s growing military might and their wholesale claims on the South China Sea. A strategy China has backed militarily with an island building campaign that is tipping the balance of power in the region. Vietnam’s weapons shopping list is extensive, and opening a whole new market for American arms sales is a rare shot in the arm for US defense contractors. Missiles, radars, maritime patrol aircraft, aerial transports and a series of naval assets are at the top of this list which could even include advanced fighter aircraft in the not so distant future. Historically, Vietnam’s primary source for advanced weaponry has been Russia, and although the majority of Vietnam’s arsenal is made up of Cold War-era legacy equipment, Hanoi is accelerating its military modernization. Vietnam’s air arm has acquired the Su-30MK2 advanced Flanker derivative in recent years, and their navy has procured improved Kilo class diesel-electric submarines and modern Gepard class frigates, all of which are of Russian origin. Additionally, modern Russian anti-ship missiles outfit Vietnam’s surface warships and submarines, with 3M-54 Klub missiles being carried by their Kilo class submarines. The Gepard class frigates are equipped with Kh-35 Uran-E anti-ships missiles produced locally under license, and they can also launch a land-attack variant of the missile. Vietnam has also ordered Russia’s advanced Bastion-P coastal defense systems , which fire the supersonic P-800 Oniks anti-ship missile . These fairly advanced anti-ship weapons clearly underline Vietnam’s increasing focus on protecting its territorial claims in the South China Sea. Two of Vietnam's Gepard class frigates are seen docked in the Phillipinesr , AP China is familiar with nearly all these Russian weapons and has also received similar imports. Moving toward procuring US systems could give Vietnam a tactical edge over its overwhelmingly powerful regional competitor. It could also bring Vietnam even closer to America’s foreign policy orbit, opening up a whole new level of military cooperation between the two militaries . It is also likely that Vietnam will soon turn toward the US for higher-end maritime patrol capabilities. This could come in the form of an export version of the hugely successful P-8 Poseidon , refurbished P-3 Orions, or even surplus and revamped S-3 Vikings , which would be uniquely suited for Vietnam’s regional interests. The Obama Administration has pursued commonality among key allies when it comes to weapons systems (P-8, F-35 etc) as a foreign policy tool in itself. Considering Australia and India will both be flying the P-8 alongside the US in the region , Vietnam may get the opportunity to join this elite club. Beyond the coastal patrol craft that President Obama mentioned in his statement, US warship designs, such as the Littoral Combat Ship and National Security Cutter (or one of its enticing military derivatives) could end up in Vietnam’s naval arsenal in the coming years. Naval confrontations between China and Vietnam have hit a crescendo, and just last week China instituted a ban on fishing in the South China Sea , stating that they would stop any vessel that it sees doing so. This comes as ship-to-ship ramming and vessel seizures have become the norm in the contested but highly strategic and resource-rich waterway. The truth is that beyond China’s dizzying man-made island outpost building campaign, the country has been spending huge sums of money on vessels and weaponry that are acutely aimed at enforcing their claims on nearly the entirety of the South China Sea. Case in point their massive new “coast guard” cutters , sea-basing ships , and their importing and now indigenous construction of the monstrous Zubr class hovercraft . With all this in mind, Vietnam really doesn’t have much of a choice but to increase ties and military cooperation with the US, as they stand no chance of unilaterally defending their claims militarily against China, should it ever come to that. As for China, they seem nonplussed with this revelation, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying stating : “As a neighboring country, we would be happy to see Vietnam develop normal and friendly cooperative relationships with all other countries, including the United States… And we hope those normal and friendly relationships are conducive to regional stability and development.” This sounds well and good, but surely any major development that will challenge China’s overt military dominance in the region is not a welcome in Beijing’s eyes. Especially one in which the US was a major partner. Vietnamese soldiers on the march., AP Now we will have to wait for some type of military reaction from China. In the last two weeks they have executed a dangerous intercept on an America spy plane operating along the Chinese border in the northern portion of the South China Sea , and launched fighters on a US destroyer that was performing a freedom of navigation drill within the supposed territorial waters of their man-made island outposts. With this most recent news, it is likely China will signal an increased military presence in the region. This could come in the form of more patrols off Vietnam’s coast, the announcement of war games in the area, or the further weaponization of their man-made islands.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 7, 2018",The Navy Is Getting A Video Pod To Record Russian And Chinese Jets Making Unsafe Intercepts,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports of “unsafe” intercepts have become headline staples over the past couple years. The reawakening of the Russian Bear and a more territorial China has led to a drastic increase in reckless aerial intercepts. They often include the intercepting fighter flying ridiculously close the “visiting” aircraft , or even doing acrobatics over and around it . They bring a real danger to the safety of the aircrews, and a mishap could spark an international incident (see the Hainan Island Incident ) and a rapid military escalation. After these intercepts, one side— almost always the US or its allies —file a formal diplomatic protest, and headlines are made. Often, a still image of a menacing-looking Su-27, or other fighter, displaying a belly bristling with missiles is distributed. Yet even this is rare, the picture often stock. The Pentagon, which has been very quick to post video of provocative military acts , is now working to catch these unsafe intercepts on camera and in spectacular fashion. The Naval Research Laboratory has built a pod to do just that. Dubbed the Common Airborne Situational Awareness (CASA) pod, the unit is made up of the housing of a ALQ-167 electronic warfare training pod that has been adapted with apertures for multiple wide-angle HD video and still cameras and the ability to record and transmit the imagery collected by these cameras in real-time. The idea is that this new pod can record an unsafe intercept in great detail from every angle, and that the footage recorded from it will likely be used for public release as well as intelligence gathering purposes. Breakingdefense.com reports that the pod came to be under a Urgent Operational Needs requirement from the Navy’s Pacific Command. It seems like PACOM’s crystal ball was especially clear when it came to ordering this pod and getting it ready for deployment in quick order, as just last week a Navy EP-3E Aries II spy plane , one of America’s most sensitive intelligence gathering assets, was intercepted off of Hainan Island in a very aggressive manner. A pair of J-11 Flanker derivatives came within 50 feet of the lumbering EP-3E during the incident. Considering the EP-3E’s wingspan is just shy of 100 feet, and the J-11’s is just shy of 50 feet, flying less than 50 feet of the EP-3E is too close for comfort. Almost making a case for the pod themselves, China has denied the details of the event put forward by the US Navy, with officials stating that the jets “kept a safe distance throughout, without taking any dangerous actions.” This incident came following escalating tensions in the South China Sea, with China launching fighters from its new island outpost at Fiery Cross Reef against a US destroyer for the first time. China also denied the US supercarrier USS John C. Stennis a port visit to Hong Kong. Still, the aggressive intercept is a bad sign when it comes to US-Chinese military tensions in the region. Just last September, during China’s president Xi Jinping’s state visit to the Washington DC, clear rules and procedures were supposedly hammered out and agreed upon by both countries to make sure intercepts like the one described above don’t happen. Now it appears that this rule book is being thrown out the door. The CASA pod has already been successfully tested using a P-3 as a surrogate and a Air National Guard F-16 as an interceptor and could be deployed to the fleet at any time. As a side note, this pod seems to open up a whole new realm of possibilities when it comes to military aviation video. The ALQ-167 can fly at high-speed on fighter jets, and it is a regular fixture on the Navy’s adversary support aircraft, such as VFC-12’s F/A-18s and contracted ATAC F-21 Kfirs and Phoenix Air Learjets . Even NSAWCs F-16s have been seen toting these electronic warfare pods as of late. With this in mind, strapping one of these to a Navy fighter during low-level training flights, basic fighter maneuvers (BFM aka dogfights) or bombing and strafing runs would bring Hollywood-quality aerial footage from perspectives we have never seen before. So let’s hope eventually the Navy sends one of these things around the fast-jet fleet, its footage could be one hell of a recruiting tool. In the meantime, unless Russia and China are on their best behavior, expect to see some incredible, if not somewhat terrifying real-world footage of what life can be like along the front lines of America’s aerial surveillance apparatus.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Afghanistan struggles to build up its aerial attack capability, it seems like less is more for the embattled country’s air arm. Case in point: their MD530F Cayuse Warrior ( AKA Little Bird in the American spec-ops world ) light air support helicopters. The type’s origins can be traced back to the Vietnam era OH-6 “Loach” scout helicopter . Today, the design is offered in various configurations featuring a wide range of levels of advancement. This includes commercial models that offer light utility capabilities up to the potent and technology-packed AH-6i , the most capable military variant that’s getting good traction on the export market. Afghanistan’s relatively simple MD530F Cayuse Warrior model falls somewhere in between. It’s more gunship than anti-tank, missile-slinging night fighter, and that’s probably a good thing considering Afghanistan’s challenges when it comes to standing up its air arm with high-tech equipment. Still, these aircraft have their critics, some of which are within Afghanistan’s air arm itself. Afghanistan’s MD530s have their clear limitations, including anemic hot and high performance, literally no armor or defense aids, and rudimentary weapons and sensors. And, yes, they may be yet another symptom of the Pentagon’s total ineptitude and nearsightedness when it comes to wanting to leave ongoing insurgencies while not leaving behind one of the most important factors in keeping that insurgency at bay, that being plentiful precision air support and surveillance capacity . But still, these helicopters are simple, affordable, and rugged, and in most situations can provide surgical air support for indigenous troops in contact. Albeit it does take a brave pilot to employ them as a weapon system in the face of heavy enemy ground fire. Additionally, like the OH-6’s entire lineage, they’re very nimble, as the video below, showing Afghanistan’s MD530Fs executing gunnery training, demonstrates: Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

When it arrives at its assigned target area, the wing kit jettisons the torpedo, with a parachute gently lowering it into the water. Once in the water, the Mark 54 torpedo then activates to autonomously hunt for and kill a submarine—just as it would if it were dropped close to the target directly by a launch aircraft or ship. Without the HAAWC kit, a Mark 54 Torpedo has to be dropped from an aircraft at low altitude, usually no higher than 100 feet. As such, the concept represents a massive increase in flexibility when it comes to engagement tactics and capabilities for aerial anti-submarine warfare platforms, and especially for the Navy’s all-star export success and flying Swiss Army knife, the P-8 Poseidon . It’s likely that HAAWC will also be outfitted with a data-link, so that mid-course targeting updates and even retargeting can be provided while the weapon makes its way to the target area. During a dynamic engagement, where multiple platforms are detecting multiple sub-surface contacts in the same region as a HAAWC-armed P-8, it will be highly beneficial to be able to direct these weapons after letting them loose. Not only will updated targeting coordinates increase their probability of killing a submarine, but it will allow weapon system officers aboard the P-8 to make the best out of a limited number of available weapons by targeting the highest-priority targets first—even if the priority list changes after the weapon’s release. HAAWC, and the standoff attack range that it provides, also allows the P-8 and other ASW aircraft to go after subsurface targets without exposing themselves to potential anti-air defenses that may overlap with the position of the submarine, or submarine operating area, being targeted. https://youtube.com/watch?v=eywTQDIlSJg This kit also makes it so a P-8 does not need to take the time to descend low over the ocean, from a perch that can be as high as 30,000 feet, to make an attack. When the multirole P-8 descends for a traditional attack run, other missions, such as radar or signals intelligence, have to be aborted temporarily or are significantly degraded. Adding the new kit also means that the P-8 won’t have to expose itself low and slow, a vulnerable place to be for any combat aircraft. This HAAWC kit will also allow the P-8 to work as a kind of arsenal ship for other anti-submarine platforms—like ships, helicopters, and even friendly submarines—by punching off torpedoes at long ranges on demand, without even having detected the target itself. Instead, the P-8 can use “third-party” targeting info from these sources to direct the winged torpedoes on their way. The system could also lead to the ability to launch disposable, sub-hunting underwater drones from relatively long ranges, or even a sonobuoy dispenser that will allow P-8s to rapidly detect and track submarines over a wide area while still remaining at high altitude, and in a centralized location. The HAAWC concept is actually not all that unique. Extended-range winged smart weapon kits are emerging as an increasingly relevant capability. The JDAM-ER and WCMD-ER give an alternative to the more expensive, purpose-built, winged glide weapons like the AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) and GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb . Considering that America’s potential enemies are increasingly putting in place anti-access/area-denial strategies , the ability to stand off at range in order to attack land and sea targets is more relevant than ever. The prosecution of subsurface targets is no different, although it has received less attention in recent decades than have weapons focused on striking ground targets. That’s all changing, and HAAWC is a perfect example of that fact. Another potential application for the HAAWC is to combine it with the Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) system that’s already designed to attach to the Mark 54 torpedo. This would give surface combatants, including US cruisers and destroyers already equipped with the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS), dozens of extra miles of engagement range against hostile submarines as compared to the existing wingless, rocket-assisted-only ASROC system. Such an application would mean that extra distance between the launch ship and the targeted enemy submarine being could be realized, and the ability to attack subsurface targets while remaining outside the range of the enemy’s core anti-ship defenses would become a more realistic possibility. An ASROC is fired via an Arleigh Burke class destroyer's Mk41 vertical launch system.r , USN The HAAWC system could also be adapted for use by shore-based launchers and could provide a flexible and comparatively affordable coastal defense against prowling submarines. Bringing air-launched weapons into the surface-to-surface arena is an increasingly popular concept; most notably, the Small Diameter Bomb is being adapted by Boeing and SAAB to be launched from the ground to hit time-sensitive targets and provide emergency close-air support over ranges approaching 100 miles. By adapting HAAWC in a similar way, countries could put enemy submarines at risk along their entire coastline without having to field throngs of aircraft or patrol craft capable of employing torpedoes or depth charges. With the subsurface threat expanding rapidly around the globe , any sort of force-multiplier like HAAWC is a welcome, if not absolutely necessary, development. The P-8 already has a bristling quiver of capabilities that includes sea control, electronic intelligence gathering, over-water and over-land advanced radar surveillance , mining, networking and data fusion , surface strikes, and of course, anti-submarine warfare, among others. Yet the potential addition of HAAWC to its weapons menu will drastically elevate the jet’s sub-killing capability in a much needed way. No matter how capable an aircraft is, it can only be in one place, and affect the battlfield around that one place, at any given time. HAAWC dramatically expands the P-8s lethal reach from that “one place,” and it could lead to a whole new approach when it comes to getting more sub-sea kinetic-kill coverage out of fewer anti-submarine warfare platforms.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday morning, a B-52H home-based out of Minot AFB in North Dakota crashed along the flightline at Andersen AFB in Guam . Pictures from the scene show the aircraft broken and in flames. Amazingly, all the aircraft’s six crew members were able to get out of the aircraft unscathed before it succumbed to the flames. The cause of the crash is unclear, but it’s not the first time a heavy bomber was lost while temporarily stationed at Guam as part of the ongoing scheduled rotation of nuclear-capable bombers to the Pacific stronghold . B-52s parked along Andersen AFB's seemingly endless dispersals., USAF In 2008, a B-52H went down in waters near the island during a training flight that was supposed to be capped by a flyover for the local celebration of Liberation Day. All six crew on-board “RAIDR 21” were killed. The crash was ruled to have been caused by a malfunctioning trim system. That same year, one of the USAF’s 21 B-2 Spirits crashed spectacularly during on takeoff [see video below]. Both pilots ejected from the aircraft before it plummeted to the ground between Andersen Air Force Base’s runways. The crash was caused by a malfunctioning air data sensor. Another near-loss of a B-2 forward deployed to Guam came in February of 2010 when one of the stealth bombers ignited into flame as it was preparing to takeoff. The damage was so bad that it took a total of four years to return the jet to the fleet. A portion of this work was executed on-site at Andersen AFB just so the striken jet could limp back to Palmdale, California for more extensive repairs. The whole ordeal is brilliantly recounted in this Los Angeles Times piece . The loss of another B-52H for USAF comes at a time when the antique platform is more relevant than ever. The type is currently fighting ISIS over in Iraq and Syria and receiving major upgrades that will make it more effective than ever on the modern battlefield . Even more extensive upgrades may also be in the works for BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker) as the Pentagon pursues an “arsenal ship” as part of its Third Offset strategy. There are currently 76 B-52s in active service. Recently, one of the 13 B-52Hs in regenerative storage at the Pentagon’s boneyard in Arizona (AMARG) was restored to flying condition to replace a B-52H that burned on the ramp at Barksdale AFB due to an electrical fire. This was the first time a B-52H was brought back from the boneyard after long-term storage. After yesterday’s loss, the Pentagon may reanimate another. B-52s taxi along one of Andersen AFB's aprons., USAF The B-52H fleet, which were all built in the early 1960s, is slated to serve into the middle of the century, and likely beyond that, at which time the aircraft design will be well over a century old.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 2, 2020",Trump Says He Will Talk Directly With North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Donald Trump’s policy positions have been viewed as radical, absurd, or just downright logical, depending on who you ask. Above all, it seems the self-proclaimed master deal-maker wants to be Negotiator In Chief as much as Commander In Chief. He has even set his sights on the possibility of single-handedly bringing peace to the Middle East , as it would be the “toughest deal ever made.” Now, he wants to do what no President has done before: open up direct talks with North Korea’s ruler, currently the boy-tyrant Kim Jong Un. “I would speak to him, I have no problem speaking to him,” Trump recently stated to Reuters . He went on to underline how he would also put pressure on China to help ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula: “I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China…China can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call.” Trump has a unique and at times eyebrow-raising perspective when it comes to the North Korean dictator, whose rule has been defined by his relentless push for nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabilities as well as an absolutely brutal method of governance . During one of Trump’s signature campaign rallies last January, he described what seemed like tacit admiration for Kim Jong Un’s method of rule , stating: “If you look at North Korea, this guy, he’s like a maniac. OK? And you’ve got to give him credit: how many young guys, he was like 26 or 25 when his father died take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden, you know, it’s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture, and it’s a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes over, he’s the boss. It’s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. This guy doesn’t play games and we can’t play games with him. Because he really does have missiles, and he really does have nukes.” AP Regardless of Trump’s questionable views on Kim Jong Un’s methods of securing and maintaining power, it begs the question: is the idea of opening up direct talks with North Korea at the highest levels a bad thing? I say no. In fact, it would be a net positive regardless of whether such talks were successful or not. In fact, I argued this exact point five years ago, when Kim Jong Un initially came into power. The fact of the matter is that the North Koreans have had one major ask over the last decade-and-a-half of fragmented negotiations: unilateral negotiations with the United States, which they still ask for today. The US has been absolutely steadfast in not granting this single request, and it’s infuriated the North Koreans. Sure, old-school diplomatic insiders and traditional pundits will say that doing so will simply elevate the North Korean regime and lend legitimacy to Kim Jong Un’s rule. Well, guess what? Kim Jong Un is the ruler of North Korea whether you like it or not, and considering that we’ve talked to other dictators in the past, and have even subsidized their power structure , why is talking to Kim Jong Un any different? Above all, the long-standing policy toward North Korea has been a therapeutic solution at best. Now that the North Korean state is racing towards long-range nuclear ballistic missile capability and miniaturizing its nuclear warheads, the time for a change in our diplomatic strategy has clearly come. Simply sitting down with Kim Jong Un, or at least having high-level unilateral negotiations with officials from both sides, will change the game and will at the very least allow us to see if this new approach is capable of being effective or not. Going into the room with an incredibly strong package—including energy and food resources, a structured plan to open up the North Korean economy to foreign investment, illustrating what the lifting of harsh sanctions will look like for the North Koreans, and a route for normalization and reconciliation with South Korea—will provide the best shot at ending 60 years of bitter and dangerous tension. In addition, China and other nations can be a major part of this opportunity, but the US has to lead it and a President should deliver it. Doing so will mark an unprecedented and powerful diplomatic gesture, one that North Korea will know they won’t likely ever get again. If such an effort fails miserably, what’s lost? Nothing tangible. The North Koreans will spin their state-level propaganda any way they want, regardless of the outcome. They do it every day. The US will look like it’s serious about peace on the world stage, and is willing to do anything it can to see the tension on the Korean Peninsula come to an amicable end. For those who think it will embarrass the United States, I ask: how so? If we come ready to make a deal and North Korea clearly does not, we would then be more certain of their intentions than ever, and could adjust our foreign policy and military footprint accordingly. It’s not as if the world community thinks highly of North Korea as it is; if they decided to walk away, or not show up at all, they would just go back to being the dangerous, clown-like regime they were before. Finally, this proposition brings up the question of how, exactly, we as Americans view the President of the United States. Has the office become a royalty-like position, one where the king or queen does not dirty their hands with such unpleasant matters as direct peace negotiations with a bitter foe? Or does the President work for the American people to better our situation in any way possible, including using his power directly and in person to negotiate monumental deals even with our most dangerous enemies? I would like to think it’s the latter. The office was never supposed to be “above” so many tasks of state; the fact that it has become so over the years is not a welcome, or beneficial, development. As for the hardliner “we don’t talk to our enemies” crowd, usually of the neoconservative variety, Ronald Reagan directly engaged the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. The personal relationship between Reagan and Gorbachev that resulted from this approach was key to ending the most perilous standoff in the history of the world. Why is this fact selectively unaccounted for by the same folks who seem to admire Reagan’s every move? It’s not like talking to one’s enemies about a clear path to peace, while also illustrating how bad the alternative option would be in a military sense, is an ineffective geopolitical negotiating strategy. If anything, it’s proven to be the most effective in modern times. You make think Trump is a blustering fool, and he may lack critical foreign and defense policy knowledge , but on this one issue he has the right idea—one that, to be honest, is refreshing to hear. It’s time to try a new approach with Kim Jong Un’s increasingly belligerent North Korea, and entering into direct talks with the best offer we can make out of the gate, delivered by the most powerful head of state in the world, is a great way of doing just that. And no matter who the next President is, hopefully that person is not above directly participating in the country’s most critical diplomatic negotiations, nor opposed to talking with our enemies. State dinners are all fun and games, and attending major trade and policy summits among the same old peers is well and good, but putting the weight of the Presidency behind the country’s most challenging diplomatic missions would be a welcome, if not essential, development.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 16, 2016",Soldier Fires On Apache With Live Ammo During War Games At Fort Irwin,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The National Training Center, which is located at Fort Irwin in California, is the ultimate playground sandbox for the Army. Vast ranges, multiple mock cities (MOUT sites), a cutting edge tracking and combat evaluation system, austere airfields, closed airspace and even its very own resident adversary ground and air opposition force (OPFOR). All these things combine to make the NTC the ideal training ground for US and international land combat units to go to war without ever really going to war. The NTC achieves hyper-realistic training possible by using the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) , which resembles laser tag. For small arms, MILES uses a laser emitter with a barrel plug device known as a blank firing adapter (BFA), which allows blank rounds to be fired with an added margin of safety. To emphasize safety, Fort Irwin rigidly compartmentalizes live and blank ammunition. Even with these measures in place, somehow, on the morning of May 13, a soldier equipped with a MILES outfitted rifle fired on an AH-64 Apache with live ammunition. Once it was realized that the soldier was firing live rounds, the exercise was halted and the Apache made a precautionary emergency landing. Army Times reports that the Apache, which is designed to shrug-off small arms hits, had about four impacts from the soldier’s live-fire attack but was not severely damaged. The soldier involved was from Fort Lewis and on assignment to bolster Fort Irwin’s resident 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment , which plays the opposing force role against units visiting the sprawling installation. The visiting forces at the time of the event were also from Fort Lewis, including the Apache that was inadvertently attacked and a Stryker Brigade. Investigators are trying to figure out where the live ammunition came from and how it ended up in the soldier’s rifle. Apparently, the MILES barrel plug fitted to his weapon was removed ballistically by the rounds that the soldier fired. Ken Drylie, the Army’s spokesman at Fort Irwin seemed just as flabbergasted with the situation as anyone else . “That’s the $100 question right now,” Drylie said. “That unit shouldn’t have had live ammo. It’s a really weird accident, but it’s an accident.” The mishap is making headlines at a fairly inopportune time for Fort Irwin as a high-profile episode of History Channel’s Top Gear America aired this week featuring Fort Irwin exclusively, including soldiers repeatedly firing on the hosts with MILES equipped weapons.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Soldiers Will Soon See Thermal Weapon Sight Crosshairs Projected Into Night Vision Goggles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The US Army’s next-gen night vision goggle will have wireless networking capability, allowing them to linked the thermal weapon sights carried on some soldiers’ firearms. Think of it as Bluetooth at a very deadly level. Not only will the sight crosshairs be superimposed in free-floating “augmented reality” in the goggle display, but the thermal imager’s own unique optical picture will also be integrated directly. What that means is even when soldiers are in total darkness, they won’t have to shoulder their weapon before accurately engaging a target. Instead, they can simply throw the thermal imager’s crosshairs on the the bad guy and fire off a burst. The system will be especially useful for light and medium machine gun operators, and it will greatly expand their situational awareness while increasing their ability to make quick reflexive shots in combat conditions where any efficiency can mean the difference between life and death. Even much lighter weapons, like the ultra-compact Heckler and Koch MP7s that some highly elite special forces units use , can be paired with this system to great effect. In many situations, thermal sights can see more than night vision alone. This is true especially in dense foliage, light cover, smoke, dust or adverse weather conditions and when targeting enemies at longer range. Snipers will also be able to use their cumbersome rifles in closer combat scenarios while also maintaining a large field of view and enhanced situational awareness. Paired with the proper training and tactics, it will give soldiers a clear edge over the enemy in critical situations and will provide a more seamless Predator -like heat-sensing infrared vision capability than ever before. Scout.com gives an idea of when this sci-fi like capability will be operational: “The technology, called Rapid Target Acquisition, merges two separate Army developmental efforts to engineer, deliver and combine new, upgraded night vision goggles, called Enhanced Night Vision Goggle III, or ENVG III, with next-generation thermal weapons sights—called Family of Weapons Sights – Individual, or FWS-I. The Army plans to acquire as many as 40,000 ENVG IIIs. ENVG III is being engineered to easily integrate FWS-I as soon as it is slated to be operational in 2018.” Things are moving fast in the wearable technologies and augmented reality space . Eventually, multi-spectral imaging and weapon sight fusion will be incorporated with other forms of information into the soldier’s helmet-mounted display. Superimposed digital tags showing where friendly and enemy forces are in the sky and on the surface, mapped routes, geolocation-triggered mission notes and many other things will be displayed synthetically before the average soldier’s eyes. Meanwhile, being able to snap off a burst from the hip without sacrificing precision—and being able to do it in total darkness—is right out of Hollywood action movies. The truth is this will save the lives of many friendly forces while taking many more of the enemy’s. This is especially true in urban warfare and close quarters combat, arenas of warfare notorious for degrading a technologically superior force’s edge.

Visitor pastimes like playing on Maho beach as the big jets come in for a landing, nearly grazing onlookers in the process, or holding onto the airport perimeter fence as the airliners throttle up to full-power just a few dozen feet away, have been immortalized in incredible imagery and videos splattered all over the net.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 27, 2016",Video Shows PKK Fighter Blasting A Turkish AH-1 Cobra Out Of The Sky With A Shoulder-Fired Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Both the military and political wars in Syria and Iraq have greatly complicated the fight against ISIS. Though the self-proclaimed caliphate represents a largely common foe, the threat posed by it hasn’t quelled existing conflicts in the region. One of those is the deep hatred and seemingly perpetual warfare between the Turkish Government and the Kurdish sub-faction known as Kurdish Workers Party , or more commonly as the PKK. Turkey sees the PKK as a terrorist organization and treats them as such even though they have been among the most potent anti-ISIS fighters on the battlefield. Even though Turkey formally entered the anti-ISIS coalition last year, opening up basing for US and coalition aircraft and putting its own massive aerial arsenal to work, it bombed PKK facilities and ISIS ones on the same opening night of airstrikes . US special operations soldiers are actively supporting and working with Kurdish YPG fighters , which have strong ties to the PKK . It is a tangled situation. The bloody tit-for-tat warfare between the PKK and the Turkish government has hit a new pinnacle with the video released today showing a PKK fighter shooting down a Turkish AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter with a man-portable air defense system (MANPADS). The dramatic footage shows the missile, which appears to be a Russian designed SA-7 derivative, streaking into the sky and blasting the Cobra to pieces. A day ago, PKK forces claimed responsibility for the downing of the Cobra, while Ankara claimed it was a technical failure. If a heat-seeking missile breaking an aircraft in half is seen as technical failure, that would be accurate. The introduction of MANPADS into conflicts—especially insurgencies—can dramatically level the playing field when it comes to the use of rudimentary airpower against a lightly equipped foe. This most famous occurred in Afghanistan in the 1980s, when the CIA furnished FIM-92 Stinger MANPADS to Mujahedeen getting clobbered by Russian attack helicopters and close air support jets. The introduction of this single weapon system to the conflict turned the war against Russia and brought about its defeat—a move that helped speed the end of the Cold War. MANPADS also were prominently used recently in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists swatted Ukrainian aircraft from the sky . Even Russia’s use of airpower in Syria was curtailed by the eventual introduction of MANPADS into the conflict via Arab Gulf States that have actively backed Syrian rebel forces . This could have been a serious factor in Russia pulling its fixed-wing combat jets, which are poorly suited for defending against MANPADS attacks, out of Syria and focusing its use of attack helicopters to support Syrian Army operations against ISIS held territory in the east. https://youtube.com/watch?v=MPbAWVML48Q This video is a stark illustration of just how important modern automatic missile launch detection and countermeasure systems are on military aircraft. There is very little time for a pilot to react to a MANPAD—if he sees it coming at all. Automated launch detection systems and the dispensing of flares and other IR decoys are considered standard technology on low-flying American combat aircraft and vulnerable transports. Directed energy countermeasures are also now widespread on these aircraft . These systems use missile launch detectors for cuing, after which a small turreted laser emitter locks onto the incoming missile and fires a blinding laser light into its seeker sending it astray. Similar systems have also been built for the civilian market to defend against terrorist MANPADS attacks . Russia is just now attempting to catch up with this technology with their more cumbersome President S system that is slowly making its way onto its most advanced attack helicopter and VIP helicopter fleets . It is unclear if the introduction of MANPADS into the Turkish-PKK conflict will become widespread. In recent weeks Turkish attack helicopters have been very active along the border, striking PKK targets with devastating results . Although there is great fear of these weapons being used for terrorist purposes, the fact is they are fairly easy to obtain throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa. Thousands of MANPADS were looted from Libyan stockpiles during the opening months of the civil war there , and although there have been serious efforts to buy them off the street so to speak, the sheer numbers of missiles unaccounted for is eye-watering. Libya is just one source for these weapons, and there are many others all over the world. Turkey’s AH-1F and handful of AH-1W Cobras are fairly dated and in the process of being replaced. Most images of these helicopters show them equipped with only basic infrared defenses. Some are shown in photos with dated ALQ-144 “Disco Ball” infrared jamming system and flare dispensers that likely need manual toggling for release. It is unclear if an automated lancuh detection and countermeasure release system was ever installed in a widespread manner across the fleet. Whether or not these or any other systems were fitted to the Cobra seen in the video really does not matter much as they either did not work or were never activated in time to defend against the fairly close-range MANPADS attack. What will Ankara’s response be? Will these weapons become a deadly staple in an already horrific conflict that has spanned decades? Time will tell. Contact Tyler at tyler@thedrive.com .

These new foreign-designed submarines, which would be outfitted with American combat systems, would be fielded in the next decade and would serve into the latter half of the century. The program’s total cost is estimated just shy of $40 billion. Shipbuilders from Germany, Japan and France were in the running to land the contract. So who was Canberra’s final choice?Let’s meet the competition: Germany’s Thyssen Krupp , known the world over as master builders of submarines, put forward an enlarged variant of their extremely popular and capable 1,900 ton displacement Type 214 AIP capable attack submarine, known as the Type 216 . Its bid was predicted to be the lowest of the lot, landing somewhere around half the cost . Thyssen Krupp Japan’s Mitsubishi-Kawasaki offered up a derivative of its own 4,200 ton displacement Soryu class diesel-electric submarine. Australia and Japan have growing ties, especially when it comes to national security interests , and the fact that the type was already in production—and the right size—seemed to give the Soryu an edge. Existing synergy between Japan and Australia in submarine operations and development was also seen as a major competitive advantage, especially since the two countries are hemispherical neighbors with aligned strategic interests. AP Finally, there’s French naval ship builder, DCNS, which is majority-owned by the French government. DCNS went in a different direction with its design. Instead of upsizing a smaller boat or selecting one off the shelf, it downsized its nuclear powered next-gen Barracuda class submarine to meet—and likely exceed—Australian requirements. They called it the Shortfin Barracuda Block 1A. Australian Government The franco option was viewed as least likely to win, and the immaturity of the design seemed to carry risk. But it’s an adaptation of the very best submarine technology the French have to offer, it is likely the most capable. It would retain the ultra-quiet pump-jet propulsion system found on the nuclear Barracuda variant and many other advanced nuclear submarines in the world, including America’s Virginia and Seawolf class fast attack boats. And The Winner Is… DCNS. On April 26, Canberra shocked the sub procurement community. Unofficial explanations as to why Australia chose the French included questions about the uncertainty of Japan running a major arms export program. Previous Japanese AIP boats used Swedish Stirling Engine-based technology , although lithium-ion batteries were to take its place in the design intended for Australia. Also, Japan’s subs are built to a 20-year lifespan, while Australia intends to keep their next generation subs in the water for 30. The size of the living spaces may have also been a major concern. When it came to Germany’s massively supersized (as in doubled in displacement) design based on the existing Type 214 , it is widely rumored that the concept present far too much technical risk for Australia’s liking . Beyond these speculative reasons for going with the underdog DCNS design, there are other elements that were likely factored in heavily to Australia’s decision. These included dramatic industrial offsets, the ability to construct the boats locally, technology transfer and the contractor’s ability to work with US combat systems suppliers. Size and overall capability, not price, were likely the nails in the coffin for the Shortfin Barracuda’s competitors. In the end Australia will end up with a French nuclear submarine design adapted for diesel-electric propulsion. One that will be built in Australia and its combat systems furnished by US defense contractors. It truly is a defense program that spans the globe. The advent of modern Air Independent Propulsion for diesel-electric submarines, and the improvement in battery power over the last two decades, have delivered nuclear submarine-like capabilities in far less complex, smaller and cheaper submarine designs. The most modern AIP boats can stay submerged for weeks at a time and are in some cases even quieter—and thus more deadly—than their nuclear counterparts. This is no secret, as diminutive AIP capable foreign submarines are known to have wreaked havoc on American flotillas during complex wargames. The US Navy even leased Swedish Gotland class AIP capable submarines to see train against, a move that turned out to be a humbling experience for America’s seagoing force. DCNS France has been pushing to expand the idea of what a diesel-electric submarine with the latest AIP technology looks like . The Shortfin Barracuda appears to be a realization of this exact concept, which was previously dubbed the SMX-Ocean . This super-sized diesel-electric AIP design bridges the gap between the gold-plated nuclear fast attack submarines and the traditionally smaller and more regionally-focused diesel-electric submarines. Australia’s willingness to pay such a high price for a dozen non-nuclear boats—about $3 billion per hull—surprises some. But this is actually the cost of the program as a whole , divided over the number of hulls procured. So it includes research and development, integration of combat systems, setting up indigenous production and support infrastructure. The truth is that diesel-electric submarines with advanced AIP capability can be had for around $500-$700 million a boat if bought directly from a manufacturer such as Germany’s Thyssen Krupp. Even Israel’s highly modified Dolphin II class of submarines cost around $500 million each. But the Shortfin Barracuda is a much larger boat than the Dolphin II and is packed with additional combat capacity and features. Most importantly, it will end up being a relatively new design built in an entirely different country than its origin. It will also feature American combat systems. DCNS Good Decision, or Bad? It depends. It’s hard to understand why Australia would pass up Germany’s Type 216, a variant of a highly proven design from a top manufacturer for half the cost. Two for one is an undeniably awesome proposition, especially for a submarine force that has a lot of ocean to patrol. Yet manning and maintaining that size fleet is really outside of Australia’s stated interest. Additionally, the Royal Australian Navy is accustomed to operating larger submarines, with the Collins class having a nearly 3,500-ton displacement. Stepping down even to a drastically enlarged derivative of an existing type may be unacceptable, regardless of the cost. Japan’s offering seems like a good mix of size, price and geopolitical convenience, but since Australia has a requirement for just twelve boats, maybe going for an “in-between” solution wasn’t attractive enough. In the end, going for the full package just short of procuring a nuclear submarine, which was not an option, may have been seen as the best option considering just how important these submarines will be strategically. In fact, buying what is really a nuclear submarine redesigned for conventional propulsion, may cost more but it also may provide the best “future-proofing” and long-term combat effectiveness for the decades to come. DCSN also has experience with fuel-cell based AIP capabilities, which along with lithium-ion batteries, are seen as cutting-edge when it comes to AIP concepts and fielding the quietest boats possible. Australian Government A Golden Opportunity For The US Navy? The US all-nuclear submarine fleet is already over-tasked, and the situation is only going to get worse. Geopolitical realities around the globe, including the reawakening of the Russian Bear , China’s rapid military expansion , and North Korea’s nuclear and submarine ambitions will all put increased pressure on America’s fast attack and guided missile submarine fleet. These boats are also tasked with spying, special forces delivery operations, and land attack and carrier escort duties. Additionally, the rapid proliferation of very quiet diesel-electric submarines, some with AIP capability, around the globe degrades America’s qualitative advantage in the undersea arena. The Virginia class fast-attack boats currently in production cost about $2.7 billion apiece. In all, the US has roughly 55 SSNs and four refitted Ohio class SSGNs in inventory, which sounds like a large number, but a significant portion of the fleet is undergoing training, maintenance or in port at any given time. One solution to this fast-attack submarine deficit would involve procuring diesel-electric submarines once again. Virginia class fast attack submarine in drydock., Huntington Ingalls The last conventionally-powered sub in service with the US Navy was the USS Blueback , which during the twilight of its career served as an aggressor submarine for nuclear submarines to practice against. The sub was finally retired in 1990 and now sits as a museum ship at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. The Blueback did not feature AIP technology and clearly diesel-electric subs have made a quantum leap in capability in the last two and a half decades since its retirement. With all this in mind, the Shortfin Barracuda that Australia is willing to pay huge sums of money to develop and equip with American combat systems would be an ideal alternative to the overworked, all-nuclear US force. By purchasing an off-the-shelf submarine—with the most advanced technology available for its class, and with US combat systems already integrated into it—the Pentagon could save billions in acquiring a nearly perfect supplement to its current undersea fleet. Even if the US could buy three of these super-sized AIP capable boats for the price of a single Virginia class nuclear submarine, it could result in just the right high-low capability mix to properly confront the threats of the future. Not only that, but Australia and France would be partnered in the program, assuming risk for future upgrades and capability enhancements. Replacing one Virginia class buy out of every four ordered with a common US-Australia diesel-electric submarine would mean that for every four boats the Navy would have acquired they now have six. And no matter how capable a submarine may be it can only be in one place at one time. In other words, numbers matter, and the current nuclear only force is not addressing this dire reality. Another factor that must be considered with such a strategy is basing. Right now America’s nuclear submarines are only based in US territory. But a diesel-electric submarine can be forward deployed and maintained far easier, without the intense security risk associated with parking a nuclear reactor in someone else’s backyard. This means that the US could forward deploy these submarines to hotspots around the globe. By focusing an advanced diesel-electric submarine force on regional operations and forward basing, some of the advantages of a the much more expensive nuclear fast attack submarine begin to fade. The Pacific is especially relevant for this kind of concept. Not only is it the strategic focus of the Pentagon going forward but it is a vast  theatre of operations where the “tyranny of distance” neuters even some of the world’s top weapon system. USN Take the US Navy’s current rotational basing of Littoral Combat Ships in Singapore for instance. A similar strategy could be executed with advanced US diesel-electric submarines. In fact, a Littoral Combat Ship paired with such a submarine would be a very interesting and effective combination. Additionally, the Littoral Combat Ship could act as a tender for the submarine to a certain extent, enhancing its range and flexibility. These boats could also be deployed to locales like the Philippines and Japan, and since Australia will have all the facilities necessary to support them and to perform deep repairs and servicing, America’s infrastructure investment would be minimal when it comes to permanently deploying them to the region. The Pacific is not the only area where these subs could be based. The Baltic Sea, which is increasingly a hot spot, as well as the Middle East would both be relevant basing areas. Rota Spain is another location that makes a lot of sense and these subs could work in tandem with America’s cadre of destroyers that are now based there . These smaller boats are extremely well adapted for operations in shallow and complex littoral environments, and could prove more tactically relevant than their larger nuclear counterparts in some instances. The Same Old Hurdles Remain… Obviously the two biggest hurdles for the Navy actually executing such a logical solution to the tactical and strategic undersea issues that lay before it today are the shipbuilding lobby and the service’s almost religious devotion to an all nuclear submarine force. By truly buying a boat off the shelf, great savings can be realized and capability and design creep, which are the plague of most big defense programs, can be averted. The problem is that this is not a good thing for US shipbuilders who are already scrambling over a relatively static ship-building pie, one that has shrunk over the decades. There is also some strategic points gained by keeping multiple shipbuilders in business, but in a globalized market, even when it comes to ships and weapons, this is somewhat of an antiquated although still highly leveraged argument. DCNS It is possible that the exact same designs could be built right here in the US under license. Although doing so could add significantly to the cost of each boat. Strangely enough, the Navy’s obsession with demanding nuclear propulsion for all of its submarine force could be an even larger obstacle to contend with than shipyard politics. The “nuke” ideology is deeply engrained into America’s submariner culture that many look down on diesel-electric boats as junk in comparison to their gold plated super-subs. This mentality may be self-serving, but it won’t fix the increasing fast-attack submarine deficit. Quite frankly, neither will a new President. Even if defense spending skyrockets, submarine production won’t necessarily increase dramatically. These boats are simply too expensive to build and maintain to see fleet size expansion without looking at other technologies and implementing a solid, high-low capability mix strategy. Now, with Australia footing the bill to develop a perfect candidate for the lower end of such a strategy the Navy has never been positioned better to dramatically increase their presence under the high seas. It will just take a cultural leap of faith and the political will to make it happen.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019","Marines To Turn Super Hercules, Osprey Fleets Into Missile Slinging Electronic Warfare Platforms","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USMC has been experimenting with arming their KC-130Js for years under the Harvest Hawk program , which saw combat in the Middle East. It has also recently tested the Osprey as a weapons delivery platform, capable of close air support. These tests included the use of a new tablet-based system that connects the forward air controller on the ground directly with the Osprey via data link . Now it seems the Marines have seen enough. With the Navy working on making distributed lethality a reality by up-arming as many vessels as possible , the USMC looks to do the same with its air arm. Under this new plan, all of the USMC’s 79 KC-130J Super Hercules transports will be become “shooter capable” and receive Harvest Hawk-like capabilities. Where the Harvest Hawk concept was a bolt-on/roll-on kit, more permanent associated upgrades will now be applied to the KC-130J fleet. The roll-on/roll-off sensor and weapons control station, door-mounted pressurized launch-tubes, and sensor ball that along with the under-wing weapons rack are part of the KC-130J's Harvest Hawk kit., USMC USNI reports that each Hercules will receive a top-of-the-line L3/Wescam FLIR/electro-optical sensor and laser designator ball system that will be permanently installed under the KC-130J’s nose. This deviates from the Harvest Hawk concept that saw a similar, albeit less capable, sensor ball installed in a modified bolt-on adaptation of an underwing-mounted fuel tank. Wing-mounted and pressurized internally mounted weapons racks will also be made available. Hellfire , Griffin and Viper Strike missiles will make up the KC-130J’s combat punch. Right now, there appear to be no plans to integrate a bushmaster cannon or standoff weapons like the Small Diameter Bomb, as seen on the most recent derivatives of the Air Force Special Operations Command’s AC-130 gunships . The initiative to ready all of the USMC’s KC-130s to provide air support does not end at adding kinetic weaponry and a sensor system for surveillance and targeting. The Intrepid Tiger electronic warfare pod will also be added to the new mix of capabilities. Intrepid Tiger is a streamlined concept that originated out of an urgent requirement for aerial jamming support in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can read all about Intrepid Tiger here . The unassuming-looking pod can be ordered to jam the enemy’s communications selectively and it can even eavesdrop on conversations. It can also jam bands commonly associated with IEDs. It works in both a pre-programmed automated mode or more dynamically from a forward deployed ground control station. Some airborne self-protection electronic warfare capabilities can be built into the pod as it continues to evolve. NAVAIR The relatively simple and easily tailorable bolt-on Intrepid Tiger system has proven itself very effective in combat. The proof is in the fact that AV-8B Harriers, with their limited payloads, carry the pod in place of an extra bomb or missile without complaints from forward air controllers on the ground. In fact, the pod seems to be preferred over an extra expendable weapon. Since it can be controlled by the very same forces it supports on the ground below, it also represents another facet of a growing trend in close air support, where control of airborne capabilities is being distributed down to those on the ground. Think of it as weapons and electronic attacks on demand. The Intrepid Tiger II pod seen under the left wing of a USMC AV-8B+ Harrier during a test sortie., US Navy Now only is the Intrepid Tiger pod, which is already flying on Hornets and Harriers, destined for the KC-130J, the Marines plan on bolting it onto a wide array of aircraft. These include the AH-1Z Viper and UH-1Y Venom helicopters and the MV-22 Osprey. The Osprey, which seems to be rapidly picking up new roles, will also be getting its own lethal upgrade. This will come in the form of an upgraded sensor ball that has laser-designation capabilities and some sort of weaponry beyond the machine guns it carries today. Laser-guided rockets have already been tested successfully on the Osprey , and it seems that the force is eyeing making the ability to employ them a fleet-wide capability once the new laser-designation capabilities are in place. Viper Strike is also on the table, which is a gravity dropped, low-collateral damage weapon. Even the Switchblade throwable suicidal drone is being looked at as a possible munition for the MV-22. They could be literally tossed out the back ramp of the MV-22 with little to no modifications to the aircraft itself. Bell's V-22 test aircraft fires a APKWS laser-guided rocket during testing. The idea behind both the Harvest Hawk and the so called “Osprey Hawk” upgrades is to provide a massive increase in close air support and surveillance capable platforms. Because these aircraft have significant range and loiter potential, they can provide persistent overwatch, jamming support, and close air support for forces below with greater efficiency than fast jets or attack helicopters. They can also execute this mission without the limitations of an unmanned aircraft’s soda-straw like view of the battlespace and low situational awareness. This end-to-end air support allows a patrol to have support up above from the start to the end of a mission. Think of guardian angels that can be attached to a mission without setting up forward refueling points, or adding the benefits of fuel-hungry fighter jets but without the tankers needed to keep them in the air. The Osprey can even provide onsite medevac and airlift support if required. Still, there may be some issues with the USMC’s ambitions for their historically less than glamorous transport and utility aircraft. The money will have to come from somewhere to see this plan through. Considering the abysmal reality of Marine Air these days, upgrading non-traditional air support platforms like this is a double-edged sword. Adding new platforms that are capable of providing basic close air support and surveillance through an upgrade takes the pressure off of those same tired traditional attack platforms. On the other hand, these upgrades take away dollars that could go into maintaining and upgrading the overworked aircraft that already possess similar (and sometimes vastly superior) capabilities. https://youtube.com/watch?v=SXPOcI8dMkU The other issue is that crews can only train for so many missions in a certain amount of flight time allotted. Either the USMC needs to up the flight hours for aircrews and increase simulator availability or other existing mission sets may suffer. Although technology may be able to help facilitate close air support more seamlessly in the future, delivering weapons in close proximity to friendly forces is not a side job. It takes training, lots of training, and confidence to execute the mission reliably. This is a challenge that will have to be confronted if the Corps intends to get the best out of their investment in these types of non-traditional upgrades. USMC In the end, when you look back at the last 15 years of continuous combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, these proposed capability upgrades would have been much appreciated and they really do fit the Marines’ likely missions of the future as counter-terror and counter-insurgency operations continue to drag on. It is definitely a low-end about face for a service that has been increasingly obsessed with high-end, 100% solutions at any cost , and that in itself is a very good thing.

Rich Cooper,"Posted on Jul 28, 2022",Inside the F-22 Raptor’s Historic Surprise Deployment to Europe,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two major things happened in the UK during late April that raised military aficionados’ eyebrows and caught aviation observers with their pants down. The first saw the US Air Force deploy twelve of the world’s most advanced super fighters across the Atlantic without any warning. It just happened. A mass of F-22A Raptors left Tyndall AFB in Florida and headed for England on a deployment that would last nearly three weeks. And no one outside the ‘need to know’ military network had a heads up about it. It proved that such things can still be done without losing the element of surprise, a point that is extra significant when you consider that the UK has an entire community built around aircraft spotting and flight tracking. Rich Cooper The second was as incredible as the first and saw a program first for this silver-clad 5th Generation fighter. Two of the super-cruising, thrust-vectoring, stealth-optimized, air dominance jets undertook a dedicated low-level mission through the UK’s famous Low-Fly system, the silver angels dropping down from the heavens, weaving and glinting their way through the green valleys of Wales. Rich Cooper The US Air Force deployed 12 F-22A Raptors from the 95th Fight Squadron ‘Boneheads’, their motto ‘Death with Finesse,’ and approximately 220 airmen and associated equipment to RAF Lakenheath, UK, to undertake a period of intense training with European-based aircraft. The Raptors swept into Europe on April 11, 2016, arriving in two waves over two days, and remained deployed until May 9th, 2016, with the final four jets leaving on May 10th. This was the largest F-22 deployment to Europe to date and is part of the unit’s training plan to support Global Response Force contingency operations. Rich Cooper During their time in the European theater, the airmen and aircraft participated in exercise ‘Iron Hand’ and also forward deployed in small numbers from the UK to other NATO bases. There they executed cooperative training with their host nations, demonstrated America’s commitment to their NATO allies, and deterring any actions that could destabilize regional security. Without a doubt, putting F-22s on Russia’s front doorstep definately sends a strong message to Moscow. Rich Cooper The Global Response Force (GRF) is a joint military team that stands ready for tasking by the US Secretary of Defense to respond to crisis situations. Akin to a Department of Defense 911 emergency force, the GRF provides a menu of tailorable and rapidly deployable forces to respond quickly to a range of worldwide contingencies. Units are assigned on a rotational basis and conduct high-tempo training to be prepared for GRF mission. This F-22 deployment exercised the GRF capability and the ‘Rapid Raptor’ concept to quickly deploy America’s only combat-proven 5th Generation fighter on a moment’s notice to anywhere in the world. Rich Cooper One F-22 pilot noted that, whilst the transit to the UK was routine, there was a chance to get stuck into the ‘Rapid Raptor’ philosophy right off the bat: “This was the first time a four-ship of clean (no tanks) F-22s made the transit across the Atlantic (circa nine hours) and joined the fight. We undertook the ‘pond hop’, then departed the tanker over northern UK and rejoined with other assets (F-15E Strike Eagles from RAF Lakenheath) and conducted a training sortie. After landing, maintenance rapidly prepared our Raptors for another sortie and the jets took off again a few hours later, demonstrating another capability of the ‘Rapid Raptor’ concept. The training mission consisted of multiple advanced air-to-air and surface-to-air threats. During the mission, the F-22s dropped simulated ordnance and integrated with local assets stationed in the UK.” Rich Cooper Unsurprisingly, the ‘Boneheads’ were tight lipped about the way in which the deployment was kept so tightly under wraps, although one spokesman for the 48th FW stated “It just proves we can do it. When we need to, we can still do anything.” It was also understood that the whole ethos of the deployment was to keep it under wraps even from the crews themselves, with just a handful of key personnel knowing the full plan before it was executed. The unit as a whole only had 72 hours notice before deploying. Rich Cooper Whilst in Europe, the 95th FS conducted air training with varied European-based assets. The F-22s forward deployed from the UK to Romania, who’s MiG-21 LanceRs provided quite the technological contrast to the ultra high-tech F-22s. A small contingent of F-22s also deployed to Lithuania. The Raptors also participated in the commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the Lafayette Escadrille in Paris, France, providing a dramatic four-ship flyover. Beyond these smaller sub-deployments, the F-22’s primary operations were undertaken with the busy assets of the 48th Fighter Wing, known better by its nickname ‘The Liberty Wing.’ The 48th FW’s fleet includes F-15Cs of the 493rd FS ‘Grim Reapers’ and F-15E Strike Eagles of the 492nd FS ‘Bolars’ and 494th FS ‘Panthers.’ There were around 16 sorties flown per day, broken down into two ‘goes,’ although sometimes the base would see upwards of 90 sorties launched due to some stunning British weather. All these missions were executed under the ‘Iron Hand’ moniker and flown with such callsigns as ‘Warman’, ‘Mugger’ and ‘Bones.’ Rich Cooper A Raptor pilot explained how the various types of aircraft worked together: “Fighter Integration (FI) tactics focuses on the synergistic effects that can be harvested by successfully playing to each fighter type’s strengths, while avoiding, as a package, individual aircraft type’s potential weaknesses. As an example, during an Offensive Counter-Air focused training mission, the F-15Cs integrated with F-22s to gain air dominance against an advanced air-to-air fighter threat, allowing the F-15Es to roam freely across the battlespace and further integrate with F-22s to find, fix, target, track, engage and assess both medium and long-range Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites in a contested Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) environment.” Hot stuff! Rich Cooper “While flying the F-22 is no different here than anywhere else in the world, the uniqueness of fighter integration with our NATO allies is what provided the greatest training value” explained a ‘Bonehead’ on deployment. “The crosstalk that happens across multi-national aircrews throughout the brief, execution, and debrief provides the bulk of the lessons learned which are invaluable to our future coalition operations.” Rich Cooper The Royal Air Force was also keen to get in the mix. “Having just successfully completed Exercise ‘Red Flag’ at Nellis AFB in Nevada by integrating with RAF Typhoons, we looked forward to again testing our interoperability and mission planning processes. We flew a variety of offensive and defensive counter-air missions with RAF Typhoons and Tornados, relying on them in differing capacities as dictated by the tactical scenario. Each time we test our current Tactics, Training and Procedures (TTPs) we walk away with newer and better lessons learned that only serve to increase our joint lethality in future engagements.” Rich Cooper So what about that flight? The one where the Raptors dropped down from their air dominance perch, swapping high-altitude swooping turns and supercruise for low-level jinking and the skirting of cliff-tops? Aviation history was made on Tuesday, April 26th when these words were transmitted by Colonel Novotny, Commander of the 48th FW, who was operating as ‘Rage 21’ in the flight: “We are a mixed formation of two Fox One Five Echos, two Fox Twenty Twos and one Fox One Five Charlie, entering Low Fly Area Seven north to south for 20 minutes.” ‘Rage 21-22’ were followed by ‘Mongol Flight’ and then ‘Sweep’, with clearance given for the group of fighters to fly down to 500 feet above the ground. Rich Cooper “All F-22 pilots maintain a low-level currency (down to 500ft AGL)” explained one Raptor pilot, “and this requires periodic flights at that altitude. Although the 95th FS typically operates over the water due to over-land supersonic restrictions, it’s also an important basic fighter pilot skill to safely operate at low level. This low-level mission highlighted the differences required in intercept geometry, the increased performance of the F-22, and the dangers associated with low-level flying while experiencing such high G onset rates, sustained G loads and decreased time-to-impact… Although we cannot get into details of what a typical mission consists of, Raptor pilots must be comfortable operating at the full flight envelope available to them. Whether its 60,000ft or 500 feet, the pilot must be comfortable with his environment and should be ready to take advantage of any opportunity that may present itself during a mission.” Rich Cooper The jets themselves took on an almost computer graphic-like appearance as the light danced off their futuristic fuselages. They dived in from Lake Bala and entered the valley towards the Cadair Idris peak, the jets could be seen to undertake hard jinks while making their way down-low. “Any fighter pilot knows that maneuvering in relation to the bandit is essential to survival,” explained one of the two pilots. “In this case the highest threat ‘bandit’ is the ground. The US Air Force has a multitude of instructions, regulations, and training rules that are in place to keep us safe, especially in the low altitude environment. As you can imagine, the speeds and altitudes at which we fly may require ‘aggressive’ turns, within our maneuver limitations, to stay on route and ensure terrain clearance.” Rich Cooper It was also understood that the Raptor’s performance in the demanding low-level regime was impressive. “The integrated digital flight control system on the F-22 constantly attempts to maintain the same handling characteristics regardless of airspeed and altitude, relying on both the combined 70,000 pounds of thrust from the Pratt & Whitney engines and thrust vectoring.” The hard maneuvering on approach to the valley (considered to have been 9g on some passes) was of note and was understood to have been necessary just to slow the speed-hungry, uber-responsive Raptors down. Rich Cooper “Flying the Mach Loop was a unique opportunity to hone our low-level proficiency in mountainous terrain, which is something we don’t have the capability to train to at our home station in Florida. Many pilots in the 95th FS have previous experience operating on the ranges in the Western US and Alaska, which are quite similar to the ranges in Wales.” Flying a Raptor through the Mach Loop is no different than any other fast jet in the low-level arena. It required significant mission planning and a spot-on crosscheck to mitigate the inherent risks of tactical maneuvering close to the ground. Rich Cooper “A significant level of mission planning went into it” the second pilot agreed. “This began with a thorough review of UK Low Fly and local procedures to include route abort procedures, bird avoidance, and en-route weather considerations. The bulk of the mission planning day was spent building the low-level route, map construction included NOTAMS and bird/noise avoidance areas, and fuel planning. The mission brief involved all participants (in the low level sortie) and covered the entirety of mission in significant detail, including a computer generated ‘live fly’ of the route and a hefty discussion on contingencies. As a result of the mission planning process and leveraging the experience of our local experts, the execution of the mission went off without a hitch.” Rich Cooper In Colonel Robert Novotny, the 48th FW has a Commander unlike many others. A true leader with a panache for Facebook, it fell to him to surmise this exciting deployment: “The F-22 deployment to RAF Lakenheath makes perfect sense. Lakenheath is the home of combat fighter aviation in Europe. It’s the place where we work with our NATO allies to sharpen our tactical skills and reaffirm to our commitment to the alliance. Deploying Raptors here and integrating with our efforts in these areas has been a phenomenal success.” Rich Cooper “During their deployment, we were able to integrate seamlessly into some of the largest fighter exercises in Europe. They trained with US, UK and other NATO forces in high-end fighter combat against robust air defenses and modern threats. Additionally, we were able to codify the lessons we learned to ensure future deployments can be faster, simpler and even more lethal if necessary.” Rich Cooper “Sending the Raptors into Low Fly Area 7 was an opportunity for their low-altitude qualified pilots to see first-hand, the amazing training opportunities we have in the United Kingdom. The training ranges and low flying airspace here are some of the best in the world. That fact that the UK is an aviation-minded nation, like the US, with aviation enthusiasts who captured our training in LFA 7 was a real bonus.’ Rich Cooper The final four-ship of F-22s screamed into the skies over Suffolk on the morning of May 10th, heading for home at the end of an unforgettable deployment, undertaken with the finest ‘fighter finesse.’ Rich Cooper Rich Cooper runs the Centre Of Aviation Photography make sure to check them out here and to follow him on Facebook here .

Part of this includes getting as many aircraft loaded up with weapons and in the air as possible for the initial waves of an attack. To practice for this, multiple exercises are held yearly where fighter aircraft are rapidly loaded with weapons and fuel and sent on their way as if they were in combat. To up ante, all of this can all happen under simulated chemical weapons attack and at night. But the aircraft involved often do not go into the air. Instead, they taxi out to the runway and sit running—as though they had flown their sortie—and then taxi back en masse for the complicated process of de-arming and deplaning. Rolling down the runway as one giant herd is an impressive site, is lovingly nicknamed the “elephant walk .” In South Korea, these exercises are usually code named “Beverly XXX,” and this particular one was called “Beverly Herd 16-01.” Joining the forward deployed A-10s of the 25th Fighter Squadron, and the F-16s from the 36th Fighter Squadron, F-16CJ Wild Weasels from the Minnesota Air National Guard’s 179th Fighter Squadron, who are on temporary deployment to South Korea, also took part in the exercise. Their jets have the dark F-35-like paint jobs. USAF Also of interest are the weapons loadouts carried by each aircraft which is representative of what munitions would be used should war break out on the Korean Peninsula. The Duluth-based Block 50 F-16C/Ds are seen toting AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiant missiles used for suppression of enemy air defenses, along with a quartet of AIM-120 AMRAAMs for counter-air duties. They also carry the HARM Targeting System (HTS) pod that is customary for F-16CJ, as well as a Sniper targeting pod. Interestingly, some of the 36th Fighter Squadron’s Block 40 F-16C/Ds carry the identical loadout. In the past few years USAF Block 40 F-16s, once focused on the night interdiction and deep strike mission, have been upgraded to F-16CG standard and can carry the HARM Targeting System pod just like the F-16C/D Block 50 Wild Weasels. This common configuration upgrade path has vastly increased the USAF’s suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) capability and the Block 40 F-16’s survivability in general. The 36th Fighter Squadron’s F-16s can also be seen toting quad-racks of Small Diameter Bombs, giving them a stand-off precision strike capability in any weather conditions. The winged SDBs can travel dozens of miles to their targets and pack considerable punch for their diminutive size. It is a nearly ideal weapon for the opening strikes against smaller fixed targets and anti-aircraft emplacement in North Korea. USAF The A-10’s loadout is optimized to go after North Korea’s expansive, albeit dated, armor and especially the thousands of artillery pieces stationed along the demilitarized zone that pose a clear threat to the South. They carry a pair of AGM-65 Maverick missiles, a pair of GBU-12 500lb laser guided bombs, a pair of GPS-guided GBU-38 500lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions, a seven round 2.75 inch rocket pod likely loaded with marking rounds used to designate targets for attacking fighters, and a pair of AIM-9L/M Sidewinders for self protection against North Korea’s geriatric air force round out its expendible stores. Oh and we cannot forget its GAU-8 Avenger 30mm cannon that is likely loaded with 1,174 rounds. The A-10s also carry the LITENING targeting pod. All said this is a great real-world illustration of just how much combat punch a single A-10 brings to the table. All the aircraft, both F-16s and A-10s, are shown carrying a variant of the AN/ALQ-184 electronic warfare pods for self-protection. USAF If anything, these exercises not only keep US air combat units stationed in South Korea on their toes, but they also send a very strong and clear message to North Korea as to what they would be facing during open conflict. It is as much a deterrent as it is a training opportunity, and a very potent one at that.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier today the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS William P. Lawrence was executing a freedom of navigation drill near Fiery Cross Reef , where China has built a 10,000-foot-long runway along with maritime and other military facilities. During the destroyer’s approach to the island, a pair of Chinese J-11 fighters, an indigenous variant of the Su-27 Flanker, along with a Y-8 surveillance aircraft, were scrambled from the island outpost. It is not clear at this time if the Y-8, which has been adapted for many missions , was a maritime patrol, airborne early warning and control (AEW&C), electronic intelligence collection, electronic warfare or a command and control variant. The United States has been executing these maneuvers around the islands since last October . The tactic is meant to exercise the right of innocent passage under international maritime law and to challenge China’s blanket claims to the resource rich South China Sea as well as the validity of their man-made islands outposts. These missions are also intended to set a precedent that will hopefully keep China from denying access to the critical waterways and aerial routes on and above the disputed body of water. Currently, half dozen countries claim portions of the South China Sea. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS William P. Lawrence , USN It is not clear exactly what the J-11s and Y-8 did after they scrambled from Fiery Cross Reef’s massive runway, which just opened last January. In fact, it was not known that fighters had been deployed to the island at all— the Chinese government had previously disclosed visits only by military transports and airliners . J-11s had previously been deployed to China’s highly developed Woody Island in the northern portion of the South China Sea, along with advanced surface-to-air missile systems , but this is an entirely new and significant development in the southern Spratlys Islands, where Fiery Cross Reef is located. Still the presence of fighters and surveillance aircraft on the man-made airbase-island underlines exactly what many had predicted for years: China intends to create a series of overlapping anti-access/area-denial “bubbles” over the South China Sea . Layers of fighter jets, maritime patrol aircraft, submarine hunting helicopters and missiles, lots and lots of missiles, both of the surface-to-air and anti-ship variety, will likely be the building blocks of this zone of control. Once operational, it will allow China to close off critical air and sea traffic, as well as access to energy and fishing reserves, on a whim. China's man-made Fiery Cross Reef base., AP China says it also dispatched a guided missile destroyer, a guided missile frigate and a frigate toward the Lawrence as it made its approach to the island. While Chinese warships shadowing maneuvers is nothing new, it remains unclearwhat defensive posture the American destroyer took once it detected the fighters inbound, and what type of maneuvers the fighters made during the encounter. What is known is that this is yet another step in the heavily militarization and geopolitical escalation on the South China Sea. Senior Colonel Yang Yujun, a spokesman for China’s Defense Ministry, stated : “The unauthorized entry by the U.S. warship into waters near China’s Nansha Islands was an act of serious provocation…They (Chinese military) promptly identified the U.S. warship and issued warnings to expel it from the area.” This event also occurs during a time when the US and China are both highly active in the area. China just kicked off an elaborate set of war games in the region this week, which according to a report by ABC News includes enemy blockade running and submarine spying drills. The flotilla conducting these drills includes the Type 052D guided missile destroyer Hefei, China’s most advanced warship. A Chinese Type 052D destroyer., PLAN The US has also had a persistent naval presence in the area as of late but has also deployed a gaggle of A-10 Warthogs to the Philippines . These aircraft had been flying patrols over the disputed Scarborough Shoul, a location that could be China’s next island building project. The A-10 may seem like a strange aircraft to use for such a mission, but really, it’s not. The Warthog is nowhere near as threatening as fighter jet as it carries only defensive air-to-air weaponry weapons more suited for close air support than maritime strike. Still, the littoral combat mission has long been a latent capability of the Warthog since its introduction into service nearly four decades ago. In fact, a two seat maritime patrol variant of the iconic close air support aircraft that sported upgraded sensors was proposed decades ago, with some countries showing interest in purchasing it. Even though that variant never came to fruition, today, there are few aircraft that could wreak as much havoc on swarming fast boats as an A-10. Also, the A-10’s long-loiter time, low-flying domain and pilot cadre trained for observation and forward air control makes patrolling waterways and conducting sea control and surveillance missions a fairly logical extension of the type’s primary mission-set. An A-10C equipped with a LITENING targeting pod and an ALQ-184 electronic warfare pod sits at Clark AB in the Phillipines., USAF Outside of making the South China Sea issue a major diplomatic priority and using all the tools available to the US to try to force a solution, or at the very least keep the situation from escalating, it surely will. As China’s man-made islands morph into ever more heavily armed fortresses there will be fewer options for the US and its regional allies when it comes to dealing with it. Considering that it is the Obama Administration’s last year in office, it is nearly certain that the Chinese will not be confronted on this issue. Sadly, by this time next year the strategic situation in the region will likely look nothing like it does today, with China’s anti-access/area-denial zone spanning hundreds of thousands of square miles going from concept to a reality.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 6, 2016",Watch This German Tornado Rip Up a Steep Canyon at Extremely Low Level,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There’s a lot of awesome low-level flight videos making the rounds these days , but this old-school footage taken through the windscreen of a Luftwaffe Tornado as it books it up a snow covered canyon near Goose Bay is pretty damn exhilarating. For decades Germany has flown both the Tornado IDS variant, used for deep interdiction/strike, as well as the ECR variant, used for suppression of enemy air defenses. Although these Torandos have a very capable terrain following radar system that can be used to skirt above the weeds at a couple hundred feet in zero visibility conditions, it looks like this super low-level adventure was flown by some experienced hands. Canada has long been an aviation training ground for NATO allies, especially during the Cold War and the years immediately following. Today, the Great White North is host to the NATO Flying Training program, which has conducted primary and advanced flight training for participating nations for a decade and a half. The school, located a CFB Moose Jaw, operates CT-156s (T-6s) and CT-155s (an advanced Hawk jet trainer derivative). Canada also holds its yearly large force employment (LFE) exercise, dubbed “Maple Flag,” at CFB Cold Lake. This event, similar to Red Flag held at Nellis AFB in Nevada , often draws multiple NATO ally and non-NATO allied air units from around the globe. Both Maple Flag and NATO Flying Training are held far from Goose Bay, on Canada’s east coast. So what’s the draw to this region for German Tornado crews? Most nation’s tactical aircraft squadrons have their favorite low-level routes and some of these units travel thousands of miles to take advantage of them. Clearly, German Tornado pilots have a special affection for the low-level routes around Goose Bay in Newfoundland/Labrador Province. Who could blame them? The scenery and terrain is breathtaking and it clearly offers a challenging set of obstacles to fly through. In fact, the Luftwaffe was not the only air arm that frequented CFB Goose Bay to master low-level tactical flying. During the Cold War, the base hosted permanent fast-jet detachments from NATO countries that flew nearly year-round over the surrounding territory. The choice of CFB Goose Bay was pragmatic: its topography is similar to to key areas of Russia, and it’s fairly accessible from Europe. Also, not a lot of people live up there, so the flights wouldn’t bother locals. Of course, there were still some complaints. Luftwaffe Tornados at their forward training location at CFB Goose Bay, JcPollock/Wikicommons By 2005, the leases held by the Royal Air Force, Italian Air Force and the Luftwaffe to use the base were not renewed, and the high-tempo foreign fast-jet operations over the area—a thunderous staple for decades—came to an end. Canadian Hornets still visit the area and a quick reaction alert site is still maintained at the base for air defense purposes, but the days of a multicultural mix of fighters blasting out of the base and roaring over the frosty wilderness are now just a memory. Here are a few more gems of the Luftwaffe’s Torandos in action low over eastern Canada: That doesn’t mean there aren’t great active low-level routes. Royal Air Force Tornado crews still have some of the world’s best right in their own backyard. One route, known as “Mach Loop,” includes the hills around Wales, and has become a mecca for aviation photographers aiming to capture all types of military aircraft and aircrews practicing their nap-of-the-earth skills in spectacular fashion. Areas of Scotland are also regularly visited by low-flying allied and Royal Air Force aircraft, like this Hawk T1.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even with all the tech packed into a U.S. Navy AEGIS combat system equipped Ticonderoga class guided missile cruiser, it still has to fight the rough seas like any other vessel. The Ticos were the first class to be built around AEGIS, but they were not an entirely clean-sheet design. Their hull-form and many of their machine systems were borrowed from the Spruance class destroyer . Because of that, the more massive Ticos have larger crews and more prominent command and control missions compared to the Spruance class. Additionally, the need to mount the large SPY-1 phased-array radars as high up on the ship’s superstructure as possible didn’t help with the class’s top-heavy look. A Spruance class Destroyer sits next to a Ticonderoga class Cruiser, which shares its hull-form., USN From certain angles, the Ticos may appear somewhat overbuilt, but they slice through the water pretty damn efficiently—even in rough seas. Case in point: The video below, shot in the South China Sea, shows the USS Bunker Hill (CG-52) attempting an underway replenishment in some pretty nasty conditions. That is a lot of ship full of a lot of weaponry pitching up and down. Because of the Ticonderoga class’s high-set bridge, I bet the ride was especially fun for her bridge crew.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 8, 2016",North Korea’s Failed Ballistic Missile Launches Are No Laughing Matter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It is hard not to laugh at North Korea’s seemingly bumbling military apparatus. Kim Jong Un’s Bond villain parallels and bad haircut only amplify the cartoon-like feel. But the Hermit Kingdom is no longer hiding behind theoretical capabilities. Instead, they have rapidly moved to testing their most terrifying weapons in order to make them actually operational. The recent launches of BM-25 Musadan intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), long considered an unproven design more suitable as a parade prop than a plausibly effective weapon system, is proof of a concerning shift in North Korea’s weapons development strategy. The Musadan missile system is likely a development of the ’60s-era Russian R-27 Zyb liquid-fueled IRBM. Its first appearance—or at least an elaborate mockup of one—was in 2010, during the Korean Worker’s Party 65th anniversary parade. The BM-25 was shown riding on the back of a large off-road capable transporter erector launcher (TELs), and it set off alarms among defense and arms-proliferation analysts. The BM-25 is believed to have a range of 1,500 to 2,500 miles and is capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. That is, if it could fly. In the half decade that has passed since that parade, North Korea’s Musadan missile capability was questioned by many analysts, who could find no evidence the missile had ever been flight tested. In essence, it was a phantom capability: maybe a propaganda tool, maybe a real weapon, or a mix of both. This uncertainty among the analysts changed suddenly just weeks ago. Musadan missile on parade in Pyongyang., Image credit- AP The North Koreans conducted no fewer than three consecutive BM-25 Musadan missile tests—on April 15, 27, and 28—and each one failed, according to South Korean and US governments . Pyongyang, which for years seemed content in to use the missiles as saberrattling props, has suddenly moved to verify their combat capabilities in a startlingly aggressive manner. Another intermediate range ballistic missile test, this one a submarine launched weapon, occurred on April 23. By all accounts, it was successful at “cold launching” the missile from a vertical launch tube—to the point of ignition and fly-away. The missile only traveled about 17 miles before exploding, according to South Korea officials , but the test represented a significant leap in North Korea’s ability to launch such a weapon successfully. Whether the launch originated from a submersible test barge or North Korea’s Sinpo Class submarine remains unclear. North Korea's sole Sinpo class submarine supposedly has a vertical launch tube capable of holding medium-range ballisitic missile. The tube runs from the top of the diesel-electric submarine's sail down through its hull., Image credit- North Korea State Media Analysts are uncertain if this new submarine-launched ballistic missile, dubbed the KN-11 by North Korea , uses solid or liquid propellant. The latter is used in the Musadan missile, and is the mainstay of North Korea’s rocket capabilities—at least for now. This greatly limits its strategic effectiveness, especially when it comes to road-mobile liquid-fueled ballistic missiles, since they can’t be transported while fueled. To launch, they have to stop, configure upright, and only then fuel up for ignition. This process can take hours and exposes the missiles and their support crews and vehicles to preemptive attack. Since the SCUD hunts of Desert Storm , the United States has become more adept at detecting and targeting ground-mobile ballistic missiles. This capability is only improving as advances in radar technology, aided by faster and faster computer processing power, evolves in exotic ways . Liquid-fueled submarine -launched ballistic missiles, however, are a different story. Cruising beneath the surface, submarines can prepare for a launch virtually undetected, are not exposed to the same amount of jarring while submerged as road-mobile variants. Still, their propellants are highly volatile, a reality that led to the loss of the Russian submarine K-219 in 1986 , Also, the fuel sloshes around during the violent ejection from a submerged launch tube, putting extreme loads on the missile’s structure and propulsion components. Ballistic missiles that use a solid-fuel based propulsion concept can be stored for long periods of time with little maintenance requirements and can take much more abuse while remaining mission capable. Most importantly, they can be launched much faster than their clumsy liquid-fueled counterparts. However, the propulsion technology behind solid-fueled missiles is much more challenging to master. North Korean solid fuel rocket test., Image credit- North Korean State Media It is known that North Korea has been testing solid fuel rocket engines . If one of these adolescent engines was fitted to the submarine-launched missile that was tested recently, it is possible it’s flight was short because the limitations of this early iteration of a solid fuel propellant and motor. If this is the case, it’s likely that the goal of the test was proving launch capability , not downrange flight capability. The weak thrust of a new solid-fuel motor may have limited the amount of fuel that could be loaded onto the missile. By loading less fuel, the thrust-to-weight ratio required for the missile to fly off after being “cold launched” from its underwater missile tube could be achieved. If the KN-11 submarine-launched ballistic missile fired late last month had a new solid-fuel based propulsion system, we should be concerned. If North Korea has moved to this more promising but complex rocket technology, it will have repercussions across each of their ballistic missile and rocket programs. Once mature, this technology would signify a giant leap in reliability and quick-launch capability for Pyongyang, and it would align with its stated goal of creating a credible nuclear deterrent as quickly as possible. It could also mean that the deployment of nuclear armed ballistic missiles on future North Korean submarines is entirely plausible. Once again, the fact that most of these recent ballistic missile launches have failed is beside the point. The takeaway should be that North Korea is now moving away from the far easier and cheaper route of putting forward “supposed capabilities” to risking that psychological deterrent in order to make their ballistic missile dreams a verified reality. Through each consecutive launch, failed or otherwise, North Korean rocket development teams are learning and becoming one step closer to success. Kim Jong Un inspects what is supposed to be a miniturized nuclear weapon., Image credit- North Korean State Media This is a dark development for the region. With North Korea’s possible miniaturization of a nuclear warhead , it seems now to be rushing headlong towards a credible medium-range nuclear delivery system. Once it has tested a miniaturized warhead ( which could be very soon ) and have a credible rocket to fly it on—even eventually one that even uses solid fuel and can be launched quickly—the strategic equation in Asia and beyond will change significantly. At the very least, expect other countries in the region to invest in ballistic missile defense systems, which are hideously expensive and often unreliable. Also, count on the international community jacking up the pressure on China to curb the North Korea threat. China has already signed on to crushing sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear arms development program and general misbehavior—a move that deviates from decades of Chinese support for the Kim regime and interfering with international efforts to punish it through harsh sanctions. Still, China has incredible leverage over North Korea: it is the impoverished nation’s main trading partner and often exclusive supplier of everything from energy to iron ore. Image credit- AP Still, North Korea will have to prove that its budding ballistic missile nuclear delivery systems work and that a nuclear warhead can separate, reenter and fuse with some accuracy and reliability. These initiatives will likely come to pass in the next decade, at which time North Korea will pose a real-deal nuclear-ballistic missile threat to its neighbors, and in some circumstances, to America’s interests in the West Pacific, Alaska and possibly even part of the west coast. The good news is that North Korea has played their hand publicly. Since the recent crescendo of test flights, we have a better picture of its weapons programs. The US and the global community—especially China—have some time to deal with the issue. But the clock is ticking louder and faster now than ever before.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",A-10 Replacement Requirements Do Actually Exist But They’re Mired In Bureaucratic Limbo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Secretary of the Air Force, Heather Wilson, recently offered some unusually strong support for the A-10 Warthog, going so far as to say she is a “fan” of a plane her service has been looking for ways to retire for decades. This might be because she knows that, at least as of yet, there is still no formal requirement for a dedicated replacement close air support-focused aircraft or clear conclusions about how to otherwise provide a similar capability in the future. In a letter dated December 12, 2017, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force denied a Freedom of Information Act Request related to the replacement of the A-10, but was still compelled to offer significant new details in order to justify the decision. The missive both confirmed that the Air Force had put together a set of draft requirements for a notional “A-X” aircraft to replace the A-10, but did not formalize them , and that the service still has yet to make a final decision on what to do with that documentation at all. In April 2016, I submitted the FOIA request, which asked for copies of any records sent to, from, or within the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Requirements regarding the drafting of these requirements. The department found 50 pages of relevant documents, but “determined that no formal requirements came out of the General Holmes’ Apr 2016 referenced CAS [close air support] platform requirements development,” according to the letter. “All documentation concerning this matter is action officer (AO) level internal pre-decisional, deliberative information, where it was determined that responsive record are not decision document or otherwise validated a final decision.” U.S. government agencies subject to the FOIA can legally withhold information on the grounds that it covers ongoing internal matters and that making the details public could prejudice the final outcome or give the false impression that the U.S. government might pursue a certain course of action. This exemption is also one that experts say is among those that agencies most often abuse as a tool to avoid release potentially controversial or embarrassing records, going so far as to nickname it the “withhold it because you want to” exemption. An A-10 moves in behind a tanker to refuel during a mission against ISIS terrorists., USAF Whether the Air Force is legitimately withholding the records or not, it is significant that after more than a year, the service has left the draft A-X requirements in this sort of bureaucratic limbo. It is a far cry from how General Holmes suggested the process would go in April 2016. “My requirements guys are in the process of building a draft-requirements document for a follow-on CAS airplane,” he said at an Air Force Association breakfast on April 7, 2016. “I have seen a draft of it, it’s out for coordination. It’ll go to the chief [of staff] sometime this Spring, and then we’ll fold that into the larger study we’re doing on the future of the combat air forces.” In July 2016, the officer again suggested that the Air Force was actively looking at replacement close air support aircraft, including a potential two-part concept. According to Holmes, this proposal would include a light attack aircraft in the near term to complement the A-10, followed by a more capable and survivable design, dubbed the A-X2 . The light attack plane portion led to the Capability Assessment of Non-Developmental Light Attack Platforms, an experimental technology demonstration also known as OA-X . The A-X2 component has yet to materialize in any form. In June 2016, then Air Force Chief of Staff Mark Welsh did describe an idea for a “ flying coke machine ” as an A-10 replacement, but it was unclear whether this concept was limited to a new aircraft, which might be manned or unmanned, or if it might be a whole network of new systems and tactics, techniques, and procedures for close air support missions. A-10s take part in an “ Elephant Walk ” exercise at Osan Air Base in South Korea in 2016., USAF The new information in response to the FOIA request adds more evidence to our previous reporting here at The War Zone that the Air Force appears to have either quietly decided to abandon the pursuit of any sort of A-X aircraft or is moving the process of developing those requirements along as slowly as possible. In July 2017, Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein had already acknowledged that the service was not working on any such program and that it might decide to again push for retiring the Warthogs without a dedicated successor. That the draft A-X requirements are still technically “pre-decisional” means the Air Force could still be planning to turn them into a formal development project. Similarly, they could inform other near term decisions, such as the purchase of an OA-X type light attack aircraft. This all remains unlikely, though. The proposed light attack aircraft would simply not be able to match the capabilities offered by even the existing Warthogs. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson has now publicly backed plans to restart a critical re-winging program that could help keep dozens more A-10s flying through 2040, suggesting that the service has no immediate plans to develop a dedicated successor. The Air Force could still be holding out for the results of the highly anticipated fly-off between the A-10 and the F-35 , which could begin in 2018 . The service has long made clear that its preferred option is to replace the older ground attack aircraft entirely with the stealthy Joint Strike Fighters. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter drops an inert GBU-12/B laser-guided bomb during a test., USAF Whatever the actual status of the A-X requirements are, the Air Force’s decision to keep them in draft status keeps them in this gray area of technically being open for consideration even if its entirely unclear how serious or not the service might actually be about the concept. A similar situation might now be brewing with the results of the OA-X experiment , which itself dates back to a draft concept document a team of Air Force officials first crafted in the late 2000s. Earlier in December 2017, Secretary of the Air Force Wilson told members of Congress that there was a final report for the OA-X tests, but that she hadn’t read it herself. The Air Force has said it will only publicly release the results “when appropriate,” according to Military.com . With new wings unlikely to arrive before more than 100 A-10s end up grounded, and the aircraft still an important part of combat operations and other missions around the world , it may become increasingly more important for the Air Force to clarify publicly where it stands on requirements for a new close air support-focused aircraft design.
