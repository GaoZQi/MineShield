By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Senator John McCain passed away today at 81 years old. He had just announced that he would end his treatment for brain cancer a day ago. Most thought that was a bit odd coming from a man that knew how to fight against the odds better than pretty much anyone on this planet. But now we understand that he did indeed fight till the very end, in true ‘Maverick’ fashion. John McCain is a personal hero of mine. I have always been gripped by his amazing story, candid demeanor, willingness to take on a fight and cross the aisle to get stuff done, and by his reliance on humor as a backstop against the crazy things life can throw at us. The hardest part of this news is that McCain is needed now more than ever in a wayward government with few lions left to lead. But maybe the timing of his departure will work to make us remember just how privileged we were to have him around for so long and how important his quality of leadership was. Navy pilot John McCain in front of a T-2 Buckeye during training. , Public Domain You don’t have to agree with one piece of policy John McCain ever supported—I certainly didn’t always agree with him on defense matters—to know that he loved the military and thought of soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen like family. And for all the power he amassed over the years he remained a humble man when it came to his own storied military career and his service to the country as a lawmaker. The fact that he was held prisoner and tortured for years by the North Vietnamese, even after being offered the option to leave due to his father’s high-ranking military position and denying this special treatment and choosing to stay so that his brothers weren’t left to fight alone, might be what McCain will be remembered for most. But this moment in the brutal 2008 Presidential Election was probably his brightest shining moment as a politician, in retrospect: McCain would rather lose on merit than win on peddling bullshit and selling out the truth for personal gain. This fundamental quality has vanished from American politics in recent years, on both sides of the aisle. For McCain this was not just some political calculation, it was who he was and he would not waiver from that for anything or anyone. It’s such a beautiful and simple thing. I want to keep this short. This news will strike everyone in a different way and we can discuss it in the comments section further. But maybe, just maybe it will help us come together as nation at a time when it’s needed most. John McCain would have had it no other way. AP Side note: The movement to name CVN-81, the fourth Ford class supercarrier, for the departed Senator should start now.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 5, 2018",These Are The Most Stunning Pictures Of An AH-1 Cobra You Are Likely To Ever See,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Bell’s AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter, a very close cousin to the iconic UH-1 Huey, has always been a sinister looking machine whose slender physique and venomous bite does justice to its serpent namesake. Over the last fifty years the helicopter has evolved dramatically in some ways, but its basic configuration remains the same. Still, the earlier single turbine models, and especially those with flat ballistic glass canopies, have a certain athletic appearance compared to their ever- bulkier twin-engine Cobra successors. And I have never seen one captured more brilliantly than by my Twitter contact and aviation photographer extraordinaire @ munbo327EJ . The series of photos below were taken during the Helicopter and Disaster Prevention Festival held in Oyabe, Japan on August 25th, 2018. Our photographer positioned himself in a building on the hillside above the festival to capture the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force AH-1S demo in absolutely spectacular fashion. We talked just recently about how an elevated perspective can make for the ultimate air show pictures, and once again this rule is proven true: @ munbo327EJ @ munbo327EJ @ munbo327EJ @ munbo327EJ @ munbo327EJ Japan’s Fuji Heavy Industries built 89 AH-S Cobras under license between 1984 and 2000, about 60 of which remain in service. Following the Cobra’s production run in Japan, JGSDFs procured a dozen AH-64D Longbow Apaches . At times it seemed that Japan would procure addition Longbows, but those orders never materialized and now Japan is look at options for replacing its Cobra fleet to augment the higher-end but tiny Apache force. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uUComi9GVgY Japan also has ordered over a hundred indigenously developed Kawasaki OH-1 light scout and armed reconnaissance helicopters, but they are not seen as a replacement for the Cobras. Instead they will replace Japan’s fleet of aging OH-6 Little Birds that serve in a similar role. OH-1, JGSDF Now known as the AH-X tender, the favorites to replace the single-engine Cobras are the AH-1Z Viper , the latest and most capable of the long-serving Cobra lineage, and the AH-64E Apache Guardian which has a roadmap to quickly add new capabilities and to better excel in the maritime combat environment. The AH-1Z was developed for the U.S. Marine Corps out of the AH-1W Super Cobra, which itself was derived from the AH-1J Sea Cobra, an aircraft that was built specifically to be at home operating from vessels out at sea. The Apache on the other hand was never realized in a dedicated manner, but operators do fly them from ships—most notably the British Army Army Air Corps. WAH-64D aboard HMS Ark Royal back in 2010. , UK MoD As we mentioned a moment ago, the Apache Guardian is going to be get some enhancement to make it better suited for maritime warfare, although the somewhat simpler AH-1Z Viper really has a pedigree for such operations. There have been various proposals for a maritime Apache variant, some more elaborate than others. The one on the right included a fighter’s pulse doppler radar, widely set landing gear and a host of other modifications. While more conservative concepts have also been offered. This includes the one on the left that shows a lightly modified Apache but packing a huge punch in the form of four AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles. , Public Domain Why any of this is important is because Japan’s realignment as military power, in which expeditionary and offensive capabilities are now on the table, is going to have a major focus on getting the very most punch out of their existing ‘helicopter carrying destroyers,’ which are actually aircraft carriers. The integration of the F-35B with Japan’s two Izumo class carriers—the largest in Japan’s inventory— is part of this initiative . But fielding highly-modern and capable attack helicopters from these ships and their smaller cousins is a much more easily obtained and economic capability. Using attack helicopters operating from amphibious flattops for dedicated strike operations over land is a tactic that was reenergized and proven highly valuable over Libya by the USMC in recent years, and Japan has surely taken notice. Izumo and her sister ship will likely be modified to accommodate F-35Bs, but new navalized attack helicopters could also offer some serious punch for the big ships and their slightly smaller cousins., AP With all this in mind, Japan’s Cobra replacement could be a central player in the country’s naval power projection capabilities, which will have real geopolitical and military impact on the region. It’s somewhat unlikely that Japan’s AH-1S Cobras will all be sent to the boneyard or the scrap heap. There is an emerging cottage industry that aims to rework these exact types of helicopters, adding new avionics, sensors, and new weaponry, along with a major structural overhaul, that offers a package of for capabilities that creeps towards those found on the new AH-1Z but for a fraction of the price. AH-1Z Viper., USMC As such, Japan’s AH-1s may rise even after retirement to strike again. In the meantime, enjoy these awesome pics of this legendary helicopter.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Recent MALD-X Advanced Air Launched Decoy Test Is A Much Bigger Deal Than It Sounds Like,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) program has matured fairly quietly over the last two decades. At first glance, the mini-cruise missiles, which are used to distract and deceive an enemy air defense system so that a real strike package can succeed and survive, seem fairly unglamorous. But the growing MALD family is among the most exciting and important programs in the Pentagon’s air warfare portfolio. Now it has been announced that that the latest iteration of the system, the MALD-X, has successfully flown twice, on August 20th and 22nd, over the test ranges off NAWS Point Mugu. This demonstration kicks open the door for a whole new set of MALD capabilities, and tactics to go along with them, that will be essential to America’s air dominance in the decades to come. The ADM-160 MALD program dates back to the 1990s, but at its heart, MALD is based around a tactic as old as warfare itself—the feint. The original idea was to use the missile to mimic an attack into enemy airspace by spoofing the radar signatures and flight profiles of American combat aircraft. Rudimentary drones have done similar jobs in decades past, from Vietnam to the Golan Heights to Baghdad . B-52s even had an air-launched decoy system during the Cold War . But MALD differs in that it is a modern, purpose-built, and expendable weapon that can be lugged into combat by an aircraft as small as an F-16 or as large as a ramp-equipped transport plane. It also has a Signature Augmentation System (SAS) that can make it look to radar like a big transport or a stealthy F-117, and everything in between. You can read all about MALD and how it would be used in combat in this past feature of mine. A test flight of the first, smaller iteration of MALD in 1999. , USAF The concept has grown in size and capability over the years. Today MALD has a range of roughly 500 miles and a flight time of about an hour. The MALD-J version includes a jammer that brings forward deployable, close proximity to threat, airborne electronic warfare to the table. It can be incredibly effective as it zips near known anti-aircraft and radar-surveillance sites as well as communications nodes. It can be programmed to loiter over a particular area, jamming a certain target for an extended period of time. So basically, when you talk about ‘day one’ air combat operations against a peer-state adversary, MALD will likely go into enemy airspace before anything else does. Now MALD-X has been successfully tested. This work is also notably under the management of the secretive Strategic Capabilities Office, which has been overseeing a number of other advanced and novel missile and drone programs, including the shadowy Sea Dragon submarine-launched supersonic missile and the Perdix air-launched drone swarm project. MALDs loaded up on a B-52H. , Raytheon This new iteration of the MALD is an interim bridge of sorts that will allow the Navy to develop a high-end and smarter MALD-N, as well, which will work in conjunction with its electronic warfare community that is dominated by the EA-18G Growler. It will also provide a conduit to evaluate enhanced capabilities for the USAF’s MALD-Js, hundreds of which are in the inventory today. MALD-X enhances the modular nature of the mini cruise missile with the ability to accommodate different electronic warfare payloads that are more advanced than those found on MALD-J. What is planned to come out of MALD-X is a networked decoy that can use its adaptive electronic warfare payload to deliver electronic attacks on air defense nodes autonomously or at the direction of operators from a afar in a semi-autonomous fashion. These operators will likely end up being EA-18G Growler crews. This advanced MALD derivative will also be able to be re-tasked in real time via an onboard data-link and will capable of low altitude penetration through enemy territory, this could help them get into a target area successfully before they begin employing their electronic warfare magic. The data-link is really key here. It totally changes the nature of the MALD mission from a pre-planned route flying decoy to a dynamic player that can be ordered to adapt to a changing electronic order of battle on the fly. This will help with keeping 4th generation fighters alive in medium and elevated risk combat environments and to help Wild Weasels and destruction of enemy air defenses tasked aircraft to dismantle an enemy’s air defense network—or at least tear open avenues through it. But above all else, it will give stealth aircraft a critical layer of protection as they strike forward into enemy territory with minimal support. USAF There is no such thing as an invisible aircraft, and this is particularly true to stealthy fighter aircraft that are optimized for decreased detectability specifically from higher frequency fire control radars. Low frequency radar systems are being produced that have the potential to detect these aircraft under certain circumstances at relevant ranges. But just because they can detect them fleetingly it doesn’t mean they can produce target quality track so that air-defense systems can engage them successfully. You can read more about modern integrated air defense systems, including their weaknesses and strengths in this past article of mine on the S-400. Still, even though they can’t produce high fidelity targeting information on stealthy aircraft, these systems could cue a wide variety of enemy air defense sensors nearer to the target to look in a certain portion of the sky. In the future, with the help of advanced computer processing and automation, this could result in the creation of engagement quality tracks of a stealth aircraft and especially those optimized to elude a narrow set of bandwidths. This is where MALD-X can come in, offering the ability to deceive, confuse, and even temporarily blind various radars and air defense nodes, including those that pop-up on the move, deep into enemy territory so that the actual strikers can get to their targets unmolested. The potential for them to also make pinpoint cyber attacks on communications nodes is also a possibility. Bombers like the stealthy B-2, and even wider-band stealth aircraft, will also increasingly rely on the help of MALD, and electronic warfare in general, to survive. In essence, as stealth’s armor begins to degrade, electronic warfare and the creative use of decoys will become increasingly important. And short of an undisclosed penetrating electronic warfare platform that may or may not exist —and if it does it’s only in small numbers—stealth fighters and bombers go where EA-18G Growlers simply cannot, and the Growler’s jamming capabilities only have limited standoff capabilities. This is why enhanced electronic warfare variants of MALD will become increasingly critical components of America’s air warfare master plan as the years go on. Raytheon Considering this new MALD is networked, swarming and cooperative tactics among a group of MALD-Xs/MALD-Ns could work to achieve their full potential as a team. This includes classifying, prioritizing, and delegating jamming and decoy duties on the fly during their relatively short lifespan. By working together autonomously they can act at speeds that can break the enemy’s decision cycle and cripple their ability to respond fast enough to impact what’s going on in the battle-space. So even at hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop, these sacrificial craft will be absolutely essential when it comes to breaking down the enemy’s door, or at least confusing its gatekeepers long enough so that a strike package can deal their damning blows. Raytheon It will be interesting to see what the MALD concept morphs into in the coming years. Larger and longer-ranged optionally reusable cruise missile/drones may replicate some of MALD-X’s capabilities in the future, namely the air-launched and recovered Gremlins program that DARPA is working on today along with concepts like Kratos XQ-222 and the Air Force Research Lab’s Gray Wolf missile initiative. Whereas MALD has been designed with the combat radius of a fighter and tactical strikes in mind, these weapons may provide a better option for projecting similar capabilities even deeper into enemy territory. This could assist in strikes aimed at the heart of an enemy’s command and control, data-fusion, and war fighting machine that would be carried out by long-range bombers such as the upcoming B-21 Raider. It’s also quite logical to assume that MALD, now in a more modular and adaptable form than ever before, will also add a kinetic attack option in the future. One in which its jammer is replaced with a warhead. By mixing explosive MALDs with a higher-end electronic warfare MALDs, formations of these missiles could destroy enemy air defenses in their path as well as jam them. Ideally, since MALDs are on a one-way trip anyway, incorporating a small warhead into electronic warfare capable MALD-X/Ns would make even more sense. That way they can attack targets if need be or at the end of their flights, self destruct in flight. The bottom line is that MALD is one of the biggest little programs going on in the entire Pentagon’s air warfare portfolio. It represents a critical capability that will become more important with each passing year. Stealth, networking, and standoff kinetic weapons aren’t an antidote for what will be the increasingly complex problem of successfully piercing into anti-access combat environments. MALD-X, and what comes after it, is also a major part of this solution. With all this in mind, it is really exciting news that MALD-X is in flight testing. Its existence should lead to a more rapid evolutionary pace for the concept and quicker fielding of new capabilities in an operational form. And that is great news for America and really nasty news for its potential enemies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 21, 2018",USAF Bomb Disposal Units Will Soon Get Laser-Armed Trucks To Rapidly Clear Mined Airfields,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is getting closer to actually fielding a vehicle-mounted laser weapon that will help it clear airfields full of mines, submunitions, or other unexplored ordnance rapidly after an attack. The Recovery of Airbase Denied by Ordnance system, or RADBO, could also serve as a stepping stone to wider spread use of ground-based directed energy weapons for mine-clearing and other missions across the U.S. military. Earlier in August 2018, the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) posted a video online covering the RADBO vehicle and showing it zapping targets during various tests. It is the latest evolution of vehicle-mounted lasers that have been ongoing for more than three decades now. “RADBO is the first Department of Defense ground-based laser system being placed into production,” Marshall Dutton, the EOD Modernization Program Manager at AFCEC, said in the video. “It’s gonna be a huge game changer for us so that we can get our airmen and our aircraft back in the fight,” U.S. Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Doug Moore, the service’s EOD Career Field Manager, added. In its present guise, RADBO is a 4×4 Cougar Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MPAP) vehicle with a three-kilowatt Zeus III laser in a remotely-controlled turret on top and a second alternator to provide the requisite power. The truck also has an extendable arm so that personnel can move debris and other objects weighing up to 50 pounds while sitting safely inside its armored shell. The Zeus III is powerful enough to detonate any residual explosives inside bombs, small submunitions from cluster bombs, land mines, and other improvised devices. It can hit targets over 980 feet away from the vehicle, allowing EOD personnel to quickly defuse threats from a safe distance without first having to physically inspect the object while wearing a heavy and bulky protective suit or use relatively expensive robots to do so remotely. “RADBO has proven itself to be an all-weather capability,” AFCEC’s Dutton noted in the video. “It’s been tested against blowing wind, heat and cold, sand, the whole nine yards.” Attacking runways to hamper an opponent’s air operations is an established tactic that the United States itself has engaged in during many conflicts. After U.S. military strikes against Shayrat Air Base in Syria in April 2017, the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad was able to quickly resume normal activities there in no small part because the runways and taxiways went unscathed. A close up of RADBO’s Zeus III laser turret., USAF Typically strikes to crater runways and taxiways and make them unusable get paired with other area denial weaponry, such as artillery shells or cluster bombs full of scatterable mines , to slow down repair crews. Any unexploded ordnance would be a hazard, too. “Currently, if a runway gets hit, it can take days to weeks to get cleared,” Dutton, the Program Manager at AFCEC, said in an interview back in 2015 . These strikes can hamper air operations from a base or bring them to a halt altogether. This, in turn, limits the ability of forces at those facilities to conduct offensive air strikes and combat air patrol, as well as defend the base from follow-on attacks. It’s hardly a new threat, but there have historically been limited safe and practical options to speed up the process of clearing any hazards. During the first Gulf War, the Air Force feared that Saddam Hussein might try to launch Scud ballistic missiles at various air bases in the region to try to stop U.S. air strikes. In response, the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional) in Doha, Qatar managed to acquire two M60A3 Patton tanks fitted with bulldozer blades form the U.S. Army as one interim solution. It’s not clear how well the airmen of the “401st Armored Squadron,” who had little training just in driving the heavy armored vehicles at all, would have fared and thankfully the missile attacks never came. An airman from the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing sits on top of an M60A3 tank during Operation Desert Storm., Michael P. Kopack via Wikimedia The experience certainly wasn’t lost on the Air Force, which had first begun looking at lasers as a way to speed up EOD work in the 1980s. In 1996, the service, in cooperation with the Army, began developing the first generation of Zeus laser. In 2003, the Army sent modified Humvee carrying a prototype of the directed energy weapon, known variously as the High-Energy Laser Ordnance Negation System or the Humvee Laser Ordnance Neutralization System, both abbreviated HLONS, to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. During that deployment, it blasted more than 200 objects, according to official reports. The Army sent the Zeus-HLONS truck back to Afghanistan in 2005 to evaluate improvements to the design. The service said that it neutralized more than 1,600 unexploded munitions during that deployment, according to the July-August 2005 issue of Army AL&T magazine . The prototype Humvee-based HLONS zaps a target in Afghanistan., US Army The MRAP-based RADBO is a significant improvement over that vehicle. In addition to the improved Zeus III laser and other systems, the vehicle itself simply offers additional basic protection over an up-armored Humvee that would let EOD personnel conduct their operations even under a certain risk of continuing attacks. The Air Force’s long-standing plans have been to send the first of 14 planned production RADBO vehicles to bases in the Middle East and Afghanistan. There the most likely threats they would be responding to would be terrorist and insurgent attacks using improvised rockets, mortars, and other light artillery weapons, which remain very real threats. At Middle Eastern air bases, they would also be well positioned to respond to a larger crisis with Iran, which could potentially involve a barrage of ballistic missiles with various payloads. Non-state actors, such as the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen , are also increasing their ballistic missile and other stand-off capabilities that could threaten American facilities during a conflict. But RADBO would also be useful during any high-end conflict, including in Europe or the Pacific, where a potential opponent, such as Russia or China, would very likely seek to neutralize air bases where American forces, or their allies, are operating from. I could help mitigate the impact of additional pre-emptive strikes against bare bases , or even highways , that friendly commanders might be planning to use as secondary dispersal sites. Without access to those locations, U.S. forces and their partners might end up presenting a prime target, bunched up together at a smaller number of large facilities. A US Air Force EOD airman prepares to move an inert rocket from the tarmac at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey during a training exercise. With RADBO, personnel could quickly neutralize this kind of threat and then rapidly clear it from a runway or taxiway., USAF The laser-armed MRAPs will also be the first tangible example of a broader push across the U.S. military to field various ground-based directed energy weapons in a number of roles, including for defending against small drones. The Army is looking to field a much more powerful 100-kilowatt design to defend against unmanned aircraft, cruise missiles, and artillery shells, rockets, and mortar rounds. If the Air Force deems the deployments in the Middle East to be successful, it could lead to larger purchases of the bomb-zapping trucks, as well. RADBO itself could be adaptable to mine-clearing and other roles across the services far removed from established bases. In the tests in Afghanistan, the Army had already shown that the Zeus-HLONS combination could be valuable for quickly blasting roadside bombs and other similar battlefield threats. However the RADBO system and the Zeus laser continue to evolve, the Air Force’s EOD look set to finally get the system into service after decades of research and development and they’ll be the first to have an operational directed energy weapon ready for routine use.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. My looming anxiety surrounding the production of Top Gun 2 , officially titled Top Gun: Maverick , melted away in a plume of afterburning jet engine exhaust today when I heard that news that Ed Harris and John Hamm have signed on to the film. Both of these actors are awesome. Ed Harris, in particular, would be perfectly cast as the salty Naval Aviator and command type who lays down the law with icy confidence. In fact, there is a bit of James Tolkan and Tom Skerritt in Ed Harris. Harris just put in an absolutely amazing performance in the second season of Westworld. There simply isn’t a plausible reality where one can get enough of his acting chops. John Hamm, I mean come on, the dude screams fighter pilot and he can do comedy or drama really well. I don’t know how to call this one. He has great success at both but his time as serious ad-man Don Draper was legendary . AMC Above all else, having these two join the film adds a lot of credibility to the production and really gets me excited wondering about their talents will be used. Also onboard are Jennifer Connoly and of course Val Kilmer reprising his role of the Ice Man. Probably the player that will get the most screen time after Tom Cruise will be Miles Teller as the young fighter-flying foil to a more seasoned Maverick. Teller has built up an impressive number of credits in recent years and I find him likable and relatable on screen. Other announced players include Glen Powell who already played Astronaut John Glenn in Hidden Figures , and Lewis Pullman , son of Bill Pullman, is also going to be in the film. Ice Man returns in the upcoming Top Gun sequel. , Paramount Joe Kosinski, who directed Oblivion , a sci-fi flick I enjoyed, is taking the directorial reigns on the Top Gun sequel. He also did the Tron reboot, which sucked, but the visuals were cool and it has one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Again, both good signs when it comes to directing a sequel of Top Gun, which relied heavily on both those elements to capture the audience’s attention. Since the movie was announced a go, it wasn’t clear if the production team was going to cast lesser-known actors in a similar fashion as its predecessor, but that doesn’t seem to be the case, at least for its core group of players. The entire idea of what Top Gun is has evolved in the three decades after it hit theaters, so taking a bit more mature casting approach does make some sense. Kosinski worked with Cruise on Oblivion ., Universal Pictures The film is already in early production. Currently, there is a 15 person crew shooting aboard the USS Abraham Lincon (CVN-72) in the Atlantic. There aren’t any actors onboard but they are shooting flight operations. Highlights from Twitter's defense community's responses to Tom Cruise's Top Gun 2 teaser: https://t.co/qlhrgFz9aH — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) May 31, 2018 One of the biggest questions that remains is how exactly will the aerial fight sequences be captured and portrayed? The F-14 Tomcat in itself became a star of the original film via the air-to-air cinematography that took incredible coordination between aircrews to capture. One has to fear that the sequel’s flight scenes will be left to CGI which could drastically decrease the quality and longevity of the film. Doing so may be a thrifty choice but it would be a huge mistake, especially in an age of GoPro hero cams, modular HD podded camera systems , and specially outfitted jets that are modified just for air-to-air cinematography. There is also the question of plot. Will this be a cautionary tale about the realities of unmanned warfare and man’s place in the future aerial combat? That movie has already been done . Will it be one about confronting the son of a lost friend and RIO that has become a colleague for better or worse? That movie has also been done in various guises. Top Gun 2 would be wise to take a path not taken and not to tread directly where others have in the hopes that the film will be a success because, well, it’s a Top Gun sequel. The timing is also a bit concerning. This film is supposed to hit theaters in less than 11 months, with a July 2019 release date already locked in. There is clearly a lot to do in not a lot of time. But even with all these reservations, we are seeing some good signs that Top Gun: Maverick has a shot at being something special, or at the very least, a fun trip down memory lane with a few quality twists thrown in. And possibly, just possibly, the door will be left open for the franchise to expand into future films. We’ll keep you up to date as production continues to spin-up.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 3, 2018",NASA’s X-59A Quiet Supersonic Test Jet Will Have Zero Forward Visibility For Its Pilot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new video from National Aeronautics and Space Administration offers a look at what the cockpit on Lockheed Martin’s still-in-development X-59A Quiet Supersonic Transport test bed, or QueSST, might look like. Due to the nature of the design, the pilot will use high-resolution video cameras to “see” forward through the front of the fuselage, which could become a more common design element on future manned commercial and military high-speed aircraft . NASA released the footage on YouTube on Aug. 23, 2018, as part of a larger video presentation about the progress of the overall Low-Boom Flight Demonstration (LBFD) program. At present, the goal is for the X-59A to make its first flight in 2021, after which it will undergo around a year of extensive “Phase 1” flight testing.  During phases 2 and 3, which are set to run between the end of 2022 and the end of 2023, scientists and engineers will examine just how well the aircraft’s design mitigates the impact of sonic booms and then survey the public about whether or not they feel the plane produces an acceptable amount of noise. “Right now, when it comes to sonic boom overland flight, it’s [the Federal Aviation Administration regulations] based on just a speed. Right now, it is for civil aircraft, thou shall not go over Mach 1 [the speed of sound],” David Nils Larson, NASA’s chief test pilot at the Armstrong Flight Research Center, which is situated within Edwards Air Force Base in California, said in the new video. “What we want to do, is we want to change that regulation and base it on the noise and not on just an arbitrary speed.” Footage showing a mockup of the X-59A’s cockpit design appears starting at around the 2:10 mark in the video below. The X-59A’s planform is designed to turn a sonic boom, which is both extremely loud and can sends out a shockwave that can physical cause damage, into more of a “ sonic thump .” Specifically, the plane will hopefully be able to fly at a speed of Mach 1.4 and an altitude of 55,000 feet with individuals on the ground experiencing something akin to an extra “heartbeat.” In a typical aircraft design, shockwaves begin to bunch up behind the plane as it reaches transonic speeds near the speed of sound. As it breaks the sound barrier, the supersonic shockwaves smack into each other, creating the sonic boom . The X-59A’s shape, based on decades of previous research into the formation of sonic booms, is supposed to send those waves into different directions to prevent them from hitting each other. This, in turn, mitigates the resulting noise and physical impact. The video below includes footage of a NASA F/A-18 Hornet producing sonic booms during a public event in 2018. “Instead of getting a loud boom-boom, you’re going to get at least two quiet thump-thump sounds,” Ed Haering, an engineer at the Armstrong Flight Research Center, said in an official interview earlier in 2018. That’s “if you even hear them at all,” he added. The problem is that creating the right shape has made it impossible to include a traditional front windscreen on the QueSST. The pilot will have an extremely limited ability to see out to the side and rear, as well. Thanks to a technique called “ schlieren ” photography, one can see the shockwaves building around a T-38 Talon jet training aircraft in this image., NASA “There’s a big bunch of the field that would be blocked by the nose itself,” Nils Larson, the NASA test pilot, explained in the LBFD program video. “Well, the FVS [forward vision system] camera’s on the bottom, so they can actually kind of fill in that whole picture and make it look like I don’t have a nose on the airplane at all.” It’s important to note that many commercial and private jet aircraft have enhanced flight vision systems, also known as EFVS or EVS, that incorporate a front-mounted camera to improve situational awareness. However, none of them replace the windscreen entirely. When it comes to supersonic aircraft, the size and shape of the nose has long been an issue in general, regardless of any attempts to reduce the impact of sonic booms, too. The Anglo-French Concorde and Soviet Tu-144 supersonic airliners both featured complicated articulating nose cones that would “droop” and a “visor windowed fairing would lower during takeoff and landing to give pilots adequate downward visibility. Ultra-high speed military aircraft, such as Lockheed’s SR-71 , have also notably had limited visibility, which adds to the challenges of flying them. It’s not surprising that plans for future supersonic and hypersonic intelligence gathering platforms have been increasingly trending toward unmanned or pilot-optional configurations. For any supersonic aircraft design that doesn’t seek to remove the pilot from the cockpit entirely, a high-resolution camera system would offer a simpler way to provide an adequate field of vision than any sort of articulating fuselage. It could also allow designers to make it easier for pilots to “see” in any direction without potentially having to compromise the aircraft’s aerodynamics or sonic boom mitigation qualities. However, relying on a single camera for the X-59A’s forward vision could create a lack of depth perception that might make the aircraft differently complicated to fly. A possible solution to that issue might be to employ a more comprehensive three-dimensional augmented vision system, such as the one found on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . Still, if the X-59A’s final configuration proves to be both workable and practical, it could easily inform any future manned supersonic aircraft designs for both commercial and military applications. In December 2017, Lockheed Martin teamed up with the Aerion Corporation to continue development of the latter firm’s AS2 supersonic business jet . At present, the AS2 has a relatively traditional design with an elongated nose. Aerion also says that its plan is for the aircraft to cruise at a transonic speed just below Mach 1, to avoid sonic booms entirely. “Depending on atmospheric conditions, principally temperature and wind,” the plane might be able to get up to Mach 1.2 without causing any disruptions, according to the company’s website . An artist’s conception of the AS2 supersonic business jet., Aerion Using lessons learned from the X-59A, including the nose shape and camera system from the pilots, it might be possible for the two partners to refine this design to reach higher speeds without the noise. The AS2 already has a host of potential military applications, which we at The War Zone have examined in detail here , and the revised planform might make it more effective and discreet, at least compared to traditional aircraft flying at supersonic speeds, in many of those roles. “Once we clear the way for a new regulation, then, basically, aircraft manufacturers can say ‘hey, if I can build to that regulation, I can go build a whole new class of aircraft that’ll get people … from point A to point B twice as fast,” NASA test pilot Nils Larson noted in the video presentation. “When you look at it [the X-59A], you’re looking and going ‘hey, this is that future we were promised 30 or 40 years ago.” It will definitely be exciting to see where the QueSST concept and NASA’s LBFD program lead future aircraft designs regardless. Depending on how the project goes, we may not have to wait much longer for a new class of practical supersonic aircraft piloted by crews who can’t actually see out of the front of the plane.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 27, 2018",Here’s The Army’s Plan For Making Its Apaches More Capable At Sea And Deadlier Overall,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has released new details about its plans for improving the AH-64E Apache attack helicopter as part of the future Version 6 upgrade package. The updates will include a major boost in the gunship’s maritime capabilities , make it easier for them to team up with a much broader range of unmanned aircraft, and improve the helicopter’s general ability to collect and share information, engage hostile targets, and avoid threats. The Army’s Apache Attack Helicopter Project Office shared the details as part of a briefing to industry partners, which Twitter user @MIL_STD then posted online on Aug. 18, 2018. The presentation shows that the service completed integrating the Version 4.5 capabilities into the AH-64E fleet in 2017 and plans to finish with the Version 6 updates by 2026. The Army first began receiving AH-64Es, previously known as the AH-64D Block III and also called the Apache Guardian, in 2011. The helicopter will remain the service’s primary attack helicopter through at least 2048, though the gunship version of the Future Vertical Lift family of aircraft is supposed to reach initial operational capability in 2034, according to the Apache Project Office’s briefing. As such, it will be important for the Army to continue modernizing the Apaches in the meantime to keep up with existing and future threats. Previous updates have already added Link 16 data links , new communication and communication relay systems, the ability to operate as a manned-unmanned team with other pilotless aircraft, and the ability to carry external fuel tanks to extend the helicopter’s range, among other improvements. An overview of capability additions to the AH-64E since its introduction in 2011., US Army via @MIL_STD The Version 6 package is particularly interesting for its emphasis on over-water combat, which is not something one might necessarily expect the Army to be worried about now or in the future. However, with increasing potential operations from bases on land in and around constrained waterways, such as the Strait of Hormuz or the Baltic Sea , or distributed and expeditionary operations that could involve flying from ships or sea bases , such as in broad expanse of the Pacific region , the service has been steadily more aware of possible maritime missions for the gunships for years now . “Current and potential future conflicts mandate the need for the Apache to counter enemy anti-access/area denial [threats] such as unmanned aircraft, amphibious assault vehicles and hovercraft, at extended ranges and under adverse weather conditions,” another official document, specifically describing planned upgrades to the helicopter’s AN/APG-78 Longbow radar , explained, according to a 2016 story from AINonline . The Version 6 configuration will feature an updated version of the mast-mounted Longbow that can better spot and engage maritime targets and small unmanned aircraft, as well as just double the range of the system, which is presently around five miles. AH-64s fly near the sea base USS Ponce, which the US Navy retired in 2017, during a training exercise in the Middle East., USN An update to the AN/APR-48B Modernized Radar Frequency Interferometer (MRFI) electronic warfare system will also improve the Apache’s ability to identify unspecified “maritime threats.” Other updates to this system will give the helicopters better electronic support measures and targeting capabilities in general, allowing it to more accurately determine range and geo-location of potential threats, such as radars associated with surface-to-air missile systems, and other emitters. There will be upgrades to the AN/ARC-231 multi-mode digital radio to better support over-water missions, as well. Version 6 AH-64Es will also be able to combine these updates with increased capabilities for manned-unmanned teaming. The updated Apaches will have the Manned-Unmanned Teaming-Extended (MUMT-X) system, which extends the range at which the helicopters can share data with drones and allows the crew to interact with a more diverse group of unmanned aircraft – possibly including an advanced, pilot-optional scout rotorcraft and other future tactical unmanned aircraft that the Army is exploring now – using C, L, Ku, and S band data links. A visual representation of the AH-64E’s components that will recieve upgrades as part of the Version 6 package., US Army via @MIL_STD “Right now, the requirement that was written for us was to talk to tactical common data link systems, which is the [MQ-1C] Gray Eagle and the [RQ-7B] Shadow V2. We can talk to those systems today,” then-Apache Project Manager U.S. Army Colonel Jeffrey Hager told reporters in 2016 . “In a few short years, we’ll be the first airframe to talk to any systems out there on the battlefield, and that includes naval security assets, the Marines – anything that’s flying out in the airspace, they’ll be able to capture that data.” A built-in air-to-air-to-ground relay in MUMT-X, based on the Rover data link , means the Apaches will be able to send video feeds and other data from those drones straight to personnel on the ground or ships below, as well. The Army demonstrated the ability of an existing AH-64E, together with an MQ-1C Grey Eagle unmanned aircraft, to provide stand-off targeting support to artillery units ashore and a communications relay for ships at sea during the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018 exercise. This also again highlighted the gunship’s existing maritime capabilities. The Version 6 package isn’t limited to expanded over-water and manned-unmanned capabilities, though. It includes a host of other updates across the AH-64Es other systems, as well. The helicopter’s nose-mounted Modern Day Sensor Assembly (M-DSA) sensor turret will get its own boost in its detection range and camera fidelity, with the latter upgrade specifically to help with identifying potential threats at longer distances. The MDSA already includes electro-optical and infrared video cameras, a laser designator, and laser range-finding and spot tracking capabilities. To go along with all the updates to the gunship’s sensor suite, the aircraft will also receive improvements to its Link 16 system and the IDM-401 modem, giving it more capability to share that information, as well as receive other data. The Version 6 aircraft will also be the first to feature the Cognitive Decision Aiding System (CDAS), which is supposed to reduce the workload on the two-person crew. The Army has been looking toward integrating the CDAS capability into the helicopters since it first crafted the requirements for the AH-64D Block III. Though details are limited, the basic description sounds like an artificial intelligence-driven software package that will be able to automate portions of the targeting process and quickly reject false sensor tracks. It may even be able to suggest optimal attack vectors or other courses of action, something other elements of the U.S. military are also looking to integrate into their combat aircraft . A timeline laying out the Army’s complete history and future plans for AH-64 upgrades., US Army via @MIL_STD Conspicuously missing from the discussion of the Version 6’s capabilities is any mention of new weapons. The briefing only says that the improved AH-64Es will be able to use advanced versions of the AGM-114R Hellfire air-to-surface missile and the air-to-air version of the FIM-92 Stinger missile, both of which are already in service. The Army has been made separate improvements to the Stinger’s ability to engage small unmanned aircraft , which could help expand the Apache’s anti-air role. In addition, earlier in 2018, the Army did green-light low-rate initial production of the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM), which is set to eventually replace the Hellfire family entirely. The service has also successfully tested a solid-state laser weapon on the Apache as an option to shoot down small hostile drones. It seems highly likely that these, or other weapon developments, could end up rolled into the Version 6 package in the future. Also absent from the briefing is any mention of the integration of a directional infrared countermeasures ( DIRCM ) system to help the helicopters defend against short-range infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles, though there is a note about updating the AN/AVR-2 laser warning sensors onto the gunships. The Army is already pushing ahead with a program to add DIRCM capability onto the Apaches, but has reportedly experienced a number of setbacks . There have also been discussions about adding a hard-kill active protection system to various U.S. military helicopters and other aircraft. US Army AH-64s in Iraq in 2017. The aircraft in front has DIRCM systems installed on the tips of its stub wings., US Army The Army is also separately working on an Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) that will result in an improved, common engine for both the AH-64 and the UH-60 Black Hawk . However, the Army only plans to begin the turbine’s engineering and manufacturing development phase in 2023, which means it might not be ready for widespread operational use by 2026 when the service wants to finish fielding the Version 6 package. Regardless of whether these additional capabilities make it into the Version 6 AH-64Es, the gunships still look set to receive an impressive array of upgrades that will leave them better equipped to conduct a wide array of different missions in various environments. If the Army does follow through with plans to continue operating the attack helicopters through 2048, it’s very likely that Apache will become even more capable in the decades to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 4, 2021","USAF Upgrading Another C-32 ‘Air Force 2’ Interior For $16M, Here’s What The First Looks Like","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USAF’s announcement that it’s paying a whopping $16M to upgrade the interior on one of its four C-32A special air mission (SAM) ‘distinguished visitor transport’ aircraft, better known by their callsign when the Vice President is onboard, ‘Air Force Two’, has made headlines recently. Those are some big bucks to splurge on creature comforts, but custom private aircraft interiors are not cheap nor are they simple to design, fabricate, and install. The official contract announcement reads : Boeing Co., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has been awarded a $16,072,212 contract for engineering support services for C-32 interior refresh second aircraft. The C-32A interior requirements are for an appearance more commensurate with presidential section of the VC-25A. The requirements necessitate a combination of the following: upgraded interior elements; refurbished interior elements; painting and cleaning; replacing double-seat configuration with triple-seat configuration, aft of Door 3. Work will be performed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and various locations, and is expected to be completed by Aug. 8, 2019. This award is the result of a sole-source acquisition. Fiscal 2018 procurement funds in the amount of $16,072,212 are being obligated at time of award. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, is the contracting activity (FA8106-17-D-0002/ FA8106-18-F-0112). (Awarded Aug. 9, 2018) C-32A, Tyler Rogoway/Author So what will the USAF get for roughly the price of a new Citation Sovereign? We discovered some rare photos of the interior of the first C-32A that was remodeled and it is definitely a major aesthetic enhancement over the existing 1990s-era government-chic, formica-clad, blue and gray interior. Check out the comparison below: Old C-32A interior: State Department State Department White House White House State Department State Department National Archives National Archives National Archives New C-32A interior: Patrick Leahy’s Webpage Patrick Leahy’s Webpage Patrick Leahy’s Webpage White House White House White House These rare photos of C-32A 99-0016’s VC-25 (Air Force One) like interior were taken during Alan Gross’s return flight to the United States after being held captive in Cuba for five years. This flight occurred in 2014, so this would have been the first C-32A upgraded. We found another contract announcement from 2017 that is very similar to the recent one, but in that case at a cost of $18M. The announcement reads: The Boeing Co., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has been awarded a $17,999,843 undefinitized contract action task order (FA8106-17-F-0086) for engineering support services. Contractor will provide engineering support services for refurbishment of the interior for one of the C-32A aircraft. This includes an FAA-approved upgrade to the C-32A interior, consisting of Group A kits for one aircraft First Article, and installation and testing along with the identification and procurement of long lead items for one aircraft.  Work will be predominantly performed in Greenville, Texas, and is expected to be complete by Aug. 31, 2018. This award is the result of a sole-source acquisition. Fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds in the amount of $7,029,193 are being obligated for the task order at the time of award. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, is the contracting activity (FA8106-17-D-0002). Based on this information, the latest interior upgrade contract would be for a third jet out of the fleet of four C-32As. So is all this expenditure worth it? From the information I have, frankly, no. Remodeling the aircraft’s interior entirely seems wasteful. There have been light updates of the interior and technological insertion modifications over the years that did not include a full-on remodel job of these aircraft and the unaltered aircraft still seem perfectly usable in their present configuration. Remember, these are supposed to be working government aircraft, not flying palaces. In addition, the C-32As are in the back-half of their service lives. The USAF is already working at coming up with a plan to replace them—and just as we reported —it will likely include a common base-platform that will also take on the E-6B and E-4B’s role as well. This new single-platform strategy is being called NEAT, an acronym that combines the sought-after missions— National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), Executive Airlift, Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO). This acquisition is still years away, but investing heavily into these aircraft simply to make them more luxurious seems like an outright waste. Defensive countermeasures , avionics, and communications upgrades , on the other hand, are not anywhere near as discretional and the C-32A fleet has received those enhancements in recent years. This upgraded C-32A has enhanced countermeasures, an EVS blister on the nose and a heads-up display. , Tyler Rogoway/Author It’s notable that these aircraft support not just the Vice President, but also the Secretary of State and even the First Lady’s travels, among others, as well as the President’s under certain circumstances. The C-32A fleet has been regularly used to move the President around the eastern United States and especially into tighter airports near his golf resorts that cannot accommodate a VC-25. Getting the President into tight airports and acting as a spare to the VC-25 fleet has always been the mission for the C-32As of the famed 89th Airlift Wing, but moving President Trump around aboard C-32s has been a far more common occurrence than it was with his predecessors. Trump famously owns his own 757-200—the same aircraft that the C-32A is based on—but his jet is far more luxurious. A C-32A is downright pedestrian in comparison and even a VC-25, although far roomier and more luxurious, isn’t nearly as plush as “Trump Force One.” It would be interesting to know if Trump and/or the White House requested better accouterments for shorter trips into smaller airfields. With that this possibility in mind, this line in the contract announcement is interesting, to say the least: “The C-32A interior requirements are for an appearance more commensurate with presidential section of the VC-25A.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=vLB–HFLleI Trump certainly has taken great interest in the aircraft the White House uses and has run negotiations for Air Force One replacement aircraft more or less out of his own pocket, for better or worse . He has even gone so far as dictating what creature comforts will be like on the new 747-8i derived jets as well as how they will appear to the world . So it wouldn’t be that surprising to find out he wanted to make changes to the C-32As he uses quite regularly. I am fascinated with VVIP air transports and especially those that are used by heads of state . I have written more articles than I can remember exploring their intricacies and how they are used in certain situations , including some pretty obscure types , but at a certain point, it all just seems a bit ridiculous. USAF I don’t think updating the surfaces and doing some reconfigurations to the passenger seating areas on a C-32 should be that controversial, but drastically upgrading the ‘distinguished visitor’ section at the cost of many millions of dollars shows a total lack of leadership from the front when it comes to spending control. That’s money that could be spent on other things or not spent at all. But don’t just blame Trump, considering that one of the C-32s was modified before he took office, Obama is likely to blame too, as well as Congress who approves such initiatives. And really, the C-32As are just one small facet of a much larger private jet ecosystem that the Federal Government pays for year after year. How much of the travel it furnishes is really necessary and how it goes about furnishing it is a highly debatable and complex topic we can save for another time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 6, 2018",Marines Need Special Lightning Rods To Shield Their F-35s In Japan From Storms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Among a number of residual issues that remain with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the matter of the jet’s defenses against lightning strikes, or lack thereof, continues to be a particularly vexing issue. For the U.S. Marine Corps and its F-35B variant , thunderstorms are still such a problem that the service is buying special portable lightning rods to help shield the jets when they’re parked outside at bases that otherwise don’t have the necessary infrastructure, which includes Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan . On Aug. 8, 2018, the Marines announced plans to purchase 14 lightning rods through a sole-source contract to LBA Technology, Inc. of Greenville, North Carolina. According to the contracting notice, which the service posted on FedBizOpps , this is the only company that makes systems that the U.S. Military’s main F-35 Joint Program Office has approved for use with the aircraft. “Since the F-35 as a composite type aircraft does not provide inherent passive lightning protection, the lightning rods being requested are needed for deploying aircraft to any expeditionary airfield in support of combat operations or training exercises that do not support all lightning protection requirements for the F-35B,” the Marine Corps said in its justification for giving the deal straight to LBA. “Based upon extensive research from the F-35 Joint Program Office, this is the only lightning rod that meets the established program requirements.” Based on the Marines’ minimum requirements, LBA’s F-35-specific version of its PLP-38-MOB rod can remain upright even in winds of up to 120 miles per hour without needing to be moored to the ground in some fashion. They can also operate in spite of heavy rainfall, ice buildup, or extreme hot and cold temperatures. It is not clear how much each one costs, but a complete PLP-38-MOB kit has a unit price of $18,750, according to LBA’s website . An F-35B from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron One Two One (VMFA-121) hovers during a demonstration at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in 2018., USMC But from the information that is available, we know the lightning protection is absolutely vital if the Marine Corps expects to park its F-35Bs out in the open at bases such as Iwakuni and avoid the hassle of having to move them into hangars or under other suitably protected shelters every time there is the possibility of a thunderstorm. As of 2017, the plane’s manufacturer Lockheed Martin was still finalizing improvements to the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) to properly shield it against the shock of a lightning strike across all variants, according to a routine report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, also known as DOT&E. ALIS is the F-35’s central computer brain, which supports virtually every aspect of its operation from tracking and isolating maintenance issues and the ordering of spare parts to the uploading and downloading a host of mission and sensor data. You can read more about how it functions in more detail here and here . Suffice to say, if the system fails, the jets would be effectively non-functional until technicians could get it up and running again. The rather unassuming PLP-38-MOB portable lighting rod in its deployed configuration., LBA Technology However, there is a far more serious issue linked to the Joint Strike Fighter’s main fuel tank. Combined with the aircraft’s lack of inherent lightning strike protection, it is difficult and complicated to make the fuel system “inert” once the plane is on the ground. What this means is that there is a distinct potential for a build-up of both oxygen and fuel vapors inside fuel tank that could be dangerous by itself. If a bolt of lightning were to hit a non-inert plane on the ground, there could be an increased risk that it would set off an explosion or cause a fire. The problem appears to be especially pronounced on the B model, which features a significantly different internal arrangement from the A and C variants due to the need for a large lift fan assembly. This is an essential component of the jet’s a short and vertical takeoff and landing capability. “The [F-35B] aircraft does not maintain residual inerting after flight for the required interval of 12 hours, which is a lightning protection requirement,” DOT&E reported in 2015 . “If the residual inerting cannot be improved, aircraft maintainers will be required to purge fuel tanks with external nitrogen more frequently or alternative lightning protection strategies (e.g., lightning-protected shelters), will have to be adopted.” One of VMFA-121’s F-35Bs conducts a hot refuel at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in 2017., USMC The next year, DOT&E reported that the F-35 program had made progress on resolving the inerting issue on the B variant, but that some deficiencies remained. There is no mention of inerting the fuel system in any of the subsequent routine reports on the Joint Strike Fighter from the Pentagon’s top testing office. This could imply that all of the parties involved had decided that the issue was resolved or that any pertinent information is now classified. Still, the lightning rod purchase shows that regardless of any improvements to the Marine Corps’ jets, the service decided to implement “alternative lightning protection strategies,” as well. It’s not clear whether the issue has already hampered Marine F-35B operations from Iwakuni since Marine Fighter Attack Squadron One Two One (VMFA-121) first deployed there with its Joint Strike Fighters in 2017. In 2016, VMFA-121 had to cancel a number of F-35B sorties during the Red Flag 16-3 training exercise at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada over concerns about lightning strikes, according to official records we at The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. A month before, thunderstorms, combined with concerns about the inerting issue, temporarily shut down Air Force F-35A operations at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho during a separate drill involving the rapid deployment aircraft from the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. An F-35A from the 388th Fighter Wing., USAF Concerns about mixing the F-35 with lightning have persisted since then, too. In March 2017 , the Royal Australia Air Force kept two F-35As at Avalon Airport near Melbourne for an extra day after an air show over fears about lightning strikes. Poor weather delayed the historical arrival of the first Royal Air Force F-35Bs to the United Kingdom, though the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense insisted that this was a routine precaution that would’ve applied to any aircraft. But regardless of whether or not the safeguards to shield the F-35 against lightning strikes have truly mitigated the issue, the need for lightning rods is a reminder that it remains a serious concern, even at more established bases such as Iwakuni. Deploying F-35s of any type has already proven to be challenging logistically given the complexities of maintaining the aircraft’s stealthy coatings and other advanced features . The need for portable lightning rods only adds another component, along with added costs, to the deployment package necessary to support Joint Strike Fighters during expeditionary operations. This could be even more pronounced when U.S. military, or other F-35 operators, try to make use of bare bases or other austere facilities to quickly disperse the jets during any future conflict or contingency. This is an important selling point for the B model, with its short and vertical takeoff and landing ability, in particular. The only alternatives to deploying lightning protection systems with the jets would be to make potentially expensive upgrades to any facility that might host Joint Strike Fighters or preposition portable lightning rods and any other necessary equipment at those sites. It appears that the Marine Corps has determined that lightning rods are a practical means of setting up lightning protection for its F-35Bs during overseas deployments and expeditionary operations, at least among the options available. Whether or not they can demonstrate that it is a truly a practical means of shielding the jets, especially during short-notice deployments, will be an important test for future Joint Strike Fighter operations around the world. If nothing else, it’s another good reason for pilots to call the jets by their new nickname, Panther , instead of their official moniker, Lightning II.

The mishap occurred at around 12:50 PM local time at Eglin, according to an official press release from the 33rd. The plane, sitting nose down on the tarmac, was visible from a highway outside the base. The Wing oversees U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps Joint Strike Fighter pilot training and the Florida base also hosts foreign F-35 pilot training contingents. “The aircraft landed safely and parked when the front nose gear collapsed. There was one person on board,” the 33rd’s press release added. “Fire crews responded immediately and the pilot suffered no injuries as a result of the incident.” Photographs showed a crash truck positioned near the F-35, but it is not clear whether or not the in-flight emergency (IFE) actually involved a fire. Deploying a firetruck is a standard response during tactical jet IFE recoveries regardless of indications of a fire onboard the stricken jet. But it’s also worth noting that F-35s have experienced engine fires in the past. In 2014, another Air Force F-35A at Eglin suffered a catastrophic blade release in its F135 engine right before takeoff, which led to a massive fire . In 2016, a faulty bracket inside the weapons bay of a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B led to another fire that totaled that aircraft . That same year, a huge gust of wind led to yet another engine fire in an F-35A at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. There are also reports that a second F-35 may have suffered a bird strike that caused physical damage to the outside of the aircraft, although they are unconfirmed at this time. It’s not clear exactly how much damage has been done to the F-35 photographed resting on its nose, but some of the jet’s most complex and sensitive electronics are housed in its nose, including its APG-81 AESA radar and its Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS). The enclosure for the latter system is positioned underneath the nose, which would increase the likelihood of it getting damaged in this incident. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 6, 2018",The Air Force Says It Might Only Buy 20 Light Attack Aircraft In The End,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it still has not yet determined how many light attack planes it might buy, but a senior officer has said it could be fewer than two dozen aircraft. Those deliberations are ongoing as the service continues to insist that any such program will primarily be about delivering this capability to foreign allies and partners . Air Force Magazine was able to get the latest details about the program in separate interviews with U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein and General Ellen Pawlikowski, who is in charge of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). Earlier in August 2018 , the service said it planned to put out a formal solicitation for its Light Attack Aircraft (LAA) program for companies to bid on by the end of the year. The leading contenders to win any such contract are Embraer and Sierra Nevada Corporation’s A-29 Super Tucano and Textron’s AT-6C Wolverine . But Pawlikowski told Air Force Magazine that she thought the Air Force’s purchases for its own use might only amount to “about 20” planes and there would only be limited support for the aircraft. After the reached the point of needing heavy maintenance or otherwise becoming non-airworthy, the service could simply buy an entirely new fleet and send the existing airframes to the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, where they would await potential transfer to a foreign partner. In his interview, Goldfein explained that the Air Force routinely talks with allies and partners who would like to contribute air power to limited military operations in cooperation with the United States, but have limited resources. He described the Light Attack Aircraft program as a way to get those countries, which he did not name, into the fight. A pair of Textron AT-6C Wolverines, one of the designs the US Air Force has been considering as a future light attack aircraft., Textron “I hear over and over again from various air chiefs … who perhaps are not able to get into fourth … or fifth-generation [fighter] aircraft” is a way to take part in coalition air campaigns, Goldfein told Air Force Magazine . Light attack aircraft let them “buy into [a] system … that can enhance [the] alignment of effort.” These two sets of statements run counter to the Air Force’s public overtures of support for a program to buy significant light attack aircraft in recent years. In January 2017, Goldfein himself said a proposal in Senate Armed Services Committee white paper to buy as many as 300 of the planes was a “ great idea .” Senator John McCain was the principal author of that document, which had come out that same month. What the Air Force now seems to be describing is a repeat of the abortive Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) program – something I have said could turn out to be the case for months – under which the service planned to buy a total of 15 light attack planes across the 2012 and 2013 Fiscal Years. After running into a variety of hurdles and in the face of budget cuts, the LAAR finally got the ax in February 2012. There is a clear danger that the new LAA effort could run into the same issues, despite the service’s own acknowledgement that it has needed this capability for decades. To put into context just how similar these two programs are, in 2009, a team within Air Combat Command (ACC) – where General Goldfein was then Director of Operations – proposed purchasing just over 200 LAAR aircraft and using established “off-the-shelf” aircraft designs to help speed up the process and keep costs low. The planes would be for the Air Force’s own use and for delivery to foreign partners as military aid. A Brazilian Air Force A-29 Super Tucano., Brazilian Air Force The Air Force Chief of Staff at the time, General Norton Schwartz, rejected the plan outright, demanding the fleet be reduced to 15 aircraft solely for training foreign pilots and that they never leave the United States. Thus he also banned Air Force pilots from ever operating the planes in combat. At the time, further legal restrictions also prevented conventional Air Force personnel from conducting missions determined to be “building partnership capacity,” a role reserved for the service’s special operations forces. “Persuading Congress to pay for planes that U.S. armed forces would not fly would be a hard sell,” an official ACC history of events in 2009, which the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, stated bluntly. “Rather than retiring high-performance fighters and buying light aircraft, staff members wanted to extend the operational lives of F-15s and F-16s .” Congress’ attitude has changed significantly since then , with legislators having put in millions of dollars for both Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps light attack aircraft in the latest defense spending bill for the 2019 Fiscal Year. It’s not clear if the Air Force’s position has truly shifted, though. A fleet of 20 planes would not be able to realize the economies of scale that are at the core of the light attack concept and would make it a far less cost-effective endeavor. Since some of those planes would likely end up held in reserve or set aside for training purposes, the Air Force wouldn’t be able to take advantage of the ability to widely disperse the aircraft throughout a region to provide more persistent and flexible air support at a lower cost compared to existing combat jets, as well. An F-16C fighter jet heads out on a mission in Afghanistan in March 2018., USAF This, in turn, would do little to ease the strain on aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16C Viper , or their crews. Reducing the number of flight hours that these combat jets are flying in support of limited conflicts has been a major factor in the push for the Air Force to acquire light attack aircraft in the first place. Ironically, General Ellen Pawlikowski also told Air Force Magazine that the costs required to support small fleets of specialized or advanced aircraft are “eating us alive.” This is entirely true and would be a good argument for buying a larger number of light attack planes. Instead, she used this to justify her concept of effectively throwing the light attack aircraft away when they broke down and buying new ones, a mechanism she has described in the past as a way to speed up the procurement process broadly. When it comes to General Goldfein’s comments about increasing foreign capabilities and participation in coalition fights, it’s also hard to understand where the impediments lie in the existing system. As we at The War Zone have noted repeatedly , the U.S. government has facilitated the sale and delivery of various types of light attack aircraft , especially the A-29 Super Tucano , to foreign partners over the past decade without any apparent issue. The Air Force also now has its own A-29s and uses conventional forces to train foreign pilots to fly them in the United States. Deliberately or not, the Air Force seems to be structuring the new LAA program in a way that could leave the planes orphaned without a functional mission or see them just absorbed into existing, non-combat efforts. This is the same basic reality made it easy for service kill the previous LAAR project in 2012 and is similar to the experience of the C-27J Spartan airlifters. In the latter case, following a series of disputes with the U.S. Army and conflicting plans for employing the aircraft, the small transports planes ended up in the boneyard before getting horse traded to other U.S. military services and government agencies. The US Coast Guard was one of the arms of the US government that received C-27J Spartans after the US Air Force pulled them from service., USCG It is possible that proponents of acquiring a light attack capability in Congress could seek to force the Air Force to procure a set number of planes and retain them for its own use, but it might set the stage for a protracted battle between legislators and the service. The two parties have similarly been locked in a fight over the future of the A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft for years now and it has not prevented the Air Force from attempting to circumvent the wishes of lawmakers on multiple occasions . General Goldfein did tell Air Force Magazine that the Air Force likely wouldn’t know how many light attack planes it wants to buy for sure until it can determine foreign interest in the program – another indication of the true nature of the initiative. It is entirely possible that the service will put out the solicitation in December 2018 without having firmed up this number. But if that final figure is as low as General Pawlikowski believes it might be, it could effectively hobble the Air Force’s latest light attack initiative before it even gets going.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 19, 2018",Foreign F-35 Users Spend Millions To Stop Jet’s Computer From Sharing Their Secrets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has received a multi-million dollar contract for work on a firewall that will allow F-35 Joint Strike Fighter operators to prevent the transfer of potentially sensitive information that the jet’s sensors and computer brain scoop up and send back to the United States via a cloud-based network . The development comes as foreign partners in the project become increasingly worried about the data that the aircraft is collecting and storing, but concerns could remain about security breaches or if the links to the system gets cut altogether, especially in the middle of a crisis. The Pentagon announced the deal , which came through the U.S. Navy, the service that is presently in charge of the main F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), on Aug. 17, 2018. The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor is set to receive more than $26 million – all of which is funding from the program’s international partners – to craft what the U.S. military is calling the Sovereign Data Management (SDM) system for the Joint Strike Fighter’s Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS). The contract covers work through June 2020, but it’s not clear if a final version of the new data transfer setup will be ready for operational use by then. “This effort provides F-35 international partners the capability to review and block messages to prevent sovereign data loss,” the Pentagon’s daily contracting announcement explained. “Additionally, the effort includes studies and recommendations to improve the security architecture of ALIS.” As it exists now, ALIS harvests an immense amount of data on the aircraft’s systems, which is supposed to help ground crews identify and fix problems. It also sends that information back to the F-35 JPO and Lockheed Martin’s offices so that specialists can see if parts are wearing out as expected or if there are previously unknown, but common points of failure that might need some sort of modification or upgrade down the line. Lockheed Martin sends out critical software patches via ALIS, as well. An Italian F-35B Joint Strike Fighter., USN But it also handle mission data packages. When the jets return to base, personnel on the ground extract that and other additional information that the aircraft’s sensors may have recorded . during the sortie for debriefing and other analysis. This could include a host of national security secrets, including records of the plane’s flight path and mission profile, communications data, video imagery, electronic signatures and locations of friendly and opposing radars and other emitters, and potential details about a country’s tactics, techniques, and procedures. There has been a separate concern that once any information ended up on Lockheed Martin’s servers, that it could be vulnerable to a cyber attack, either directly against the company or against one of many subcontractors scattered across 45 states and Puerto Rico. Testing in 2017 revealed that known vulnerabilities in F-35 related networks had gone unaddressed, according to the most recent routine review of the program from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. I have laid out the worst case scenario for a breach of ALIS in the past: “The nightmare scenario would involve an opponent causing a disruption during an actual crisis by either actively feeding bad information into the ALIS system or otherwise disabling some portion of it or its overarching architecture. The interconnected nature of the arrangement might allow a localized breach to infect larger segments of the F-35 fleet both in the United States or abroad or vice versa. It’s not hard to imagine the time and energy needed to sort out real inputs and outputs from fake ones hampering or halting operations entirely under the right circumstances. Given the jet’s low-observable characteristics, advanced defensive systems, and other sensors, a cyber attack would be an attractive option for any enemy force. Why would an enemy use a $500,000 air-to-air or surface-to-air missiles and put their personnel and equipment at risk in an attempt to down an F-35 when a simple worm may be able to do the same to a whole fleet of F-35s? It could also do so with plausible deniability, something kinetic weapons are far less adept to.” A member of the US Air Force uses a laptop to access the ALIS components on one of the service’s F-35A jets., USAF So, not surprisingly, the foreign members of the F-35 program are wary of exactly what ALIS might be grabbing and sending back not only to the U.S. government, but to a private company, and then possibly putting at even greater risk of compromise. Even allies don’t typically share all of their secrets and they usually exchange any sensitive information in a way where they can sanitize it to protect their own sources and methods. “Italy, in [this] specific case, wants to preserve its sovereignty on some information, avoiding any unnecessary disclosure,” an unidentified member of the Italian Air Force told FlightGlobal at the Dubai Air Show in 2017. “In order to do so, like other partners do, Italy took some actions to grant an effective use of the weapon system, without disclosing some data that are deemed sensible.” At that time, Italy and Norway had already established a shared software laboratory at the U.S. Air Force’s Eglin Air Force Base in Florida to develop an interim firewall. The SDM, which includes various outside “studies and recommendations,” looks to be the culmination of that effort and others. The Royal Australian Air Force has been pursuing its own separate plans, as well. However, there’s still a question of how much autonomy the additional data transfer system will give F-35 operators. Though Lockheed Martin had reportedly approved countries putting their own initial systems into place and is now designing these new tools, the firm has also been highly protective of ALIS’ code and other associated F-35 systems. As of October 2017, the U.S. military was still locked in deliberations with the company over what information would and wouldn’t be in the jet’s official operator’s manual. An Australian F-35A., USAF So far, only Israel has been able to secure the rights to operate its F-35I Adirs completely independently of ALIS if necessary and to add its own software on top of the system. Other Joint Strike Fighter users will remain dependent on the system even with the SDM. The F-35’s interconnectedness already gives the U.S. government or Lockheed Martin an unprecedented level of export control. ALIS offers a way to cut off the distribution of software updates and important mission data to foreign operators, as well as possibly serve as an entryway for an offensive cyber attack to completely disable certain jets. Since ALIS identifies maintenance issues and helps order spare parts, it could make maintaining the already complex jets difficult, if not impossible. These are all things we at The War Zone discussed at length in the past here . The most obvious example of how the U.S. government might seek to use this capability is in its present diplomatic spat with Turkey, which includes a dispute over the latter country’s purchase of Russian S-400 surface to air missile systems. The U.S. military, as well as other F-35 operators, particularly other NATO members, are concerned that this could expose secrets about the Joint Strike Fighter’s capabilities to the Russians. In the U.S. defense spending bill for the 2019 Fiscal Year, which President Donald Trump made law earlier in August 2018, Congress demanded a halt to any cooperation with the Turkish government on the F-35, among other weapon systems, until the Pentagon submits a report that includes “an assessment of the operational and counterintelligence risks … and the steps required to mitigate those risks.” The first F-35A for Turkey during a rollout ceremony in June 2018., Lockheed Martin One step could be to use ALIS to limit or block Turkey’s access to Joint Strike Fighter software patches or other data. Of course, Turkey would still need some baseline software to operate the aircraft at all, which Russian technicians could seek to acquire access to, and there might just be opportunities to see how capable the S-400’s radars are or aren’t at spotting and tracking the stealthy jets. Another option might be to use ALIS as a sort of counterintelligence tool to more tightly monitor Turkish activities with the jets, such as when, where, and how they’re flying them, for potential threats. The Pentagon, which remains publicly supportive of continued cooperation with its Turkish counterparts, will likely present legislators with a variety of step to try to safeguard sensitive details about the F-35s. These same issues could crop up if the U.S. government decides to allow additional countries to join the Joint Strike Fighter program. The United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , and India have all expressed interest in the jets in the past and the latter two countries are buying S-400s , as well. There have also been separate concerns that allowing the UAE and Saudi Arabia to buy F-35s could threaten Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region, despite warming ties between the three countries . ALIS could give the U.S. government enhanced safeguards to curtail Emirati or Saudi Joint Strike Fighter operations should the geopolitical situation change. A US Air Force F-35A., USAF So, with or without the SDM, this arrangement continues to present a potential national security concern for any of the foreign F-35 operators. Now that they have secured the new data transfer rights from Lockheed Martin, operators might pursue greater leeway being able to use their jets independent of ALIS. This might just involve developing a mechanism to allow countries to temporarily work around the cloud-based network locally to continue conducting operations in the event of a broad cyber attack or another catastrophic fault in the system or protracted loss of connectivity, all of which could be serious threats during a major conflict. Lockheed Martin could set a time or flight hour limit on how long a country would be able to operate free of ALIS before needing to reconnect or seek some sort of extension from the company. Lockheed Martin has been steadfastly opposed to any plan that might de-link ALIS from the Joint Strike Fighter, which could allow F-35 operators to hire other defense contractors to provide various services during the type’s lifecycle. Still, the new data transfer deal shows that it is willing to make some compromises and might be inclined to try and find further middle ground, especially if it decides to try and entice other countries to join the program. All told, the SDM is an indication that the U.S. government and Lockheed Martin are aware of the need to address security concerns about ALIS among foreign partners in the F-35 program. But it’s also an indication that there may still be a lot of work left to do to meet the demands of all the parties involved in the project.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russia Is Hunting For Its Crashed Nuclear-Powered Cruise Missile And The U.S. Might Be Too,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is reportedly set to launch an operation to recover a prototype of its Burevestnik nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missile that came down in the Barents Sea in 2017. At the same time, the wreckage presents a prime opportunity for other countries, particularly the United States, to gain major insights into its design and true capabilities. CNBC was first to report the Russian expedition, citing unnamed U.S. government sources with knowledge of an American intelligence report on the matter, on Aug. 21, 2018. These individuals said that the Kremlin would dispatch three unspecified ships, including one specially configured to recover the missile’s nuclear reactor, but said there was no set timeline for when the operation would begin or how long it might last. Russia test-fired four Burevestniks in total between November 2017 and February 2018, according to the new information. The longest test flight reportedly lasted over two minutes and saw the weapon travel a total of 22 miles, while the shortest experiment saw the missile fail within seconds, but it still managed to cover a distance of five miles. The missile reportedly uses a nuclear reactor to power its propulsion system, giving it theoretically unlimited range. The Russians have otherwise been very tight-lipped about the design, which read more about here . So, it’s not surprising that they would want to recover any wrecks both to prevent foreign intelligence services from getting their hands on it and to gather more information for their test program. The official video below offers the best views of the Burevestnik cruise missile available to date. Though CNBC did not say which Russian ships might be heading out on the recovery mission, it is very possible that the Yantar might be among them. Officially an “oceanographic research vessel,” this spy ship has specialized equipment that can reportedly tap or cut submarine cables and investigate and retrieve objects from depths of up to 18,000 feet. In 2017, the vessel reportedly sailed off the coast of Syria to recover the remnants of two fighter jets, a Su-33 and a Mig-29KR , that crashed into the Mediterranean Sea during operations from Russia’s aircraft carrier Kuznetsov . In that case, the goal was also, at least in part, to make sure other countries could not retrieve the wrecks for their own purposes. In June 2018, the U.K.’s Royal Navy escorted Yantar through the English Channel as it headed into the North Sea. Pictures showed a Saab SeaEye Tiger deep-sea robot on the ship’s deck. Russia acquired this piece of equipment after the Kursk submarine disaster . The Tiger can reach depths of 3,280 feet and private companies have previously used them to do work at sites with heavy radioactive contamination . The Russian spy ship Yantar ., Almaz Design Bureau It’s not clear what state the missile wreckage, or the weapon’s reactor, might be in. We at The War Zone have previously explored in detail what might happen if these weapons came down on land or over water after reports that they were crashing first emerged earlier in 2018. It’s also worth noting that these apparent failures might have been successes depending on the actual test points and would have provided Russia important information for further development of the Burevestnik regardless. Of course, if the weapon is at all salvageable, the race may be on for the Russians to get it off the bottom of the Barents Sea before anyone else does. The United States has already reportedly been keeping a close eye on the tests and could have a good idea of where the missiles have landed. If they spread any substantial amount of radioactive material when they came down, it might make them even easier to locate. In February 2017, well before the reported test flights, a U.S. Air Force WC-135 atmospheric reconnaissance aircraft was flying around the Barents Sea on what the service has insisted was a routine mission. This coincided with reports of increased radioactivity in the region, but that might have been linked to leaking Russian nuclear waste facilities. That U.S. Navy has its own deep sea intelligence gathering and salvage capabilities, notably the super-secret Seawolf -class submarine the USS Jimmy Carter . In September 2017, again before Russia reportedly began firing Burevestniks, that boat returned to its homeport at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor in Washington State flying a Jolly Roger flag, a symbol representing the completion of a particularly successful mission . The secretive USS Jimmy Carter flying a Jolly Roger flag as it returns to port in September 2017., USN The U.S. government has a long history of trying to steal sensitive Russian equipment from the bottom of the ocean, as well. In the 1970s, the Central Intelligence Agency famously used the Hughes Glomar Explorer to pull a portion of the Soviet Golf II -class ballistic missile submarine K-129 up from the depths of the Pacific Ocean. Getting ahold of or even examining pieces of a Burevestnik, one of six super weapons Russian President Vladimir Putin highlighted in a speech in March 2018, would be a major coup for American intelligence agencies and the U.S. government’s foreign partners. NATO as a whole is also becoming more concerned with Russia’s aggressive policies and various advanced weapons developments, amid threatening training exercises , electronic warfare attacks , and deceptive information operations . All told, it might be worth keeping an eye on Yantar ‘s movements to see if she heads out into the waters above the Arctic Circle any time soon. Update: 5:20pm EST— Canadian analyst Steffan Watkins has found that Russia’s Akademik Primakov , a seismic research vessel has been recently sailing a very deliberate pattern in the Kara Sea , which is to the east of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago . To the west of Novaya Zemlya is the Barents Sea and the area was home to Soviet nuclear weapon testing. It is possible that the initial report of where the missile went down was inaccurate and that it instead crashed into the Kara Sea. However, as Watkins notes, the Akademik Primakov is more likely mapping the region. The Russian company JSC Sevmorneftegeofizika acquired the ship in June 2017 specifically to conduct geological exploration activities in the Arctic Shelf.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 2, 2018",This Video Makes Test Dropping A B61 Nuclear Bomb Look Like An Elegant Dance,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last November, we brought you a rare tour of Tonopah Test Range , a normally shy and sensitive installation located among the USAF’s restricted range in the middle of the Nevada desert. Now Sandia National Labs has posted an incredibly well-produced video showing how all the facets of a nuclear weapons delivery test mission come together in an incredibly elegant fashion. In this case, F-15E Strike Eagles are seen dropping inert B61-3/4 tactical nuclear bombs. In one clip we can see the bomb’s spin-stabilization rockets fire and in a series of others, you can see a parachute deploy. These depict two delivery profiles. The first being a medium altitude delivery and the other a low altitude drop—at 900 feet to be exact. In regards to the latter, during an actual nuclear strike, the parachute would allow the F-15E to make it a safe distance away before detonation, with the warhead detonating at a pre-described height above ground, or in lay-down mode, where the bomb would lay on the ground a finite amount of time before detonating. Yes, it would be one terrible way to go with one of these things splayed out on the ground in front of you shortly before being vaporized by its thermonuclear hellfire . Currently, the new ‘smart’ B61-12 is deep in development, some of which has occurred at Tonopah Test Range. The B61-12 is slated to replace all four B61 variants still in use. The program is so expensive that each of the weapons is literally worth more than its weight in gold! Beyond the ominous nature of the test subject, the video gives a great sense of many of the components that go into a single test and just how heavily instrumented and staffed the range is during these evolutions. Among all the advanced sensors and gear we also see some of the range’s dilapidated infrastructure, which is unsurprising as it has been actively supporting America’s nuclear apparatus, among other duties, for 61 years. What we don’t see is nearby Tonopah Test Range Airport that has its own amazing history. It includes foreign materiel exploitation (FME) programs, acting as the highly clandestine operational home and now the resting place of the F-117 Nighthawk, along with other classified operational and test duties, many of which continue on till this very day. With nuclear weapons experiencing a renaissance of sorts within the Department of Defense, at least for now , Tonopah Test Range’s star is set to shine a bit brighter within the sprawling constellation of test and development facilities that collectively support America’s massive arsenal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",U.S. Helicopter Crash Kills One In Iraq After Reported Special Operations Raid,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A member of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria has died and multiple other individuals on board were injured when their helicopter crashed in Iraq over the weekend, reportedly as the aircraft was heading back to base after a special operations raid. Details surrounding the incident remain limited, but this is the second fatal aviation mishap in Iraq in less than six months and the most recent in a worrisome string of such accidents across the U.S. military that have already killed more than two dozen aviators and other personnel in 2018. The latest crash in Iraq occurred on Aug. 19, 2018, according to an official statement from Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), the coalition command overseeing the campaign against ISIS in the region. Friendly forces quickly recovered all of the individuals and subsequently transported three of them to an unknown location for further medical treatment. The press released added that there was no indication that hostile fire had brought down the aircraft and that the mishap was under investigation. On Aug. 20, 2018, Major Josh Jakes, a spokesperson for U.S. Central Command, which oversees all U.S. military operations in the Middle East, told The War Zone via telephone that there was no additional releasable information concerning the incident, including what type of aircraft was involved, including whether it was a fixed-wing type or a helicopter. U.S. Army Colonel Sean Ryan, the main spokesperson for CJTF-OIR, did refer it as a “helicopter” in a Tweet earlier that day. “Our heartfelt condolence to the family of @CJTFOIR service member who died in a helicopter crash in #Iraq last night,” Ryan wrote. “While the incident was not a result of enemy fire, it further demonstrates the sacrifices of #Coalition service members & and the danger they face everyday [sic].” A separate report from Newsweek , citing unnamed U.S. officials, said that the aircraft in question was a U.S. Army MH-60 Black Hawk special operations helicopter from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment . It was reportedly returning from a counterterrorism mission somewhere in Iraq or Syria that coalition personnel had conducted with local partner forces. There were 10 U.S. military personnel, including the crew, on the MH-60 when it crashed, according to Newsweek , but there is no indication the helicopter was actually carrying any other coalition or partner forces. After the personnel recovery effort, U.S. officials deemed two of the individuals involved in the crash as “continuing mission,” meaning they had at most light injuries that would not preclude them from immediately returning to duty. An MH-60 from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment prepares to insert personnel on top of building a during a training exercise., US Army Since May 2018 , CJTF-OIR has been working with local Syrian forces under the umbrella of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to isolate and eliminate a pocket of ISIS terrorists along the Iraq-Syria border. This has involved working with the SDF inside Syria on the ground and conducting coordinated air strikes , as well as the establishment of artillery firebases in Iraq to provide additional support. “The ISIS problem is far from over and there’s still a lot of work to be done, both militarily and on civilization [sic] stabilization efforts in both countries,” Colonel Ryan told reporters on Aug. 14, 2018 . “Make no mistake: The coalition is not talking victory or taking our foot off the gas in working with our partners.” A US Army soldier fires an M777 155mm howitzer along the Iraqi-Syrian border in support of Operation Roundup in June 2018., US Army The U.S.-coalition and its partners in Syria were heavily involved in operations along the border before May 2018, though, and this is the second helicopter accident to occur in the area. In March 2018, a U.S. Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopter crashed near Al Qaim , situated right on the Iraqi-Syrian border, killing all seven individuals on the aircraft. The Air Force has not publicly disclosed the exact reasons for that crash, but the Pave Hawk fleet has been in an increasingly poor state in recent years. On Aug. 16, 2018, the Government Accountability Office released a report stating that between 2013 and 2018, the average number of flight hours on each of the service’s nearly 100 HH-60Gs had increased by some 20 percent. A US Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk., USAF The helicopter’s original service life was around 6,000 flight hours, but the average flight time on each airframe across the entire fleet at present is more than 7,100 hours. Some training aircraft had logged more than 10,000 flight hours. During the 2017 fiscal year, less than 70 percent of the Pave Hawks were airworthy at any one time with the most common maintenance issues having to do with the airframes, turboshaft engines, and flight controls – all particularly essential components of the aircraft. There is far less granular information available on the state of the Army’s special operations MH-60s, but, in August 2017, another one of the 160th’s Black Hawks crashed during a training mission off the coast of Yemen. That mishap killed one of the crew, but U.S. forces rescued the other five personnel on board. A table showing a breakdown of average flight hours across the Air Force’s HH-60G Pave Hawk fleet as of May 2018., GAO The U.S. military’s special operations community, including units such as the 160th, has been heavily engaged for years supporting campaigns against terrorists across the world and there are increasing concerns about the readiness of America’s elite units. At the same time, there has been a serious spike in aviation accidents across the U.S. military. In the defense spending bill for the 2019 fiscal year, which President Donald Trump signed into law earlier in August 2018, Congress included a provision demanding a military aviation readiness review across the services. The report, which legislators want in their hands no later than this time next year, must include a detailed analysis of aircrew training requirements, how aviators get promoted and advance in their careers, the impact of significant operational demands on readiness, and whether aviation units are properly structured and manned to meet those demands. It will be interesting to see that report’s findings given that the top leadership at the Pentagon and officials from the different service branches had repeatedly insisted there is no “crisis” in U.S. military aviation. Regardless, with this latest accident in Iraq, 2018 only continues to be a particularly deadly year for American military aviation communities. Update: 8/21/2018 — The U.S. military has identified the individual who died in the crash as U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 3 Taylor J. Galvin, who was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 160th Special Operation Aviation Regiment based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He was on his ninth deployment since joining the Army in 2003.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Air Force and Navy struggle to find the sources of persistent reports of pilots not getting enough oxygen and suffering “hypoxia-like” symptoms when flying a variety of different aircraft, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has recently kicked off a new program to help out. NASA pilots will fly various aircraft, including ex-U.S. military F/A-18A/B Hornet and F-15D Eagle jets, to gather important baseline information on how the human body responds to various flight conditions, especially when it comes to breathing . The flight tests at the Armstrong Flight Research Center, situated within the Air Force’s Edwards Air Force Base in California, began on Aug. 3, 2018 . The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) at the Langley Research Center in Virginia is managing the program. Five NASA pilots will fly a total of 160 hours performing various maneuvers, from routine flight through “benign environments” to complex and strenuous high-altitude aerobatics and combat-style maneuvering. “As a retired Air Force fighter pilot, I understand the military mission and the environment in which our pilots need to operate,” NASA pilot Jim Less said in an interview for an official feature on the project. “It is my hope that the data we gather will increase our understanding of the physiology of flying high-performance fighters and will allow the military to resolve the problems they’ve been having with physiological events.” A physiological event, or physiological episode, also known as a P.E., is how the U.S. military describes an incident where a pilot reports one or more serious symptoms, including severe headaches, blurred vision, confusion, disorientation, or even blacking out temporarily. These are often associated with hypoxia , or a lack of adequate oxygen to the brain, though there can be other contributing factors, as well. A NASA F/A-18A Hornet., USAF The pilots will wear a VigiLOX oxygen monitoring system, which defense contractor Cobham is supplying, in addition to their normal oxygen mask. This system is able to collect data about the pilot’s physiological condition, breathing, and the environmental condition in the cockpit and transmit it to personnel on the ground in real time. The Air Force and Navy have focused much of their efforts in exploring the potential for faults in the onboard oxygen generation systems (OBOGS) that delivers air to pilots in most modern fighter jets, as well as other aircraft, including jet and turboprop trainers, such as the T-45 Goshawk and T-6 Texan II . Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to locate an obvious problem, or collection of problems, that would completely explain away even a majority of the reported instances of hypoxia-like symptoms across various aircraft types. NASA pilot Jim Less tries on the Cobham VigiLOX system together with his normal oxygen mask., NASA “It’s like chasing a ghost,” U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Mike “Nasty” Manazir, then-Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Systems, explained to members of Congress in February 2016. “You can’t figure it out, because the monitoring devices that do this are not on the airplane.” A career naval aviator, Manazir retired from the service in August 2017. He is now Vice President, Navy Systems, The Boeing Company, which manufactured the F/A-18 Hornet and continues to make the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler , the latter two types being front and center in the crisis of reported hypoxia-like symptoms. NASA doesn’t expect to identify any actual root causes that result in P.E.s, but instead hopes to offer a better overall understanding of how a human body is supposed to act in the cockpit of modern U.S. military fighter jets. The present program at the Armstrong Flight Research Center builds off NESC’s own experience of independently assessing a Navy study regarding reports of hypoxia-like symptoms in 2017. From back to front, Boeing’s F/A-18E Super Hornet, F/A-18F Super Hornet, and EA-18G Growler., Boeing “We found that there has been very little investigation surrounding the human in the cockpit,” NESC principal engineer Clinton Cragg told members of Congress earlier in 2018 . “We don’t have the amount of oxygen in his mask, the amount of CO2 [ carbon dioxcide ] in his mask, the pressure you’d want to know about in the cockpit, nor the pilot’s breathing rates. Those types of things are what could help us do a full physiological assessment of what’s happening to the pilot.” NASA wouldn’t necessarily be able to help determine the actual cause of hypoxia-like episodes in current U.S. military aircraft if it wanted to anyway. Its F/A-18A/B and F-15D aircraft have liquid oxygen (LOX) systems versus the newer computer-controlled OBOGS found on more modern fighter jets , which produce their own oxygen in flight. But NESC believes this will actually be a benefit in the testing, since NASA will be able to establish a baseline of what one could expect a pilot to have experienced in jets without OBOGS. Those aircraft have generally not seen the same spike in reported P.E.s in recent years and problems with LOX systems have proven easier to diagnose . As such, NASA’s information could also help the Air Force and the Navy further isolate possible sources of trouble in newer aircraft by eliminating potential factors also present in older planes where pilots have not complained about trouble breathing. A NASA F-15D Eagle., NASA Any additional information NASA can provide will help to some degree. Despite years of attempts by the Air Force and Navy to identify and address the root causes, P.E.s remain a persistent and potentially deadly danger for pilots in a wide array of different aircraft types, including the  – and that doesn’t look set to change any time soon. In May 2018, an F/A-18E Super Hornet from the USS Harry S. Truman ‘s air wing had to divert to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey after experiencing hypoxia-like symptoms during a mission over Syria. Earlier in August, Aviation Week reported that the Air Force’s T-6 trainer fleet was still averaging nearly 8 P.E.s every month since the planes returned to the skies in February 2018 after having been grounded over the issue. This story came soon after Lieutenant General Steven Kwast, head of Air Education and Training Command, insisted the problem was months away from being solved for good in July 2018. The officer told Air Force Times that investigations had shown that pilots in the Texan IIs had experienced more fluctuation in the flow of oxygen during various situations than the Air Force had expected. A US Air Force T-6 Texan II trainer., USAF “So the question is, what does that do to the human body, when you have a fluctuation of oxygen?” Kwast said. “That’s the kind of work they’re doing as they discover something that is a little … different than what we thought. Because we’re measuring it with more precision; we do the work, the scientific method [to find out] ‘What does that mean?’” This is exactly the sort of baseline information NASA is hoping to collect in its study. Hopefully, this new data will help the Air Force and the Navy to better understand the source or sources of these issues so they can solve them once and for all.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 28, 2018",Exploding Engine Caused Aussie EA-18G Growler Crash At Nellis AFB Last January,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are finally getting information as to the cause of a bizarre mishap at Nellis AFB back in January in which a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) EA-18G Growler burst into flames and skidded off the runway. A RAAF investigation has concluded that one of the electronic warfare aircraft’s General Electric F414 turbofan engines experienced an uncontained catastrophic failure. The explosion sent shards of the engine’s fan blades ripping through the jet, which sparked off a fire that damaged the aircraft beyond repair. The incident occurred right before Red Flag —the USAF’s largest air warfare exercise—was about to get underway. ABC News in Australia reports that the investigation into the incident has wrapped up and was sent to the Chief of Air Force on July 30th, 2018. ABC’s sources state that the loss of the Growler was the “most serious incident of its kind for the Australian Air Force in more than 25 years”—a remarkable claim if accurate. The sources continue on, saying that the engine ‘destroyed itself’ and that the crew is to be commended for staying with the jet to avoid having it careen into rows of nearby aircraft. If the catastrophic engine failure happened just seconds later, the crew would have been committed to taking off and the fuel-laden aircraft would have blown up after flying uncontrolled into the ground following an ejection by its crew. The ABC article describes the damage and how it occurred: “The investigation has confirmed a high-pressure compressor in the Growler’s engine had broken into three major pieces, with one segment piercing through the bottom of the jet and taking a chunk out of the runway. Another piece of the compressor went sideways through the second engine causing severe damage, while the third piece went up and destroyed the right-hand tailfin before flying away and landing some distance from the jet. As the jet came to a halt, the rear fuselage was engulfed in fire, the main undercarriage collapsed, and two of the three ALQ-99 electronic jammer pods it was carrying were severely damaged.” Supposedly, the Australian Defense Department is looking to be made whole financially for their loss now that the jet is deemed beyond economic repair. This will apparently be a convoluted process that may have questionable results. The claim would go through the U.S. Navy according to the ABC report and then on to Boeing who makes the Growler, and eventually to General Electric, who makes the F414 engine. It may even go beyond them to the supplier of the component of the engine that failed. One can see how this could potentially end up being a complex legal blame game that could take a long time to sort out. The RAAF could replace the EA-18G with a new build aircraft or convert one of their F/A-18F Super Hornets from the second batch of 12 jets they ordered to Growler standard. These aircraft were built with the wiring already installed to do so for just this type of contingency and for potential capability reprioritization in the future. RAAF F/A-18A/Bs and an EA-18G., © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence/CPL David Gibbs What the report does not address, and unsurprisingly so, is that while Australia has two dozen Super Hornets and 11 Growlers, the U.S. Navy has hundreds of them. Is there a systemic issue with the powerplants on these aircraft? Even a small batch of them that contain faulty engine parts that could fail at any time could be a big deal for the Navy’s already overstressed tactical fast-jet force, especially now that the Legacy Hornet is no longer going to be deployed by the Navy on cruises. The F/A-18A-D Hornet utilizes a close cousin of the F414, its progenitor the F404, that wouldn’t be impacted by a potential grounding or fix order. U.S. Navy photo by Photographer’s Mate 1st Class Johnnie Robbins So far the Navy has been incredibly tight-lipped about all this, which is a bit concerning considering at face value such an issue could dramatically impact their fighter fleet. It also comes as accusations have been made against General Electric’s primary competitor, Pratt and Whitney, that they have been knowingly selling faulty engines to the Pentagon. According to a report by the Connecticut based Journal Inquirer, the supposed whistleblower claims the following: Pratt “recklessly used inappropriate spray equipment and flawed test methodologies,” and deliberately manipulated test procedures in the manufacture of parts for the F119 engine used exclusively in the Pentagon’s F-22 Raptor fighter jet. Bonzani asserts that Pratt engaged in the “inappropriate” spray procedure specifically in applying the coating on the “knife edge seals used in the engine rotors.” … The flawed process resulted in engines supplied to the Air Force that are “at risk for premature wear and possible catastrophic failure, putting pilots and others at risk,” the lawsuit adds. Apparently, the same person claimed similar processes were also used on the company’s F100 series of fighter jet engines that power some USAF F-15s and F-16s, so they could also be impacted. Pratt and Whitney vehemently denied the whistleblower’s accusations, stating: “There is absolutely no merit to these claims… We intend to defend this case aggressively.” F-22s have had a number of known incidents that point to engine issues as of late, but the USAF has not commented on exactly what was the cause of these incidents as of yet. As for the Navy’s General Electric F414 powered Super Hornets and Growlers, the last loss of one of these aircraft occurred last March when an F/A-18F was struggling to make it back to NAS Key West on one engine before diving into shallow water short of the field. Both crewmen died in that incident. We’ll have to see how all this pans and we are reaching out to the Navy for comment on this report.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 26, 2018",Meet Stratolaunch’s Family Of Space Launch Vehicles For Its Huge ‘Roc’ Mothership,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Space launch firm Stratolaunch has unveiled ambitious plans for four different launch vehicles, including a reusable space plane , to go along with its massive carrier aircraft . The company’s goal is to use the multi-tier concept to provide a cost-effective and relatively quick means of putting payloads weighing more than 13,000 pounds into orbit and potentially bringing other cargo, or even personnel , to and from the Earth’s surface, all of which could be especially useful for military applications. The Washington state-headquartered company, which Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, set up in 2011, announced its latest vision for the Stratolaunch system on Aug. 20, 2018. The planned family of launch vehicles will include Orbital Sciences Corporation’s Pegasus XL, followed by a Medium Launch Vehicle (MLV), a more capable Medium Launch Vehicle-Heavy (MLV-H), and finally, a space plane known as “Black Ice.” “We are excited to share for the first time some details about the development of our own, proprietary Stratolaunch launch vehicles, with which we will offer a flexible launch capability unlike any other,” Jean Floyd, Stratolaunch’s CEO, said in a press release . “Whatever the payload, whatever the orbit, getting your satellite into space will soon be as easy as booking an airline flight.” Orbital Sciences Corporation, previously part of Orbital ATK and now part of Northrop Grumman, first successfully flew the Pegasus back in 1990 and introduced the XL model in 1994. Stratolaunch has long said that this would be one option for getting payloads into space via air launch from its own still-in-development mothership. Scaled Composites, which is building the aircraft, calls it the “ Roc ,” after the mythological bird of prey that was said to be big enough to swoop down and carry away elephants. The Stratolaunch Roc while still under construction in 2017., Stratolaunch. Pegasus XL can carry up to three payloads with a total weight of approximately 815 pounds and put them into a low earth orbit (LEO). Stratolaunch hopes to achieve the first flight of its carrier aircraft with one of these rockets in 2020. Stratolaunch says the Roc will be able to carry up to three of these rockets at once, making it an even more flexible launch option. The MLV, which would hopefully make its first flight in 2022 and is also nicknamed “ Kraken ,” would offer more than nine times the payload capacity using a single rocket motor. The multi-motor MLV-H, which is reportedly in the early stages of development, would be able to lug payloads weighing approximately 13,220 pounds into LEO, or get a space-based system weighing up to 4,500 pounds into geostationary orbit. An artist’s conception of the MLV Kraken, at left, and the MLV-H, at right., Stratolaunch But the crown jewel of the Stratolaunch family is clearly the Black Ice space plane, which is presently just a design study. Unlikely the other three launch options, this vehicle would be able to not only go into space, but also come back and land like a regular airplane before getting prepped for another mission. Stratolaunch says it plans for this vehicle to be “a fully reusable space plane that enables advanced in-orbit capabilities and cargo return. Initial designs optimized for cargo launch, with a follow-on variant capable of transporting crew,” according to the company’s press release . An artist’s conception of the Black Ice spaceplane., Stratolaunch If the company can make this work in a cost-effective manner, the entire family of vehicles could offer game-changing space-launch capabilities for both civilian and military applications. Just compared to typical satellite launches, a reliable, large capacity air-launched vehicle could give any customer a means of getting new payloads into orbit on short-notice. With satellites shrinking in size already, it is possible that the space plane, as well as the single-use MLV-H, could rapidly deploy multiple payloads at once, further reducing the cost of getting those payloads into space. Speeding up the launch process could be invaluable for establishing any space-based capability, but would be especially useful for a military force looking to quickly replace lost or damaged satellites during a high-end conflict. As we at The War Zone regularly note , the dangers to vital communication, navigation , early warning , and intelligence satellites are only increasing. “I believe we’re going to be fighting from space in a matter of years,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said in February 2018 . “And we are the service that must lead joint warfighting in this new contested domain. This is what the nation demands.” The U.S. military has become steadily more aware of this issue, with the debate now centering around whether or not there is a need for a dedicated, separate military branch focused on space operations. At the same time, the U.S. Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have already been actively looking into reusable space planes as a means to rush satellites into orbit as necessary and on short notice. The video below offers an overview of DARPA’s concept of operations for its experimental XS-1 space plane. In its budget request for the 2019 Fiscal Year , the Air Force alone asked for more than $190 million to support a “small launch” program to explore ways of improving access to space, especially for light payloads. In the final defense spending bill for that fiscal cycle, which President Donald Trump signed into law earlier in August 2019, Congress demanded that the U.S. military as a whole consider at least one reusable launch option for getting any future space-based systems into orbit, as well as look into ways to expand cooperation with commercial firms on launches and operations in space. Stratolaunch is clearly eager to position itself as a good option for anyone who needs to get payloads into position above the atmosphere quickly and without the need for costly and complex traditional rockets, launch sites, and associated infrastructure. The Roc will reportedly be able to launch its rockets at ranges up to 2,000 miles from where it took off and be able to rapidly stage from different locations. The trick will be making the launches reliable enough to be routine and cost-effective enough to be a practical alternative to traditional space launch options. So far, the company has been tight-lipped about prospective costs. The six-engine, 500,000-pound mothership aircraft itself was originally set to cost around $300 million in 2011, but this had reportedly dropped to $200 million by 2016. Burt Rutan, an aviation legend who has been in charge of the Roc design, initially thought he could build the plane for as little as $20 million, according to a profile of Stratolaunch that Wired just published on Aug. 20, 2018. He himself reportedly joked that the “Roc” name is just an acronym for “Rutan’s on Crack.” The aircraft has been performing various ground tests and its first flight could occur in 2019 or even earlier . The Roc during taxi tests in February 2018., Stratolaunch It’s not clear whether one aircraft will be able to provide the kind of scalable capacity that Stratolaunch would need to make the launches a routine affair. The cost to produce additional motherships and establish the necessary infrastructure to support them could have an impact on the final price per launch. Stratolaunch’s CEO Floyd says Kraken MLV will be able to take payloads into LEO for $30 million or less, Wired reported , but it’s unclear what that figure includes. In 2015 , NASA said that it would spend more than $56 million to launch an Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) satellite, which weighs less than 700 pounds, using a Pegasus XL air-launched rocket and a different carrier aircraft. This included “firm-fixed launch service costs, spacecraft processing, payload integration, tracking, data and telemetry and other launch support requirements,” according to an official contract notice. Orbital ATK’s L-1011 Stargazer launch aircraft carries a Pegasus XL rocket during a mission in 2016., NASA As of May 2018, SpaceX was reportedly offering launch services using its latest Block 5 Falcon 9 launch rocket , which can carry payloads weighing more than 50,000 pounds into LEO, starting at around $50 million , down from $62 million in 2016. DARPA’s goal for its XS-1 space plane , which Boeing is developing and will use a traditional rocket to get into space, is to be able to achieve a per-launch cost of just $5 million, but with a maximum of 3,000 pounds of payload. Of course, Stratolaunch is targeting its launch vehicles at a different segment of the space launch market from SpaceX. If it can just keep pace with the price point of using traditional rockets at all, it might present a cost-effective option when factoring in the ability to conduct missions on much shorter notice. As noted, for the U.S. military, in particular, this will become an increasingly important capability to have available in the face of growing threats to space-based systems. China is notably also exploring aerial space launch capabilities for many of the same reasons. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket sits on a launch pad., SpaceX There is a definite possibility the company may be able to leverage the U.S. government’s increasing interest in public-private space partnerships to help further development of its various systems, as well. The company has already entered into an agreement where it will pay NASA more than $5 million to help develop the rocket motor for the MLVs. If Stratolaunch can actually get the MLV launch cost down to around $30 million and make the other members of its launch vehicle family equally affordable for their respective capabilities, it could be a very exciting time for the space launch industry. But there’s still a lot of work left for the company to do to achieve its goals and the space plane, in particular, remains just a paper concept at present.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 3, 2018",China’s Dismantling Of CIA Spy Ring Highlights Growing Dystopian-Like Surveillance State,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report has described how a catastrophic failure on the part of the Central Intelligence Agency, combined with the Chinese government’s steadily more sophisticated internet monitoring capabilities , led to the dramatic collapse of an American intelligence network in China and the executions of dozens of spies and their associates. The incident is just one example of how authorities in Beijing are overseeing the creation of an ever more effective police state, complete with technology and tactics straight out of a certain genre of near-future science fiction movie. Earlier in August 2018, Foreign Policy revealed how Chinese state security officials were able to completely dismantle a CIA-run intelligence operation over the course of two years, beginning in 2010. The New York Times first broke the news of the debacle in 2017, but its sources either did not disclose or did not know exactly what had happened or the true scale of China’s response. In May 2018, U.S. officials charged former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee with conspiracy to commit espionage over the affair, nearly five months after indicting him for retaining classified information . “When things started going bad, they went bad fast,” an unnamed U.S. official told Foreign Policy . “You could tell the Chinese weren’t guessing. The Ministry of State Security were always pulling in the right people.” When it became apparent that there was a problem, the CIA turned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to help uncover the source of the leak, according to the report. That investigation helped turn up Lee, who allegedly received tens of thousands of dollars to deliver information to the Chinese Ministry of State Security , which oversees both foreign and internal intelligence operations. A handout photo of former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee after his arrest., via SCMP But the FBI also apparently determined that the duplicitous intelligence officer would simply not have been able to point the finger at so many American intelligence assets or their associates so quickly and accurately. For obvious security reasons, agencies such as the CIA typically keep the real identities of their sources highly compartmentalized specifically so that if one person gets compromised, the others are protected. The FBI, with help from the National Security Agency , subsequently turned up a far more embarrassing truth. The CIA had likely burned these individuals itself when it unknowingly gave them a faulty piece of internet-based communications software. The agency used this encrypted communications application to communicate with new sources in order to vet them. The system was separate from the CIA’s main links to established operatives in the field, again to shield those operations from infiltration. Except the system was broken and contained one serious technical error. Experts at the FBI and NSA found they could use the less robust communications system the CIA used for its initial contacts to access the larger network. NSA headquarters at Fort Meade in Maryland., AP “The attitude [of CIA officials in China] was that we’ve got this, we’re untouchable,” another anonymous official told Foreign Policy, who added they felt “invincible.” Even in 2010, this belief seems hard to understand. For more than a decade at that point, the Chinese government had been developing and improving a wide array of powerful controls over the country’s internet, which have become known commonly as the “ Great Firewall .” These systems are typically associated mostly with blocking websites and content on social media that the Chinese Communist Party deems objectionable. With the rise of Email and social media, they’ve also become part of a steadily more effective set of tools to track and silence dissent . As such, the former CIA officer Lee would only have had to give the Ministry of State Security the names of a limited number of individuals to kickstart a major government investigation. Once the Chinese had arrested the first assets and acquired copies of the CIA’s communications software, or acquired that application by other means, they could’ve used information from that network, combined with the power of the Great Firewall, to isolate unusual web activity and locate other spies and potential associates. China’s counterintelligence officers might have had leads they were working through already to help quickly build a more accurate picture of the American intelligence operation. Sources told Foreign Policy that Chinese authorities had subsequently executed at least 30 people, more than twice as many as the The New York Times ’ initially reported, and had potentially killed or detained even more. China may have shared what it uncovered with its counterparts in Russia, leading to a chill in American human intelligence efforts there , as well. The incident has reportedly pushed American intelligence agents in China to be wary of internet-based communications to the point of potentially abandoning it altogether in favor of old-school tradecraft, such as discreet, in-person meetings. The problem with this plan is that that the Chinese government is actively working to make such physical interactions dangerously difficult, too, with one particular region, the ostensibly “semi-autonomous” Xinjiang , acting as a sort incubator for a slew of draconian surveillance technologies. Xinjiang, where Uighurs , a non-Chinese Turkic ethnic group that is predominantly Muslim, make up the bulk of the population, has been an ideal setting to test out new equipment and concepts of operation far from both Han Chinese and outside observers. China has used the reality of Uighur Islamic extremists and separatists to paint the entire population, along with other Muslim ethnic groups in the region, as potentially suspect and there are reports that around a million of them are in concentration camps at present. There are also horrifying reports of forced marriages between Uighur women and Han men with the apparent aim of “breeding out” the group. To help exercise this level of social control, China has put into place one of the most elaborate surveillance architectures in the world, complete with omnipresent cameras connected to monitoring stations running advanced facial recognition software , checkpoints with paramilitary police , and a system of systems all tied to a government-issued identification card that includes a “score” of how much a threat an individual poses to the state. Authorities have also begun implementing mass biometric data collection, including blood and DNA samples , to go along with other official information on file. All this can limit a person’s ability to buy goods and services or get a job. An archway with no less than seven cameras in front of the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgarin in Xinjiang., The Yomiuri Shimbun via AP After a spate of knife attacks in Xinjiang by alleged separatists, Chinese officials instituted a policy where cutlery vendors must physically laser-etch a QR code linked the buyer’s ID into the blade. In July 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that some 11,500 Uighurs that the Chinese government had approved to go on the Hajj, the sacred Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, had to carry special cards with a GPS tracker inside on a lanyard around their necks. Ostensibly for their own safety in the event of some sort of crisis, this system would obviously be able to monitor their every movement and it seems likely that anyone who decided to leave it behind would, if nothing else, take a serious hit on their social scorecard. A security guards man a checkpoint with a metal detector and an ID scanning system in a shopping mall in Xinjiang’s Kashgarin., The Yomiuri Shimbun via AP Among the most recent new additions to security apparatus in Xinjiang itself are small drones shaped like birds with realistically flapping wings, according to a June 2018 report from the South China Morning Post . These “Doves” can fly for thirty minutes and carry a small, color video camera and an ability to transmit the feed down to an individual on the ground. It reportedly has a GPS antenna and could be able to fly a pre-programmed route or operate under line-of-sight control. The Chinese are “applying a very, very broad attempted solution to what they see as an ideological danger,” James Millward, who teaches Chinese history at The Georgetown University, told The Atlantic earlier in August 2018. “In Xinjiang, the definition of extremism has expanded so far as to incorporate virtually anything you do as a Muslim.” China’s “Dove” drone, a product of the country’s Northwestern Polytechnical University., Northwestern Polytechnical University It might be difficult for China’s government to apply the same sort of visibly extreme measures to ethnic Han or other groups elsewhere in the country and the Uighurs are suffering disproportionately, but the Chinese are certainly trying to expand the reach of many of these policies. They have already begun implementing the social scoring system on a more widespread basis. Cops are now wearing Google Glass-style headsets with similar recognition capabilities to spot repeat offenders for crimes as minor as jaywalking . In the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, public restrooms use facial recognition software to give out only a specific amount of toilet paper per person. Even the police dogs have cameras. As security personnel and automated systems scrape so much data in cyberspace and in the physical world, China has also begun to invest heavily in artificial intelligence systems that could help sort through it faster. Tech companies, eager to gain access to the Chinese market, have increasingly been working with authorities in Beijing directly and indirectly on software and hardware to expand the government’s ability to censor information and monitor its citizenry. Domestic companies still remain dominant , though, working hand-in-hand with the authorities to provide new messaging software for personal computers and cell phones that double as a way for the government to keep tabs on individuals. It’s a reality that has likely only made it more difficult for the CIA and other foreign intelligence services to employ their own distinct encrypted communications tools in China, which would easily stand out from normal phone and internet use. Chinese police officers and dogs, all with cameras, in Tiananmen Square., Imaginechina via AP This could have all have a serious impact on foreign intelligence collection, as well as political activism and government criticism, in China and that’s surely the point. The suggestion that the CIA is increasingly abandoning internet-based communication for operations in China indicates that at least some portions of the U.S. Intelligence Community don’t see a way to guard against threats such as the Great Firewall, at least in the near future. That is no small victory for the Chinese and could threaten to give them an advantage given their own intelligence collecting successes in the United States and elsewhere . So far it seems to be working and it’s not clear what the United States, or anyone else, might be able to do about it, either. “Will a system always stay encrypted, given the advances in technology?” an unnamed U.S. intelligence source asked rhetorically in speaking with Foreign Policy about what the CIA might be able to do in the future to safely communicate with its assets. “You’re supposed to protect people forever.” Chinese officials, who are now turning to automated face-scanning machines to meter out toilet paper, are clearly hoping to make it as difficult as possible for external and internal actors to have any sort of unsanctioned impact.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two years ago I made sure you knew that you had a rare chance to travel like an oil-rich emir by buying Qatar’s retired 747SP VVIP flying palace. Now an even rarer opportunity has surfaced—to acquire a barely used, fully decked-out 747-8i Boeing Business Jet that served Qatar in the same role as its stubbier predecessor. That’s right, one of two 747-8i Boeing Business Jets (BBJ) that serve Qatar’s Amiri Flight is on the market. The aircraft, registered VQ-BSK, only came off the assembly line in Everett in December of 2012. The 747-8i is the mother of all Boeing Business Jet conversions. As you can see it absolutely dwarfs a 737BBJ, dxme from Schweiz/Wikicommons It then spent a couple years being outfitted by Boeing’s San Antonio service center with its VVIP interior and features before being delivered to Qatar in 2015. It only has 436 hours on its airframe and just 200 cycles! VQ-BSK’s GE GenX 2B67 engines are flying works of art. , Lukas von Daeniken/wikicommons The interior, which is a bit more tasteful than you might have expected, is designed for just 76 passengers and eighteen crew—that’s right, an entire 747-8i for 94 people total . A three-class layout 747-8i carries over 400. It’s equipped with an elaborate Panasonic in-flight entertainment system and a full camera and security system by Otonomy Aviation . The aircraft has various staterooms, lounges, boardrooms, first class seating areas, and even its own hospital. Controller.com Controller.com Controller.com Controller.com Controller.com Controller.com Controller.com Controller.com Controller.com It’s not clear why Qatar would want to sell one of their two 747-8i BBJs. The other, A7-HBJ, wears a less descript livery and we don’t know how it interior compares opulence wise with VQ-BSK. It’s also worth noting that there are areas and features on the jet that we don’t see in the photos above and are not listed—they are not for mere peasants eyes. There can be no doubt that operating the largest and most expensive private jet in the world isn’t a highly economical affair even for an oil-rich kingdom. Also, their size alone is limiting when it comes to getting into some destinations and unless you have 78 people in your entourage, moving around the world in one of these flying yachts instead of a wide-body twin-jet or 737BBJ may be considered wasteful—everything is relative when it comes to this level of wealth. Qatar’s Amiri Flight definitely has options for its small user base. Its inventory includes a trio of widebody A340s and two A330s. For bread and butter work it has around eight narrow-body A320s as well as single A310. So yeah, basically it’s a royal airline we are talking about here and everything from Qatari Air Force C-17s to C-130Js can be used to haul royal cargo as well. A7-HBJ, Qatar Ameri Flight’s other 747-8i BBJ., Alec Wilson/wikicommons A new ‘green’ (not outfitted for service) 747-8i costs roughly $370M but prices can change somewhat drastically based on a number of factors that are negotiated between Boeing and the buyer. The interior of a VVIP jet alone can cost many millions of dollars itself, so we really don’t know how much Qatar has invested in VQ-BSK. But for the buyer who has money literally to burn in the form of copious amounts of jet fuel and wants to personally own the same type of jet as the one the President of United States will fly on in the not too distant future , this may be their best shot at a bargain price. For all you other dreamers, you can still buy Qatar’s 40-year-old 747SP for a cool $9.5M dollars—think of it as a starter jumbo jet of sorts. If you negotiate tough you may have money left over for your own gold-plated airstair escalator! You can check out the entire listing for VQ-BSK on Controller.com here and on Avbuyer.com here.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 16, 2019",Where Were The Fiscal Hawks When The Navy Threw Itself The Mother Of All Flying Parades?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Trump’s highly controversial military parade has continued to suck up headlines, but this time around it’s because of reports stating its price supposedly ballooned from around $15M to potentially over $90M. Previous statements against the show of military might morphed into fevered screams of rejection following these new projected cost estimates, which set off a chain of events that would end in Trump canceling the Veteran’s Day military review—at least for now. But what came before Trump tweeted that he was putting his parade plans on the back-burner was an avalanche of bad press, including reports on the President’s beloved Fox And Friends broadcast, stating that the parade’s costs had soared out of control. We know that Trump makes snap proclamations and decisions based on what he sees on television, so maybe his tweet that announced the postponement of the parade was all but a sure thing once the package aired of Fox News early this morning. But the thing is that those numbers could be totally incorrect. In fact, the one person that should know what the estimates are is Secretary of Defense James Mattis who had been getting them sent to him for personal review. The decorated retired Marine general slapped down the $90M report while en route to South America aboard an E-4B in far more candid terms than we are accustomed to hearing him use: https://youtube.com/watch?v=ya19LnjkkpM But as the whirlwind of evolving reporting and hot takes mounted, Trump threw in the towel, Tweeting early in the morning: The mayor of Washington DC, who appears to be no fan of Donald Trump, posted that it would run $21.6M for security and support for the parade in a somewhat snarky tweet. This may be true, but even with this number factored in I am skeptical that the parade would cost a number approaching $90M. Yes, military hardware is expensive to move around and operate, and especially combat aircraft. But blowing that level of money on a parade seems nearly impossible. Even if you split the costs in half between military expenses and security and event support costs, $45M for the military’s participation in the parade is nearly unthinkable. You could fly an F-16 for roughly 2,050 hours for that dollar figure. Lining up some warbirds, a good mix of current American air power, including high-end assets like the B-2 bomber and E-4B flying command post to do a flyby, along with formations of tactical aircraft, most of which are based in the region, and rolling some vehicles and marching a bunch of soldiers down Pennsylvania Avenue won’t cost the DoD anywhere near $45M. And what people don’t understand is these same assets spread out to air shows across the United States every weekend for roughly nine months out of the year already. I think it would also be interesting to review the cost estimates for security and support from civil stakeholders and compare them against other events that have occurred in Washington DC to see how those estimates compare. The fact is that few in the Pentagon and in Washington DC wanted this parade in the first place. And I agree with them, I don’t think its necessary or even a smart decision for a number of factors, and simply speaking, the optics are really bad. But that doesn’t mean it should be misrepresented fiscally speaking or reported on inaccurately. Trump’s inauguration included military marching bands and other ceremonial DoD components. , DoD With this in mind, along with all the outrage over this supposedly uber wasteful display of military might, I do find it interesting that none of this was heard at anywhere near the frequency or amplitude when the U.S. Navy went and threw naval aviation the mother of all air parades and birthday bashes back in 2011. USN For people inside the aviation and defense space, the Centennial Of Naval Aviation (CONA) was a very exciting event that really took place in various locations in one form or another over an entire year. It included budgeting funds for most squadrons to paint a CONA aircraft in a retro paint scheme, which gave birth to some of the most striking and colorful naval aircraft that ever took to the skies. These aircraft and literally hundreds of others would all migrate to the grand CONA bash at Naval Air Station North Island—and around the entire San Diego Bay for that matter—on February 12, 2011 for what would be a freakishly large military display that totally broke from the realities of shrinking appetites for this type of spectacle among Western Nations. USN Nearly two hundred aircraft, the Blue Angels, and the vast majority of an entire carrier air wing would fly in a grand flypast. The goal was to have an example of at least one of everything still flying from throughout the Navy and Marine Corps history. Even the Coast Guard was involved. These planes ranged from vintage torpedo and scout planes to formations of current Navy and Marine fighters, helicopters, and even unique support aircraft like the E-6B Tacamo and others. On top of this, there were flight demonstrations over the bay and all the CONA painted jets and at least one example of each current serving Navy aircraft, along with additional warbirds and more, flew into Naval Air Station North Island and were put on static display for a giant open house. Coronado Island basically ground to a halt after months of preparations as thousands upon thousands of visitors streamed into the birthday celebration of sorts. The amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu and the supercarrier USS John C. Stennis also sailed into port to be the ultimate VIP platforms from which everyone from the Secretary of Navy down to local esteemed guest would take in the high-flying procession. I have been intimately involved with military air shows and I can’t stress enough how much larger a scale this whole enterprise was. And I should know because I was contracted by the Navy to photograph the entire thing with full run of North Island for the week and I was set up on the Peleliu’s fantail during the flyover. Tyler Rogoway/Author To this day I am simply stunned with how massive this spectacle was and how grossly out of place it seemed in 2011, a time when military budgets were on the skids, gear was worn down after a decade of fighting in the Middle East, and the U.S. economy was still on the rocks. At the same time, it was some of the most fun I have ever had around flying machines and military hardware and the mood was simply electric on base. What a great group of people and marvelous flying machines. So in retrospect, I understand why the Navy did it, but to this day I have no idea how they were allowed to do it. Tyler Rogoway/Author If this massive display of military might, which didn’t make anywhere near the headlines that a Washington DC military parade would, was able to be budgeted for in 2011, now, in a time of ballooning defense spending, I can’t imagine doing something similar in D.C. should be as fiscally appalling as many claim. At the same time, considering that throngs of military aircraft traveled from all over the U.S. to attend CONA, and the sheer scale of the whole thing, how was it allowed to go down with little opposition but Trump’s military parade on Veteran’s Day has resulted in such a rabid dogfight in the press and on Capitol Hill? The answer is simple—politics. The man demanding this event is the most polarizing figure we have ever had in the Oval Office by nearly all accounts. His autocratic tendencies and strange infatuation with military dictators doesn’t help his plight much either. But really, this whole thing seems to have been treated very uniquely because it was Trump ordering it up. And as I have stated in detail the past, there definitely is a modern precedent for a military parade in Washington DC. The last one followed the Gulf War and included Harriers landing on The Mall. That military display ran a cool $11M in back then, or $20M adjusted for inflation today. AP The cold hard truth is we have air shows, fleet weeks, open houses, and other events all over the United States where citizens can meet military personnel and interact with the gear they pay for with their tax contributions. We fund the Blue Angels, Thunderbirds, a slew of solo aircraft display teams, multiple jump teams, and a whole range of recruiting engagement and outreach programs. Although a military parade in Washington DC may make global news to some degree, it will likely be more for the controversy surrounding it than for its intended meaning. And as I have stated before, Trump could just beef-up the nearby Andrews AFB air show, which is one of the most prominent in the nation, attend that, and not incur the massive costs or invoke controversy by executing a military review down and above Pensylvania Avenue. The money saved could be used elsewhere, or, I don’t know, how about not spent at all? It seems he took this advice or came to his own conclusion that this would be the best course. And that was the right decision. But regardless, it’s laughable how little we heard in terms of fiscal outrage about the Centennial of Naval Aviation bash compared to how much we are hearing about Trump’s parade. And I can’t count how many TV pundits or writers jamming out hot-takes have posited out that Trump’s proposed military review has no precedent, which simply isn’t true. You may dislike Trump or adore him, but these types of things should mainly fall on their own sword or succeed based on hard facts logical reasoning while also keeping historic precedent and a bit of perspective in mind. It looks like in this instance that simply wasn’t able to be the case. So even though it’s a good thing the parade got canceled, the way it happened doesn’t seem quite fair in retrospect.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still coming in, but a T-38 Talon training jet from the 71st Flying Training Wing at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma has crashed. This is the sixth aircraft the Air Force has lost in non-combat mishaps in 2018 and the third incident involving a T-38 since November 2017. This mishap occurred at around 3:30 PM local time in Oklahoma on Aug. 17, 2018. The jet plowed into farm pasture approximately 50 miles west of Vance Air Force Base, setting it on fire. Though the aircraft can carry a crew of two, the U.S. Air Force has said there was only a single pilot on board. “One pilot was successfully ejected from one of Vance’s T-38 training jets,” was how U.S. Air Force Technical Sergeant Eric Cardenas phrased the situation to Oklahoma’s Enid News & Eagle newspaper. “The pilot is currently with emergency responders.” Vance Air Force Base officials also said that the pilot was conscious after parachute down into the farm and that the property owner had given him water and tended to him until first responders arrived, according to The Olympian . Firefighters put out the resulting blaze, as well. Earlier in August 2018, the 14th Flying Training Wing at Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi grounded its T-38s after an ejection seat in one of the aircraft accidentally fired during routine maintenance on the ground, injuring three contractors. However, there is no indication so far that these two incidents are related in any way. In May 2018, a T-38 from the 14th crashed in Mississippi . In that instance, both pilots were able to safely eject. In November 2017 , another Talon, this time from the 87th Flying Training Squadron at Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas crashed, killing the pilot. The Air Force only suffered six non-combat aircraft crashes in 2017, but has already had six so far this year. The U.S. military as a whole has seen a spike in serious mishaps , as well as fatalities , across its aviation communities in 2018.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkmenistan’s dictatorial president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, has cast himself as the star of a military propaganda film that apes some of the worst parts of classic action flicks and similar trends among other authoritarian leaders. The former dentist, who has no known military experience, but now holds the title of General of the Army, recently took the opportunity to demonstrate his “skills” for elite members of his country’s security forces. Berdymukhammedov reportedly showed off his shooting abilities at a military training facility in Turkmenistan’s western Balkan region on Aug. 10, 2018. The event was part of a series of visits in the lead up to the country’s Day of the Border Patrol. He made a very similar performance in August 2017, which resulted in an equally cheesy propaganda spread . Not surprisingly, TDH, the state news agency of Turkmenistan, declared that Berdimuhamedov had hit all the targets he shot at and that this was “a clear confirmation” of his martial abilities. The official report also said that it was a servicemember who requested that the president autograph one of the paper targets, which is set to go on display in the country’s State Border Guard Museum. Turkmen activists living in exile have parodied Berdimuhamedov, mashing up the official video with footage from 2017 and clips from the Sylvester Stallone action classic Rambo and the Stan Bush song Fight To Survive from the iconic Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts movie Bloodsport , which you can watch below. The video from the event shows Berdimuhamedov arriving on a camouflaged three-wheeled trike-type motorcycle ahead of a convoy of military trucks and light special operations vehicles. This is highly reminiscent of Russian President Vladimir Putin fondness for motorcycles , which he often rides together with the Night Wolves motorcycle “club,” a violent group that has murky ties to the Kremlin’s internal and external security services. The effect is perhaps closer to Danny McBride’s character Kenny Powers from the television show Eastbound & Down . He then proceeds to shoot four targets with a pistol, apparently hitting each one dead center in the chest. The president then engages four more targets – possibly the same ones – with an Israeli Tavor TAR-21 assault rifle complete with red dot sight, tactical light, and sound suppressor, again hitting them all. Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov sits on his trike at the military demonstration in August 2018., TDH It is difficult to judge from the available video how far away the targets actually are and whether Berdimuhamedov is actually the one making the accurate shots. It is entirely possible that he may be a good shot, but the event is also clearly heavily scripted with personnel quickly applauding and studiously taking “notes” from their country’s leader. Afterward, Berdimuhamedov observes troops and paramilitary police perform a variety of firearms and hand-to-hand combat drills. At one point, a pair of individuals appear to engage in a dangerous “ confidence drill ,” facing each other at very close range and shooting 9mm Tavor submachineguns over each other’s shoulders. Two Turkmen security forces personnel engage in what appears to be a confidence drill that involves them shooting past each other at close range., via Chronicles of Turkmenistan Also visible are Italian Beretta ARX160 assault rifles and Beretta Px4 Storm pistols, along with SAKO TRG M10 sniper rifles, which have become the predominant weapons among many elements of country’s security forces. Finland’s SAKO has been a Beretta subsidiary since 2000. The video wraps up with footage of Berdimuhamedov observing a more conventional demonstration of his country’s air and naval assets, including Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft. Turkmenistan’s Balkan region sits on the Capsian Sea. Berdimuhamedov’s 2018 demonstration is actually relatively muted compared to his one in 2017. That performance involved him shooting a small rifle, an MP5 submachine gun , and a pistol, before topping it all off by throwing bayonets at the targets. He arrived at that event in a speeding pickup truck and also coordinated the rest of the drills from a command center in full military gear. There’s another parody video of these escapades, which inserts clips of Arnold Schwarzenegger from the 1985 action movie Commando , which you watch below. When Berdymukhamedov took power in 2007, following the death of the previous dictatorial leader Saparmurat Niyazov, there was a hope that he might have a moderating influence. Niyazov had been a dictator straight out of a comic book, developing an extreme cult of personality that included massive golden statues of himself as a child and an adult, renaming portions of the calendar after him and his mother, and more . He dubbed himself the “Turkmenbashi,” or Head of The Turkmen. Though Berdymukhamedov did away with some of the most absurd excesses, such as changes to the calendar , he has since developed his own authoritarian cult of personality, giving himself his own title, “Arkadag,” which means protector. He also likes to style himself a man of many talents, including military specialist, singer-songwriter and DJ , and expert equestrian. During the country’s 2013 Day of the Horse celebrations, he fell off his mount in the middle of a race. Berdymukhamedov last “won” re-election as the country’s president in February 2017 , claiming to have won 97 percent of the vote in polls that foreign observers decried as neither free nor fair . There were nine opposition candidates, but the government had pre-approved all of them—hardly a competitive field of candidates to say the least. Turkmenistan’s president serves terms of seven years, with the next election scheduled to occur in 2024. With this in mind, it seems likely that we will be treated to more demonstrations of the Arkadag’s martial prowess in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have been following the progress of Tactical Air Support Inc.’s F-5E Tiger II aggressor program from before we even knew it existed. Since then the company has made huge strides in bringing an advanced F-5E/F derivative to the commercial adversary support marketplace. The 21 jets, which came from overseas surplus stocks, are all being refurbished at Northrop Grumman’s St. Augustine facility, after which they will head to TacAir’s home base at Reno’s Stead Field where they will receive extensive upgrades. This process will include fitting an all-new glass cockpit in the sleek fighters. But to our knowledge, none of these jets have been photographed in flight—that is until now. Our good friend and one of our favorite aviation photographers , Frank Crebas of Bluelife Aviation (make sure to follow his Instagram linked here , you won’t be disappointed), captured the splinter-schemed F-5 during a test flight out of St. Augustine’s Northwest Florida Regional Airport. Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com Apparently, this is the fourth TacAir F-5 that has received a refreshing from Northrop Grumman—the other three are already back at Stead Field in Nevada. So there can be no doubt that TacAir’s Tiger II fleet is rapidly evolving. These are truly exciting times for commercial adversary support contractors. The USAF has laid out its grand plan for embracing privatized aggressor and other tactical air power training services and it’s impressive. The competition for these and other contracts is stiff, but it looks like there will be plenty of opportunities to go around. Considering the high cost of sustaining and operating a 5th generation fighter dominated future force, along with many other factors I have been discussing for nearly a decade , the decision by USAF to finally leverage the private sector to the maximum degree possible for portions of its tactical air combat training needs isn’t really a choice anymore as it had been in decades past. This is a necessary evolution and one that will save money, result in a far more elastic set of training capabilities and options, and it will result in better-trained pilots than what the in-house alternatives can provide.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Australia’s preeminent multi-national air warfare exercise Pitch Black is underway down under and this iteration has drawn a very diverse mix of participants. Everything from Indian Su-30MKI Flankers to USAF B-52H Stratofortresses are participating in the biennial large force employment (LFE) set of drills. The USMC, in particular, is participating in force, with MV-22s Ospreys being part of the aircraft roster. Based on photos just released by the Royal Australian Air Force, the Ospreys were escorted by RAAF PC-9 light air support turboprop aircraft during an insertion drill—a sign of what could come for the tilt-rotor community. The images show a pair of PC-9 aircraft, which are primarily used for flight training and are a close cousin to the U.S. Air Force and Navy’s T-6 Texan II trainers, escorting a Marine MV-22s into a landing zone. An earlier video from the exercise notes that the aircraft have been working in a Forward Air Control-Airborne (FAC-A) role as well. Forward Air Controllers work to rapidly organize and coordinate close air support for friendly troops. Putting them above the ground, and especially in an aircraft that can loiter low and slow, offers unique advantages, and can be the difference between life and death during air assault operations. CPL Glen McCarthy © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence All this makes sense because the RAAF’s storied No. 4 Squadron flies a handful of specially modified PC-9 aircraft that work to train Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) which are essentially ground-based Forward Air Controllers, as well as airborne ones. The unit works closely with Australian special operations community as well and their aircraft include unique gray paint jobs, special radios, pylons to mount smoke grenades used for marking targets and other external stores, along with other modifications. CPL Glen McCarthy © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Integrating light air support aircraft with Osprey operations could very well become a staple in the future if the USAF does indeed acquire a fleet of light air support aircraft as it currently promises —something some of us have been begging them to do for years. These aircraft have similar operating speeds as the Osprey and can loiter over an area for prolonged periods of time providing overwatch, forward air control, communications relay, and light attack roles. CPL Glen McCarthy © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Even in the FAC-A and/or armed escort role, these aircraft could give Ospreys a huge amount of support. During multiple operations in lower-threat environments, most notably during operation in Africa, Ospreys and other transports have been shot up by ground fire during insertions and extractions of special operations forces. Royal Australian Air Force No. 4 Squadron A Flight Forward Air Controllers conduct a pre-mission brief before launching their PC-9 aircraft from RAAF Base Tindal in support of Exercise Pitch Black 2018., CPL Glen McCarthy © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence The slide shows that the Ospreys were escorted along a circuitous route by a pair of RAAF PC-9s. Also a MQ-9 Reaper was involved apparently. , CPL Glen McCarthy © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence The Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel, basically USMC lingo for Combat Search And Rescue (CSAR) for downed aircrews, that the Osprey is wonderfully adept at due to its speed, could make great use of this capability in particular. In addition, forward deploying light air support aircraft to support Ospreys is far easier and exponentially more economical than doing so with a fast jet fighter or A-10 squadron. Finally, the use of propeller-driven light attack aircraft for exactly this role dates back many decades , with the OV-10 Bronco providing a similar function for the USMC into the early 1990s. CPL Glen McCarthy © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence For all that it is capable of, the $70M Osprey has limited ability to protect itself during missions into hot landing zones, with just a ramp-mounted machine gun being standard. Other solutions, like a remote-controlled minigun that drops out of the aircraft’s belly aperture, have been deployed but have not really caught on for various reasons. Even arming Ospreys with laser-guided rockets to provide their own air support has been tested. But a cost-effective and far more effective solution like a light air support aircraft would be ideally suited for providing air cover for Marine and USAF Ospreys, along with other critical functions. CPL Glen McCarthy © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence The USMC is also interested in procuring a similar aircraft at least for tactical training purposes as first, but as funds flow toward a light air support platform, the service could follow the USAF in making such an initiative a larger, front-line program of record. The Corps does have plans for a high-end vertical takeoff and landing drone in the works that could be armed and could provide air support, but that program is very ambitious, its entry into service is at least a decade away, and will take years to mature after that. In addition, the MUX program may be in trouble even at this early stage of its life. But joint operations are what it’s all about these days, especially for CSAR and similar collective mission sets. So there is no reason why USAF light attack aircraft couldn’t work hand-in-hand with USMC Ospreys as well as the USAF’s special operations optimized models. With all this in mind, these images snapped during Pitch Black, and the tactics put to work during this particular evolution of the exercise, could very well be a progenitor of what’s to come for the tilt-rotor community. Considering that U.S. Marine’s are deployed to Australia on a semi-permanent basis now as part of Marine Rotational Force–Darwin (MRF-D) , mastering the combined use of Osprey and light attack aircraft may very well occur down under with the help of No. 4 Squadron regardless of how long the Pentagon drags its feet on buying its own fleet of light air support aircraft. Pitch Black has grown in complexity and size with each iteration in an effort that seems to match the RAAF’s goal to seriously up their game when it comes to all aspects of air warfare . It also has become an event where a diverse set of regional players can unite and train to fight together. Something that is becoming more important as China increasingly throws its military might around the hemisphere. 140 aircraft and 4,000 personnel are taking part in Pitch Black 2018, which is primarily held out of RAAF Base Darwin and RAAF Base Tindal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 1, 2018","Russia Has Four Potential “Killer Satellites” In Orbit, At Least That We Know About","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior U.S. diplomat has accused Russia of deploying another small, specialized satellite into orbit that it could use as an anti-satellite weapon . This is at least the fourth such system the Kremlin has launched since 2013 and highlights a continued lack of internationally accepted ground rules for hostile activities in space , even as the United States seeks to increase its military capabilities above the Earth’s atmosphere . Yleem Poblete, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance, raised the concerns about the Russian “space apparatus inspector” at a meeting of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, Switzerland on Aug. 14, 2018. Russia publicly announced the launch of this satellite in June 2017, but insists that its only function is to inspect the country’s own space-based systems for damage or other possible issues and potentially service and repair them. The Russian satellite’s “behavior on-orbit was inconsistent with anything seen before from on-orbit inspection or space situational awareness capabilities, including other Russian inspection satellite activities,” Poblete said at the gathering . “We are concerned with what appears to be very abnormal behavior by a declared ‘space apparatus inspector.’ We don’t know for certain what it is and there is no way to verify it.” When Poblete mentioned “other” activities, she was likely referring to three additional inspector satellites that the Russians launched between 2013 and 2015 . These space-based systems, also known as Kosmos-2491, Kosmos-2499, and Kosmos-2504, conducted a number of apparent tests, getting relatively close to various pieces of space debris, before going dormant in 2016. The next year, Russia turned one of them back on and sent it near to a portion of a Chinese weather satellite, which that country had destroyed in a ground-based anti-satellite test in 2007. The video below, from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, shows one concept for using a small repair satellite to service other space-based systems. Now it’s important to note that the concept of a small inspector satellite isn’t new and makes good sense. Sending manned missions to examine satellites and other space objects and potentially make repairs or modifications has historically been costly and complicated. At the same time, fixing or making modifications to a satellite in space saves the trouble of building a replacement and paying to launch it into orbit. Famously, the United States sent astronauts to fix the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993 after NASA discovered a fault in the system’s main mirror. Having a semi-autonomous, space-based repair crew of sorts on call could simplify the arrangement significantly. If nothing else, these robotic inspectors could assess the issue quickly so personnel on the ground could make an informed decision about how to proceed. The problem is that any satellite that can maneuver itself very close to another one, and may have small arms or probes to physically interact with its target, is inherently capable of being a weapon. Any such repair system could easily smash sensitive optics and other components, or simply slam into the target, acting as a kinetic weapon. Their small size means that their terrestrial operators might be able to instruct them to try to hide near other objects, especially among the ever-expanding field of “ space junk ” floating around the earth, as well. A notional Robotic Servicing Vehicle that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been working on. This kind of space-based system could also function as a weapon., DARPA They might also be able to carry electronic warfare jammers or directed energy weapons that could blind optics or prevent a satellite from communicating information, including warnings about incoming missiles or vital intelligence data, to facilities down below. The “inspectors” could act as small intelligence agents, intercepting transmissions aimed at space-based communications systems. In that case, they might potentially send out spoofed signals with confusing messages or false navigational coordinates , as well. Russia has since denounced Assistant Secretary of State Poblete’s comments as “unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions.” However, statements from the country’s own Ministry of Defense regarding their newest inspector’s rendezvous with Kosmos-2519 , another military satellite that itself has an unknown mission, strongly indicate that this satellite has a robust set of capabilities that could have a secondary military application. “In trials involving controlling the maneuvering defense satellite, ground, and orbital communication systems were tested, and methods involving ballistic estimates and new software were employed,” Russia’s Izvestia newspaper reported based on information from the Ministry of Defense. “The space forces proved their ability to ensure the satellite’s automatic undocking from the platform, the remote control of its flight, and the activation of the satellite payload, including surveillance hardware, data transfer to Earth, and data processing.” For years, experts and others, including us at The War Zone , have pointed out the clear threat that these dual-use satellites might pose. The United States and China have and still are both actively exploring advanced space-based inspector-type systems, as well, which might set the stage for an even more complex situation that could involve groups of small satellites attacking and defending against each other. The U.S. military is also working on cost-effective, reusable hypersonic space planes , including the U.S. Air Force’s secretive X-37B , that could rapidly deploy small satellites for various functions or otherwise perform their own offensive missions in space. The US Air Force’s X-37B space plane., USAF “The potential for a serious incident in outer space is being driven by advances in technology that challenge the existing rules and norms governing space activity,” Jeffery Lewis, now in charge of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, wrote all the way back in 2004 . “Micro-satellite proximity operations would be best regulated with confidence-building measures in outer space.” More than a decade on, international rules and regulations have yet to catch up with these continued developments. Assistant Secretary of State Poblete made her comments earlier in August 2014 specifically to underscore the U.S. government’s continued opposition to a Russian-Chinese proposal for a Treaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects, conveniently abbreviated PWTT. “How do we verify what countries say their spacecraft are doing?” she asked rhetorically. “What would be enough information to prove what the purpose of an object is?” US Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance Yleem Poblete., US Department of State The U.S. government’s position is that the PWTT is not sufficient because it does not explicitly prohibit the development or test of space-based systems, such as the inspectors, with a potential anti-satellite role. This could let countries stockpile a “breakout capability” if they ever decided to abandon the agreement. The proposed agreement also does not ban ground-based or air-launched anti-satellite systems, which Russia and China have been developing, as well. In February 2018, the Chinese military tested what they described as an anti-ballistic missile defense interceptor, but which might be a cover for an anti-satellite weapon . Russia has publicly said that it is working on anti-satellite interceptors and directed energy weapons . Russia and China, as well as other critics of the American position, counter by noting that the U.S. government is actively looking to militarize space and put actual weapons into orbit, ostensibly for anti-ballistic missile defense . The two countries have already responded negatively to the U.S. military’s plans for a possible space-focused military branch . A Russian Beriev A-60 aircraft, which carries a laser weapon in its nose and that Russia has said may be able to blind or otherwise disable enemy satellites. , Beriev Without any such agreement, what constitutes an attack on a nation’s interest in space has remained up for debate. It’s a gray area made more complicated by the likelihood that the United States and its potential opponents have satellites in orbit that they don’t acknowledge are vital to national security or are up there at all . “Is jamming an attack? Is a laser an attack? Does it have to be a kinetic hit on a satellite to be an attack?” Douglas Loverro, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, asked during a talk in 2016 . “It’s really difficult to go ahead and justify how you might attack somebody’s homeland if they’ve taken out a satellite that you don’t even admit exists.” Unfortunately, it is clear that basic definitions of what constitutes conflict in space, if nothing else, are necessary now, more than ever. Without them, there is only an increasing possibility for dangerous miscalculations. The activities of Russia’s latest inspector satellite, China’s own anti-satellite developments, and the United States’ plans for space-based ballistic missile defense weapons all show that these issues will only continue to become more pronounced in the future, whether there is any sort of international treaty that seeks to govern military activity in space or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Navy Details Plans For Carrier Onboard Delivery CMV-22 Osprey Squadrons As Tests Continue,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it will formally establish the first of three CMV-22B Osprey squadrons within weeks and has outlined other details about how it plans to proceed with the replacement of its existing C-2A Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft. The announcement comes after the service recently demonstrated the ability of the tilt-rotors to use rolling landings and takeoffs to touch-down on an aircraft carrier’s deck and then get airborne again with large cargoes, which will be an essential capability when it comes to transporting particularly large items, such as spare F135 engines for the F-35C Joint Strike Fighter . Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron Three Zero (VRM-30) will stand up at Naval Air Station North Island in California, on Oct. 1, 2018, according to an official directive, Seapower Magazine reported on Aug. 15, 2018. On that same date, the Naval Aviation Training Support Group (NATSG) will take up residence at Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina, to coordinate CMV-22B pilot training, which Marine Medium Tiltrotor Training Squadron Two Zero Four (VMMT-204) will oversee initially. Sometime after that, the Navy plans to create a new wing-sized unit at North Island to control both VRM-30 and a second operational CMV-22B squadron, VRM-40. A third dedicated “fleet replacement” training squadron, VRM-50, will eventually arrive at the base in California, consolidating the Navy’s entire Osprey operations at one location. This plan was one of two proposed courses of action the Navy revealed in January 2018 and the service expects it to cost approximately $130 million to upgrade North Island to handle the influx of aircraft and personnel. At present, the goal is for CMV-22B to reach initial operational capability by 2020, the tilt-rotor fleet to be fully operational four years after that, and for the C-2s to be completely out of service by 2026. With this in mind, Naval Air Systems Command continues to evaluate the Osprey’s capabilities in the carrier onboard delivery (COD) role using MV-22Bs , which the U.S. Marine Corps operates. The CMV-22B configuration is similar to the Marines’ Ospreys, but will also feature additional fuel capacity in the fuselage and wings to increase its overall range, additional communications equipment, a public address system in the main cabin, and extra lighting to help with loading and unloading cargo at night. “I started off flying Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft and I love the platform,” said U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Steven Tschanz, a test pilot from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two One (HX-21), said earlier in August 2018 . “With that said, nothing lasts forever and the Navy came up with a solution to move us into the future with the CMV-22 Osprey.” A map showing proposed changes to Naval Air Station North Island to accommodate the future CMV-22B force, as of January 2018., USN Tschanz was speaking after a series of tests aboard the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush that showed the MV-22B could safely land and takeoff with a gross weight of 57,000 pounds, including fuel and internal cargo. The Navy’s C-2s can’t touch down on one of the flattops if they’re heavier than 49,000 pounds. The CMV-22 will also be able to carry heavy loads slung underneath and otherwise operate like a helicopter. This could eliminate the need for the present “hub and spoke” concept of operations where the COD aircraft brings cargo or personnel for the other ships in the Carrier Strike Group, but MH-60R or -S helicopters have to actually ferry them to those vessels. But, in particular, the August 2018 experiments showed that the CMV-22 can meet one of the Navy’s key requirements for the aircraft in the COD role, which is transporting F135 engines for the F-35C Joint Strike Fighter. The Navy hopes to reach initial operational capability with these stealth fighter jets by the end of 2018, though there are fears that schedule may slip . If all goes according to plan, the F-35Cs could see their first operational deployment aboard the USS Carl Vinson , another Nimitz -class carrier, in 2021. This could be the first cruise for the CMV-22Bs, too, since, at least according to the Navy , the C-2s can’t transport the F135s and therefore would be unable to adequately support a Carrier Air Wing that included Joint Strike Fighters. An artist’s conception of a pair of CMV-22Bs in flight., Bell-Boeing But while the Navy lauded the success of the tests, the event also highlighted a number of persistent concerns about the Osprey’s ability to handle the COD mission, much of which centers around the F135 engine issue. Hauling spare parts and entire replacement engines to the carrier is at the center of wartime COD duties and will be essential for keeping aircraft mission capable and sortie rates up during any potential high-end conflict. The Navy is right to say that the C-2 can’t carry the F-35’s engine inside its standard shipping container, a bulky configuration that weighs 9,350 pounds. But the CMV-22B, despite its now proven ability to land and take off with a higher gross weight, can’t, either. To get the F135 into the cramped confines of the Osprey’s main cabin, the Navy will need to use a special pallet that leaves the engine exposed to the elements, including corrosive salt-filled sea air and water. Ground crews will also need to remove certain external aircraft components to prevent them from being damaged during loading and unloading and then reinstall them before the tilt-rotor can get going again, which makes the entire process take longer. The Marine Corps uses this procedure to support its F-35B Joint Strike Fighters deployed on amphibious assault ships using its MV-22Bs. Marines and sailors load an F135 engine into an MV-22B Osprey using a special pallet during a test in 2015., USMC This adds to general concerns about the amount of deck space the CMV-22B will take up and whether that might impede other flight operations while taking on cargo or passengers or offloading them. The C-2 can taxi to a parking spot with its wings folded, giving it a far smaller overall footprint to help maneuver around the crowded flight deck. The Osprey cannot move around on its own with its wing and rotors folded. If the aircraft needs to use a rolling landing or take off to get moving or come to a complete stop, this could only compound those issues. Video of the tests, seen at the beginning of the story, shows the MV-22B from HX-21 using a significant portion of Bush ’s angled flight deck to perform these maneuvers, something that might be more difficult to facilitate during high-pace operations in the midst of a large-scale conflict. This could also limit the ability of the carrier to use this portion of the deck for catapult launches or other activities, as well. Overall, this will impact how the carrier’s crew manages the deck during operations and the already complex launch and recovery cycle . The rolling landing may turn out to help a bit with fitting the CMV-22Bs into the pattern during landing operations, too. A pair of MV-22Bs from HX-21 fly past the USS George H.W. Bush in August 2018 . , USN All of this is on top of other unrelated issues, which you can read about in more detail here . These including the Osprey’s lack of a pressurized cabin, limiting how high the tilt-rotor can fly and forcing it to fly around rather than over storms and other dangerous weather, which could increase the time it takes for the aircraft to cover the “golden mile” between bases ashore and the carrier. The only alternative would be to fly through bad weather, which is routine in the maritime environment, at comparatively low altitudes, which can make flights out to the boat very uncomfortable and in some cases hazardous. The CMV-22B will have a slower maximum speed than the C-2, as well. Of course, exploring new capabilities and uncovering and developing ways to try to mitigate any issues is exactly why HX-21 is running Ospreys through various tests. So, it will be interesting to see how the Navy’s understanding of carrier operations evolve as it stands up its first CMV-22B squadron and continues to prepare the aircraft for their first operational deployment, which could come in just three years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",The U.S. Navy Has A Critically Important Submarine Test Base Tucked Away In Alaska,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you venture just north of Ketchikan, Alaska, around the picturesque Behm Canal, you may stumble upon something very unexpected—the sinister black silhouette of a nuclear fast attack or ballistic missile submarine. The waterway is the home of the United States Navy’s Southeast Alaska Acoustic Measurement Facility, more commonly known as SEAFAC. Built in 1991, it’s located roughly 675 miles from the major submarine bases in Washington State. For years it seems its existence was kept relatively hush-hush, although locals clearly knew a major submarine testing facility had been established. But to this very day, the place catches people off-guard. I have received roughly a half-dozen emails over the years from various individuals, from pilots to visitors to the area, who wondered why they saw a huge submarine plowing the waters in a fjord near Ketchikan. USN SEAFAC is where new technologies and equipment configurations are tested aboard multi-billion dollar American nuclear submarines and where their acoustic signature is measured while underway. USN Acoustic signature—literally the noise something makes—is the primary survivability factor of a modern submarine. Every aspect and component of a submarine’s construction takes this reality into account. And it’s not just about quieter mechanical systems, pump-jets, or coatings on a submarine’s hull, but also about how systems are mounted inside a submarine to isolate vibrations and sound waves as well. Even the shape of a submarine and the water flowing around it can be a noise factor. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qCkAonWXfZo Just like how the military aerospace research and development community has a vast array of facilities related to signature management—including radar cross-section test facilities , flying infrared and radar signature evaluation testbeds, anechoic chambers , live-flight radar signature evaluation ranges, infrared signature live-fire ranges , and even soundstage-like facilities used to test various forms of sensor engagement technology—submarines have a similar, albeit less well-known test and evaluation infrastructure. This includes a key submarine test facility in Idaho that I profiled in this story from four years ago. Other testing installations can be found in the eastern United States and in the Bahamas, each with various capabilities and missions, but SEAFAC focuses exclusively on the most critical element of a submarine’s survivability. USN Behm Canal is an ideal setting for an underwater acoustic test range because it is shielded from the ocean and from large amounts of vessel traffic, and thus from ambient noise. Its basin is also ideal, with a smooth tub-like contour that provides as close to lab-like acoustic conditions as possible. It can also be cordoned off relatively easily when tests are underway. The facility allows for static and dynamic acoustic tests, the latter of which can take place throughout the submarine’s performance envelope. Two acoustic arrays are attached to the seafloor, which has a depth of roughly 1250 feet, to capture a submarine’s audible signature as it travels back and forth across the canal while executing various test profiles. The Navy describes this range as such : “The Underway Measurement Site acquires the signature of the ship while it is moving through the water. Measurements during movement ensure that propulsion and flow noises can be captured. The measurement process is slow and takes about 30 minutes to conduct 6 minutes of data acquisition for every single measurement. The remainder of the time is spent repositioning the ship for the next measurement. Typically, a submarine will spend two to five days conducting underway testing.” You can read more about the range’s acoustic arrays, which were upgraded in 2006 and are called High Gain Measurement Systems (HGMS), as well as how they are installed, here . Navy document linked above. There is also a pair of custom barges that provides support for static tests. These tests can include an entire submarine or components of a submarine being submerged while suspended on cables between two hydrophone arrays at various depths. The barges can provide external power to the submarine so that all but the systems being evaluated can be turned off while testing occurs. In some cases, a full submarine isn’t needed for these evaluations and just a unique piece of machinery or mounting concept can be tested on its own before being installed aboard a submarine and evaluated in an integrated manner. The Navy explains how the static site works in some detail: “At the Static Site, suspension barges lower the submarine on cables to hold it in a stable position. The submarine can be suspended at various depths to evaluate how sea pressure affects the acoustic signature. The Static Site primarily measures the signature of rotating equipment onboard the vessel. The vessel does not have to maneuver so the testing can be conducted more rapidly. Also, better communication lines exist between the vessel and the Operations Center, therefore, the testing is more controlled and efficiently conducted. Typically, the submarine will spend one to seven days conducting Static Site testing.” USN A data analysis site and general base of operations is located on Back Island which sits on the eastern edge of the restricted test area. From data collected at SEAFAC, the performance of new components and submarines both new and old can be evaluated and signature control practices and methods can be developed, validated, and improved upon. There also is a validation aspect to SEAFAC’s mission, wherein submarines that have undergone overhauls or major work can have their acoustic signature thoroughly checked before heading out on patrols. The facility also does some work with surface vessels as well and continues to receive upgrades as America realigns its naval forces for high-end peer-state naval combat in the future. With all this in mind, and considering that U.S. Navy submarines carry the country’s second-strike nuclear deterrent and provide critical intelligence-gathering abilities in addition to some of their more traditional tactical purposes , this unassuming test range north of Ketchikan is an incredibly valuable tool for U.S. Navy. The submarine can fight where no other vessel can—as long as it remains undetected. With SEAFAC’s help, the future of American underwater stealth technology is better assured.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 18, 2018",USAF Hands Lockheed Billions For New Warning Satellites Amid Rush For More Space Sensors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has formally hired Lockheed Martin to build three new missile warning satellites as part of the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared program, also called Next-Gen OPIR. Under pressure from members of Congress and critics within the U.S. military , the service is pushing an aggressive timetable for the project, which is just one part of still-developing plans for a broad array of new space-based sensors to help guard against both advanced ballistic missiles and emerging hypersonic threats . On Aug. 14, 2018, in its daily contracting announcement , the Pentagon announced that Lockheed Martin had received the $2.9 billion dollar contract and that the Air Force expected to take delivery of the trio of satellites by April 30, 2021. In May 2018, the service had first revealed plans to give sole-source deals to both Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for Next-Gen OPIR work. The two firms have worked together in the past on the existing Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) missile warning constellation. “As we develop these new systems, speed matters,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in a statement in May 2018. “The next generation missile warning satellite will be a pace-setter.” It is unclear whether the 2021 delivery date reflects a change in the program’s overall schedule. The timeline the Air Force had previously presented in May 2018 called for the launch of the first Next-Gen OPIR satellite into geosynchronous orbit in 2023 and placement of one in a polar orbit in 2027. In November 2017, the plan had been to get the initial satellite into orbit by 2025. One of the existing SBIRS satellite during its final assembly and test period. The Next-Gen OPIR constellation will supplement these space-based sensors., Lockheed Martin This new contract also only covers three of the planned five satellites in the complete constellation. Northrop Grumman is set to take charge of the work on the two polar satellites. The Air Force has said in the past that it wants the entire system up and running no later than 2029 . Getting an entirely new satellite constellation into place in “five to six years is a gold medal,” Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Will Roper had said in April 2018 . He added that the effort would hopefully get program managers to think about ways to move programs along faster with a “reasonable amount of experimentation and prototyping” where they “can take advantage of discovery in getting things right, but can hedge their bets in case something goes wrong.” Though details about the Next-Gen OPIR’s capabilities are not publicly available, the Air Force plans to use them to supplement the SBIRS constellation and they should have improved capabilities over those existing satellites. The primary function of the six SBIRS satellites is to spot the bright, hot plumes of ballistic missiles as the blast off. They might be able to continue tracking those threats once they enter space and “go cold” to some degree during their mid-course phase of flight, as well. There are also reports that the infrared sensors are powerful enough to detect other, smaller missile launches, including surface-to-air and air-to-air weapons, and even conventional artillery fire and aircraft in flight under certain circumstances. The Air Force has also said that the Next-Gen OPIR satellites will be more “ survivable ” than their predecessors in a world of increasing worrisome anti-satellite threats . This could include improvements to the system’s resistance to jamming , which could prevent it from sending an alert to personnel on the ground, or features to better shield the optics from harmful laser beams that might just blind it outright. But the Next-Gen OPIR program may still not be moving along fast enough for lawmakers or the U.S. military itself. In February 2018, U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command, said the 2029 date for the full system to go online was “ ridiculous ” and insisted that there were ways to speed up the process. U.S. Air Force General John Hyten., Matthew Staver/Bloomberg via Getty Images In the defense spending bill for the 2019 Fiscal Year, which President Donald Trump signed into law earlier in August 2018, Congress ordered the Missile Defense Agency to lead efforts to speed up work on various space-based sensors, as well. At the same time, legislators did cut earlier language that had demanded the deployment of at least some of those systems by 2022. The U.S. military is already exploring ways to reduce the time and cost of developing space-based systems and getting them into orbit, including through the use of cheaper, reusable rockets . The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is experimenting with an even more novel concept to put payloads into space with a reusable, hypersonic spaceplane . Still, no matter how fast the Air Force can get the Next-Gen OPIR system into operation, it is only one part of a larger sensor network necessary to adequately monitor for potential missile threats, especially future hypersonic weapons . The U.S. military’s existing combination of space- and surface-based sensors is simply not effective for tracking this latter category of threats, which is likely at least part of the reason why Russia and China are investing so heavily in developing them. Earlier in August 2018, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves described a notional three-part space-based sensor layer to help defend against various missile threats, including hypersonic types. The first part of this over-arching system would be the Next-Gen OPIR constellation “to be the bell-ringer if something is going on,” the officer explained . MDA’s proposed space sensor layers: #SMDSymposium pic.twitter.com/asYitVflin — CSIS Missile Defense (@Missile_Defense) August 8, 2018 A separate set of satellites, known as the Midcourse Tracking Sensor, which you can read about in more detail here , would then monitor the missile as it flew either through space or in the upper atmosphere and help discriminate actual warheads from decoys or other tertiary objects. It would then feed targeting information to anti-missile weapons on the ground or in space . The third array of sensors in space would orbit in positions nearer to potential friendly target areas and would be able to better determine whether a defensive weapon system had hit the incoming threat and effectively neutralized it. “Getting that capability into the architecture and providing that information to folks on the ground that have to make a decision on whether or not to re-shoot or whether to move onto another target, that is extremely important,” Greaves noted . At the same time, there are efforts to look into how the Department of Defense might be able to leverage commercial technology to improve its own space launch and satellite capabilities or maybe even make use of commercial constellations to better network its own existing and future sensor architecture. “Unless you plan to wallpaper the Earth with radars,” the “only way to see these things coming is from space,” Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin also said earlier in August 2018 . “Our response has to be a proliferated space sensor layer, possibly based off commercial space developments.” Michael Griffin, then director NASA, speaks to reporters in 2005., NASA The big question, therefore, is how long it might take to get all of these systems in place and operational and how much it might cost to do within a reasonable timeframe. So far, the Air Force has only outlined the schedule for the Next-Gen OPIR, which has already changed repeatedly in the past year. “We know that this can be done,” Griffin insisted . “To me this is not a technology challenge, this is a policy decision. Is the United States going to deploy a space layer so we can track the Chinese hypersonic threat from cloud break forward? The answer had better be yes.” Griffin, who worked on Ronald Reagan’s signature Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) missile defense program in the 1980s, has repeatedly insisted that both space-based sensors and anti-missile systems, such as either kinetic interceptors or directed energy weapons, are both practical and not as expensive as critics claim. However, he has yet to publicly present a formal cost estimate for either set of systems. With the tech we have today, there’s “no excuse” not to move forward on space based sensors. – MDA Director Greaves #SMDSymposium pic.twitter.com/zCP9PbfEAo — CSIS Missile Defense (@Missile_Defense) August 8, 2018 If the Air Force can succeed in launching the first Next-Gen OPIR satellite in 2023, two years ahead of a schedule it presented less than a year ago, it might demonstrate improvements procuring space-based systems that could apply to other programs. At the same time, the planned date for the full system to become operational does not appear to have changed and remains firmly more than a decade in the future, calling into question how realistic the new timetable might be. There is a separate possibility that the service’s decision to move up the date for the first Next-Gen OPIR satellite launch is, at least in part, driven by a broader desire on its part to show it is taking the “space domain” seriously in the face of a push for an independent space-focused military branch . Members of Congress , President Trump , and even senior Pentagon leadership have become increasingly supportive of this idea. A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket ready to launch one of the SBIRS satellites in 2017., ULA The Air Force stands to lose a significant portion of its budget and a not insignificant amount of manpower if that proposal becomes a reality. Proponents of the idea of a Space Force might be inclined to use any progress, or lack thereof, on the Next-Gen OPIR program to reinforce their arguments, which you can read about in more detail here . But whoever is ultimately in charge of buying and deploying the U.S. military’s future space-based sensors, what is clear is that the various stakeholders agree that there is a need for these systems and that they need to go into operation as soon as possible, especially given growing concerns about hypersonic weapons. It will be up to them to show that these plans are truly more feasible now than they have been in the past.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 3, 2019",It Looks Meant For A Ship But This Big Armored Turret Can Turn Trucks Into Heavy Artillery,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For more than a decade, German defense contractor Krauss-Maffei Wegmann , or KMW, has been pitching an armored turret with a massive 155mm howitzer as a relatively low-cost way to turn various tracked and wheeled military vehicles into highly mobile artillery pieces. The company has yet to find a launch customer for this system, which looks like it was ripped straight off the deck of a large warship. But with various countries, including the United States, now investing heavily in new artillery systems there could be renewed interest in the concept. KMW first announced it was working on this Armored Gun Module , or AGM, in 2004. The weapon system uses the same Rheinmetall 155mm L52 howitzer as the firm’s PzH2000 tracked self-propelled howitzer. The self-contained turret has fire control and other systems derived from the ones found on that large vehicle, as well. Compared to the PzH2000, the AGM is far more compact and automated, featuring a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system fire control arrangement to quickly get the gun into position and an automatic ammunition loading system to rapidly feed rounds into the weapon. While most self-propelled howitzers require a gun crew of between three and four individuals – not counting the driver and vehicle commander – KMW’s turret only needs two. In 2006 , a prototype AGM on a modified M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System chassis fired 10 rounds in less than three minutes. As of 2008 , KMW said the maximum rate of fire of the system at present is six rounds per minute, but that it could increase to eight in the future. An artist’s conception of KMW’s AGM turret, in this case emplaced as a fixed weapon at a small base., KMW The system is capable of Multiple Round Simultaneous Impact (MRSI) fire missions and has demonstrated an ability to have five rounds hit a target simultaneously out to a range of nearly seven and a half miles. It can fire any standard 155mm ammunition, including rocket-assisted, extended-range rounds that give it a maximum range of around 25 miles or more depending on the type. Coupled together with a super-long-range round, such as the now-in-development ramjet-powered design from Norway’s Nammo, even a small number of vehicles carrying the compact AGM system could cover large stretches of the battlefield. These are impressive statistics for a turret system that only weighs 12 and a half tons by itself and typically less than 35 tons in all depending on the chassis. KMW’s own PzH2000 is nearly 60 tons. South Korea’s K9 Thunder and the British AS-90 are 47 and 45 tons respectively The U.S. Army’s M109A7 , which has a shorter howitzer and less range than a vehicle with the AGM, is still approximately 40 tons. KMW says they can install the AGM on any vehicle that can handle the weight and shock of firing. In 2008, the company unveiled their own complete system, called Donar , which uses the ASCOD 2 infantry fighting vehicle chassis. https://youtube.com/watch?v=vacHVUrDXhg It has since demonstrated other versions on the German company ARTEC’s Boxer 8×8 wheeled armored vehicle and, most recently, on the Italian Iveco Trakker 8×8 truck . The Trakker-mounted variant features supporting outriggers to stabilize the vehicle during firing. KMW has proposed installing AGM’s in fixed and semi-permanent positions for base or coastal defense purposes, as well. KMW also offers the AGM with a shorter 155mm L39 howitzer, which has a decreased maximum range, but is lighter and has less recoil, making it more suitable for even smaller vehicles. In the past, the firm has released concept art showing this configuration on the back of a 6×6 Navistar Defense tactical truck . A Boxer 8×8 wheeled armored vehicle with the AGM turret., KMW KMW says that Donar can fit inside an Airbus A400M , or any other similarly sized transport plane, which could present another means of quickly getting them nearer to the battlefield. That vehicle also has a top speed of more than 35 miles per hour and can travel over 310 miles on a single tank of gas. An auxiliary power unit also allows it to function with the engine off. All of these features give Donar a level of versatility that could make it, or a similar configuration using a different chassis, a good choice for various types of mobile armored and infantry units. There could be a number of potential customers already. An artist’s conception of a Navistar Defense 6×6 truck carrying an AGM turret with a shorter 155mm L39 howitzer., KMW In February 2018 , the U.S. Army announced it was looking a new, common howitzer to replace its 105mm and 155mm towed types and said that it would be willing to consider a self-propelled weapon system. This service has towed howitzers in various infantry units, including airborne and airmobile forces, and a lightweight, truck-mounted AGM might be one option for many of those formations. The Army’s units that use 8×8 Stryker wheeled armored vehicles also have towed howitzers. A Stryker-mounted AGM, similar in concept to the Boxer-mounted type, would be better able to keep up with the rest of this force. The Stryker’s manufacturer, General Dynamics Land Systems, has shown off versions of the vehicle with a flat rear deck and an anti-aircraft turret already. This weapon system is much smaller the AGM, but the company could still use it as a starting place to develop a self-propelled howitzer configuration. General Dynamics’ European Land Systems division already has experience with the system since it produces the ASCOD 2 and worked with KMW on the Donar self-propelled howitzer. A proposed air defense variant of the Stryker featuring a flat rear deck to accommodate a turreted weapon system. , Boeing/General Dynamics Land Systems The Army, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, might be interested in considering the AGM as an option on any of their other future armored vehicles , as well. The Army is already looking to acquire a turreted 120mm mortar system that could work with a variant of its Next Generation Combat Vehicle. The British Army might also find itself interested in the AGM. In April 2018, the United Kingdom rejoined the Boxer program after having pulled out more than a decade earlier. It is also acquiring variants of the ASCOD 2, which it calls the Ajax . Artillery units supporting formations with either vehicle could use variants with KMW’s 155mm turret to help to reduce logistics strains and the costs of operating a different self-propelled howitzer using a distinct chassis. Other countries in Europe, especially Germany’s NATO allies, might be interested in expanding their own mobile artillery options as they look to bolster their military capabilities in general in the face of potential threats from Russia . China is driving similar defense spending increases in Asia, especially among countries with claims in the hotly contested South China Sea . Possibly reflecting the potential for interest in the AGM in the Southeast Asian market, KMW decided to show off the Iveco Trakker-mounted version for the first time at the Singapore Airshow in February 2018. An Iveco Trakker configured to carry KMW’s AGM turret., KMW It still remains to be seen whether the German defense contractor will find success with the AGM after nearly 15 years. But the company clearly feels that there may be a place for the unique features of its weapon system on a variety of different chassis.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 8, 2019",It’s Official! Blue Angels To Receive Full Squadron Of Super Hornets By End Of 2021,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Well, it’s actually happening. The Navy’s Flight Demonstration Team, better known as the Blue Angels, is set to be fully equipped with Super Hornets by the end of 2021. The news was released with little fanfare via the daily contract announcements posted on the DoD’s website, but it is very exciting news for the team and its huge global fanbase. The contract includes the procurement of 11 kits that are based on a recent engineering study that will allow 9 F/A-18Es and 2 F/A-18Fs to be modified to suit the team’s unique needs. This includes the removal of certain items, such as the jet’s nose-mounted M61A2 cannon, and the installation of others, including air show smoke systems that help onlookers trace the team’s path through the sky. Other modifications include a heavy spring in the control column that provides constant forward force. This helps the Blue Angel pilots pull off their especially tight formation aerobatics. There are some avionics modifications as well and, of course, the iconic blue and gold paint job. Tyler Rogway/Author The announcement reads : “The Boeing Co., St. Louis, Missouri, is being awarded $17,002,107 for firm-fixed-price delivery order N0001918F2654 against a previously issued basic ordering agreement (N00019-16-G-0001).  This order is for the retrofit documentation and kits to convert nine F/A-18E and two F/A-18F aircraft into a Blue Angel configuration in accordance with engineering change proposal 6480.  Work will be performed in St. Louis, Missouri, and is expected to be completed in December 2021.  Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds in the amount of $17,002,107 will be obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.” An F/A-18F turning and burning. , Tyler Rogoway/Author News that the Navy was seriously considering the transition dates back to 2015 , but this contract announcement comes as NAVAIR has enacted a plan that would see many of its youngest Legacy Hornets (F/A-18A-Ds) ported over to the USMC. This was only possible due to increased funding as part of the Trump administration’s military buildup and a larger multi-year buy of Super Hornets. These measures will drastically improve what was becoming something of a dire ‘fighter gap’ brought on by years of warfare overseas that literally flew the wings off the Navy’s tactical air fleet, delays in the F-35 program, and lack of prioritization when it came to spares procurement and general readiness under sequester. With more Super Hornets coming, and in the advanced Block III form no less, and the first Super Hornets heading to Boeing for a service life extension which will also include Block III upgrades in many instances, the Navy can treat its prized demo team to some newer hardware. Traditionally the team’s F/A-18C/Ds are among the oldest and highest hour jets in the fleet. In recent years they have been subject to a number of incidents in which parts literally fell off the aircraft in flight. Beyond that, the aging aircraft are becoming more of a hassle to keep up with the team’s highly demanding schedule. With all this in mind, the Super Hornets, which are likely to be among the oldest in the Navy’s inventory, will be a welcome addition. Tyler Rogoway/Author It’s not clear if these jets will go through a life extension before being converted and delivered to the team or if they will get older jets with hours still left on them. Beyond being newer airframes, there are certain ways the Super Hornets may impact the Blue Angel’s air show routine. The type is physically larger than the one they replace by a good margin and feature longer range—a good thing when deploying in clean configuration across the United States. The Super Hornet is quite the air show performer as it is, especially when it comes to slow and high-angle of attack maneuvers. These capabilities could enhance the solo’s routine in particular. On the other hand, the Super Hornet has been compared to the Legacy Hornet multiple times to me by pilots who have flown both—and two that were flying both at the same time at VFA-122—as a luxury high-performance SUV compared to a Porsche 911. Tyler Rogoway/Author But for what the Super Hornet lacks in certain aspects of kinematic performance, it makes up for in other ways. And considering that the Legacy Hornet has made its last cruise aboard a U.S. Navy carrier, the Super Hornet is more representative of the Navy’s front-line force. For the Marines on the other hand, who are part of the Blue Angels team but passed over procuring Super Hornet, that’s a different story. But they will be flying Legacy Hornets in a front-line capacity for many years to come. This is especially true now that they will receive an injection of airframes from the Navy, some of which will get a series of advanced upgrades including an AESA radar. It’s worth noting that the Blue Angel’s Air Force counterparts, the Thunderbirds, have flown some of the most advanced F-16C/Ds in the inventory for over a decade. The team’s Block 52 Vipers are also the first of the USAF’s F-16C/Ds to receive a service life extension . Tyler Rogoway/Author Unless something major has changed, the Blues will also be getting a C-130J to replace their KC-130T commonly referred to as Fat Albert . In that case, the aircraft is coming from surplus Royal Air Force stocks, but regardless of its origins, the J model Super Hercules brings a big leap in performance over the aging KC-130T. This will almost certainly mean Fat Albert’s routine will also receive an update. If everything goes as plan, the Blue Angels should have a very exciting and fresh look in the early 2020s.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 9, 2018","The Army’s Futuristic ‘Punisher’ Grenade Launcher Is Officially Dead, But It Could Rise Again","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than two decades, the U.S. Army says it had finally killed a program to develop a futuristic 25mm grenade launcher capable of firing computerized, programmable ammunition known as the XM25 and nicknamed “The Punisher.” However, as part of a legal settlement with the lead contractor, Orbital ATK, now part of Northrop Grumman, the service now owns the weapon’s technical design package and could hire a different company to reboot the project in the future. The Army first revealed the project had come to an end in a statement to Stars and Stripes earlier in August 2018. The service explained it had formally ended work on the XM25 , also known as the Individual Semi-Automatic Airburst System (ISAAS) or Counter-Defilade Target Engagement (CDTE) System on July 24, 2018, after reaching the deal with Orbital ATK. “After cancelling the program last year, the Army has since received rights to the program’s research and development,” U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Isaac Taylor, a service spokesperson, told Stars and Stripes on Aug. 9, 2018. “This is in addition to the 20 existing XM25 systems — to include high explosive air-burst and target practice rounds — that the Army garnered as part of the negotiated settlement.” Taylor misspoke in saying that the Army had previously canceled the program. In 2017, the service did cancel a contract with Orbital ATK, but had not made a final decision on the Punisher’s future. A mockup of the XM25 “Punisher” grenade launcher., US Army “On April 5, 2017, the Army terminated the XM25 Counter Defilade Target Engagement (CDTE) contract with the prime contractor (Orbital-ATK) after it failed to deliver the 20 weapons as specified by the terms of the contract,” another Army spokesperson told Military.com in May 2017. “Despite extensive negotiation efforts, the contractor failed to provide an acceptable alternate resolution to the Government.” Orbital ATK blamed subcontractor Heckler and Koch for the schedule slip and, in turn, sued the German gun maker. The two companies settled that lawsuit in July 2018. Clearly, the Army continued negotiating a complete and final resolution to its dispute with primary contractor afterward. As of 2016 , the program, which had already been going on for more than a decade at that point, had cost the Army $185 million. The service planned to spend more than $835 million to buy the launchers and specialized ammunition. The planned family of ammunition for the XM25., Orbital ATK The Army had long presented the XM25 as a “leap-ahead” weapon system. Unlike the existing single-shot 40mm grenade launchers that its soldiers still use today, the 25mm launcher held ammunition in five-round magazines and handled like an oversized rifle. Instead of having to arc grenades in a ballistic trajectory to have a chance of hitting enemy forces behind cover, operators could fire advanced air-bursting ammunition straight above the target area, where it would detonate, raining down a hail of deadly fragments on the personnel or light vehicles below. A computerized fire control system used a laser range finder to determine the distance to the target. It then sent that data to the grenade so it would explode at exactly the right moment. In development since 2005, the XM25 was the latest in what has been a long, meandering, expensive, and largely fruitless search for this type of capability for decades. The weapon was a direct outgrowth of the Objective Infantry Combat Weapon (OICW) program, which the Army had started in the 1990s and sought to develop a combination system that included both the 25mm launcher and a small 5.56mm carbine. In principle, the new grenade launcher, even by itself, could have significantly improved the capabilities and flexibility of grenadiers in an Army infantry squad to engage various targets at longer ranges, behind hard cover or inside buildings . Unfortunately, experiments and field tests with prototype weapons exposed serious drawbacks with the concept. For one, as with infantry grenade launchers historically, the Army found that the XM25 had little capability to engage targets at close range. Dedicated rounds for short-range targets were a possibility, but it could have been hard for troops to quickly swap between them in combat. This was an immediate problem since the service had intended for troops to use them as their primary weapon and not carry a backup, such as an M4 carbine . A US Army soldier carries an XM25 during a field trial in Afghanistan circa 2011., US Army The 14-pound system – almost twice the weight of a standard M4 – was too bulky to allow soldiers to realistically lug around a secondary weapon, anyway, and also limited how much ammunition they could take with them. It was also expensive, complex, and potentially too sensitive to the rigors of combat. In February 2013, an Army special operator in Afghanistan suffered minor injuries when their Punisher malfunctioned. This was the third potentially serious incident involving the weapon since June 2011. Thankfully safety features built into the grenade itself prevented it from exploding. The complicated nature of the launcher and its ammunition had already led to significant delays at Orbital ATK and Heckler and Koch. In August 2016, the Pentagon’s own Inspector General Office released a review of the program, describing examples of possible mismanagement and confusing and conflicting priorities within the Army itself. A timeline of the XM25 program as of 2016., DOD “Specifically, Army officials removed procurement funding from the XM25 budget, which extended the engineering and manufacturing development phase by 2 years,” the Inspector General report explained. “Additionally, Army officials contributed to the initial production decision delay by placing a hold on the XM25 capability production document.” The review recommended the Army consider canceling the project if it did not see a way to get the launcher on the path to production by the end of 2016. The service disagreed and deferred that decision, apparently until July 2018. The U.S. military’s main Inspector General also included its comments about the XM25 in a compendium of still-unresolved recommendations that it released on Aug. 1, 2018 . But it’s not clear if the Army is entirely finished the XM25, or its underlying concept, despite terminating this specific program. Now that it has the rights to the launcher, as well as all of the prototypes and ammunition, it can do whatever it might want with them. The Army is already working on air-bursting cartridges for its existing 40mm grenade launchers and it clearly remains interested in giving soldiers the ability to quickly and effectively engage opponents sheltered behind walls, rock outcroppings, or other substantive barriers. Still, multi-shot 40mm grenade launchers also exist, and the U.S. Marine Corps has already adopted one , which would be another alternative to the XM25. A US Army briefing slide from 2017 providing information about the XM1166 air-bursting 40mm cartridge., US Army The existing prototypes could serve as test bed for future grenade ammunition developments in much the same way as the AAI Corporation’s experimental light machine guns and carbines that can fire cased-telescoped or caseless ammunition. The Army also now has the rights to continue to refine or revise the design on its own or hire another contractor to do so on its behalf. The service’s engineers could explore using 3D printing or other advanced production methods , composite materials, or other concepts to try to reduce weight, bulk, and cost. This kind of experimentation could eventually lead to an actual procurement program, a well. The Army is now seriously considering a squad automatic rifle based on AAI’s designs as one possible replacement for its existing M249 Squad Automatic Weapons. Of course, the Army could choose not to do anything at all with the XM25 or its ammunition and instead leave them in storage somewhere on the off chance they might need them for testing in the future. At the same time, the service has recently begun issuing large numbers of the Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle to infantry units to improve their overall firepower, which might reduce the demand for the advanced 25mm grenade launcher in general. Depending on what happens, you may soon see Punishers turn up on display in official museums. But there is also the possibility that, some time from now, the Army might unveil a very similar looking system with a new designation and new name as part of an entirely new initiative.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 29, 2018",No Stealth For You!: Trump Signs Defense Bill That Blocks Transfer Of F-35s To Turkey,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The escalating F-35 saga between Ankara and Washington D.C., which you can read about here , hit a crescendo today when President Donald Trump signed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) at Fort Drum in upstate New York. Language in the bill specifically stops the delivery of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to Turkey—a NATO ally and one of the first international partners on the program dating back two decades. Turkey has plans to buy 100 of the stealthy fighters, 30 of which are already on order, and has invested $1.2B into the program so far. The language in the law requires a written review within 90 days on Turkish-U.S. relations, including the use of Incirlik Air Base by American forces, as well as a risk assessment associated with delivering F-35s to Turkey as well as other platforms and weapons systems. It reads in part: Assessment of impacts on other United States weapon systems and platforms operated jointly with the Republic of Turkey” for the following (ii) the Patriot surface-to-air missile system; (iii) the CH–47 Chinook heavy lift helicopter; (iv) the AH–64 Attack helicopter; (v) the H–60 Black Hawk utility helicopter; and (vi) the F–16 Fighting Falcon aircraft. Only once these documents are delivered can a reevaluation of the restrictions be made. The first Turkish F-35 has already been delivered , but it will be some time before the jets actually migrate to Turkey as Turkish F-35 pilot training is just being spun up at Luke AFB in Arizona. Secretary of Defense James Mattis was opposed to blocking the transfer on the grounds that Turkey is still a regional strategic ally of the United States and that it would add to the F-35 program’s cost and potentially disrupt its supply chain among other factors. But rhetoric emanating from Ankara doesn’t point to the possibility of a repeal of the embargo anytime soon, as both Trump and Erdogan squabble over the return of religious leaders in each other’s countries. On August 10th, 2018 the Trump administration placed sanctions on Turkey over its unwillingness to release American pastor Andrew Brunson who has been held in a Turkish custody since 2016 after it was alleged he was involved in the failed military coup against President Erdogan. Erdogan has long claimed that the U.S. is protecting Muhammed Fethullah Gülen, which the Turkish President claims was the mastermind of the 2016 coup attempt against him, even though the cleric lives in the United States. The sanctions have sent Turkey’s already faltering economy into a tailspin, with its currency, the Lira, taking a huge nosedive . Erdogan has stated that America’s move to impose sanctions is a “stab in the back” and his administration is working to forestall more economic damage and to stabilize the situation. He also said that “economic terrorists” will be dealt with, which apparently includes media that print negative information about the economy. The move was a massive departure from the chummy relationship Trump and Erdogan displayed during the first year of his Presidency. Despite Erdogan descent towards tyrannical rule, he was one of the first invitees to the White House following Trump’s inauguration. During the visit that followed, not long after Trump smiled and shook hands with Erdogan in the Oval Office, his security team beat down protesters in the streets Capital while Erdogan looked on. May 16th, 2017 meeting between Trump and Erdogan in the Oval Office was controversial to say the least. , AP And all this is surplus to the original impetus behind the F-35 embargo legislation—that Turkey is buying S-400 air defense systems from Moscow—a move that could endanger the sensitive nature of the F-35’s capabilities and support architecture. Also at risk are Turkey’s industrial offsets and participation related to the program that is said to be worth around $12B in total. The Daily Sabah states that Alp Aviation, AYESAS, Kale Aviation, Kale Pratt & Whitney, and Turkish Aerospace Industries are all producing components for the F-35 program. By some accounts, it could take up to two years to re-source these components to manufacturers in the U.S. or in other F-35 customer counties. In addition, one of three planned engine maintenance facilities in Europe to provide depot-level service for the F135 engine that powers the F-35 is located in Turkey. The other two will be stood up in Norway and The Netherlands. The legislation also requires a study on the impact of the end of Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program: C) An assessment of the Republic of Turkey’s participation in the F–35 program, including— (i) a description of industrial participation of Turkish industry in the manufacturing and assembly of the F–35 program; (ii) an assessment of tooling and other manufacturing materials held by Turkish industry; and (iii) an assessment of the impacts of a significant change in participation by the Republic of Turkey in the F–35 program and the steps that would be required to mitigate negative impacts of such a change on the United States and other international program partners. (D) An identification of potential alternative air and missile defense systems that could be purchased by the Government of the Republic of Turkey, including air and missile defense systems operated by the United States or other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states. As the once tight relationship between the U.S. and Turkey fractures, Turkey continues to be pulled closer into Moscow’s orbit, especially in an economic sense —a reality that is very concerning for its NATO partners. Beyond its increasing affinity towards Russia, the F-35 and S-400 issues, and the escalating spat over the extradition of religious figures, many other issues between the Washington D.C. and Ankara persist. April 4, 2018. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, right to left, pose for a photo before a meeting in Ankara., AP These include Turkey’s stance toward the Kurds in Northern Syria, and its involvement in the ongoing war in Syria in general, its evaporating relationship with Israel, and Erdogan’s massive crackdown on political opposition and the media, just to name a few. All the while, the U.S. still runs an operational tactical nuclear storage site at Incirlik Air Base, a U.S. outpost that Turkish lawyers now want raided along with the arrest of some of America’s top military officials in the region. These demands are once again due to unsubstantiated claims that U.S. military personnel played a central role in the July 2016 coup attempt. If there are indeed B61 nuclear bombs still stored Incirlik Air Base—we have no indication that they have been removed—it would be an incredibly nearsighted policy by the Pentagon and the Trump administration. I laid out the case for immediate removal of these weapons nearly two years ago, and at that time U.S.-Turkish relations weren’t anywhere as confrontational as they are today. At this point, the presence of these weapons at Incirlik Air Base poses an unthinkable strategic risk. It’s possible that Trump and Erdogan could come to some agreement in the coming weeks to continue on with the F-35 program, which in The War Zone’s opinion would be incredibly foolish. But considering the issues at play now that go well beyond military hardware acquisition risk, and taking into account the personalities involved, it’s highly doubtful.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 11, 2018",Iran Reveals Upgraded Short Range Ballistic Missile It Claims Is ‘Stealthy’ and More Precise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has unveiled a new type of Fateh 110 short-range ballistic missile , the Fateh Mobin, which it claims is more precise than previous variants and has improved “stealth” features to defeat enemy ballistic missile defenses and other countermeasures. The announcement follows reports that the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , or IRGC, had fired an unknown version of this weapon during a recent exercise in and around the Strait of Hormuz , but it is unclear if the launch during the drills was a test of this upgraded design. Iranian Minister of Defense Amir Hatami revealed the Fateh Mobin in a ceremony on Aug. 13, 2018 in Tehran. The country’s top military officer also took the opportunity to send a defiant message to the country’s unnamed “enemies,” almost certainly a reference to the United States and Israel , saying the weapon was an example of the country’s deterrent and military industrial capabilities and that the it would never abandon its ballistic missile development programs . “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s missile power is a defensive deterrent power and as I had promised our dear people,” Hatami said, according to Iran’s semi-official FARS News Agency . “I will not spare any efforts to increase the country’s missile capabilities and certainly, we will increase our missile power on a daily basis.” Hatami did not offer any detailed specifics about the Fateh Mobin missile itself and it is unclear how it differs from late model Fateh 110s . The only clear visual difference is a rounded nose cone instead of the older, pointed design, which Iran’s top military officer said contained an upgraded guidance system. Iranian Defense Minister Amir Hatami stands next to a Fatah Mobin short-range ballistic missile during a ceremony in Tehran on Aug. 13, 2018., via Tasmin News Agency “Nothing can stop this missile because of its high degree of flexibility,” Hatami declared. The Fateh Mobin is “100-percent domestically made… agile, stealth, tactical [and] precision-guided.” There are reports that this newly-debuted missile may have a satellite navigation system-assisted inertial navigation system guidance package, as well as an imaging infrared sensor, the latter of which would give it a capability to hit moving targets, including ships. Video purportedly showing an undated Fateh Mobin test that emerged online to go along with the announcement appears to show the missile using the latter system to zero in on a mock building. https://youtube.com/watch?v=brzuTdFS4ZQ However, there have been reports that these guidance options have been available for the Fateh family of missiles since at least June 2017 . It is possible that the Fateh Mobin features improved versions of those guidance systems and is more precise. There is nothing about the weapon’s shape, or its other external characteristics, that supports Hatami’s other claims. The basic shape of the body and arrangement of the control surfaces is visually identical to older Fateh 110 types. There is no indication that the Mobin model has any stealthy features that could hide it from enemy radars or that it is any more maneuverable than previous types, which might allow it to better dodge enemy ballistic missile defenses. It is possible that the Iranians have reduced the infrared signature of the missile at launch or have improved its guidance system to allow the weapon fly a more unusual trajectory to its target, both of which could make it more difficult for an opponent to spot or track before trying to shoot it down. At the same time, Iran has a long history of making dubious claims about its military capabilities. Dynamically guided ballistic missiles are a tough thing to perfect in general. That’s not to say that the Fateh Mobin, or its various cousins, aren’t worrisome, especially in regions where it might already be difficult to maneuver, such as the Strait of Hormuz. In June 2017, the IRGC launched a number of Zulfiqar missiles , a derivative of the Fateh 110 with slightly increased range and a warhead full of small submunitions ideal for attacking area targets, ISIS terrorists in Syria retaliation for attacks the group had staged in Tehran earlier that month. A mobile transporter-erector-launcher carrying two earlier generation Fateh 110 ballistic missiles during a parade., M-ATF via Wikimedia With their moving target and anti-ship capabilities, a barrage of Fateh 110s or more recent derivatives with unitary warheads could also help Iran deny, or at least slow, more conventional opponents from accessing certain areas. These weapons already present a standing threat to both warships and commercial shipping transiting back and forth between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It is also unclear whether or not the IRGC fired one of these Mobin variants during exercises aimed at demonstrating that force’s ability to blockade the strategic Strait of Hormuz earlier in August 2018. On Aug. 10, 2018, Fox News reported that these drills included the launch of a third generation Fateh 110 in an anti-ship configuration, though the weapon reportedly struck a mock target on land. English language Iranian media reports about the Fateh Mobin did not mention that exercise at all. In addition, this latest ballistic missile news came from Iran’s Ministry of Defense, which is separate and distinct from the powerful paramilitary IRGC. The video reportedly showing a test launch of the new type is undated and could be from the recent exercises, other tests in March 2017 , or an entirely unrelated event. Whether or not the Fateh Mobin announcement is linked in any way to the drills in the Strait of Hormuz, it is clearly a response to the U.S. government’s decision to reimpose various sanctions against Iran earlier in August 2018. This was the result of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the controversial multi-national agreement regarding Iran’s nuclear program. US President Donald Trump holds the executive order pulling the United States out of the Iran Deal in May 2018., Martin H. Simon/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images “What is said about the Islamic Republic’s defense and missile power is a cheap and baseless claim and clear meddling, and the great Iranian nation does not allow any foreign power to interfere in its defense and military affairs,” Hatami said during his speech. “The more intense are sanctions, pressures, smear campaigns, and psychological warfare against the great nation of Iran, the greater will become our will to enhance our defensive power in all areas.” In pulling out of the Iran deal, Trump specifically cited continued Iranian ballistic missile developments as an example of the agreement’s inherent flaws. The president and other critics had long complained that the arrangement did not include specific provisions aimed at restricting the regime in Tehran from furthering this work and continuing to pursue other malign activities that threaten the interests of the United States and its allies in the Middle East and beyond. Though a valid criticism, the question remains about whether abandoning an existing agreement and starting from scratch to try to address those issues has been, or will turn out to be, a fruitful course of action. On Aug. 13, 2018, separate from the Fateh Mobin ceremony, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to Twitter to explain why his regime is disinclined to negotiate with the United States in general and declare that it would never agree to talks with the Trump Administration in particular. At the same time, Iran’s economy has already suffered a slump recently, which has, in turn, led to protests aimed at President Hassan Rouhani and the country’s religious leadership. The potential impact of U.S. sanction may already be feeding into this, for better or worse , and it’s unclear what effect this might have on Iran’s capacity to develop new and improved ballistic missiles and other weapons . But, curiously, the U.S. government’s response to news surrounding developments with the Fateh missile continues to be muted, in stark contrast to even recent statements from Trump and other officials. In July 2018, the president Tweeted out a fiery message aimed at Rouhani, threatening “consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before” if Iran continued to challenge the United States. Trump has, so far, not issued any statement specifically about the IRGC firing the Fateh 110 during the exercises in and near the Strait of Hormuz, Iran’s first launch of any kind of ballistic missile in over year, or in response to this “new” missile. Other U.S. government agencies have not criticized these developments, either. On Aug. 12, 2018, during a press gaggle with reporters while en route to Brasilia, Brazil for an official visit, Secretary of Defense James Mattis did not mention Iran once. On Aug. 10, 2018, an apparent Arabic-language U.S. Department of State-linked Twitter account, which oddly has the handle @DOTArabic, claimed that that IRGC head Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari had announced another new missile development. The State Department’s English-language social media accounts did not repeat this announcement and there was no readily apparent reporting of Jafari’s statements in English-language Iranian media. A crude machine translation of the text suggested that whoever had written the message had made confusing and incorrect claims, including that Iran had a cruise missile capable of hitting targets at distances greater than 930 miles and that this was in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 . That resolution only forbids Iran from development ballistic missiles and only those that could carry nuclear warheads. A cruise missile of any kind, such as the air-launched type Iran showed off in April 2018, would not be subject to these restrictions and Iran argues that all of its missiles are exempt since it claims it is not working on any nuclear weapons. If Jafari had actually been talking about a ballistic missile, the question would then be why this statement is notable now given that he had publicly declared that Iran had examples of these weapons with maximum ranges of at least approximately 1,240 miles and was continuing to develop them in October 2017. Since the U.S. Intelligence Community has likely been aware of these developments in part or in full for some time, there remains the possibility that American officials themselves do not put the Fateh series of missiles in the same category as Iran’s more strategic weapons. It is also possible that the U.S. government is in the process of crafting additional sanctions packages or formulating a new diplomatic push to further isolate Iran and is, therefore, waiting to reveal a larger critical assessment of Iranian ballistic missile work in the future. Not ratching up the rhetoric and looking to see how domestic discontent with the regime evolves, especially as the latest sanctions come into force, would be a sensible approach for the U.S. government to pursue in general. Doing so helps deny the Iranian regime an easy way to refocus domestic anger and criticism from its own policies onto an external actor. It would also be uncharacteristic of the Trump Administration. What we do know from the Fateh Mobin revelation is that Iran is determined to demonstrate that it is designing and producing increasingly capable ballistic missiles, and will continue to do so, regardless of existing and future sanctions. But just how “new” this latest version of the Fateh missile is in actuality remains to be seen.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 11, 2018",Listen To KC-46 Tankers On A Test Flight Offer To Refuel F-15s During Stolen Q400 Incident,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After the sad end to Friday evening’s flight of a stolen Q400 , Rock 41 and Rock 42—the Oregon Air National Guard F-15Cs that intercepted Richard Russell as he flew aggressively around the Tacoma area—had to figure out where they would get gas to stay aloft. The alert tanker that launches out of Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane during scrambles hadn’t gotten airborne yet, and after a supersonic, low-level race from Portland, even the Eagle with its generous endurance would soon need gas soon or have to land. Monitoring the event over the airwaves were a pair of Boeing KC-46 Pegasus tankers that were on a test flight nearby that offered a somewhat unconventional helping hand. As the F-15s checked in to state their dwindling fuel status, the Seattle Center controller notes that the KC-46s are holding nearby and have called in to say that they are capable of refueling F-15s and are offering to do so on the fly. Still, actually executing such a plan would be something of an experimental affair as F-15 fleet pilots have never tanked from a KC-46 before. The program has been beset by delays and cost overruns , with hopes being that the first examples will finally get delivered to USAF flight-lines this Fall. Rock 41 scrambling from PDX on the evening of August 10th. The MA tail code is because the 142nd Fighter Wing has swapped some jets with the Massachusettes Air National Guard for European deployment., Russell Hill The Eagles, which had about 30 to 40 minutes of gas left according to the lead pilot, said that the KC-135 tanker out of Fairchild AFB in Spokane, callsign GASMAN 04, had just launched and was headed their way. As such, they wouldn’t need the KC-46’s help. But if this incident had been ongoing, and a KC-135 wasn’t able to get airborne quick enough, it is hard to imagine that the Eagle Drivers wouldn’t have taken the KC-46 crews up on their creative offer. And to our knowledge, it would have been the first operational refueling for the Pegasus. Listen to the complete audio recording here . The part about the KC-46s starts at around 10:15 in. KC-46, Boeing Above all else, this audio is a reminder of how the skies are a helpful place. Pilots, in general, love the community they are a part of. It is a unique family and when somebody needs help everyone in the airspace is usually ready and waiting to pitch in. On another note, I always get a ton of questions about why the 142nd Fighter Wing are called to intercept aircraft around Seattle and why fighters out of McChord AFB or Naval Air Station Whidbey Island aren’t used. The very simple answer is that there are no fighters based in Washington that sit alert and have pilots trained in this very specific mission set. There are no fighters stationed at McChord AFB and Whidbey Island’s EA-18Gs are air-to-air capable only with the AIM-120 AMRAAM for defensive purposes. In other words, Portland’s alert F-15s, which commonly include two jets and a spare—all fully armed—as well as another aircraft with its cannon loaded that can be launched in a pinch, cover all the airspace from the northern reaches of California to British Columbia. You can read more about the 142nd Fighter Wing’s readiness here and a video of a practice intercept by the unit’s F-15s is also posted below. The complete post can be found here . The rest of the recording is highly interesting as well as it is rare we get to hear the F-15 pilots on the radio as they use UHF, and in rarer cases, encrypted communications. At the start of the video we hear the aftermath of the crash, and at the end, we hear the lead F-15 pilot working to intercept the tanker between Seattle and Everett.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. F-15s scrambled to intercept a potentially stolen or hijacked aircraft flying in airspace south of Seattle. I have been updating my twitter as I was away from my office, but below is what you need to know thus far. Details remain sketchy and are likely to change to some degree, but at around 8:15pm this evening, F-15Cs from the 142nd Fighter Wing at Portland International Airport were sent on an over-land emergency scramble to intercept a low-flying target south of Seattle. This is an actual picture (and the one at the top of this post) of Rock 41 scrambling out of PDX this evening. The MA tail code is because the unit has swapped some of its jets with the Massachusetts Air National Guard for an overseas deployment. Our good friend and wonderful photographer Russell Hill provided these pictures. Make sure to check out all his work here ., Russell Hill Based on our sources, the aircraft was a possibly stolen or hijacked Q400 twin-turboprop airliner out of Seattle International Airport. Whatever happened leading up to its flight resulted in a total ground-stop at the airport. The F-15s intercepted the Q400 and were cleared to launch flares during that intercept. Apparently, the aircraft has since crashed or was shot down, with the F-15s circling overhead the crash site and waiting for first responders. BIGFOOT, the callsign for the Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) that controls these types of intercepts instructed the F-15s to land at nearby McChord AFB once they were no longer to stay on station. UPDATE: 9:44pm PST— Apparently, it was an employee at the airport and nobody else was onboard. This is very good news. Here is audio from the person named Rich who stole the plane: Here is more video: Here is the aircraft’s ID: Update: 9:50pm PST— Local officials state that the aircraft crashed due to the pilot’s direct actions and was not shot down. More on the suspect: We will continue to update this post with new information as it comes available. You can see exactly what it is like to get intercepted by Oregon Air National Guard F-15s in this past video of ours: Update: 10:14pm PST— ​More important audio:​​​ A KC-135 is now up over the scene: A Piece County Sheriff Cessna is also circling the scene: A bit of commentary: I am very surprised this aircraft was not shot down earlier. It was at low altitude and a Q400 could do a lot of damage, especially considering so many outside events are going in the region. He was communicating and the Eagles had him in their sights, but once he flew over water I am a little surprised that wasn’t it. We don’t know all the details, far from it, but it seems like they did everything and more to try to get him to land safely. It will be interesting to find out how this all went down exactly. For those who think it would be impossible for someone with no formal flight training to steal and eventually land a complex aircraft, give this past feature of mine a read. Some info to our friends @Aircraftspots: Update: 10:55pm PST— Check out video of the guy doing aerobatics very close to the water in the stolen Q400: Here is the debris and fuel left burning on the water’s surface: Update: 11:18pm PST— The crash site (white arrow) and the surrounding area. You can see just how close McChord AFB was. Google Earth From @Civmilair: We have been told the aircraft was sitting on a hardstand at SEATAC where it wouldn’t need a pushback to taxi.

Also, here is a statement from Washington’s governor: Update: 11:57pm PST— A new angle on the split-s maneuver that some are calling a loop: This audio may have been right before the end: Update: 12:10am PST— A message from Horizon’s Chief Operations Officer: https://youtube.com/watch?v=LM6zshBLSDg Alaska says the person who stole the Q400 was a ground service agent, not a mechanic. Update: 12:30pm PST— Here are some personal thoughts I posted on Twitter after tonight’s events: Update 10:47am PST— Here is NORAD’s statement on the event: I have received multiple inquiries on the F-15’s potentially going supersonic on their way up to the Seattle-Tacoma area. They can get up there in a handful of minutes and have broken the sound barrier doing so before. It looks like they did it again in this case: A number of agencies are on the scene of the crash now, with the FBI Seattle office leading the criminal investigation. There is also a temporary flight restriction up around the crash site. Update: 2:04pm PST— Apparently, this is a video made by Richard Russell, the perpetrator of the incident. It will certainly be examined in the investigation into the incident. It is somewhat eerie for a number of reasons as you can see for yourself: https://youtube.com/watch?v=RQ765Fnec8Q In a blog he made for the same class that the video was for from 2017, his ‘about’ page has some details about his life.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 1, 2018",Iran Fired Ballistic Missile During Drills Where It Practiced Blockading the Strait of Hormuz,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran reportedly fired a short-range Fateh 110 ballistic missile, the first launch of any kind of ballistic missile in more than a year , during recent exercises in and around the Strait of Hormuz, further underscoring threatening capability the country wields over the strategic waterway . It will likely incite the ire of President Donald Trump, if it hasn’t already, who pulled out of a controversial deal over Iran’s nuclear program, in no small part over the country’s continued development of these types of weapons, earlier in 2018. Fox News was the first to report the launch , citing unnamed U.S. government officials. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) fired the third generation Fateh 110 , said to have been in an anti-ship configuration, from Iranian soil, after which it flew over 100 miles, crossing part of the Strait of Hormuz, and then impacting on a desert test range on land inside the country. There is no indication that any ships in the area, including the U.S. Navy destroyer USS The Sullivans , which is operating in the region , were ever in danger. “The scope and scale of the exercise [in and around the Strait of Hormuz] we saw was similar to what we’ve seen with other exercises that they’ve done in this region,” U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, told reporters on Aug. 8, 2018, without  making any mention of a missile launch. “I think what was perhaps a little bit different was the timing of it in this particular case. And so, I think it’s pretty clear to us that they were trying to use that exercise to send a message to us that as – as we approach this – the period of the sanctions here, that they had some capabilities.” The Pentagon declined to comment to Fox News on the use of the Fateh 110 during the exercise. One of the outlet’s sources , however, said that it was routine for the IRGC to fire missiles during drills in and around the Strait of Hormuz. A mobile Fateh 110 transporter-erector-launcher, with two missiles. , M-ATF via Wikimedia The Fateh 110 itself is a well-established weapon in the Iranian arsenal and has been in service since 2002. The third generation version, which reportedly has a range of approximately 185 miles, first emerged to the public in 2010. Iran has since developed a number of additional variants and derivatives of the same design, which reportedly have increased range and accuracy. In 2011, Iran claimed that it had tested a dedicated anti-ship version of that missile, which it called Khalij Fars . That the missile during this recent exercise impacted a target on land and that Fox News’ sources described it specifically as a third generation Fateh 110 rather than the Khalij Fars, or more recent derivatives aptly named Hormuz-1 and Hormuz-2 , which also reportedly have an anti-ship capability, raise questions about what the exact model might have been. The last known launches of the Fateh 110 came in March 2017, when Iran fired a pair of them in either tests or drills, according to Fox News . One reportedly hit a floating barge, an apparent mock naval target, at a range of around 155 miles. In June 2017, the IRGC fired a barrage of Zulfiqar ballistic missiles , a derivative of the Fateh 110, at ISIS terrorists in Syria in retaliation for terrorist attacks in Iran’s capital Tehran. The use of the anti-ship Fateh 110 variant during the recent drills is clearly meant to highlight the various capabilities Iran could bring to bear if it wanted to shut down the Strait of Hormuz. On multiple occasions in 2018, Iranian officials have explicitly and implicitly threatened to do this in response to sanctions and other “aggression” from the United States. Iran has raised the possibility of trying to close off the important waterway repeatedly in the past , as well. As in this case, these threats typically coincide with periods of increased tensions with the United States and other regional opponents. You can read more about the Iranians might go about doing this and the potential impacts here . Suffice to say, if the Iranians actually tried to impose a blockade, using the Fateh 110s and other weapons, especially naval mines , it could easily touch off a broader regional conflict that would be almost certain to drag in the United States. Even if the parties involved managed to avoid a larger war, the crisis could still have significant impacts around the world. Some 20 percent of all oil exports make their way to their destinations via the Strait of Hormuz. The video below shows the IRGC’s “Great  Prophet IX” exercise, another drill in the Strait of Hormuz 2015, which involved sinking a mock aircraft carrier . https://youtube.com/watch?v=CkbS4BQxTgg But the launch of the Fateh 110 could also prompt a new round of charged rhetoric from the U.S. government and President Trump himself. As a candidate and since taking office, he has been an outspoken critic of Iran’s missile programs and regularly cited them among the reasons why he felt that the multi-national deal with Iran over its equally controversial nuclear program was flawed. In May 2018, Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of that agreement . On Aug. 6, 2018, he ordered the reimposition of a host of economic sanctions against Iran that the United States had lifted under the deal. “We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles,” Trump had said in a speech at the United Nations on Sept. 19, 2017. “The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.” US President Donald Trump speaks at the United Nations in September 2017., AP Opponents of the deal had long criticized it, not unreasonably , for having a myopic focus on the country’s nuclear ambitions alone, without addressing any other significant issues. Among these were Iran’s continuing ballistic missile developments, which present a standing threat to American interests and allies in the region, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia . The agreement did contain a provision calling for Iran to help promote regional peace and stability, which the country definitely did not do . Critics had said then that Iranian missiles violated the “ spirit of the agreement, ” even if they did not technically violate it. And lastly, a separate United Nations Security Council resolution forbids Iran from launching any ballistic missile that could carry a nuclear weapon until 2023. Since Iranian authorities insist they are not developing nuclear warheads at all, they argue that all of their missiles are exempt . The United States and other countries have vehemently disagreed with this position . Regardless, at present, there is no publicly available evidence that Iran is presently developing any nuclear weapons , especially ones small enough to fit inside the Fateh 110, which would exempt it from this U.N.-backed missile launch ban. Of course, it’s not clear whether any of this will matter to the Trump administration, or National Security Advisor John Bolton , in particular. Bolton has been an outspoken advocate of regime change, despite insisting that this is not current United States policy , and of potential military action in Iran in the past. US National Security Advisor John Bolton., Alexey Vitvitsky/Sputnik via AP There is also evidence that Trump himself is more inclined to make policy decisions based on news reports, rather than any information he receives from his own Intelligence Community. In September 2017 , he criticized what Fox News and other outlets characterized as video of a new missile test, despite Iran having never claimed it as such. It turned out, as we at The War Zone reported at the time initially, that the footage was months old and was of a launch that had already prompted U.S. sanctions . It remains hard to imagine that American intelligence agencies were not aware of the true situation and Trump had apparently not sought out their counsel before Tweeting out about the apparent new development. The video below shows footage of the missile test that occurred in January 2017, but which Iran only released in September 2017. https://youtube.com/watch?v=g1-pzkLjeE0 Though Fox News and others have already characterized this Fateh 110 launch during the recent drills as a “test,” we have no way of telling if this is an accurate description of the events, but it could have an impact on how Trump interprets them. After sanctioning Iran over the January 2017 missile test, the president said he had put Iranian authorities “on notice” that there would be consequences for further ballistic missile tests. However, the U.S. government did not make a major issue out of Iran’s decision to fire the Zulfiqars into Syria in an operational context in June 2017. At the time of writing, Trump had not yet mentioned the news on Twitter or through any other outlet. Regardless, the concern is that this incident could lead to more tit-for-tat sanctions and threats, which might further inflame tensions and increase the possibility of a miscalculation on either the part of the United States or Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is under increasing pressure on multiple fronts at home and has increasingly chosen to take a defiant stance against the U.S. government in an apparent attempt to bolster his political standing. In July 2018, the two leaders exchanged threats, with Trump writing an especially inflammatory Tweet that called the Iranian president’s word’s “demented.” The president’s statement came after a round of threats to close the Strait of Hormuz and may have led to the snap IRGC exercises followed. Still, it’s already been at least a week since Iran reportedly fired the Fateh 110 and it seems highly unlikely, especially given Fox News’ sources, that the U.S. Intelligence Community was unaware that this launch had occurred. In that time, however, there has been no criticism, or other statements, from Trump or his Administration regarding the event. This raises the possibility that the U.S. officials may have already dismissed the use of the missile as routine. On the other hand, they could also be waiting until a more critical juncture to bring up that information as evidence of Iran’s continued defiance of the international community. Now that Fox’s report is out in the open, we may not have to wait long for an official response.

The initiative didn’t go as planned, but looking back, the United States class was incredibly novel and even forward thinking in some regards, and at the same time it was also incredibly nearsighted. USS United States, the first carrier to be built in the post-World War II era, and her three sister ships were going to be supercarriers indeed. Measuring 1090 feet long and 190 feet wide, and displacing roughly 65,000 tons—83,000 tons when fully loaded—they would dwarf their predecessors. With eight Foster-Wheeler boilers and four Westinghouse turbines, USS United States would produce 280,000hp with her four screws propelling her to speeds in excess of 33 knots. The crew size would have been roughly 5,500 personnel, with nearly half that made up by the carrier’s embarked air wing. Based on these metrics alone, USS United States as a link between earlier carrier designs and the Forrestal class of supercarriers that would emerge after the Korean War, is clear. Other features were also foreshadowing the future of carrier design. CVA-58’s configuration rapidly evolved as the 1940s drew to a close. In its final form, the vessel’s four catapults were arrayed on the bow and angled out on the ship’s waist. The location of the ship’s four elevators, arrayed on the periphery of its deck to keep from interrupting flight operations and to keep from compromising the integrity of the heavily armored deck, looks somewhat familiar to what we see on supercarriers today. But USS United States’ commonality with established supercarrier configuration ends there. The United States class was far more exotic. The whole concept focused on the ability to field bomber aircraft—each weighing upwards of 100,000lbs—at sea that would be capable of lugging the bulky and heavy nuclear weapons of the early atomic age over long distances to vaporize enemy targets. Preliminary exploratory design model for CVA-58. In the end, the finalized design looked very different., USN With this requirement in mind, the ship needed to have an open enough deck to accommodate a jet bomber’s wide wingspan. As a result, there was no island superstructure. It was a flush-deck design that harkened back to the dawn of naval aviation. Even its funnels were retractable and arranged along the ship’s edge to provide the widest possible operating area for big nuclear-armed aircraft. There was no angled landing area either, although there were outcropped sponsons for launching fighters off the waist catapults while the main operating area was in use. By the end of 1947, the United States class’s exotic configuration was largely locked in., National Archives In addition, the ship’s deck would be heavily armored, instead of the hangar bay as in past designs. This resulted in a much higher center of gravity that was overcome by adding to the ship’s overall size and displacement. Even getting the bombers into a hangar bay was less of a priority in the overall design as they were so large. Instead, most of them would live life in the elements on the ship’s deck throughout an entire cruise. A hangar bay did exist, but it was intended mainly to support a contingent of escort jet fighters that would also call the vessel home. In all, the air wing would be made up of about a dozen bombers and 48 jet fighters, with a surge capacity to roughly 18 bombers and 54 fighters. The lack of an island meant that the ship wouldn’t have a radar or any other command and control capabilities. A small pop-up wheelhouse was part of the design for basic navigation purposes alone, as well as an enclosed tower-like platform for directing movements around the deck. Beyond that, an accompanying specially outfitted command ship cruiser would have to provide all the ship’s radar, navigation, war planning, and command and control functionality. In a sense, USS United States the arsenal ship of her day. As a ‘bomber carrier,’ nuclear strike was the ship’s primary mission, but it could also execute more traditional tasks like supporting amphibious operations, sea control, and tactical air support. They were planned to have been the centerpieces in a new 39 ship architecture that was tailored around them. Two smaller, more traditional carriers would operate alongside each of the four United States class supercarriers and her escorts to provide additional fighter escort and other duties, like anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare support. In all, the procurement of this force would cost at least $1.265B, with USS United States costing $190M alone. The whole concept was designed to challenge the USAF’s monopoly on nuclear weapons delivery. This enraged the newly minted Air Force’s top leadership, and the Army wasn’t too excited to see more funding and mission sets handed over to the Navy, either. As the post World War II defense budget retracted, calls to outright cancel the United States class program grew louder. Then, on April 23rd, 1949 Defense Secretary Louis Johnson, who had just been on the job a number of weeks after President Truman fired Secretary of Defense James Forrestal who supported the Navy’s plans, canceled construction of the United States without seeking the approval of the Chief of Naval Operations. Navy Secretary John Sullivan resigned in protest. Louis Johnson, America’s second Secretary of Defense., Truman Library Congressional hearings commenced to better understand Johnson’s snap decision. Through this process, the aircraft carrier’s modern utility in a nuclear age wasn’t well articulated and the decision to sink the United States class was upheld, with the USAF’s strategic bombers being favored over the Navy’s carriers for the nuclear delivery mission. All this, as well as a number of other service rivalry and political factors, led to what is widely called the “ Revolt of the Admirals, ” where a number of the Navy’s top brass resigned in protest just as the CNO did. The shockwaves from this standoff between the services, Pentagon and White House leadership, still reverberate to this very day. The keel of USS United States had already been laid when word of her abrupt cancellation came., USN Even though USS United States was canceled, these events brought attention to the plight of the supercarrier in general and were intrinsic in seeing the far more conventionally configured and aptly named Forrestal class make it into production just half a decade later. In the end, the Korean War proved that carrier air power was still highly relevant and a necessary investment—especially in conventional weapons terms. Nuclear weapons rapidly shrunk in size while increasing dramatically in power as well. By 1950, nukes were at sea about the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVA-42), a far smaller carrier than the USS United States . As for the Navy’s role in the Pentagon’s grander strategic deterrent mission, missile technology, and most notably the submarine-launched ballistic missiles, would make the outrage over canceling the USS United States a non-factor, and in retrospect, a glaringly good decision. Still, while the Forrestal class gave birth to the supercarrier operationally speaking, the United States class was the genesis of the idea as a real fundable concept the Navy could hang its hat on. F-8 Crusaders over USS Forrestal in 1962., USN Fast forward to today, an age of rapidly increasingly supercarrier prices , with the yet to be named fourth Ford class carrier costing $16B—almost the entire annual defense budget of Canada—and that’s just to purchase, not to operate for 50 years and then dispose of . Maybe the United States class concept could be mined for ideas on how to lower the cost and complexity of future carrier designs. A shrunken island size and more deck area are already parts of the Ford class’s feature list, but the idea of deleting most of a carrier’s sensors, including their very costly radar system, and leveraging those on a nearby cruiser and from the strike group overall, is an interesting proposition. It is a far more plausible concept today, where advanced data-links and cooperative engagement capabilities are becoming common, than in the late 1940s when most all information was relayed by traditional radio communications. Moving command and control, intelligence gathering and exploitation, and combat information center tasks to a surface combatant is also an interesting idea. Vessels like the Zumwalt class, which has a command deck more like the ones found at fixed installations on land that command entire wars than those commonly found on traditional surface combatants, may be able to accommodate such a concept. Even the Navy’s upcoming next-generation cruiser could be designed with this capability in mind. USN Also the idea of placing larger, longer-range aircraft back on aircraft carriers is attractive considering the lack of range of modern naval tactical aircraft and the raising specter of anti-access/area-denial peer state conflict. In those scenarios, the threat posed by multiple anti-ship weapons technologies far outranges the reach of modern carrier-based combat aircraft. The Navy is working to at least partially solve this problem with carrier-based tanker drones , but even then, aircraft with more generous unrefueled range would be highly prized assets for a modern American carrier air wing. Basically, this capability could be affordably fielded by procuring navalized unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), which you can read all about here . Even nuclear weapons may soon make their return to American carrier air wings in the weapons bays of F-35Cs. So in addition to looking at building smaller, conventionally fueled aircraft carriers to replace at least a portion of the Navy’s supercarrier force, maybe examining what a modern supercarrier arsenal ship type concept would look like and what it would cost would be a logical endeavor. Regardless, that’s the tale of the abortive United States class, the first American supercarrier that almost was.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 22, 2018","The Scope, Not The Scale of Russian And Chinese Naval Ops In The Atlantic Is Worrisome","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s top officer has warned that Russian submarines are prowling the Atlantic Ocean at rates not seen since the end of the Cold War and that China is beginning to increase its naval activity closer to American shores. Though there has certainly been an uptick in these activities, the available evidence points to the nature of those operations, rather than the exact number of ships as being the real source of concern. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson explained his worries in an interview that Voice of America, or VOA, published on Aug. 6, 2018. It’s not the first time he has raised these concerns and he had directed the Navy to reactivate the 2nd Fleet to oversee naval operations in the northwest Atlantic in May 2018. That command will hold a formal establishment ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk on Aug. 24, 2018. “We’re talking about more [Russian submarine activity] than we’ve seen in 25 years,” Richardson told VOA . “Even five years ago, we wouldn’t have seen anything like this,” he added regarding Chinese naval activity in the region. There is no debate that Russia is making a very public push to reinvigorate its naval operations and conduct more routine patrols in the Atlantic and elsewhere. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made clear that the goal of this effort is, at least in part, is to enhance his country’s nuclear deterrent capabilities . Russia’s Borei -class ballistic missile submarine Alexander Nevsky ., Russian Ministry of Defense “A total of 102 voyages by surface ships and submarines are scheduled for this year,” Putin said in May 2018 . “It is essential to enhance the naval component of the strategic nuclear force. This will increase the role of the Navy in nuclear deterrence.” The plan is also to have more ships and submarines patrolling with conventional stand-off land-attack cruise missiles in places where they could rush to intervene in support of the Kremlin’s interests or in defense of its foreign partners . This would be an extension of the model Russia has applied in Syria , where Russian forces have demonstrated a variety of expeditionary capabilities and hybrid warfare concepts that were essential in keeping dictator Bashar Al Assad in power and allowing him to regain his footing . What’s less clear is how ready and able the Russian Navy, especially its submarine forces , is to meet these objectives. For example, publicly available evidence suggests that the Kremlin has stepped up deterrent patrols with ballistic missile submarines in the Atlantic, but only by shifting resources and reducing those operations in the Pacific. There are real questions about whether the Kremlin has the manpower and other resources necessary to turn any surge in operations into a permanent routine. The Russians also would not have to increase their submarine activity very much for it to look impressive compared to what it was 25 years ago based on the Navy’s own reporting, according to the Federation of American Scientists .  In 1993, Russia’s Navy sent ballistic missile submarines on around 20 patrols and had cruise missile and attack boats make around 15 sorties. Even in 1989, Soviet submarine activity was half of what it was between 1983 and 1984 and was steadily trending downward. As of 2008, the Russian submarine force as a whole had been averaging approximately 20 sorties a year for a decade. If that number had doubled by 2018 it would indeed be a major increase “since the end of the cold war,” but still less than the Soviet Navy’s typical operating levels in the 1980s. “We watch all submarine activity,” Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters on Aug. 7, 2018, when asked about the reports. “I’m not concerned about it.” But it’s the exact nature of present Russian submarine operations that actually seems to have the U.S. military most concerned. In particular, the Kremlin has reportedly been deploying boats near undersea cables in the North Atlantic at an unprecedented rate. “We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Andrew Lennon, who serves as NATO’s top submarine officer , revealed to The Washington Post in December 2017. “Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.” Russia has invested heavily in special mission submarines that experts widely believe can cut and tap these capable, which could allow them access to sensitive data or give them a means to cut off the flow of information in a crisis. In 2016, at an event the National Defense Industry Association hosted, Robin Brunner, then-Director of Science and Technology for U.S. Northern Command, used the Russian Navy’s nuclear-powered midget submarine Losharik as an example of worrisome maritime “dark targets” that were especially difficult to detect and monitor. A slide from a briefing that then-Director of Science and Technology for U.S. Northern Command Robin Brunner gave in 2016 that shows an artist’s conception of Losharik as an example of a maritime “dark target.”, NORTHCOM The fear is that this boat, and others like it , might be able to operate close to American shores without anyone knowing, tapping cables, deploying sensors, or otherwise collecting intelligence. With the Kremlin investing heavily in long-range nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed torpedoes and unmanned underwater vehicles , there is a concern that even a small number of Russian submarines might be able to present an outsized and asymmetric threat in the North Atlantic. It is similarly the nature of Chinese naval activity in the Atlantic is particularly notable, rather than how many ships it sends there, at least at the moment. China is actively seeking to evolve from a regional power into a global one . The video below shows actual footage of Russia’s Poseidon long-range, nuclear-armed torpedo, as well as computer generated clips of how the Russians might employ it during an actual conflict. On top of that, unlike Russia, the country does appear to have the resources necessary to pursue its plans, at least in the near term. China is in the midst of a massive push to increase both the size and capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) with the plans to add dozens of modern surface warships, including new destroyers and a fleet of supercarriers , as well as more nuclear and advanced diesel-electric submarines capable of longer range operations. It is also rapidly expanding its own network of formal bases and agreements with foreign countries that allow its military ships to use their commercial ports. These will all enable it to conduct operations at will not just in the Atlantic, but also in the Pacific , around Europe , off the coasts of Africa , and in the increasing strategic Arctic region . The PLAN is already “ready and capable” of operating worldwide, Admiral Richardson told VOA. “They’re certainly a pacing competition for us in terms of the naval threat.” Much more so than Russia, China appears to be the United States’ next major global competitor, with the PLAN at the forefront of its ability to project force, as well as economic power well beyond its borders. The Chinese military is already challenging the U.S. Navy’s ability to operate freely across wide swaths of the Pacific region . Richardson is right to be concerned that authorities in Beijing might be interested in expanding those activities into other areas where the U.S. Navy has typically enjoyed unfettered naval supremacy. That the PLAN is sending ships into the North Atlantic at all would seem to suggest it is looking to make its presence felt and sends a signal that, while these sorties might not be a direct challenge to the United States now, they could be in the near future. A Chinese Type 091 nuclear-powered attack submarine., Qiao Tianfu/Color China Photo/AP With the reactivation of 2nd Fleet, which the Navy had shuttered in 2011 due to budget cuts and limits concerns about threats at Atlantic at the time, it is clear that the service is taking this uptick in naval activity seriously, whether it’s cause for actual concern right now or not. It is definitely important for the U.S. military to begin devising ways to mitigate any future threats now. Stepping up American naval operations in the northwestern Atlantic could be a daunting task, given the existing strains on the service’s surface and subsurface fleets , maintenance backlogs , and personnel shortages , not to mention other operational demands . The Navy has a long-standing goal of a total fleet size of 355 ships to help mitigate some of these issues, but even with a new influx of funds, it has been difficult to see how the service would get there any time soon . At the same time, operations in the North Atlantic could be a perfect opportunity to test out new operational concepts and the use of smaller ships to cost-effectively monitor a region of interest. The relatively limited area that 2nd Fleet has to cover would be a good proving ground to explore the Navy might be able to do with its future guided missile frigates , its growing fleets of long-range unmanned surface and undersea vehicles , and other emerging technologies . However the Navy decides to respond to increased Russian and Chinese naval activity in Atlantic, it will have to ensure its plans truly address the complex challenges those operations pose, regardless of how many potentially hostile ships and submarines are actually cruising around the region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 18, 2018","Lockheed’s Wayne Roberts On Looping The Hercules, Test Flying, And All Things C-130","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin’s C-130 team stormed into the Farnborough Air Show in England with their new LM-100J commercial variant of the iconic and super versatile Hercules. The LM-100J display, flown by veteran Lockheed test pilot Wayne Robers, stole the entire show. During the routine, Roberts pulled off quite the spectacle, looping the airlifter right in front of the crowd. The second video of the routine was available The War Zone posted it and it went viral around the globe. Now we get to hear all about this historic air show routine, including how it became a reality and how it was flown, by Wayne Roberts himself. And that’s not all, we also talk test pilot flying, memorable moments in the cockpit, favorite aircraft, and everything C-130 with the soon to retire master pilot. As a bonus, we also get to pick Lockheed’s Vice President of Business Development for Air Mobility and Maritime Missions Tony Frese’s brain about LM-100J and what’s in store for the Hercules in the decades to come. So buckle in, it’s going to be a wild ride, and start off by watching these videos of Wayne’s awesome air show routine: Tyler: Wayne, you’re the only pilot in the world who holds an aerobatic card for the C-130. What went into obtaining something like that? I didn’t even know such a qualification even existed! Wayne: Yeah, okay. So, I have to say, I’m not sure I knew either until I started going into it. Years ago, the FAA decided they needed to regulate for safety purposes airshow pilots. They needed to make sure they were safe to do air shows in front of the public. They did a really smart thing. They delegated it through the international council of air shows, and they’re really the group of professional air show pilots that get together and help each other out. So, the international council of air shows, I contacted them. I started getting the statement of aerobatic currency, which is what the FAA calls it, in 2009—I got the first one with the C-130J team, I did Paris [Paris Air Show] that year. I also updated it in 2010 and then I did it again for this show. So, what it is is it’s a bunch of air show pilots that are very senior and they had the responsibility to evaluate other air show pilots and then recommended the FAA that we can do a routine in our airplane. So, since I chose the C-130J as my airplane, my statement of aerobatic currency competency is for all models of the C-130. This special operations MC-130J Commando II variant of the Super Hercules, seen taking off from the factory in Marietta, Georgia is the 400th C-130J built. Suffice it to say that it’s ‘unique’ that a pilot holds an aerobatic currency competency for an airlifter!, Lockheed Martin Tyler: Were you surprised by the reaction that you received after you did your latest routine at the Farnborough Air Show in the LM-100J? Wayne: Yeah, I certainly was surprised at the extent of it. To me, I’ve done the shows since 1998, and I’ve just been slowly making the shows better and showing off more capability of the airplane. To me, this was a small step from my last show, which was actually in 2011. We didn’t have a reason to do another show for a few years, because we didn’t have another new airplane to market like the LM-100J. But to me, it was a relatively small adjustment, but what I did is I shifted the show to the center and then created a little bit more of a loop, and it certainly seemed to make the difference. Wayne leads a tour of the C-130. His routine at Farnborough was a crowd favorite, to say the least, and made international headlines., Lockheed Martin Tyler: Oh, it sure did. No question about that. Now, as far as that loop and planning the routine to execute that particular maneuver, what was that like? What all did it entail to make it happen? Wayne: Well, okay. Again, I’ve been kind of a professional air show pilot, essentially, for the last 20 years, so I’ve worked into a very methodical process to create a show. I always create a little different show. I always make it a little bit better, change it. To create the show and then to perfect it and then to perform it. So, let me talk a little bit about those steps. First of all, I know an awful lot about the airplane. I started flying four-engine turboprop P-3s 41 years ago, and I’ve been flying steadily ever since. I flew the Navy P-3s and then I went to test pilot school, became an instructor at the Navy Test Pilot School in turboprops and handling qualities and performance in big airplanes in the early ’80s. Then I joined Lockheed and worked for almost 30 years at Lockheed, I’ve been testing big airplanes, mostly big turboprops. In the C-130J, I’ve done everything with it… I was back there in the trenches doing the development work in the ’90s, and I pretty much got a chance to do every good flight test there was, from all the stalls, the side-slips, to all the engine out work. So, I really know how the airplane performs and handles, so it was a good background to slowly put the show together. All right, so in this particular show, I made changes, and I kind of inverted the show to create this loop maneuver right in front of the crowd. One of the reasons I did that is because the airspace has gotten so tight because of prior accidents and risk mitigation. They really don’t want you to go upside down or into unusual latitudes at Farnborough now except right on a narrow little slip of the field in front of the crowd. So, it was a perfect excuse for me to invert my show. Instead of doing stuff on the side, most people do stuff on the side, high up, and then zoom past the crowd in the middle, and kind of this figure-eight type thing. This gave me the excuse to come in and do the maneuver right in front of the crowd, which just showed it off. I was doing similar maneuvers before, but it just didn’t show it off, what I was really doing, until you put the loop really right in front of the crowd. So, when I decided to do that, then I finalized the routine. It took me about a month and a half of two or three hours every night in the simulator for about a month and a half to put this show together, head up, head up down displays, and then I did it about 120 times, just to give you an idea of what it takes to get precision in a show like this. I performed the eight-minute show about 120 times in the simulator. By then, I had a very, very repeatable show. We have all this flight test and simulation data that we can put together. I can see how the airplane flies in three dimensions after I fly it in the sim, and we put these multiple shows together, and I was going through the exact same space in three dimensions, and in four dimensions in time over and over again. So, with that kind of precision, now you have actually a safer show because all the way through the routine I know exactly what I’m supposed to be seeing. And if I’m not seeing the airspeed and the altitude and all these checkpoints all the way around, then I can make small corrections, or I can check if the airplane’s not performing right. I only need a few show practices in the airplane, because I know the airplane so well, I know the simulator so well, that there are only a few things I check to make sure that the performance in the airplane is not too much different. So I only ended up doing three practice routines, 120 in the simulator, three in the airplane, and I was ready to go. Tyler: As far as, what do you call it? Is it a loop? Is there a special name for that maneuver that you came up with for the maneuver? Wayne: You might be a great candidate to come up with a good name! Let me tell you what it is. It’s pretty close to a loop. Let me explain what’s different about it. This is something I also want to comment on. The routine and practicing it is one thing and putting it together. To actually convince the FAA, the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] in Europe because it’s flown in Europe, and the Flying Control Committee in Farnborough, that it’s a safe show is a whole other thing. I know it’s safe, but I have to convince everybody. The statement of aerobatic competency is one piece of it. We had the airplane structurally analyzed by our engineers who are also FAA engineer representatives, so the airplane was analyzed in detail to be able to do the show with no overstress whatsoever. And then, of course, we record everything the airplane does and look after each show. All that has to happen. The other piece of it is that I treat it just like any other transport mission in an FAA sense. We look at every single point failure that can occur during the air show, and if I’m not happy, and the FAA would not be either, if any single point failure, and I don’t care what the probability of the single point failure is, any single point failure would result in there not being a safe recovery. I worked through every engine failure at every moment of the show, even when I’m almost upside down. I look at all four engine failures one at a time. I come up with what I’m going to do with the HUD [Heads Up Display], what I’m going to do with the rudders, and the ailerons, the escape maneuver that gets away from the crowd, whether I lose my Heads Up Display, the Heads Down Display, or any other system that’s a single point failure is all analyzed. And of course, we do this anyway for all missions. These are the things that enter my head anyway, but we apply it to the show. Now, I say all that because I inclined the show at the loop 20 degrees, and that’s why it’s not quite a loop, but I do that for safety purposes. It actually gives me more options to get out of an engine failure than a straight loop. But it’s a minor difference from the crowd point of view, and the way I do the loop, you can’t see the 20 degrees bank much, so it’s a little bit of an optical illusion but not much. So, what I do is instead of just pulling straight up, I roll the 20 degrees angle of bank, and you can see that in the video, and then I pull straight back. The airplane goes up to about 70 degrees nose up instead of 90, and then over the top, instead of 180 degrees angle of bank, I’m at about 150 or so. It is a loop. It’s just a loop inclined a little bit because it gives me better escape maneuver capability for any kind of a failure. Lockheed Martin Tyler: Well, I think we need to call it the Wayne Loop. I think that’s just the answer right there! Wayne: That’s fine. That’s fine with me! At the end, I kind of scoop it out in a little bit of a corkscrew, but by that time you’re three-quarters of the way around the loop, everybody’s satisfied. Nobody cares what happens that last quarter of the run. Tyler: As far as those maneuvers in your routine, including the loop, are they something that we’ll see in future C-130 demos, whether it’s one by the Air Force or maybe even Fat Albert? Wayne: Well, I don’t know the answer to that question. Everybody that flies one of these airplanes has a boss and has an owner of the airplane, and those people that make those decisions will have to address that. I think in this particular case, I certainly had all the background to put the show together, although the show isn’t all that difficult to fly if you do it exactly like I did, but to have all these escape maneuvers and that sort of stuff, it’s going to take a bit for other people feel comfortable with that. The other piece of it, of course, we had the engineering analysis within Lockheed to make people comfortable with that, so another customer that has this type of desire to do it, I believe they’re going to have to go through the same steps. I’m not sure how hard it’ll be for them. But let’s face it, I say that to everybody, the airplane did it, it wasn’t just me, obviously. Somebody else could do it, and it’s not that hard a show to fly. It was a lot more effort to put it together and to make sure that I knew what I needed to do to keep it safe. Tyler: Right, a team effort there more so than just jumping in there and flying a demo. Wayne: Exactly. Lockheed Martin Tyler: What does the LM-100J bring to the table, and how do you think it will be received by the marketplace once it’s out there and flying commercially? Tony: I think it will be received very well. Based on some of the initial conversations we had with some existing users of the C-130 in the commercial marketplace, they love the airplane. It’s a very unique airplane that there’s really not anything else out there that can do what it does of its class and its size, and they’re anxious to obviously see the next generation come to fruition. Frankly, the older ones, they’re built so well, they’ve got a lot of longevity on them, so we’re working closely with them on transitioning them over to the new model as quickly as it makes sense. The old ones are still performing well for them, but I think they are ready for and anxious to see the latest version of the Herc. Tyler: How does the new C-130, the latest J model that’s coming off the line, differ from the C-130 that we grew up with? Like the H model and the E model. What are the major differences? Wayne: The design of a straight wing turboprop is very efficient across a wide range of airspeeds and altitudes, and that’s why it does so many missions so well. What’s changed is cost of ownership, in the sense that it’s a two-man crew instead of a four- or five-man crew, because there’s so much automation. The engines have more thrust. The takeoff distances are shorter. It can go faster and carry more. It’s all CNS-ATM compliant . The LM-100J has every update required to meet all aerospace requirements around the world now with data-link and RNAV LTV minimums approaches , and there may be some legacy C-130s that have gotten some upgrades to get some of that, but all of that’s in there. It’s much easier to plan missions. There’s so much automation in the airplane which the legacies [C-130s] did not have. The pilots are really there just to change the missions and routes, so even the civil guys can plan multiple legs, multiple short landing fields, airdrop is still a possibility—certainly has always been in the civil side as well as the military. Airdrop capability is probably second to none of any airplane in the world in terms of accuracy and capability of airdrop, and all that can be planned on the ground and executed much better than it was in the past. Basically, a two-man crew can perform more accurately and safer than a four- or five-man crew could in the legacy airplane. The J was completely a digital transformation entirely, so every aspect of the airplane in terms of operation and maintenance has been up-tuned. Tony: Yeah, I think from my perspective, what I promote to our customers is we stripped out a lot of the old mechanical parts, replaced it with an all-digital backbone, and that equates to almost doubling the reliability of this airplane. Powerplant, all-new powerplant obviously gives us 20% more fuel efficiency. All that translates to about a 30% savings in operation support costs using this aircraft compared to the legacy. So, combined with its performance enhancements, frankly, a lot of design drivers that went into the J were really driven by how do we save operational support cost. Wayne: Right, and I think that’s been demonstrated not with our data, but with actual customer data, that we validated 30% cost savings. LM-100J, the commercial variant of the C-130J. , Lockheed Martin Tyler: What does a C-130 look like in your in 2050? Where do you see the C-130 going in the future, and how is it going to adapt even more to accommodate new mission requirements and emerging threats in the coming decades? Tony: We talk about that a lot. I think obviously what’s going to drive that a lot is economics, and we’ve stayed tried and true with the J as we’ve developed it. We’ve upgraded certain systems. We’ve been very thoughtful about that. I think if you’re looking forward to C-130 in the future, I think it’s going to look very similar, with some technology upgrades to address either obsolescence or maybe some performance enhancements we still want to see on the propulsion side in order to get a little bit better range or fuel economies. Then maybe whatever the latest technologies are for the flight deck, whether it be display technologies or we may want to take some incremental looks at some of the control panels we have on the airplane and streamline some of that with some of the latest touch panel technologies. So, I don’t see it as transformational. I see it more as evolutionary, just to make sure that we continue to retain the proven nature of the platform, the reliability, and of course the cost-effectiveness. Wayne: I want to mention the firefighting mission for example, we do have a great platform that’s very efficient across all these speed ranges and altitude ranges, and for some reason, we can make guesses, the competition has been held at bay, that nobody’s decided to go directly at this and create an airplane that can do what this airplane can do. So, we’ve got this modern airplane that has a range of missions that it’s the best at, but I think we’re going to continue to make those missions more efficient. So I think there’s going to be a lot of work on the mission portion… As Tony said, a little evolutionary in a sense in terms of performance and some of those things. One of them is the firefighting mission, where I think there’s been a lot of data recently that says we need good firefighters in mountains, and this airplane’s great for that. But we need to be able to do it in more weather conditions, night and smoke and so forth. There’s so little time available where a current visual firefighter can operate, and most of the time, the fire’s burning and you can’t go do anything because of either smoke or darkness. I think our airplane, with a Heads Up Display, its primary flight display, and other technology that’s out there, might be able to make it an extremely more efficient firefighter, for example. Tony: I guess to my point, we’re not going to try to become something we’re not. We’re not going to overcomplicate the airplane. We’re going to do what we do well, and we’re always conscious of the cost, the price of the airplane, the support operational cost, to remain ultra-competitive. We know we have other folks that are pushing their products as well and saying they can do the same things we can, which to Wayne’s point earlier, our design really lends itself very well to tactical roles, and I think the other designs are always some level of compromises when it comes to that. So, we’re going to stay very focused on making sure we’re price competitive in the market, unless we get some other customers that really drive some unique developments on the airplane. And I frankly think, as you look outwards the 2030, 2040 timeframe, I think Air Mobility Command will certainly start to give us indications, even well before that, of what the next generation tactical airlifter will need to be. And then we’ll start putting our attention toward that design, which is likely to be different than what we’re looking at in a C-130. Lockheed Martin Tyler: We’re fascinated with the C-130’s historically uncanny ability to adapt to different mission sets and all the unique configurations that have been built or even just imagined. Is there a variant of the C-130 that never ended up being built that you like? Tony: I’ve got one, and it really intrigued me when I was back in college. I went through engineering school and picked up a report on a C-130, it was called HOW, Hercules On Water. They built a radio control model of a C-130 that had big floats and sponsons on it so that it could land and take off on water. They never built it, but they did build this radio control model and actually flew it, and I was just intrigued by that design. Author’s Note: I actually wrote a profile on this exact obscure Hercules variant a few years ago that was massively popular, you can read it here. Wayne: Very good, very good. Hey, Tyler, so I have one I actually worked on it for a while, that I was really intrigued with. There was a Navy admiral not that long ago, maybe about 10 years ago, that was convinced that sea basing was the best way to go for the next capability. What he meant by that was we may not be able to base our aircraft, our a supply base, near the battle, and that we ought to have a capability of basing a supply base on water, with a big ship, and ships apparently are fairly inexpensive to build, big ships in a sense, in the big scheme of things. We know how to build those big ships. The piece that was required was the air link that we’d get from this, almost a floating island perhaps, of military equipment to the shore. He was convinced that the Herc was the right airplane for that, because in the big scheme of development, ships were cheap, airplanes are very expensive to develop. So, if you had to develop an airplane for that mission, it would be hugely expensive. If you could use an existing airplane and develop the ship to match the airplane, you could do it more cheaply, and he was convinced that the C-130J, with its fairly modern capability, was the right airplane. So, I worked on that for a while, and I think we had some really good solutions to safety problems around the ship. We have this automatic thrust control system that’s already in the airplane [currently operational in the C-130J] you may already know about, that I worked on an awful lot, where the outboard engines being turboprops, digitally controlled through the mission computers, are actually part of the directional stability of the airplane. When one engine fails, the other one pulls back real quickly, because we didn’t make the rudder bigger. That system would help in that environment, as well as I looked at maybe some very capable, safe, solid fuel, JATO type of that kind of technology, to fire only if you need it at all… to make very safe landings. So, if you want to put a whole bunch of people on this plane and try to take it off the boat, then you have to be really safe. So, we worked on a number of those types of ideas, but it didn’t go very far. Tony: I got one more that I think was actually really cool. It was a boom tanker version of the C-130 that we actually did wind tunnel tests on. We put a refueling boom on the airplane, and we thought there’d be a market for it, with some customers that couldn’t get their hands on KC-135s or KC-10s or other boom tankers. We felt like we could have a boom variant on the C-130… We took it to the wind tunnel, we did one tunnel test, I have a model on my desk, probably have the only model of the C-130 with a boom on it, and it’s very interesting. We ended up not building it because the way the aft [rear] design of the airplane is it creates some turbulence back there that the boom would get a little bit finicky as it tried to drop from its stowed position down to fully extended. If we threw enough money at it, we would be able to make it work, but we didn’t think there was going to be enough of a market to justify that investment, so it never went anywhere, but that’s another cool one. I don’t think anybody’s seen that. Lockheed/Public Domain Tyler: What makes a good test pilot and what makes a good instructor test pilot? That seems like an extremely challenging job. Wayne: In my case, I guess it’s 41 years. I don’t know how else to put it. I’ve been learning … I still am just amazed. I think almost every day I’m at Lockheed I’m still learning things, that there’s just no end to what you can learn about even the same airplane. Okay, so let me break this down. I really think, first, knowledge about the airplane itself, and then because a lot of times a test pilot will just go out and execute standard tests that you learn at test pilot schools. First of all, professional test pilots get trained at a test pilot school, and you learn standard test techniques and that sort of stuff. On the military side, you’re being trained by these military test pilot schools, their job is to just go test the product and see what’s wrong with it and report it, and that’s about as far as the test pilot instruction goes. I’ve only spent about four or five years doing that in the Navy, and then I jumped ship after 12 years and joined Lockheed, and I’ve been a Lockheed test pilot for 29 years—a very different environment as a contractor or working for a company developing an airplane than as a customer just checking the product. What makes a good test pilot on the contractor side is really getting to know the airplane and how it’s put together and how you can make changes and working every single day as a team with the engineering group. The more you can understand, in order to fix an airplane, you got to understand how you can affordably fix it. One of the problems with just an evaluation is it throws these problems over the fence, and then nobody knows. It really helps for the test pilot to actually help come up with the solution. So, it’s really being able to get really close and work together as a team with the engineers and understand exactly how your airplane’s put together, where things are done in the airplane—whether it’s some software or hardware—and then help create the solutions… I think test pilots are uniquely positioned to know what he really wants, but he’s also, because of that, if you understand how the airplane’s put together, he’ll also be very influential in coming up with the best solution. So, that’s really what makes the best test pilot. Wayne gives the thumbs up post-flight to George Shultz, vice president of Air Mobility & Maritime Programs., Lockheed Martin Tyler: What’s your favorite aircraft you’ve flown and why? Wayne: Well, I have to say that the one that I contributed the most to, and therefore, kind of just a favorite is certainly the C-130J. I got on the program fairly early in the concept stage of this great digital, modern, overpowered C-130J and I got to go through all those steps that you would do… And all the flight paths and all the challenges that go with developing a new airplane… I have to say that it was the best part of my career. Your first airplane is always great. The P-3, I loved flying that all the time. It’s the best airplane for that mission. And I actually operationally flew that airplane in some very challenging areas—cold weather. I mean, I did three winter deployments, one in Iceland, one in Alaska, and one in Northern Japan. I flew in the worst weather conditions doing real missions. Chasing Russian submarines, all those things. I’ll tell ya, when I flew the C-5 I didn’t fly it till I was over 50 and it was a phenomenal airplane, very easy to fly and there’s some great things about flying that airplane. I’ve been very blessed to have this opportunity to work on great airplanes. KC-130Js., USMC Tyler: What is it like flying a giant C-5M at the edges of the envelope? I mean that seems very intimidating. The size of that aircraft, getting it out there to where it probably isn’t too happy to be in the air. Wayne: Yeah, we had a couple of challenges, in that sense. One of them was, you’re probably familiar with the classic T-tail deep stall problem T-tailed airplanes have. Lockheed did a real good job with designing the C-5 to be able to get out of those deep stalls. But when we put the new engines on the airplane, and just in general, the new M model on three engines has, I think, has equal to, or maybe slightly better, thrust in some scenarios, than the 4 engine A and B model C-5. That’s how much extra thrust went on the M model. That extra thrust is below the CG [center of gravity]—trying to not get too technical—the engines are under the wing, and typically when the engines are below the CG, when you add power the nose pitches up, that’s a stable thing, and you don’t want to add power and have the airplane pitch down. So, typically, the engines are low, but with all this extra thrust, it pitched up more in the stall, and so there wasn’t enough analysis to prove that in the very deep stalls that a C-5 could get into that with high power the tail was still big enough to get out of it [the stall]. So that was this big question out there. So even though the C-5 has passed all its deep stall testing in the early days, when you hung new engines there, that question came back up again, and it fell on me. I sort of volunteered to some extent, to go look at this problem, and we ended up developing some better alerting for the pilots to prevent them from getting into the really big stalls, but we still ended up having to take it pretty much, almost in the deepest stalls and we proved that the tail was still big enough to get out of it. It just takes a while, it won’t be close to the ground when you do it, but you do it, do a stall, and the wings stay very level, it’s a very well designed airplane from a deep stall point of view in terms of lateral directional. The wings, pretty much stay level, but you push the nose of the M (C-5M) full forward and you just start counting and very slowly, the nose comes down. So that was interesting, that was interesting. Then, typical engine scenarios on the runway have to be tested again, where you’re going on the runway max power and you fail it, the critical engine, and you go straight with the rudder and then if you can go straight at that speed just slow down and you’ll try it again and you’ll slow down, and you’ll try it again. And you’re looking for the speed at which you really can’t quite control it. You don’t want to overshoot that speed, ’cause you can get a lot of runway deviation and risk going off the runway. So that’s always an interesting task, which I’ve done on a lot of. It’s called VMC, Minimum Control Speed ground testing. I did it all on the ‘Herc and I got a chance to do it on the C-5 as well. You’re just looking for a speed, but you don’t wanna mess up the test, because it can be hazardous. C-5M during testing., USAF Tyler: You were a lead player in bringing the electronic surveillance variant of the S-3 Viking, the ES-3 Shadow, into existence. It seems like that capability would be highly valued today but it had a laughably short lifespan. What are your thoughts on that platform and on the status of the mothballed S-3 fleet overall? Wayne: That’s interesting, yeah you are absolutely right. We built quite a few of them and then the Navy didn’t actually use up all the life. Again, we made a pretty good airplane that had good life, and even in the Navy carrier environment, the S-3 life did not all get used up and many of them are in the boneyard with life left… We had a number of customers, even recently, that have been interested in those S-3s, but every year that goes by they’re older and they’re probably a little less viable to bring back into service. Maybe we missed that window, but yes it was a great airplane, and I think the Navy, when they got rid of it… I don’t know all that went into it, but there’s certainly a lot of people that questioned that decision at the time. ES-3 Shadow., US Navy Tyler: Is there a time in all of your test pilot or military flying career that stood out as just the wildest, scariest moment in the cockpit? Wayne: I wish that I could give you something that was really exciting, I actually think that I have been quite fortunate to not have anything particularly uncomfortable, which leads us to say that a lot of the work that goes on before the flight has been very well done by the company and by all the planners. We haven’t had anything, really, too surprising. I guess I’ll mention one, we pioneered the development of a system called Automatic Thrust Control. We wanted to put all this extra thrust on the C-130J because more thrust makes shorter takeoffs, and heavier gross weights, and a faster airplane. But we didn’t want to change the design of the airplane in terms of a bigger tail, because that’s a whole lot of money, and cost, and drag. So we invented this system where at the lighter weights where you need to have this lower, good field performance, you have to be able to handle an engine failure at lower speeds. When one engine fails, the mission computer on the airplane automatically commands the other computer controlled engine to come back very quickly, and then programs that power automatically to accelerate again. It’s a really good system, and we certified it with the FAA. We developed that whole system on the runway, and I did almost all that development work, and we developed it on the long airplane [C-130J-30]—we have two different length C-130s—and it worked really well, and we were happy. Then we decided to do it on the short [C-130 variant] until the analysis wasn’t all that good. We just didn’t have good engineering models from the ’50s when we had developed the airplane the first time and they’ve given me some numbers and they weren’t right and fuel-chopped the engine a bit lower than we should have… I think we got about, almost 100 feet of deviation [skidding laterally] on the runway before we got it back, so that was one time. And the other time, I was just working with other test pilots, the younger test pilots, customer test pilots, that had gotten me into some kind of hairy situations that I’m kind of fortunate to have been paying attention and get out of. Another one on the runway, [they] flipped the throttles the wrong way and I was able to pull the throttles back at the right time and keep on the runway. Another one at a very high side-slip a low altitude that I was able to get out of. Those are three things that come to mind. The C-130J may look like its predecessor, but its cockpit is from an entirely different era. , USAF Tyler: Our final and most important question of this entire interview—what does a guy who has been doing aerobatics in C-130s for decades do in retirement? Wayne: I’m a little scared because I don’t think it’s enough, necessarily. I’m gonna wait to see what comes about. I’ve missed out on a lot of things that I’d really like to do because I’ve been working so hard. I have a long list of things outside of flying. I think I may hang around some air shows now that I’m done with air show work, and see what I might be able to do. But I have no specific plans when it comes to flying, I’m gonna kind of see what comes along. I mean I got all kinds of thoughts about what to do. I’m gonna go get my seaplane rating, it’s the only thing I can think of I don’t have, is the seaplane rating. I’ve flown helicopters, and gliders, and fighters, but I don’t have a seaplane rating. So that’s one of the first things I’m gonna go do! Lockheed Martin I want to give a huge thanks to Wayne Roberts for taking the time to talk so in-depth with us, as well as to Tony Frese. We wish Wayne the very best with his new-found freedom in retirement. But above all else, I want to give a very special thanks to Stephanie Stinn, Communications Program Manager for C-130. Getting everyone together and executing something like this isn’t easy, but Stephanie made it seem like it was. These three love their product and it really shows.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 14, 2019",Taiwan Eyes Phalanx Point Defense Gun Systems To Defend Mountainside Air Bases,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amid the rising threat of potential Chinese attacks along its Pacific-facing coastline , Taiwan is reportedly looking to buy land-based rapid-firing guns to help defend the partially underground Jiashan and Taitung Air Bases on that side of the island. A land-based version of the American-made Phalanx appears to be the most likely candidate and these systems would act as point defenses against land-attack cruise missiles , anti-radiation missiles, and small drones . Taiwan’s Chinese-language outlet Up Media was first to report on the potential contract on Aug. 7, 2018. The story included a screenshot showing a formal request for quotes that was dated June 6 of “Minguo 107,” or 2018. The Taiwanese government uses the Minguo calendar , which started in 1912 with the founding of the Republic of China, for official documents. The request called for a fast-firing, but highly accurate gun-based weapon system that can automatically track and engage hostile targets. The system could be either fixed in place or mounted on some form of mobile platform. The land-based version Raytheon’s Mk 15 Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS), also known as Centurion , would seem to be the most obvious choice. This turreted weapon system is relatively self-contained, combining a 20mm 6-barrel Vulcan cannon with a rate of fire of 4,500 rounds per minute with an integrated fire control radar suite. One of the US Army’s trailer-mounted Centurion fires a test burst at a base in Afghanistan., US Army The system can engage targets autonomously or in a manual mode where an operator issues commands. More recent versions add infrared and electro-optical sensors to the system, increasing its ability to identify, track, and engage targets. These features have long made it a low-cost close-in defense option for a wide array of ships and also helped Raytheon to port the system over to a ground-based role. The U.S. military began deploying the Centurion version around 2004, primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan, to shoot down incoming rockets and mortar rounds. But there’s no reason why it shouldn’t still be able to perform many of the same functions it does at sea, where its main job is to blast incoming anti-ship cruise missiles. Raytheon says the latest Block 1B variant can also engage helicopters and small boats . The company has also used the Phalanx’s sensors to cue a solid-state laser close-in defense weapon to destroy unmanned aircraft, suggesting it could also engage those targets if they were to come into range of the gun. Centurion comes in trailer- and truck-mounted versions, too, which could give the Taiwanese military more flexibility to employ them as necessary and then redeploy to reinforce different areas as needed. Taitung Air Base with the underground facilities at the far right., Google Earth Taiwan could be even more inclined to pick a version of Phalanx given that it already has the systems in service on a number of destroyers, frigates , and missile boats . It’s a system the Taiwanese military is familiar with and that it already has pipelines in place to support logistically. It wouldn’t be the first time the country has installed a land-based Phalanx system, either. The Taiwanese Navy turned one over to the country’s Air Force after taking it off a decommissioned ship and it now guards the Leshan radar station in New Taipei City, according to Up Media . The outlet’s report noted that the Taiwanese Air Force had considered adding a similar rapid-fire gun system to its defenses across the country in the past, but decided against it given the nature of the threat, as well. The Leshan radar station in Taiwan., via fas.org For decades, a major concern for Taiwan had been finding ways to insulate itself against the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) ballistic missiles , which Phalanx or any similar system would have no chance at defeating. The Taiwanese Air Force built Jiashan and Taitung Air Bases on the eastern shores of the island with hangars and other facilities tucked away at least partially inside mountains specifically to make them difficult to hit with a barrage of conventionally armed ballistic missiles. Land-attack cruise missiles steadily became more of a threat, too, but their range made it hard for ground-based launchers across the Taiwan Strait to engage targets all the way on the other side of the island. Sea- and air-launch platforms were neither numerous or capable enough to truly challenge facilities such as Jiashan and Taitung or do so without risking coming within range of Taiwanese air and shore-based anti-ship defenses. A map showing Taiwan within the range of multiple short-range ballistic missiles and land- and sea-based surface-to-air missile systems., DOD In recent years, that has all begun to change dramatically as the People’s Republic of China has significantly expanded the size and scope of the stand-off arsenal it could employ during any conflict over Taiwan. Just in May 2018, the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) demonstrated its capabilities in this regard when it flew fighters and bombers in a route that effectively encircled Taiwan . In any potential conflict scenario, bombers could use land-attack cruise missiles to try to temporarily disable runways or destroy other important targets across the island. Multi-role combat jets would employ anti-radiation missiles against air defense and early warning radars to blind and neuter Taiwanese defenses. China's land attack cruise missile in action: https://t.co/yFBMOwvELL — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) August 3, 2018 The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is also substantially growing its surface and sub-surface forces, adding advanced types with land-attack cruise missile capabilities. Those ships would be able to position themselves on the eastern side of the island, as well. This is to say nothing of the growing threat of Chinese unmanned aircraft and drone swarms . Spying remains a major concern in Taiwan and individuals could use small quad-copter-type drones to snoop on sensitive facilities, such as Jiashan and Taitung, or worse . During an actual conflict, they might perform intelligence or surveillance missions, locate targets for stand-off strikes, or employ their own small munitions, electronic warfare jammers , or systems able to launch cyber attacks to confuse and overwhelm the island’s defenses or just harass Taiwanese forces . People’s Liberation Army Navy ships and submarines, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning , sail through the Taiwan Strait during a major exercise in April 2018., Li Gang/Xinhua via AP The stark reality is that bases such as Jiashan and Taitung would be just as vulnerable to Chinese strikes in any future potential conflict and there is a clear need then to update their defenses. Phalanx would offer a relatively simple way to increase protection against cruise missiles and drones at those sites in the near term and could be a valuable part of a layered defense arrangement in the long run. It’s a model that the Taiwanese military could easily apply to other sites along the country’s eastern shore or elsewhere, too. Any Phalanxes Taiwan buys might serve as the basis for new weapon systems in the future, as well. Raytheon’s SeaRAM uses much of the same physical and systems architecture but features a cluster of 11 RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles instead of the Vulcan cannon. The Taiwanese government has been funding development of a similar domestically-designed system as a replacement for Phalanx, called Sea Oryx . It’s possible that Raytheon could substitute a solid-state laser for the gun, or otherwise add that capability on in the future, too. Networking the guns with each other and additional sensor nodes could also improve their precision and response times. In addition, Phalanx is a weapon that Taiwanese authorities have been able to purchase from the United States in the past, which is no small consideration given the political complexities surrounding Taiwan’s self-rule distinct from the government of the People’s Republic of China and its relations with foreign governments. Authorities in Beijing do not respect the island’s ability to conduct its own foreign affairs and object to arms sales to its military on principle. There are other similar systems available, such as the Mantis system from Germany’s Rheinmetall, which combined turreted 35mm cannons with a separate fire control radar. But the officials in Berlin and elsewhere might not be inclined to incite China’s ire. An artist’s conception of the Rheinmetall’s Mantis counter-rocket, artillery, and mortar system., Rheinmetall The United States under President Donald Trump, who has been highly critical of China at times and has now launched a trade war against that country over what he describes as unfair business practices, has had no qualms about approving sales of weapon systems and other military equipment to Taiwan. Whatever system they end up choosing, and however long it might take to finalize the deal, the Taiwanese Air Force needs an additional last line of defense at Jiashan and Taitung, and potentially other locations, now. Taiwan has already passed on a plan to buy land-based Phalanxes once, when ballistic missiles looked to be the bigger concern, but it can’t afford to do it again.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 2, 2018",Harrowing Account Of How USAF C-130 Crews Snuck Into South Sudan To Evacuate Diplomats Under Fire,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In July 2016, three U.S. Air Force C-130J Hercules cargo planes raced south from Camp Lemonnier in the East African country of Djibouti to help members of the U.S. Embassy in South Sudan evacuate the country. Now, documents we’ve obtained describe a dangerous mission where crews dodged potentially hostile air defenses without appropriate countermeasures, battled aircraft trouble before and during the mission, and rescued two people with life-threatening conditions and dozens more after taking off under hostile fire. These new details stand in contrast to the muted information that was available at the time and offers a window into the complexities and risks inherent to these types of operations. President Barack Obama himself directed the U.S. military to provide support to the American embassy in the South Sudanese capital Juba amid a worrying spike in violence in the country that had led to dozens of deaths, including a Chinese peacekeeper . The trio of C-130J aircraft assigned to the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron – using the call signs Lion 592, 593, and 594 – subsequently brought in more than 30 special operators, including U.S. Army Special Forces , U.S. Navy SEALs , and at least one Air Force Special Operations Command Joint Terminal Air Controller , along with their equipment. This personnel provided command and control on the ground, local security, and escorted almost 30 American citizens to safety in neighboring Uganda. “The details of the overall mission and situation in South Sudan at the time were very limited,” U.S. Air Force Major Stumpf, who was head of the 75th at the time, said in an interview in 2017 . ”We basically had 12 hours to wrap our head around what was going on before we launched the next morning.” The country was, and remains, in the throes of a brutal civil war that erupted in 2013. Since then, thousands of civilians have died in the fighting and millions more have fled their homes or the country entirely. A low-quality image from during the 2016 rescue mission showing commercial pickup trucks that special operators commonly use on discreet missions in Africa and elsewhere., USAF The aircraft and crews who flew the July 2016 mission actually came from the 39th Airlift Squadron , which is based at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, which provided the manpower to the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron in Djibouti at the time. The 16 officers and airmen subsequently received the 2017 General James H. Doolittle Trophy, which Air Mobility Command awards each year to an individual or individuals within the command who demonstrate “extremely meritorious service, professionalism, courage and leadership.” We at The War Zone recently obtained the complete award citation and supporting information via the Freedom of Information Act. The nomination packet makes it clear that the eight-hour flight from Camp Lemmonier to Juba International Airport was anything but a cakewalk. It was also the first time the U.S. military had ever initiated this type of mission as part of Operation New Normal, a broad crisis response plan that came into being after the infamous attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya in 2012. Five of the 16 members of the 39th Airlift Squadron who took part in the 2016 rescue mission into South Sudan., USAF As Stumpf and other American commanders put together the actual plan, maintenance personnel hustled to get the C-130s ready to go. Ground crews identified and then fixed a dozen mission-critical “red ball” problems before the planes actually set out on the mission. At least three of these were directly related to the engines on one or more of the planes, according to the award documents. The special operators were the ones to actually wake up the aircrews, just seven hours before the mission launched. Together, they “worked out last-min[ute] load plan in bedroom,” the nomination information noted. The video below shows special operators in pickup trucks and motorcycles training with the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron in 2017. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qn8C1syN7YU Problems with the aircraft persisted in flight. Having agreed to fly aircraft with “degraded electric sys[tems],” the crews had to fly around certain weather patterns rather than through them, the award packet explained. Personnel onboard Lion 592 also had to rewire the plane’s satellite communications system in the air – reportedly the first time any U.S. Air Force C-130 crew had ever attempted to do this – to get all three aircraft on the same secure channel. But even if the Hercules had not had any issues, the mission would have been risky. At that time, the U.S. government considered Juba to be an active war zone and worried the airport might be under rebel control. On July 11, 2016, government and insurgent forces had fought each other close by using tanks and other heavy weapons. There were also concerns about whether South Sudanese president Salva Kiir was exercising complete control over his own forces, including those in charge of various anti-aircraft weapons. Between 2015 and 2016, the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army, the formal title of the country’s military, acquired Russian-made S-125 radar-guided surface-to-air missiles and Chinese QW-2 man-portable shoulder-fired infrared-guided types. These weapons posed a very real danger to the low-and-slow flying C-130s. The crews did not have access to chaffs for their countermeasures dispensers at the time. Their planes also lacked directional infrared countermeasures systems, or DIRCM , that have been increasingly common on Hercules operating in high-risk areas to defeat smaller, shorter-range infrared-guided missiles. Even heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades could have posed a serious threat, especially as the aircraft came in to land in Juba. The Air Force was well aware of this danger from a previous non-combatant evacuation operation into South Sudan in 2013. A C-130J-30 at an undisclosed location in Syria in 2018. A turret that is part of the aircraft’s directional infrared countermeasures system is visible on the rear fuselage behind the national insignia., USAF During that mission , three Air Force CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors had to abort an attempt to rescue American citizens trapped in the South Sudanese city of Bor after coming under fire from small arms and rockets from either government troops or rebel forces. All of the aircraft suffered serious damage and some of the U.S. Navy SEALs on board nearly died as bullets and shrapnel pierced the sides of the fuselage. With these concerns in mind, the C-130s followed a circuitous route so they could try to avoid 13 known anti-aircraft sites. The planes also zipped into South Sudan at extremely low-level under radio silence to give any potential hostile forces the least amount of time to react. Once on the ground, special operators seized control of the control tower at the airport within three minutes. Other personnel had started unloading vehicles within 20 seconds and were soon moving toward the embassy. When a Joint Tactical Air Controller assigned to the response team lost contact with friendly forces, the crew of Lion 594 took over those duties, using their onboard communications systems to direct unspecified intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft into position to monitor the convoy’s progress. These might have been small manned types the U.S. military had and still has in Uganda, but if that was the case, those aircraft could have been similarly at risk from South Sudanese missiles. The individuals from the 75th also coordinated with a total of six F/A-18 Hornets from an unknown unit – possibly part of the U.S. Marine Corps’ own Africa-focused crisis response task force – that flew overhead during the mission. These aircraft were fully loaded and on station to provide close air support for the evacuation convoy or the personnel coordinating the operation from the airport if necessary. A US Marine Corps F/A-18C Hornet on a mission over Iraq in 2018., USAF “When they [the evacuees] came to the plane, you could clearly see they were distressed and tired,” U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant James Hurst, a 39th Airlift Squadron loadmaster who took part the mission, said after he and the others received the Doolittle Trophy in 2017 . “As they got closer, they became more relieved. Once they put their bags on the ground and sat down, they were feeling a lot more at ease.” What the U.S. military didn’t say in 2016, or after the C-130 crews go their awards the following year, was that two of the individuals had life-threatening illnesses or injuries. The nomination documents describe the subsequent flight to Uganda as, at least in part, a medical evacuation mission that saved their lives. Unknown forces on the ground also fired on the aircraft with small arms as they took off, requiring the pilots to take evasive action. We don’t know if any of the planes took any damage. There are no reports of any injuries during the mission itself and all 29 evacuees eventually returned safely to the United States. After returning to Djibouti, the rescue force also coordinated with U.S. Marine Corps personnel, who initiated a broader crisis response mission, nicknamed Operation Oaken Steel , on July 12, 2016. That operation wrapped up in January 2017. Marines load American nationals onto a KC-130J Hercules in Juba, South Sudan, during another evacuation mission in 2014., USMC Though daring and successful, the July 2016 rescue mission underscores just how complicated these types of short-notice operations are even in situations where the United States is not at war with the country in question. Since 2016, we have seen numerous additional examples of how difficult casualty evacuation and other personnel recovery missions can be, especially in Africa as a whole, where small units of U.S. military personnel are positioned in various remote and austere locations detached from traditional support architecture. The high-profile incident in Niger in October 2017, which led to the death of four members of the U.S. Army, made these issues a topic of national discussion . However, as this new information shows, it was hardly the first time the U.S. military has struggled with these challenges. Just on Aug. 8, 2018, the Department of Defense’s Inspector General announced it would be looking into whether the Marine Corps’ crisis response task force for Africa is actually capable of performing that mission adequately. At an event that the National Defense Industry Association hosted in March 2018 , Peter Tiel, the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) Science Advisor explained that increasing personnel capability on the continent was the command’s top priority for the next five years. In his briefing, Tiel also disclosed that only one in three requests for casualty evacuation or personnel recovery capability within AFRICOM gets sourced. Contracts, worth nearly $50 million annually, to have private companies provide additional support in Niger and Somalia “narrows the gap,” but clearly leaves significant room for improvement. The U.S. military has been experiencing similar shortfalls outside of Africa, including in Yemen and elsewhere . A slide from US Africa Command Science Advisor Peter Tiel’s March 2018 briefing discussing casualty evacuation and personnel recovery issues., AFRICOM The U.S. military’s experience in 2016 in South Sudan also continues to point out how difficult personnel recovery missions are in combat situations and non-combatant evacuation operations in general. And if this is how things look when the U.S. military had to rush to a rescue in a country such as South Sudan, where the threats were comparatively limited, just imagine how things might look during a conflict in or near a country with far more robust capabilities. There have been concerns, for instance, about how quickly the United States could realistically get government personnel and other U.S. citizens out of South Korea during a major crisis with the North. The U.S. military will increasingly be forced to find ways to mitigate the danger from advanced air defense and other threats, not just to protect American military personnel during combat operations, but also when considering how to evacuate civilians swept up in violent crises. In the meantime, the United States will have to rely heavily on the leadership, courage, creativity, and professionalism of its existing forces to conduct these dangerous missions.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The C-5 is a flying warehouse of an aircraft, but with all its lifting capacity comes high complexity and the type is certainly known for its fair share of chronic issues. On a week when the last upgraded C-5M was announced delivered, a video showing a Galaxy making an incredibly well-flown nose gear up landing at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas has come to light. Here’s a direct link to the Facebook video in case it doesn’t show up automatically below on your mobile device: It’s not clear if the video, which was first posted on John Q. Public’s Facebook page, was shot recently or on March 15th, 2018 when a known nose gear up landing by as C-5 occurred at the base, but the latter is probably the case. Nobody was hurt in that incident and the aircraft was deemed repairable, but it marked another in a very long line of issues with Galaxy’s troublesome landing gear which has included many emergency landings . In the Summer of 2017, two C-5s from Dover Air Force Base had similar issues in Rota, Spain which resulted in the grounding of the USAF’s truncated force of just 56 C-5s. During the grounding, it was discovered that the ball-screw assembly was malfunctioning and causing issues with the nose gear’s extension and retraction process. The entire fleet received new ball-screw assemblies but it seems that didn’t necessarily cure the C-5’s nose gear woes. Celebrating the final #C5M delivery! We’ve loved working on the Super Galaxy for the past 50 years and look forward to supporting it for years to come. https://t.co/9v88nyDGfq pic.twitter.com/e8wzD6m4j9 — Lockheed Martin (@LockheedMartin) August 2, 2018 But that’s not too surprising. The C-5’s long history of landing gear issues includes the aircraft’s issues to rise again after its nose gear ‘kneels’ to accept cargo through the jet’s giant tilting nosecone door. I have had more than one C-5 crewmen tell me that the chances of the jet’s nose gear lifting as advertised basically a coin toss. This is in addition to the myriad of other issues that impact the aircraft’s reliability, many of which were supposed to be solved by the C-5M upgrade, although large increases in availability have not materialized as expected. Regardless of the details surrounding this nose gear up landing, the crew did an amazing job of keeping the nose off the ground as long as possible and thus keeping the jet, the surrounding infrastructure and their own souls intact. You can read all about what it is like to pilot the C-5 in this past feature of mine.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 9, 2018",Chinese President Xi Jinping Brought A New Armored Limousine With Him To Africa,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As China continues to deepen ties with countries across sub-Saharan Africa , Chinese President Xi Jinping himself recently concluded a whirlwind tour of the continent on July 30, 2018. China’s premier, who has also been consolidating power at home and is in the throes of an expanding trade war with the United States, also used the trip as an opportunity to show off a new, Chinese-made presidential limousine known as the Hongqi N501. The four-door sedan is more than 18 feet long and has an overall shape with a large front grill that is clearly meant to evoke very high-end, full-size luxury cars such as Rolls-Royces, Bentleys, and Mercedes, the latter of which has been especially popular with world leaders in the past, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . It reportedly has a 402-horsepower turbocharged V8 engine coupled with an automatic transmission and can travel more than 500 miles on a single tank of gas. Beyond that, there are few publicly available details about the car or its features. When information about the N501 first began to emerge in 2016 , the suggestion was that it might be a new addition to Hongqi’s commercial product line. As of May 2018, however, Hongqi had still not officially launched the N501 and it was nowhere to be found in the company’s catalogs. Car watchers in China , however, spotted one of them on the road carrying military plates, which suggested it was a model specifically for the country’s government. Xi’s use of the type in Africa would all but confirm this observation. Pictures show, unsurprisingly, that the Chinese president’s N501 has heavy armored windows and doors. It would have to have various additional security and other features, including secure communications equipment to help the premier keep connected while on the move, as is the case with the cars other major world leaders use to get around . We don’t know whether Hongqi is making any version of the N501, with or without the armor or other extras, available commercially or if the type is specifically for China’s president. There is also a possibility that it uses a foreign designed chassis or a platform derived from one. Hongqi is just one brand under the umbrella of the state-owned FAW Group . This automotive conglomerate builds foreign designs for the Chinese market in cooperation with companies such as Audi and Toyota. Initial reports indicated that the N501 would use a Toyota or Toyota-derived engine, but the size and shape led observers to wonder if the vehicle was using an Audi A6L chassis . Whether either party would consent to Hongqi putting their products together in this fashion, or if that would matter, is unclear. But whatever the car looks like under the hood and inside, Hongqi’s red flag hood ornament is especially prominent and gives it a distinctly Chinese look. Since its founding in 1958, the company has been closely associated with China’s premiers, including Mao Tse Tung, and other senior Communist party leadership. A 1959 Hongqi CA72, the company’s first ever design, which it based in large part on contemporary American designs from Chrysler., Navigator84 via Wikimedia Hongqi limousines and cars have remained important symbols for China’s increasingly powerful premier , but not when traveling abroad. Even as recently as 2017 , Xi has ridden in European makes during state visits to foreign countries. Putting Xi in the N501 during his trip to Africa reflects Hongqi’s ambitions to return to its former glory and to become a more accessible brand in China, which it could use as a springboard to expand sales overseas . In January 2018, FAW Group announced a new strategic plan for Hongqi, its second for the brand in just six years . The video below shows Xi Jinping riding in a Citroen during a visit to France in 2014. The company is now claiming it will release 17 new designs by 2025, which will include cars and trucks in a variety of price ranges and size categories, including at least two sport utility vehicles . The L4, the commercial version of the N501, is supposed to be available by 2020. The firm is also planning to release electrically powered designs and luxury types with self-driving features. It’s a major shift from its stated plan in 2012 to reinvigorate its high-end offerings to recapture government contracts and give wealthy Chinese politicians and businessmen an alternative to foreign made designs. This decision itself had come after Hongqi had stopped making its iconic limousines and related luxury types in 1981 , as the country opened to the West, deciding instead to focus on the production of designs based on European cars, such as the Audi 100 , that had a more mass market appeal. A 2005 Hongqi CA7180A2E, derived from the Audi 100., Navigator84 via Wikimedia In 2013, Hongqi unveiled the L5 limo , which quickly became the car of choice for China’s then-new president Xi and his government. The car evoked many of the same stylistic choices of the earlier Hongqi models and had a decided older appearance compared to other more modern luxury cars. It was also extremely expensive, with pre-orders for commercial variants reportedly starting at more than $800,000 in 2014. “The Hongqi L5 is too pricey for official use and I also don’t think it will have big market potential in the consumer market,” Zeng Zhiling, the general manager of LMC Automotive Consulting in Shanghai, told Global Times – a newspaper the Chinese Communist Party operates – at the time. A Hongqi L5., emperornie via Wikimedia The H7 sedan was supposed to further help the brand break out into the broader domestic Chinese market and capitalize on the country’s middle class . With a price of around $80,000, it was significantly cheaper, but failed to see significant sales, either. Whether or not FAW Group’s latest push to revitalize Hongqi will turn out to be successful remains to be seen. A steadily escalating trade spat between China and the United States might make it harder for the brand to offer cars at competitive prices or ramp up production to help lower costs. At the same time, Chinese tariffs on various foreign imports could have second-order effects that make domestic car options much more attractive. The Hongqi H7 sedan, intended for a much broader commercial market, and even featuring a much subdued red flag hood ornament., Navigator84 via Wikimedia There’s always the possibility that emerging markets in Africa or elsewhere could also help Hongqi meet its target of selling 100,000 vehicles by 2020, 200,000 by 2025, and a whopping 500,000 by 2035. Xi’s trip, where he acted as something of a rolling advertisement for the brand, couldn’t have hurt. What we do know is that the Hongqi N501 is, at least, still the car of choice for China’s most powerful individuals after sixty years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 17, 2018","No, Assassination By Drone Isn’t A New Concept, I Have Been Warning Of It For Years","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With the recent unsuccessful assassination attempt on Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, the age of targeted attacks by small, commercially available aerial drones on VVIPs has officially arrived. While major media outlets are pushing big headlines detailing this ‘new’ threat and foreshadowing how it will only grow, with the U.S. federal government now stating the same, the fact is this was a totally foreseeable eventuality that a few of my colleagues and I have been harping on for years . All the while the U.S. government did next to nothing to confront it. In fact, it took weaponized hobby drones to show up on battlefield en-masse for any real counter-drone initiatives to begin in earnest. And what’s to come in regards to this technology, both at home and on the battlefield, represents a far darker reality than pretty much anyone in an official capacity is letting on. This glaring lapse, one of the most puzzling I have ever witnessed from the Pentagon, its domestic law enforcement counterparts, and from Congress to a lesser degree, should act as a reminder of the aversion these institutions seem to have towards dealing with low-end threats which often have non-glamorous solutions. We build multi-billion dollar, experimental, boondoggle blimps to maybe be able to spot cruise missiles heading towards Washington D.C. in a World War III scenario, but robustly countering over-the-counter remote-controlled drones that can carry pounds of explosives is blown off as a low-priority. Then again, maybe this should have come as no surprise. No big defense contractor was going to get rich pushing anti-drone systems and no general was going to get another star on their lapel pleading for funding to repel potential hobby-drone attacks, so the whole issue became a low-funded experimental game of paddy cake that nobody really cared much about. Be outraged, they all deserve it. What went down in Maduro town The assassination attempt occurred on Aug. 4, 2018, while the Venezuelan president was speaking at an event honoring the 81st anniversary of the country’s National Guard. Bodyguards carrying ballistic blankets did quickly move in to shield Maduro before hurrying him off stage and there appears to have been a panicked stampede among those in attendance. Seven National Guardsmen were reportedly injured in the chaos . “This was an attempt to kill me,” Maduro, who most recently won re-election in May 2018 in a poll that international observers categorized as neither free nor fair, said after escaping unscathed . “Today they attempted to assassinate me.” For years now , the country has been in the grips of a major economic crisis, which has led to widespread shortages in critical items such as food and medicine, and which many say is the result of corruption and mismanagement on the part of Maduro’s administration. He has countered by saying that he is beset by reactionary elements inside the country who receive support from his opponents aboard, including Colombia and the United States . However, a militant dissident group, Soldiers in T-shirts, subsequently claimed responsibility for what they said had been a deliberate attack. This organization claims to be made up of soldiers who have deserted and taken up arms against Maduro, which has happened in the past at least one some level. In June 2017, a renegade national police pilot and aspiring film star, Oscar Perez, very publicly stole a helicopter and attacked the country’s Interior Ministry and Supreme Court with small arms fire and grenades, which did not cause any substantial damage . Venezuela security forces killed Perez in a shootout in January 2018 . On Aug. 5, 2018, Venezuelan authorities said that they had arrested six individuals in connection with the incident, but did not identify them or whether they were members of Soldiers in T-shirts. Nestor Reverol, the country’s Interior Minister, also said there had been two DJI M600 drones , each carrying a little more than two pounds of C-4 plastic explosive , used in the attack. M600 drone., DJI He added that one was supposed to have exploded above Maduro, while the other was to have flown in front of him before detonating, but did not say where this information had come from. Venezuelan security forces reportedly used some form of jamming system to throw one of the drones off target and the other hit a building some blocks away instead. “I am fine, I am alive, and after this attack, I’m more determined than ever to follow the path of the revolution,” Maduro declared after the attack . “Justice! Maximum punishment! And there will be no forgiveness.” Maduro has specifically blamed individuals in Colombia and the United States for supporting the assassination attempt, but has provided no evidence to support this claim. Colombian and U.S. government officials have denied any direct involvement . “If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we’ll take a serious look at it,” U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton told Fox News on Aug. 5, 2018. “In the meantime, I think what we really should focus on is the corruption and oppression in the Maduro regime in Venezuela.” Bolton also posited that Maduro might have staged the entire incident to bolster support for his government, but offered no evidence to support that assertion. There is now a concern that the Venezuelan President could use the incident as an excuse to further crack down on political dissent or otherwise consolidate national authority under his office. There were similar fears after President Donald Trump has publicly suggested he might take military action against Venezuela’s government and reportedly queried aides and friendly Latin American governments about the feasibility and support for such a plan . Other U.S. politicians have harshly criticized the government in Caracas, as well, with Florida Senator Marco Rubio at one point taking to Twitter to implicitly call for a coup . The Venezuelan president quickly received words of support from countries such as Russia , Syria , Turkey, and Nicaragua , who the United States has also criticized in the past . Bolivian President Evo Morales called the attack a “crime against humanity.” Now it is reported that the mastermind of the plot and the pilots of the drones, among other related individuals, were among those apprehended in the days following the attack, with CNN writing : The investigation, which involves four prosecutors, has yielded the locations from where the drones were piloted, as well as the arrests of two of the drone pilots, the country’s top law enforcement official said. “We also know the places where they stayed in the days leading to the attack. We have identified the people who made the explosives and prepared the weapons and their international links,” Saab said. He further said the alleged assassination constituted a “betrayal to the motherland, intentional homicide attempt, terrorism, association to commit a crime and financing terrorism.” …. Maduro appeared on national TV hours later to speak about the investigation and arrests. He said the Venezuelan political far right, in collaboration with the Colombian far right and President Santos, were behind the attack. He also blamed Venezuelans living in the United States.”The preliminary investigation indicates that many of those responsible for the attack, the financiers and planners, live in the United States in the state of Florida,” Maduro said, adding that he hopes the White House is “willing to fight terrorist groups that commit attacks in peaceful countries. Regardless of who plotted to take out Maduro, the fact that drones were used as the weapon of choice is terrifying, but for some of us, it is wholly unsurprising. Years of little action The attempted assassination of Maduro by commercially available drones toting explosives and the imagery that went along with it startled many who got their first real look at the concept outside of dispatches from war zones—namely from the assault of Mosul when commercially available and even homemade drones morphed into weapons on a grand scale . The footage of the Maduro attack also let us see some of the tactics available to those tasked with protecting heads of state and other VVIPs from drone attacks— ballistic blankets , umbrellas, bodyguard flesh, and possibly electronic warfare technology. Although the jammers may have saved Maduro’s life if indeed they were present and active at the time of the attack, the idea that ballistic blankets and bodyguards are all that stood between those drones and their target is not comforting. And clearly, the attack made a serious impact on the security operations of other heads of state. The next day, Turkey’s increasingly tyrannical Recep Erdogan was seen being guarded by FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles . The type is now more capable of engaging small drones thanks to a recent upgrade . But once again, none of this should be surprising and it’s hardly ripped from some script of a new, cutting-edge futuristic technothriller as many state. In 2013, I wrote the following : …This technology does represent a double-edged sword though. In fact, almost all micro-drone technology that is proliferating throughout the commercial, and even civilian world, has a dark side. These small man-portable drones can be turned from surveillance assets to assassination tools by swapping out their payloads. … As this technology continues to develop you will see new emphasis put on securing the airspace around VIPs and very delicate but important infrastructure on a level greater than anything we have seen before. Whereas the threat from direct fire has been paramount when it comes to personal security, the focus will begin to morph more and more into protection against nontraditional indirect fire, aka small drones with evil payloads. In 2014, I wrote a story all about how the threat landscape is changing and VVIPs are going to be targeted using this increasingly available technology. I wrote in part : These diminutive man-portable drones can be turned from surveillance assets and backyard toys to assassination tools by swapping out their payloads. Even the quad-rotor type hobbyist/commercial drones, like those controversially pimped to millions on 60 Minutes by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently, can carry around half a dozen pounds. Swap out that pair of earphones or cookbook you ordered online, or a DSLR camera when it comes to rudimentary commercial photography drones, with an improvised explosive device and you have a guided missile capable of some very horrific things… … It is just another piece of twine in the exciting but also unsettling new world of unmanned weaponry. One where the word “drone” will increasingly be associated with both friend and foe. And again in 2015 , after a gyrocopter touched down in front of the Capitol unannounced: Although taking down hobby drones and ultralight aircraft is not a glamorous mission, the threat posed by them is becoming more relevant than the hijacked airliner threat reminiscent of 9/11. The Navy has already deployed its first laser close-in weapons system and there are a series of other ground-based systems that are already capable of taking down small aircraft at relatively close ranges. Still, it is clear that the accessibility to low-end unmanned technology is rapidly outpacing the development of countermeasures designed to defeat that technology when it is used as an improvised weapon system. … Sadly, it may take many more wake-up calls till the powers that be realize that lumbering hijacked airliners and cruise missiles are not the only major aerial threats to America’s most sensitive locales and individuals anymore. In the years between these and other earlier writings and today, the risk posed by hobby drones and the adaptation of small and inexpensive unmanned aircraft into weapons is somewhat of an everyday topic around here, and there certainly weren’t a lack of major warning signs for the U.S. government to act on. Even a U.S. police department used a robot to kill a suspected mass murderer in 2016, setting a whole new precedented for domestic law enforcement organizations. But even though by this time nobody needed a crystal ball to predict what was to come, it was the Battle of Mosul that finally made the Pentagon and other government agencies begin to come to terms with what had become so glaringly obvious. This piece I wrote in January of 2017, as the campaign to take back Mosul was underway, highlighted these same issues and how easy ISIS was able to quickly evolve the concept even on a battlefield that was largely cut-off from external logistics: One of the major tactical developments during the war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq has been the deployment of hobbyist and even homemade remote-controlled aircraft—often referred to as “drones”—armed with small explosive charges. During the Battle of Mosul especially , Iraqi forces have experienced a threat from aerial bombardment by low-end drones on a level never seen before in combat. Meanwhile, U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have also scrambled to adapt to and counter this growing capability. Yet the hard truth is that the Department of Defense has had plenty of time and warning to do just that. In fact, they spent many millions of dollars looking at the problem , but no hard action was really taken to develop countermeasures, which makes their scramble for countermeasures now all that more frustrating. The weaponizing of these increasingly prevalent and cheap hobbyist drones has been warned about for years by many of us outside the Pentagon’s five walls, and likely by some on the inside as well. Meanwhile, the DoD seemed focused on countering the problem with very high-end systems, such as emerging solid-state laser capabilities , which are more suited for the protection of extremely high-value targets than for providing a shield for soldiers on the battlefield. Some counter-rocket and mortar (C-RAM) systems, which use kinetic means to kill, with cannon shells or missiles, have also been adapted for this use to a limited degree, but these are also geared to defending fixed positions and can be horrifically expensive to use. … Clearly, this is going to become a much more complicated business than anyone would like to imagine, especially as these “over-the-counter” drone systems become smaller and more autonomous . Even here at home, as time passes, murder by drone is likely to become a very real thing. The police have already killed a suspect using a robotic system, and criminals may find that the drone is a far better tool for taking out one’s enemies from afar than a gun’s bullet, especially considering that said bullet cannot turn corners. As our lives become more encompassed by these buzzing craft, distinguishing friend from foe will be all but impossible. Washington D.C . and its surroundings are already drone-free zones , as are other sensitive areas . Expect many others to follow especially if the technology cannot be regulated to the point where it can’t be so easily abused. This is a problem pro-drone industries should confront head-on as the future of the technology and its applications likely depends on it. The thing is that we have rapidly moved from small but deadly and expensive suicide drones capable of inflicting lethal force, to even simpler and cheaper ones that drop expendable munitions and can be quickly reused again. What’s most concerning is that the majority of the innovation in this field has been achieved by the enemy in a war zone. This is both an amazing achievement and a horrific one that is a harbinger of things to come. Meanwhile, it seems as if the exploding low-end drone industry and the US government—including the Pentagon—are in denial of just what this all means for the future of warfare and quite frankly, humanity. After the improvised attack drone showed up in force in Mosul, the U.S. military frantically accelerated its search for counter-drone solutions. Its efforts went from what seemed like an exploratory good time and generally a slow-roll to an all-out scramble. Today there are a number of technologies that show promise, and some are already in the field. These include multiple types of jammers , directed-energy weapons— lasers and high-power microwave emitters —and even tiny hit to kill interceptors . Old fashion anti-aircraft gun systems and shoulder-fired man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) also remain a staple fallback solution of varying effectiveness depending on the system. There are also more lowly solutions that are questionable at best, such as net ammunition for shotguns . The Pentagon has now also looked towards unconventional ways to get industry involved in small drone tactical issues via competitions and live demonstration events. But while all this is now going on, the threat is rapidly proliferating and adapting, with non-state actors and peer competitors alike acquiring new and very concerning abilities. Sending waves of rudimentary drones to saturate well-defended and fixed high-value target areas is an established tactic now on the battlefields of the Middle East, with multiple incidents occurring in both Syria and Yemen . But the ability to use low-cost drones to act cooperatively as a swarm is on the horizon for individuals and is already becoming a reality for countries like China . The U.S. is exploring this capability as well, although we can only hope they are doing much more in the classified realm than what we have seen in the unclassified world. The coming swarm While defending against a couple weaponized small drones may be currently possible under certain circumstances and if early detection occurs—as potentially seen during the Maduro incident—doing so against a swarm of dozens or even hundreds of explosive carrying drones buzzing through the air is a whole other story. Jamming and high-power microwave beams may prove effective in some cases, but as I have posited for years, really the best way to counter a swarm is with one of your own. I go into detail about it in this article on America’s larger short-range air defense gap which has since become a hot topic issue in defense circles and it’s a problem the DoD is now scrambling to find solutions to as well: Being networked together, and being autonomous in nature after being loaded with a target area location, along with other mission parameters, these swarms will be extremely hard to defend against using even the best SHORAD systems in development today. It’s the saturation nature of the attack, the size of the attackers, and the fact that they work as a coordinated swarm, employing dynamic tactics to see as many in their company survive long enough to make their suicidal attack, that make them so deadly. They could even drop micro-munitions and be reused for a later attack. Just the knowledge that such an attack is possible would be psychologically stressful and demoralizing for troops on the ground. Similar swarming strikes could be unleashed behind the front lines as well, with hugely expensive and low density/high demand combat aircraft being especially vulnerable to this sort of tactic—something General James Holmes alluded to inadvertently while speaking to the Air Force Association, stating: “Imagine a world where somebody flies a couple hundred of those and flies one down the intake of my F-22s with just a small weapon on it.” Actually, it would be even easier to just strike the jets as they sit idle and vulnerable on the flight line. One swarm could see a whole squadron of tightly packed fighters destroyed without even having a chance to fight back. Maybe wide-area electronic warfare could help counter such a threat, at least to some degree. But clearly the best defense of all is to not let the enemy get close enough to launch such an onslaught in the first place. But this is a tough proposition when it comes to defense from such an attack in friendly areas or behind the lines, where even the fastest fighter jets sit stationary on flightlines—the coordinates of which are readily available on Google Earth. Although it may sound like a page out a science fiction novel, the only thing that could probably counter such a dense swarming attack on ground forces or a garrisoned force would be for those forces to have their own counter-swarm swarms at the ready. This would result in dozens or even hundreds of mini kamikaze dogfights in the sky—a life and death suicide struggle among diminutive hive-minded flying robots. Suffice it to say the SHORAD challenges of the future will be robust and plentiful. But it’s time we start tackling today’s SHORAD challenges head-on so we can adapt quicker to those of tomorrow. Getting America’s military back in the SHORAD game in a serious way would be a good first step in the right direction. But dealing with what is largely a traditional tactical problem like short-range air defense against low-flying aircraft, larger drones, and cruise missiles, is something the Pentagon is far more adept to confronting than the transformation of hobby drones into deadly weapons of warfare and espionage. With the U.S. already behind the curve, the threat of individual drones will quickly give way to swarms, and how exactly this will be dealt with even when it comes to proliferation among non-state actors remains unclear. Closely regulating components that provide cooperative capabilities and networking among multiple drones would certainly be a start, but even just larger volumes of disparate types of hobby drones that do not work semi-autonomously or autonomously together will be hard to defend against. The jammers work for some won’t work for others, and decoys that run without man-in-the-loop control won’t be easy to discriminate against quickly. As I stated above, the best defense against small drones is small drones, especially when it comes to swarms. Now, it seems as if industry is finally getting that impression too. In the meantime, just being able to reliably counter individual or small numbers of improvised attack drones remains the priority. Frankly, we are very lucky this type of attack hasn’t happened before and against a less controversial head of state or other VVIP. The barrier of entry to executing such a plan is so low and potential targets have been so soft for so long that it’s a miracle this is just becoming a mainstream issue now. But I really need to make the point here that the lowest-end and highest-end drone technologies are really the most disruptive. The weaponization of cheap swarms of drones will absolutely change the nature of combat in the not so distant future in ways that are far more complex than the issues just beginning to be talked about widely today. A far darker cloud on the horizon I made some predictions as to what’s coming in terms of drone warfare back in 2012 , most of which has already become a reality or is in the process of doing so. What must be understood is that drone/unmanned warfare on an increasingly miniaturized level will irrevocably warp our perceptions of modern combat and these weapons will make the individual soldier far more vulnerable than they have been in a very long time. I wrote the following in early 2012 and it it has made its way around to the curriculum in a number of war colleges and other academic institutions: Imagine for instance if a Marine unit wanted to take down a village. Instead of sending in platoon after platoon of Marines to clear an objective, you could send in swarms of small UAVs, every soldier could even individually operate or monitor their own micro UAV and be in the battle “virtually,” each platoon represented by a swarm. They could enter the town in mass, and not only recon it, but if the operator “sees” an enemy threat they can just fly the UAV over to that threat and detonate a fragmentation charge. Such a capability would drastically decrease the dangers of urban warfare and when used in a non-urban environment there would really be nowhere for the enemy to hide. The best part about such a concept is that the drones, unlike young Marines, are fully expendable. If one is lost via enemy fire or simple malfunction, no big deal, others will adapt to fill in for their lost brethren automatically. By arming these micro UAVs with explosives you create a suicide robot that would be feared psychologically by the enemy on truly unprecedented levels, as they would literally be able to sneak in a cracked window at night and detonate themselves above the enemy as they sleep. There are other areas where micro UAVs, and specifically small swarms of them, would come in handy. For instance, during direct action operations by special forces, swarms could stand guard at key vulnerability areas while the special operations team goes about their raid… … On a smaller scale, imagine a scout sniper team being able to recon their area while still remaining hidden almost as if they were doing it on foot. A micro-UAV system would give them the ability to go inside open buildings and peer around corners. All the swarm’s intel could be recorded/relayed in real time as well. Further, micro-UAV swarms could be used as a weapon instead of a telltale sniper shot which often gives away a stealthy scout sniper team’s hiding position. Instead, they could spot their target and fly a little drone too it, detonating next to the target by surprise when it comes within lethal range. No muzzle report or muzzle flash needed. In many ways, science fiction has already portrayed such drones as the ultimate in persistent search and destroy weaponry—too hard to kill and relentless in their pursuit. Today these concepts have become common in pop-culture, but just the better part of a decade ago, they really weren’t. And it’s probably time for me to update these macro-battle concepts, but this shows it wasn’t that hard to see what was around the bend, and the fact that the Pentagon and law enforcement were so caught off guard by a much more blatant and immediate threat is really troubling. The dark art of espionage will increasingly rely on tiny drones for everything from assassination to intelligence collecting. And mother nature has provided the perfect cover for these clandestine operations. In my big 2012 feature Tyler’s 10 Thoughts On The Future Of Drone Warfare I wrote in part: The days of thinking of “small drones” as those that fit in a Navy SEAL’s backpack are numbered. Soon we will see operational drones the size of a grapefruit, then the size of a dragonfly, and eventually, maybe in 30 years time, we won’t be able to see them at all. As drones shrink so will the weapons they carry. Today we see the sub 50lb smart munitions being deployed on smaller drones, yet these cutting-edge micro-munitions may prove to be comparatively colossal in time. Eventually, miniature UAVs will use sub 5lb guided bomblets and even guided bullets to deal death from on high. Even smaller drones will eventually be able to take out the enemy by “biting” or “injecting” them with poison, both lethal and non-lethal, very similar to the ways in which insects have operated for millions of years. On the sub-micro end of things nanites or nanobots, which are microscopic robots, will be able to infiltrate computer circuitry or even the human circulatory system in large numbers and conduct repairs or cause catastrophic damage. In the end, the smallest drones may end up being the most useful and dangerous of all, able to act like life-saving mini-surgeons living in our bloodstreams or as self-replicating weapons of mass destruction for which the only defense may be, dare I say it, anti-nanobot nanobots! We have all seen just how effective computer software viruses can be when used as weaponry, now just imagine if the computer hardware itself could be infected on a microscopic level with mechanical viruses in the form of nanobots. The same could theoretically be done to the human body, instead of biological weapons of mass destruction based on human-engineered super-viruses, micro-mechanized based weaponized viruses may be the alarming norm of the not too distant future. It is bewildering to think that the world’s most lethal future wars may be fought on a microscopic battlefield. Mirroring the organic creatures in our biosphere also offers a veil of stealth never really obtainable to such a believable or functional degree: Eventually, [in certain circumstances] you will not need expensive and imperfect stealth technology to infiltrate an enemy’s territory, instead, you will send robotic birds, fish, and even insects to do so. A replica bird carrying miniaturized information, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) equipment would be able to operate over enemy territory with near impunity. Further, bird or fish-like drone imposters would be even more effective and survivable than their traditional counterparts by being able to operate in flocks and schools just like their organic cousins without drawing any extra attention to themselves. On the tiny side of things, mechanized dragonflies and mosquitoes will become the ultimate tools of clandestine warfare. Able to penetrate almost any structure, these tiny drones could be used to literally look and listen in on the enemy’s most sensitive conversations without being detected or requiring risky planting before such a meeting takes place. Further, these types of mechanical micro-insects will be able to track an enemy high-value target by simply attaching themselves to their vehicle or clothes. Even machinery and computer networks could eventually be infiltrated with tiny mechanical spiders, still far larger than the aforementioned nanobots, that could wreak havoc on hardware from inside the computers themselves. Finally and the most sinister of all, mosquito, wasp, or even ant like drones could use their organic pseudo-pedigree in deadly ways, injecting the enemy with poison even while they are fast asleep. What at first would seem like a harmless series of bug bites would soon turn out to be a death sentence. With this insect-like drone technology, there will no longer be a need to blow up a building with a Hellfire missile in order to kill a single high-value target inside. Instead, war-fighters could just drop a swarm of mechanical mosquitoes over the building in question and proceed to deal death with microscopic accuracy and finesse. These tiny drones represent the ultimate in low collateral damage stealth weaponry. Yet the technology also represents a massive threat to our forces as well. How do you adequately protect the common soldier, let alone people like the President or other highly important figureheads when just a drone-mosquito bite could mean certain death? Once this technology gestates, what once were traditionally safe havens, such as inside known structures surrounded by security personnel, will no longer be considered so. The only true defense against such an insidious capability would be to live within totally sealed structures at all times. What I am trying to say here is that this type of micro-drone, insect-like technology, once developed, has the ability to change the way we live, and if it were to fall into the wrong hands it could become incredibly dangerous. Drones line a table at remote-controlled aircraft show in Moscow., AP The truth hurts, but it  have hurt way more So what’s the big takeaway here? The Pentagon and law enforcement need to treat emerging drone technology in a different manner than they do when it comes to more traditional and established threats. The democratization of unmanned aircraft technology is only going to increase and it could make our lives better is so many ways and it will also provide unique and critical capabilities to our military and to law enforcement . At the same time, it has an even better chance of disrupting security here at home and the safety of our dignitaries and service people abroad more than almost any other threat technology on the horizon, including ‘sexier’ high-end threats like hypersonic weapons and railguns . The powers that be have blown it when it comes to identifying and actually acting on this threat early on and I have little confidence they will invest anywhere near as much as they need to going forward to try to outpace it as it morphs rapidly and drastically in the future. Then again now, after they have they been warned for years about the potential dangers of low-end drone technologies and have now seen the threat manifest itself in audacious forms right before their very eyes, that may change. But we are really talking about yesterday’s threat here and there are dark clouds on the horizon regarding just how these capabilities could rapidly evolve and the dangers they may pose, and those clouds aren’t made up of rain and mist, but massive swarms of small drones that could change the course of human history. Will our government buy an umbrella and rubber boots in advance of the approaching torrent or will they once again turn their gaze elsewhere and be left to ride the storm out on short notice and get drenched in the technological mayhem as a result? We’ll have to wait and see, but when it comes to small drones it seems like there is a dire lack of creativity of vision to see what is coming and not just react to what has already passed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 9, 2021",Whoops! Spanish Eurofighter Jet Accidentally Fires An Air-To-Air Missile Over Estonia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Spanish Air Force Eurofighter EF2000 has accidentally fired an AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM , while on patrol over Estonia. A search is now underway for any remnants of the weapon and Estonian authorities have, understandably, already launched an investigation into what exactly happened. The incident occurred on Aug. 7, 2018, at around 3:44 PM local time in the Pangodi area of Estonia’s Tartu County, which situated less than 50 miles west of the country’s border with Russia, according to local reports . In May 2018 , Spain deployed six of its Eurofighters to the region as part of NATO’s Baltic Air Policing mission, where they joined Portuguese F-16AM and French Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets. Estonian authorities say the last presumed position of the AIM-120 was around 25 miles north of the city of Tartu proper. After launching the missile, the Spanish EF2000, from that country’s Ala 11, or 11th Wing, based at Morón Air Base , returned to its forward operating location in Šiauliai, Lithuania. The weapon has a self-destruct feature, but it is unclear if it exploded or crashed into the ground. Estonian Defense Forces subsequently went out to look for any signs of the weapon using helicopters, but so far, there is no indication that they have found anything. A pair of Spanish Eurofighter EF2000s., Spanish Air Force The missile is more than 12 feet long and has a warhead with between 40 and 50 pounds of high explosive depending on the particular variant. As such, Estonian officials have urged anyone who does come across bits of the AMRAAM to stay away from it and alert the authorities. So far there is no word on whether the launch was the result of a fault with the aircraft or pilot error. Neither would seem particularly likely to occur. For the aircraft to inadvertently launch a weapon by itself, the appropriate electrical signals would need to get to the missile. The EF2000, or any other modern fighter jet, has multiple fail-safes in its design to prevent this from occurring accidentally. Spanish Eurofighters have suffered a number of accidents dating back all the way back to 2002 , when the crew of a two-seat variant ejected safely after suffering a dual engine flameout. Additional crashes occurred in 2010 and 2017 , killing the pilots in both cases, but there have been no other reports of misfired weaponry. The videos below show Spanish EF2000s performing the Baltic Air Policing mission in 2016. https://youtube.com/watch?v=TgugWfx5Dxw If the mishap was the result of pilot error, it would have required a significant number of protocol failures. Launching an AIM-120 is a multi-step process that begins with having the aircraft’s master arm function turned on. The pilot would then have to at least select the missile from the available armament options and then trigger the launch. The Baltic Air Policing mission is just that, an aerial police service meant to help the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania patrol their airspace against intrusions . But even if in times of war, the master arm function remains off until the pilot is ready to engage an enemy target. Even securing approval or independently firing on a hostile aircraft can involve carefully laid out procedures that are in accordance with strict rules of engagement. Whatever the case turns out to be, it’s definitely embarrassing for Spain, which is among the NATO members that spend the least on defense. It’s also not a great look for the Alliance as a whole, which has been under increasing pressure, especially from the United States , to reinvigorate its military capabilities after years of increasing neglect in many cases since the end of the Cold War. We will be keeping an eye out for any new details about this accidental missile launch and will update this story if we learn anything new. In the meantime, if you’re in Estonia and happen to see a long, smoldering tubular object lying on the ground, you can call the authorities at +372 717 1900 or dial 112 for the country’s national emergency line.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Less than a year after the U.S. Navy touted how purchasing missile tube assemblies in advance for its future Columbia -class ballistic missile submarines had helped trim the cost of the program, the service says it has uncovered faulty welds in those components that will need potentially costly and time-consuming fixes. The tubes are common to the Block V Virginia -class attack submarines and the U.K.’s Dreadnought -class ballistic missile boats, as well, and the issue could lead to delays in building all three types. Defense News was the first to report the problems on Aug. 6, 2018. Naval Sea Systems Command’s (NAVSEA) is now investigating all the work that BWXT, Inc., a sub-contractor to General Dynamics Electric Boat, has done on the common missile tubes so far. The firm has delivered seven of the assemblies already and is in the process of building five more. “All BWXT welding requiring volumetric inspection has been halted until the investigation is complete,” Bill Couch, a spokesperson for NAVSEA, told Defense News . “Initial reports indicate that the other vendors do not have the same issue, and they continue to produce missile and payload tubes.” The Navy has not said how many of BWXT’s tubes have known issues. An unnamed source told Defense News that the firm itself discovered the substandard welds, but it is unclear how and when it got reported to both General Dynamics Electric Boat and the U.S. government. An artist’s rendition of the future USS Columbia ., USN The service expects to purchase a total of 12 Columbia -class boats, which will eventually take the place of the Cold War-era Ohio -class . General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding will be involved in the production and the lead ship is supposed to enter service in 2031 if everything goes according to plan. In addition, the U.S. Columbia -class and the U.K. Dreadnought -class will carry their Trident D-5 nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missiles in multiple “quad pack” Common Missile Compartments, a deliberate decision to simplify the process of building the two types of subs and hopefully save money. The Block V Virginia -class doesn’t use the complete assembly, but the four tubes in its new Virginia Payload Module , or VPM, are of a common design, again to trim costs and streamline production. A briefing slide from 2014, when the Columbia -class was still called the Ohio Replacement, showing the production plan for the “quad pack” Common Missile Compartments., USN With regards to the Columbias , General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding will slot the compartments into the submarines at the appropriate time during construction. In the past, the shipyards had only purchased these components near to when the rest of the boat was ready, leading to small, irregular, and costly orders and added time to the overall production schedule. The Navy has long touted this concept as essential to keeping the price of the new ballistic missile boats as low as possible and keeping their delivery on schedule. So a problem with the tubes presents a significant issue. This briefing slide shows the Virginia Payload Module design which uses the same basic launch tube architecture as the Common Missile Compartment., USN “We’ve already reduced cost by $80 million per hull, to bring [average procurement unit down to $7.21 [billion],” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Michael Jabaley, the Program Executive Officer for Submarines at NAVSEA, said at the Naval Submarine League’s annual conference in November 2017 . “So that was a combination of missile tube continuous production … and advance construction, which is pulling key construction activities to the left. Really the focus of that was to reduce the risk of not delivering on time, but it had an added benefit of savings as well.” The concern is that BWXT’s welds could be a sign of other problems from the Navy’s push to ramp up production of the Columbias and new submarines in general, especially given the firm’s excellent existing quality record, according to Defense News . At present, the General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding are on a schedule where they each deliver one Virginia -class boat a year. The Navy hopes to add delivery of one of its new ballistic missile submarines each year on top of that and still have Virginias only take around 60 months to build in total. Needless to say, this is an ambitious goal. “Both shipbuilders hired additional people to account for the increase to two submarines per year,” Rear Admiral Jabaley had told Defense News in March 2017. “As a result, obviously when you bring in an influx of new people your level of experience goes down.” The Virginia -class USS Minnesota under construction in 2012., Newport News Shipbuilding It’s still too soon to tell whether BWXT’s troubles stemmed from this need to significantly increase production of the missile tubes, other factors, or a combination of both. If the former issue turns out to be the primary reason, it could call into question whether the shipyards can meet the Navy’s demands. And depending on how widespread the issue is, it could have cascading impacts on the delivery timetable for the Navy’s Columbias and Block V Virginias , as well as the Dreadnoughts for the Royal Navy. The Virginia -class is already on a very tight schedule to meet the two-boats-a-year requirement. Delays and cost increases could be even more problematic for the Royal Navy, which is reportedly staring down a possible funding gap of more than $7.7 billion for the Dreadnought -class over the next decade. Budget shortfalls combined with the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the European Union have already led to deep budget cuts and the country’s naval forces have already been hit particularly hard . “Impacts to the delivery of missile tubes to the U.K. will be assessed upon completion of GDEB’s [General Dynamics Electric Boat] efforts to define and scope next steps,” Couch, the NAVSEA spokesperson, told Defense News . “The Navy is assessing the potential impact to Virginia -class submarines with VPM.” An artist’s conception of one of the Royal Navy’s future Dreadnought -class submarines., BAE Systems Couch added that the Navy had been buying the tubes ahead of time specifically to help mitigate risk and that delivery of the future USS Columbia remained on schedule. But until its investigation into the situation is complete, the Navy might not really know just how widespread and serious the deficient welding is for the tubes or the submarines production timetable as a whole. The service has also not said how much it expects the repairs to cost. In September 2017, General Dynamics Electric Boat received a $5.1 billion contract just to finish design work ahead of the planned start of Columbia’s construction in 2021. A report from the Congressional Research Service in July 2018 pegged the full cost of the 12-boat program at more than $122 billion already. All of this comes at a time when the Navy is struggling to maintain its existing submarine fleets, which could give it a very little margin for delays in getting its new boats into service. As of October 2017, 15 Los Angeles – and Virginia -class types had been sitting idle for a total of 177 months collectively due to a backlog in regular maintenance availabilities both at the service’s own shipyards and those that contractors operate . “If you have a submarine that’s tied up in the shipyard, then obviously they’re not operating,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Joseph Tofalo, the Navy’s top submarine officer, told Breaking Defense at the Naval Submarine League conference in November 2017. “It’s probably most manifest in our ability to surge in time of crisis. We meet our … demand on a day to day basis, but the impact would be, if there’s a crisis, then your surge tank is low.” Significant delays in the delivery of new submarines would only exacerbate this deficiency. This, in turn, could put the Navy in an even more worrying predicament as small hostile states, such as North Korea , along with potential near-peer opponents, primarily Russia and China , look to step up their own submarine and other underwater activity . Hopefully, the Navy will be able to quickly isolate this new issue with the Common Missile Compartments and exploit the long-lead purchasing it has already done to otherwise mitigate any issues in the near- or long-term.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 17, 2018",Boeing Reportedly Blocks Offer Of Used 767s For Israeli Air Force Tanker Competition,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel is mulling over a large, multi-billion dollar defense spending boost for the Israeli Air Force, or IAF, which could include money for fighter jets , transport helicopters , cargo planes , and six new aerial refueling tankers . This last tender was already set to be highly competitive and now there are reports that Boeing has blocked Israel Aerospace Industries, also known as IAI, from offering second-hand 767 airliners converted into tanker-transports, which would be a direct threat to its own troublesome 767-based KC-46 Pegasus . The Israeli business daily Globes was the first to report the developments on Aug. 6, 2018. According to their sources, the American planemaker had refused to issue the required approvals for IAI’s Bedek Aviation Group division to make the modifications. It is possible that the Chicago-headquartered company could use this same mechanism to prevent the Israeli firm from competing against it with a Boeing-based platform in any future tanker competition anywhere in the world. “This is a serious restriction,” a source told Globes regarding Boeing’s decision. “Regrettably, and there is genuine regret, IAI is ruled out of the process” to bid on the contract for future IAF tankers. In July 2018, media outlets in Israel had reported that the IAF was in negotiations with Boeing about the possible purchase of its KC-46 tankers, but indicated that IAI and European consortium Airbus would put forward bids. Bedek had reportedly made a very attractive offer to convert second-hand 767s into an appropriate configuration for a total cost of around $150 million each . A Boeing KC-46 Pegasus., Boeing It’s unclear how much of a saving this would necessarily be compared to the KC-46, though. The U.S. Air Force, which has a firm, fixed-price contract with Boeing is buying the aircraft for around the same price. However, in February 2018, Boeing received a contract for the first KC-46 for Japan worth nearly $280 million , but it is unclear if this includes spare parts or other support services. Still, Bedek would also be able to point to its well-established history of working with Boeing products under license and converting some of those aircraft, including 767s, into tanker-transports. The Brazilian and Colombian Air Forces both operate examples of this KC-767 conversion, which IAI also refers to as the Multi-Mission Tanker Transport (MMTT) configuration. The MMTT conversions have only included probe-and-drogue fueling equipment, so Bedek would have had to develop a boom-type refueling system for any version it would have pitched to the IAF, which uses this method for refueling its fixed-wing aircraft. Still, the company has been doing exactly this type of work since the 1980s. This firm is the one that supplied the fleet of modified 707 airliners with a boom-type arrangement that the Israelis use to this day. There’s a broad precedent for turning used commercial aircraft into tankers, too, with the U.S. Air Force’s own KC-10 Extenders having started life hauling passengers. A breakdown of the 767 MMTT conversion’s features., IAI Boeing’s decision has the potential to hit hard at IAI’s finances and could put up to 500 jobs at risk, according to Globes . It could also possibly put the future of the Bedek division itself in question if it looks as if the American company might make a habit of blocking them from competing in military tenders that it wants for itself. “How would it make business sense for Boeing to give IAI such a permit when it is bidding against it in the very same tender?” the source told Globes . But no matter how reasonable this all might seem from a business perspective and regardless of how much genuine regret Boeing might have about the situation, the American company clearly has a fear that its KC-46 would not be able to win against the IAI offer for a variety of reasons. A Colombian KC-767 MMTT., Chris Lofting/Wikicommons The basic price difference is certainly one aspect of this, but the Pegasus has already had a long and overwrought development process and has suffered repeated difficulties and delays . In recent months, the U.S. Air Force, the launch customer for the type, had become unable to contain its ire about how things have gone and publicly took Boeing to task over the situation. In June 2018, Boeing and the Air Force had agreed on a new date for the delivery of the first KC-46, now scheduled for some time in October. But on Aug. 3, 2018, Aviation Week reported that a long-standing issue with the probe-and-drogue refueling system, which the KC-46s will use to refueling U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, had cropped up again. One of the KC-46 prototypes refuels an F/A-18 Hornet using one of its probe-and-drogue refueling systems., USAF The centerline drogue, one of three the KC-46 can carry, has a habit of inadvertently disconnecting from receiving aircraft, frustrating an already complex refueling process , which can be even more complicated during bad weather, at night, or under tense operational conditions. It is unclear whether this problem will push that back yet again. You can read more about the various issues that have led to the program ending up in this predicament in detail in a feature our own Tyler Rogoway wrote for Foxtrot Alpha in 2015, at which time the KC-46 program had been going on for nearly four years already. That project was itself an outgrowth of previous abortive U.S. Air Force tanker competitions and Boeing’s own earlier KC-767 concept , which it sold to Italy and Japan. And despite Boeing’s previous experience, the KC-46 is a very different beast, made up of components from various different types of 767s combined with a remote-control, fly-by-wire aerial refueling boom, instead of a traditional one with a crew member situated at the rear of the aircraft to operate it, and other new features. The new boom and the associated Remote Vision System, which an operator in the main cockpit uses to control it, have both proven to be particularly troublesome. A look at the key feature of the KC-46., Boeing The arrangement has led to damaged receiving aircraft and produced violent physics that has made it simply dangerous certain larger planes to refuel from the KC-46 at all in the past. It’s unclear if Boeing has been able to completely resolve either issue. The boom scraping along or denting the skin of a receiving aircraft would be bad enough, but for modern stealthy designs, it might impair the low observable characteristics of those planes. The Israelis will almost certainly be concerned about this given that they are buying F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and have already reportedly sent them into combat . Tankers would already be essential for any Israeli contingency planning with regards to more conventional opponents, chiefly Iran , as would the F-35’s ability to penetrate dense air defenses to either strike targets or neutralize those enemy positions to pave a way for follow-on operations by non-stealthy aircraft. The IAF’s new aerial refueling will need to be able to work seamlessly with the Joint Strike Fighters, which Israel calls the Adir , or “Mighty,” as well as its fourth generation combat jets . As noted, Bedek would have had to design a new boom setup for its KC-767 MMTT for the IAF competition, but it is highly unlikely that the firm would have chosen a remotely operated arrangement given Boeing’s troubles with the KC-46 and its experience with the KC-707. This could have simplified the conversion process immensely and no doubt contributed to the much lower price point of the Israeli offering. An IAF KC-707., IAF Boeing itself could have chosen to offer a version of its earlier, proven KC-767 , but it would be hard not to see a highly experienced air force such as Israel’s considering that variant as a referendum against the Pegasus. The American planemaker isn’t offering the older design anymore at all, even to existing operators, such as Japan, which is now buying KC-46s . Depending on how seriously the Israelis view the continuing boom issues and if Boeing can’t convince them that it has or will soon rectify these problems, the decision to force out Bedek of the running might push the IAF away from a Boeing based design entirely. Airbus is almost certainly interested in competing for this deal with its A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft, which has a unit cost of around $200 million, cheaper still than the KC-46. Australia already operates a version this aircraft with a boom as the KC-30A and plans to use it in cooperation with its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters. The Royal Australian Air Force has already demonstrated the aircraft’s ability to refuel the stealthy fighter jets, among other aircraft. A Royal Australian Air Force KC-30A refuels a US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter during a test., USAF Boeing’s move against IAI might lead to a broader chill between the company and the Israeli government, which could impact a host of other deals. Most notably, the IAF appears very interested in buying more of the company’s F-15 combat jets. The firm is also hoping to sell V-22 Osprey tilt-rotors and CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters to Israel. International politics could play a role in the final decision, as well, since U.S. President Donald Trump has been an outspoken supporter of Israel and is eager to promote American weapon sales to allies abroad. His administration could push for additional military aid to the Israeli government or otherwise help facilitate purchases of KC-46s and potentially make them more attractive compared to any competing bid in the process. Whatever the case, it seems hard to see how IAI will be able to put forward a bid, at least using a Boeing airframe, which could have serious ramifications for both companies in the near- and long-term.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 6, 2019",Dive Into This Incredible Shot Taken At USS Olympia’s Swim Call Following RIMPAC,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Los Angeles class submarine USS Olympia (SSN-717) is the second oldest nuclear fast attack submarine in the U.S. Navy’s inventory. But apparently, when it comes to Olympia, with age comes wisdom and stellar performance. The boat’s crew not only performed awesomely during Rim of The Pacific (RIMPAC) drills that just wrapped up, but they also made history by firing off the first UGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missile from an American submarine in decades during a sinking exercise (SINKEX)—an act that is likely to have dramatic repercussions for years to come throughout the Navy’s fast attack submarine community. You can read all about this and Olympia’s performance here . With all this in mind, the crew got a well-deserved swim call after RIMPAC wrapped up on August 2nd, enjoying the warm Hawaiian waters from their beloved nuclear-powered dive platform. Luckily, Bob Nguyen, who also happens to be a member of Olympia’s crew as well as a very creative photographer, captured the action above and below water simultaneously in incredible fashion. Not only is such a photo very challenging to pull off, but the timing with the diver and the sailor in the foreground couldn’t be better. But above all else, we get a rare look of a nuclear fast attack submarine both from above and below the waterline. And judging by the organic growth on Olympia’s hull, she is no drydock queen. Bob Nguyen/USS Olympia Facebook page The life of a submariner is not for the faint of heart. Being locked up in a submerged tube with a hundred a twenty other people for weeks at a time can and does break some individuals. You can read all about what it is like living and working on a nuclear fast attack boat in this past special feature of mine. Submariners even have their own language that is as comical as it is intricate . Suffice it to say that we should be very thankful that there are those that are willing and even excited to live a good portion of their lives below the waves. Rescue swimmer and crew stand ready to assist swimmers during Olympia’s swim call. That one guy’s shirt is awesome by the way. , USS Olympia Facebook page The stress of the job definitely requires a break from time to time, and even though even the Navy’s largest ships execute swim calls and ‘steel beach’ picnic events to give sailors and a bit of rest and relaxation, submarines do it in their own very unique way. This can include throwing a football around at the ice-covered crown of the globe , BBQing on the submarine’s thin strip of real estate while floating in the middle a huge ocean, or even executing the mother of all beer runs. A similar shot that grabbed my attention a while back: Olympia has been serving the fleet for 34 years and still has two more years of service to fulfill before being decommissioned in 2020. When she is retired, the first flight of Los Angeles submarines will have disappeared from service once and for all.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 22, 2018",USAF Reveals Timeline For Buying Light Attack Aircraft It Now Says It Needed Decades Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says that it will begin formally soliciting bids for an undisclosed number of light attack aircraft within months and that Embraer and Sierra Nevada Corporation’s A-29 Super Tucano or Textron’s AT-6C Wolverine look to be the most promising candidates, which could invite protests from other companies. Beyond that, the service doesn’t expect to issue an actual contract until sometime in 2019, a lengthy wait ​​​​ for planes that it now admits could have been useful in various conflicts since 1993 , well before the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Global War on Terror. On Aug. 3, 2018, the Air Force Materiel Command issued one notice , in error, on FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s top contracting website, before replacing it with a corrected one . According to the announcement, the service wants to put out a solicitation in December 2018 and pick a winning offer in the fourth quarter of the 2019 Fiscal Year, which runs from July 1, 2019, to Sept. 30, 2019. The Air Force still has yet to say how many aircraft it expects to purchase as part of what it is now calling the Light Attack Aircraft (LAA) program. “LAA will provide an affordable, non-developmental aircraft intended to operate globally in the types of Irregular Warfare environments that have characterized combat operations over the past 25 years,” the final noticed explained . “Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) and Textron Aviation are the only firms that appear to possess the capability necessary to meet the requirement within the Air Force’s time frame without causing an unacceptable delay in meeting the needs of the warfighter.” That latter statement is hardly surprising. As we at The War Zone have pointed out on a number of occasions , the Air Force and other branches of the U.S. military have, together collectively, evaluated one or both of these aircraft on no less than six separate occasions since 2007. An Ecuadorean Air Force A-29 Super Tucano during a training exercise in Brazil., Brazilian Air Force Most recently , the service had put the two aircraft types through a series of experiments that it said would explore the potential to integrate additional sensors and networking capabilities, as well as examine their maintenance and logistical requirements. It seemed difficult to understand why the Air Force still needed to gather information on these topics and, after a fatal accident in June 2018, it shut down the tests early and declared it had all the data it needed. On top of that, the Air Force itself already flies A-29s to help train foreign pilots and operates the T-6 Texan II , the unarmed trainer that Textron used as the basis for the AT-6C. It is safe to say that the service has had a wealth of information about these two aircraft and a good understanding of their capabilities and operational requirements for years. Members of Air Force National Guard look at an AT-6C with various weapons loaded and on display in front during another evaluation of the type in 2010., USAF So, it would make good sense to focus on them in order to help speed up the process of getting new light attack planes into service as fast as possible, especially given that the Air Force’s somewhat stunning acknowledgment about having had a need for them for more than two decades. The 25-year time frame in the contracting notice dates back to when Somali militants shot down two MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters killed 18 American special operators, and wounded dozens more in a running gun battle in that country’s capital Mogadishu following a risky daytime raid to capture individuals close to prominent warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. American forces in the country had limited close air support options at the time and the debacle set the tone for U.S. involvement in Somalia , as well as how it conducted limited interventions in general, for more than a decade thereafter. But even now, the Air Force still seems to be dragging its feet on the LAA program. If the service awards a contract right on July 1, 2019, this will be two years after it started its light attack aircraft experiment, commonly known as OA-X. It will be more than a decade after members of the service produced the first OA-X white paper calling for this type of aircraft in 2008. The video below shows rare footage from the Battle of Mogadishu in October 1993. https://youtube.com/watch?v=yGSXhnVic3E As of June 2018, the service said that it still had not developed an acquisition strategy for buying light attack aircraft. It didn’t ask for any money for the program in its 2019 Fiscal Year budget request, either. Congress, which has been very supportive of light attack aircraft projects, added hundreds of millions into the defense budget anyway, but the Air Force has suggested that a full LAA program that sees the purchase of between 200 and 300 aircraft in total could cost approximately $2.5 billion between the 2020 and 2024 fiscal years. The service has insinuated on a number of occasions that it doesn’t expect to begin receiving any such planes until 2020 at the earliest. Stating up front that the A-29 and AT-6C are the primary competitors could easily lead to legal or procedural challenges from other firms interested in competing, as well. Czech firm Aero Vodochody and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) are heavily pushing what they’re calling the F/A-259 Striker , an improved variant of Aero’s L-159 light jet aircraft . Bronco Combat Systems, a joint venture between South Africa’s Paramount Group and American defense company Fulcrum Concepts, is hoping to pitch their Bronco II aircraft. An artist’s conception of the F/A-259 Striker., Aero Vodochody Another U.S.-based firm, IOMAX, which is working with the Air Force separately to certify various aspects of its Archangel light attack aircraft, could be another prospective vendor. The North Carolina-headquartered company felt it had gotten unfairly excluded from the original OA-X experiment. A formal challenge through Congress’ Government Accountability Office or the threat of a lawsuit could force the Air Force to consider more aircraft types, further drawing out the process. If nothing else, responding to those complaints could delay the LAA program’s contract. Of course, it is still a positive sign that the Air Force does appear to be moving toward a formal program and a real contract. By its own admission, it has been a long time coming. As we at the War Zone , among others, have consistently pointed out , these aircraft are not a substitute for high-performance combat jets, or even aircraft, such as the A-10 , that might be increasingly better suited to medium-threat environments. It is a complimentary capability with a smaller logistics footprint that helps reduce the operational and sustainment demands on those other fleets and their pilots. US Air Force A-10s fly with a Colombian Air Force A-29 Super Tucano during a training exercise., USAF Cheaper to fly and maintain, a large fleet of light attack aircraft might use smaller operating locations with limited infrastructure to provide coverage across a broad area during limited conflicts. Between this dispersed posture and their ability to loiter over the battlefield for extended periods, these planes could provide invaluable armed overwatch for conventional and special operations forces . Unfortunately, there is a real risk that remains is that if the Air Force still doesn’t have a clear plan for what it intends to do with the aircraft and how, for whatever reasons, that these planes might find themselves orphaned within the service’s force structure and ultimately discarded. Fears that this could happen led to the collapse of the almost identical Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) program in 2012. It’s also what happened to the C-27J Spartan intra-theater airlifter, the remaining examples of which have now filtered out to U.S. Special Operations Command, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Forest Service. The Air Force has continually stressed how important it will be for foreign partners to be a part of the program, as well, but hasn’t explained how that will necessarily work. We don’t know whether this means the LAA program will be more about assisting other countries in acquiring light attack aircraft than building this capability within the service itself. In the defense spending bill that Congress recently passed cover the 2019 fiscal year, legislators specifically demanded a report outlining how foreign cooperation fits in with the project. We can only hope that the Air Force is more committed to seeing the new LAA program through than it has been with similar efforts in the past and finally acquires this much-needed capability.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 1, 2018",AC-130W Gunship Pilots Help Target The Enemy With An Off The Shelf Rifle Sight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are few weapons as vicious as the AC-130 gunship. For 50 years this flying arsenal has ruthlessly rained down fire on the enemy from on high, and usually in the black of night. With the venerable AC-130U Spooky gunship now in the twilight of its career and the AC-130H Spectre having been finally retired in 2015 , the fleet will be consolidated around the AC-130W Stinger II and new AC-130J Ghostrider in the not too distant future. The AC-130W, which are converted C-130Hs, was once viewed as a lightly modified, modular roll-on-roll-off gunship concept, but has since grown in scope. Originally designed more as a bomb truck than as a  traditional gunship in many respects (read all about this in this prior article of mine), the aircraft’s single GAU-23 30mm Bushmaster cannon has since been augmented by the AC-130 family’s most powerful weapon, the 105mm Howitzer. This addition, along with other upgrades, has resulted in an incredibly powerful platform that is all AC-130—not an aircraft that can moonlight doing other missions as well. And that’s a very good thing for U.S. and allied troops and a very bad thing for the enemy. One interesting feature we just noticed the latest iteration of the Stinger II sporting is an EOTech holographic rifle sight mounted on the left side of the cockpit, next to the pilot. The model looks to be a version of the XPS2 which has an MSRP of $665. XPS2, EOTech Youtube Screencap Here’s the video of a very recent AC-130W mission over Syria in which the EOTech can be seen: Traditionally, AC-130s have had full-on Heads Up Displays (HUD) mounted sideways in this position. The somewhat awkward arrangement was developed to help AC-130 pilots to hold a perfect pylon turn around a point—their target area. AC-130U pilot using the HUD to coordinate a pylon turn during a firing sequence., Youtube GIF This allowed gunners to more accurately engage their targets on the ground without any maneuvering surprises which could prove deadly for nearby friendly troops. Nothing can engage the enemy from the air with better accuracy in danger-close situations than the AC-130. From what we know, the pilot could also fire some of the AC-130’s arsenal using the HUD, or at least they could on earlier models under specific circumstances. The original gunship, the AC-47, used a holographic gunsight in a similar manner to help its pilot fire off broadsides of machinegun fire., San Diego Air And Space Museum Today, AC-130 weapons fire and targeting is done primarily at the hand of the Combat Systems Officer sitting in the back of the aircraft at a control station that feeds them critical data from the aircraft’s sensors and weapons. Regardless, the AC-130W, which never had a side-mounted HUD to our knowledge, now appears to have the very off-the-shelf holographic gunsight in this position. It’s certainly there to help Stinger II pilots coordinate their deadly circles in the sky, but we have no idea if it can actually be used to engage targets, although it seems quite unlikely as it wouldn’t have the computing power that a full-up HUD has. Still, it’s pretty wild to think that the world’s largest flying gun gets help aiming its brutal arsenal using a lowly rifle sight that is more at home on a soldier’s carbine, or even at your local shooting range, than on a front-line combat aircraft. Then again, maybe it isn’t that surprising considering F-15 squadrons mounted high-power rifle scopes in their cockpit for long-range visual identification purposes for many years due to lack of a better or at least fully funded solution.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 18, 2018",Here’s Why The USAF Is Suddenly Talking Cargo Drops From Space And Spying On Other Galaxies,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For better or worse , the idea of an independent Space Force seems to be gaining traction within the White House, in Congress, and even the halls of the Pentagon. The Air Force stands to lose the most in any such arrangement, so, perhaps not coincidentally, some members of the service’s senior leadership seem especially keen to show that they understand that space, and potential threats to American assets up there , is an important issue. But some of the statements these individuals have made, including the idea of prepositioning supplies in geosynchronous orbit or preparing to monitor activities in other galaxies , are highly unrealistic and difficult to view seriously. On Aug. 3, 2018, our good friend Stephen Trimble , who is editor of Flightglobal ‘s Americas Bureau, alerted us that the issue of watching for threats outside the Milky Way had come up in question and answer session with U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Veralinn Jamieson, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, after her speech at an event the Air Force Association had hosted the day before. At a separate gathering, U.S. Air Force General Carlton Everhart, head of Air Mobility Command, had off-handedly raised the possibility of using space as a huge cargo dump . The relevant portions of Trimble’s exchange with Jamieson, which he generously shared on Twitter , are worth reading in full: Lieutenant General Jamieson: “I am convinced that there are more domains – man-made domains – that will come, and I would offer you that if we look at galaxies – sounds nuts – but there’s going to be a man-made domain in galaxies.” FlightGlobal’s Stephen Trimble: “I don’t know what you mean – galaxies?” Jamieson: “Space has got different galaxies. And in those galaxies in the future we’re going to actually have capability that we have right now in the air. We don’t know what it is because we haven’t freed our mind to think about what is that space and how we are going to utilize it. Space is contested. It’s going to happen.” Trimble remains understandably baffled by what this was supposed to mean, as are we. Let’s be perfectly clear, space does have lots of different galaxies and the space immediately above planet Earth is increasingly contested for military actors , something we at The War Zone note routinely . It’s also true that the nearest galaxy to our own, the Andromeda Galaxy , is 2.5 million light years away and that we still seem to be a ways off from being able to reliably and cost-effectively traveling to our planetary neighbor Mars, which is only 48 million normal Earth miles away from us, an infinitesimally shorter distance by comparison. Despite vocal advocates to the contrary, there is little to no actual evidence that the technology that would be necessary to reach Andromeda, let along militarize it, has moved beyond the realm of science fiction. Worrying about how to monitor a “man-made domain” there isn’t even a long-term issue for a service that is still formalizing a plan for how it will replace its nearly 30-year-old E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management aircraft and has even less of an idea of what to about its even more dated airliner-sized RC-135 family of spy planes – which was the crux of Trimble’s actual question to Jamieson. So far, there is no “man-made domain” in the Andromeda Galaxy, seen here, that we know of., Adam Evans via Wikimedia These comments came after General Everhart had caused his own stir by mentioning that he had visited space launch firms SpaceX and Virgin Orbit and brought up the possibility of moving cargo and personnel from one point on Earth to another through space in the future. The officer said he hoped to find time to sit down with representatives from another company, Blue Origin , in the future to discuss this and other topics. “Think about this. Thirty minutes, 150 metric tons, [and] less than the cost of a C-5 [cargo plane] ,” he said on Aug. 2, 2018. “I said, I need to get me some of that. How do I do that?” That’s a good question and one that the Air Force, as well as other services, has been looking to answer since the very beginnings of the Space Race in the late 1950s. It’s become something of a holy grail over the decades. Concept art from circa 1963 depicting Douglas Ithacus T-100 cargo and personnel carrying rockets launching Marines on a mission from the deck of a supercarrier. , Douglas via Scott Lowther It goes without saying that the ability to use space as a hypersonic transport route to rapidly deliver cargo and personnel could revolutionize routine operations and enable entirely new offensive and defensive strategies. But developing a system that works safely and reliability and is anywhere near fiscally feasible, let alone cheaper than traditional means of transportation, for any substantial volume of cargo, is a tall order. The idea of putting cargo-carrying satellites into orbit and being able to request an orbital supply drop at the touch of a button is even more fanciful. “I think in the next five years we can be right in on that concept stage,” Everhart said. “Actual routine, probably within the next 10.” The most recent formal U.S. military’s projects in this realm, the Small Unit Space Transport and Insertion program, or SUSTAIN , began in 2002 and received support from the U.S. Marine Corps. It was also purportedly “doable in 5-10 year timeframe” as of 2009. By the end of that year, the program was effectively dead . A briefing slide from circa 2009 describing “conclusions” from a study the University of North Dakota did regarding about the SUSTAIN concept under contract to the US Marine Corps and the Pentagon’s National Security Space Office., DOD Of course, since then, SpaceX , in particular, has made serious progress on reusable rocket boosters to help reduce costs and other companies are following suit . Congress is even mandating that the U.S. military consider a reusable option for every single launch in the future and submit a written report to lawmakers any time they choose an expendable launch vehicle that explaining why they did so. SpaceX, as well as its competitors, is hoping to leverage that technology into cost-effective launch vehicles for planetary landers for a potential mission to Mars, which the U.S. military might be able to at least consider as an option for rapidly moving personnel and materiel around the Earth in the future . But there’s still no evidence yet that these are fiscally workable, especially for routine, day-to-day movements. How much might it cost, per round, to deliver just a load of standard 5.56mm rifle ammunition from orbit? https://youtube.com/watch?v=u0-pfzKbh2k Just getting cargo deliveries to the International Space Station is an expensive undertaking, ranging broadly from $150 million to $250 million per launch. Satellites launches can be significantly cheaper , but also involve much lighter payloads than the military might be interested in. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is presently working on a proof of concept of a reusable space plane that might only cost $5 million per launch, but will be limited to a 3,000-pound payload. The Air Force has also been experimenting with the X-37B , another small space shuttle, for almost a decade now. A C-5 Galaxy may cost more than $100,000 per hour to fly, but even on a 24-hour mission, that’s still an order of magnitude less expensive than most commercial space launches and half of the price that DARPA is aiming for with its program. A Galaxy can carry more than 450,000 pounds of cargo, too. The last cargo shipment to the ISS was less than 8,000 pounds and it was the largest load ever for Orbital ATK’s Cygnus unmanned cargo spacecraft. It is possible that space-based cargo operations could be useful to support short-notice, high-risk operations in unusual circumstances, such as resupplying a special operations team deep behind enemy lines on a mission vital to national security or inserting them there to begin with. But it’s not at all clear that this would be more discreet and effective than other, more conventional options the Air Force is presently looking at or be worth the immense cost of maintaining this capability for those extremely rare situations, at all. General Everhart seemed to be at least somewhat aware of these issues. Despite offering up a timeline, he also indicated he wasn’t sure regular space-based transportation missions would be viable any time soon. “This is me thinking out loud,” he said. “I don’t know, I’m going to ask the industry…If you’ve got ideas, I’ll take them.” US Air Force General Carlton Everhart, NGB We have no way of knowing whether these kinds of pronouncements about hyper-futuristic plans for the “space domain” will help the Air Force in its effort to quash the Space Force initiative, or at least garner a larger portion of it. The service’s opposition has infuriated the Space Force’s most vocal supporters in Congress and only pushed them to redouble their efforts and the Pentagon’s top leadership appears to be steadily changing its mind on the matter, too. With President Donald Trump fully on board, that momentum is only building. None of this is to say the idea of a Space Force is necessarily good or bad. There are serious questions that remain unanswered about the proposal and it’s unclear if the majority of Congress actually supports any of the plans that we know about so far. The Air Force appears to have an increasingly real fear of getting left behind on space, though, and losing important parts of its budget and force structure in the process. Still, it seems hard to see how talking up concepts that sound ripped from a Hollywood blockbuster will help show that it not only understands what’s at stake in space and takes things seriously, but is still the right service to lead these efforts. There are very real things the service is and needs to be doing in the near term to preserve its presence in space and expand it to respond to emerging challenges and threats . Defending against jamming, spoofing , and physical attacks on critical communications and intelligence satellites and increasing space-based networking , early warning , and intelligence gathering will only continue to be increasingly important issues in the coming years and ones that the Air Force use to highlight its existing role in space. Whether the service can finally make space-based, hypersonic transportation affordable enough for large, routine deliveries after more than six decades of unsuccessfully attempting to do so would seem to be less of a priority. Whatever happens, it seems much more likely that we’ll see a separate branch of the U.S. military dedicated to activities in space before the Air Force, or any other service, ever has to worry about operations in other galaxies.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 20, 2018",Watch This F-35B Have A Bit Of Aerial Refueling Frustration On Its Way To The UK,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Aerial refueling is not an easy task no matter how simple some aircrews make it look. This post alone will make you appreciate the work of tankers and their ‘customer’ aircraft like never before. Even the latest tanker and tactical aircraft designs, with all the technology they bring to the table, don’t make the process that much easier. Case in point is the video below shot during a transatlantic delivery flight of F-35Bs being ‘dragged’ to the UK by a RAF A330 Voyager Multi-Role Tanker Transport. Here’s a direct link to the Facebook video if it does not show up automatically below on your mobile device. As you can see, the F-35 pilot takes stab at the basket and misses, with the drogue ramming into the F-35’s refueling probe. The F-35 pilot does all they can to avoid the basket impacting the stealth jet’s sensitive skin before taking a second and more successful run at it.Â Although missing the drogue is very common for any type of aircraft equipped with a probe for aerial refueling, the F-35’s refueling probe has been a source of frustration for the program. The C and B models have broken off a disproportionate number of probe tips during refueling in recent years. The last major report from the Pentagon’s head tester stated the following: DOT&E Report A June 2018 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report goes into further detail regarding the outstanding issue: Aerial refueling probes: The F-35B and F-35C variants use a â€œhose and drogueâ€ system where an aerial refueling tanker aircraft extends a long, flexible refueling hose and a parachute-like metal basket that provides stability, and the receiving aircraft then connects to the drogue basket with its extendable refueling probe, as shown in figure 10. From April 2014 to August 2017, 21 incidents have occurred where the F-35â€™s aerial refueling probes broke off while conducting aerial refueling, leading to a restriction of aerial refueling operations. The Navy and Air Force are investigating the issue and implementing improvements to reduce these incidents: 1. Pilot training improvements have been completed. 2. Improved inspection of KC-10 aerial refueling equipment has been implemented. 3. Software improvements to reduce the pilotâ€™s workload during refueling are planned to enter flight testing in May 2018. 4. A stronger refueling probe is in development. During long-range ‘tanker drags,’ also sometimes referred to as ‘Coronet’ missions, these factors have to be calculated into a complex refueling plan that would allow a crippled jet to divert to a landing field at nearly any given time during its flight. Bad weather, which makes aerial refueling a tougher and violent affair, may also be factored in more heavily to F-35 operations because of this deficiency. So far, it has been noted that F-35Bs require uniquely extensive tanker support for long-range repositioning operations.Â The F-35 program has tested the limits of its probe design in fairly spectacular fashion , and it is known that testers weren’t pleased with how the canopy bow blocks the line of sight between the pilot and the probe’s tip near perfectly during refueling operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 9, 2018",The Army Wants Armored Turrets Packing 120mm Mortars For Its Strykers And Other Vehicles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army wants a new turreted 120mm mortar that it can put on various armored vehicles, such as the Stryker and the up-coming Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle . The service is also eying it as an option a variant of the future Next Generation Combat Vehicle and wants the complete system to eventually be able to fire loitering munitions , too. The Army’s Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey described its basic requirements for such a system in a notice that it posted on FedBizOpps , the U.S. government’s top contracting website, on Aug. 2, 2018. The announcement said the service hoped to find a company to develop the system, formally called the Future Indirect Fire Turret (FIFT), and begin production by the end of 2021. “The 120mm Mortar FIFT is a 120mm turret that provides protection from enemy counter battery systems and insulates soldiers from the effects of both noise and blast overpressure,” the Army explained. “Additionally, the FIFT shall feature a level of automation, such that physical burden on crew is reduced, while supporting a high rate of fire capability.” This new system would replace wheeled M1129 Stryker Mortar Carrier Vehicles and tracked M113-based mortar carriers . These existing designs both use 120mm mortars mounted inside the hull of the vehicle and fired through large hatches on the roof that expose the crew to enemy fire and other potential hazards. An M1129 Stryker Mortar Carrier Vehicle. A member of the vehicle’s crew and the mortar’s 120mm mortar’s muzzle are visible at the rear protruding through the large open hatch., US Army The requirements say the turret can be manned or unmanned and needs an automatic loading system that at least moves the mortar rounds from a rack into the weapon itself. The objective goal is to acquire a system that doesn’t require a human to move the ammunition around inside the vehicle at all. This desire for automation extends to the firing process, as well. The Army wants a gunner to be able to receive a request for a fire mission and respond within 30 seconds with the help of a ballistic computer. If the vehicle is on the move when it gets the call for support, the service wants the crew to be able to stop, get into position, and fire the first round within a minute. There is a hope that the weapon system might even be able to work without the vehicle having to stop at all. This would make it more flexible and more survivable since it would be harder for an enemy to determine its position and then fire its own mortars or artillery in response. The entire system needs to be relatively fast, too. The Army wants the turret to be able to lob 16 rounds in a minute if necessary, followed by a more sustained fire of 6 rounds per minute thereafter. The objective is for a crew to be able to get up to 24 rounds in the air in the first 60 seconds and then keep firing 12 rounds every minute indefinitely afterward. A US Army soldier prepares to fire the 120mm mortar in an M1064 mortar carrier, which is based on the M113 armored personnel carrier., US Army This volume of fire has to translate into so-called “ Multiple Round Simultaneous Impact ” fire missions, or MRSI, with at least six rounds hitting the same target area, or bursting overhead, within four seconds of each other. This would enable a single vehicle to saturate an area and give an opponent little time to react and try to seek cover. The system needs to be able to engage targets at ranges of at least 5 miles, which is roughly equivalent to the capability of Elbit’s Cardom Recoil Mortar System 6-Light, or RMS-6L, on the existing mortar-carrying Strykers. The required minimum range, including for direct-fire targets, is no more than 220 yards. A prototype of BAE System’s Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, which the Army says would also receive the new mortar turret., BAE Systems Not surprisingly, the Army wants the new weapon to be able to fire all of its existing 120mm ammunition, but it has also left the door option for future developments , which could include precision-guided types . The service is also interested in the mortar having a direct-fire capability, as well as an indirect one, which would require new types of rounds. The most immediate option would be for Elbit, or another firm, to develop a full-enclosed turret and ammunition handling arrangement for the RMS-6L and improve the existing computerized fire control systems. Army crews in the Stryker mortar carrier variant and special operators using versions ground-mounted firing platforms , also known as the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS), can already move their weapons 180 degrees left or right from its existing position in just 12 seconds with the existing system. The Army has also been experimenting with a mobile and highly automated 81mm mortar, known as the Automated Direct Indirect-fire Mortar, or ADIM , which it might be able to scale up to 120mm. This system has proven to be complex and expensive, though, which might push the Army to look at more readily available options if it wants to have something in production within three years. The service requirements actually seem very close to the capabilities already present in Finnish defense contractor Patria’s NEMO – a contraction of “NEw MOrtar.” This is an unmanned turret with a 120mm mortar capable of direct and indirect fire that features an automatic loading system and can fire bursts of three rounds in 12 seconds at targets up to six miles away. It’s a smoothbore weapon, just like the Army’s present 120mm mortars, which means it should be able to fire the same ammunition. Its maximum one-minute rate of fire is 10 rounds, which wouldn’t meet the Army’s requirements, but its sustained rate of fire of seven rounds every 60 seconds would. But it’s definitely a good starting place. NEMO is already in service in various countries on 8×8 wheeled armored vehicles similar to the Stryker and even small boats and demonstrated a shoot-on-the-move capability. https://youtube.com/watch?v=3LfWKfCaIiM In 2016, Patria unveiled a containerized version that could fit on the back of a truck and that troops could emplace as a fixed firing position, a configuration that might make the weapon even more appealing to the Army. Since at least 2015, special operators have been interested in a mobile version of the EMTAS to give that system more flexibility. A truck-mounted NEMO could offer significantly more capability with added mobility for extended operations in remote areas. The Army is also interested in building in additional growth potential into any FIFT system. It wants the turreted mortar to be able to, in some fashion, accommodate loitering munitions, such as the Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) or Single Multi-mission Attack Munition (SMAMS). These are the service’s names for the AeroVironment Switchblade and the Raytheon Coyote , respectively. It’s not clear whether or not the Army is talking about being able to fire these drones from the mortar itself, or if it just wants the FIFT to be able to also mount a separate launcher. Raytheon has already developed a four-tube SMAMS launcher as part of a separate truck-mounted system that the Army plans to use to knock down small unmanned aircraft. Regardless, integrating the loitering munitions could significantly increase the overall capability of the Army’s mortar carriers. Beyond just offering the crew another means of attacking the enemy, the drones could help search for targets or offer additional local surveillance and defense around the firing position. The SMAMS can act as a swarm and could potentially carry electronic warfare systems or other payloads in the future, as well. This could ultimately turn the Army’s mortar carriers into more multi-mission vehicles that could launch non-kinetic attacks or conduct limited surveillance and reconnaissance missions in addition to providing traditional fire support. This sort of self-contained multi-purpose capability could be especially valuable in future expeditionary or distributed missions where relatively small units might find themselves operating for extended periods of time detached from traditional supporting ground, surface, and air assets. This would be a particularly likely scenario in the Pacific region , where ground forces could easily end up conducting operations spread out across a wide area, such as a chain of islands . It’s a capability that could also be attractive not only to special operations forces, but to the U.S. Marine Corps, which focuses heavily on these types of operations and just recently retired its own 120mm mortar system . It is now in the process of exploring other fire support options, including rocket artillery and loitering munitions . So, whether the Army decides to pursue a system based on its existing RMS-6L or chooses a new weapon, such as NEMO, the vehicles carrying these turrets could significantly increase the capabilities of its combat units beyond just giving them access to an improved mortar system.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 8, 2018","Wait, The New York Police Department Has A Spy Plane For Hunting Dirty Bombs?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a year ago, five members of the New York Police Department’s Aviation Unit were so mad at their supervisor they decided to take a specialized surveillance plane worth $4 million on a joy ride, flying a route in the shape of a large penis. The incident is the latest in a series of controversial incidents involving the aircraft, but also highlights another important detail, that New York’s Finest have a federally-funded aerial platform specifically set up to hunt for radiological weapons, or “dirty bombs,” at all. The New York Post was first to report the Aviation Unit’s creative, but unauthorized use of the plane earlier in July 2018. The New York Police Department had obtained the modified Cessna C208B Grand Caravan, which carries the civil registration number N23FH, though a Preparedness Grant, also known as a “Non-Disaster” grant, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 2017. Fox Hotel Holdings of Ronkonkoma, New York, on Long Island, is the actual owner of the plane, according to Federal Aviation Administration’s records. “As some applications may include details regarding public safety (e.g. law enforcement) they are not made publicly available,” FEMA told The War Zone in an Email. “This fixed-wing aircraft is deployed to conduct aerial surveillance and conduct first-response activities for critical infrastructure and key resources.” Flying from MacArthur Airport on Long Island, the plane’s primary mission is searching for radiological hazards. FEMA explained that the Cessna has an unspecified “mobile airborne radiological detection system” that can collect data on baseline radiation readings around the city and spot potential unusual surges in radioactivity. These spikes “may be indicators of manufacturing or transporting radiological weapons,” FEMA noted. One of these weapons, or dirty bombs , would use an explosive charge to spread some type of radioactive material. Though this wouldn’t create a nuclear explosion, it could give anyone unlucky enough to find themselves in the blast area radiation poisoning or otherwise contaminate a large area, at least in theory. To find potentially threatening sources of radiation, the Cessna’s sensors system likely includes some sort of directional radiation sensor to zero in on potential areas of interest, as well as other equipment to take more general reading so help develop baseline radiation “maps” of New York City and surrounding areas. The New York Police Department could then use this information keep an eye out for any significant changes in ambient radiation levels. The Cessna may also carry an air sampling system for further analysis of “hot spots” by personnel after the aircraft lands. The aircraft’s mission systems are also apparently capable of displaying this information in a visual format and the aircraft has a data link that allows the operators to share the information with personnel on the ground. The configuration sounds very similar to the one another C208B, known as Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Collection Technology, or ASPECT , which the Environmental Protection Agency operates with contractor support. This plane, which you can read about in more detail here , also carries a wide-angle mapping camera and an infrared line scanner. If N23FH has a similar set of sensors, it could explain why officials say the aircraft is capable of conducting a variety of secondary surveillance missions. The EPA’s contractor-operated C208B ASPECT aircraft., Airborne Aspect The Department of Energy also operates a Beechcraft King Air aircraft and Bell 412 helicopters similarly outfitted with sensors to take gather baseline radiation data after a nuclear incident to help map the possible spread of radioactivity as part of what it calls the Aerial Measuring System . These fixed and rotary wing aircraft can both transmit that information to a ground station in real time. Typically, the King Air will make an initial survey of an impacted area, according to the Department of Energy’s website . The helicopters would then follow to take more detailed readings, flying as low as 150 feet off the ground. A map of Washington, DC that the Department of Energy created using data from the Aerial Measuring System during a test in 2013., DOE The New York Police Department has declined requests from other outlets for more information about the plane’s activities and the New York Post blurred out the N-number in its latest story sometime after publishing it. It’s also worth noting that the city’s police force had previously operated an unmarked Bell 412EP helicopter with the civil registration N23FH, which also carried specialized surveillance equipment. It’s unclear if they still have that helicopter or not, but, at least in that instance, the “23” in the registration was a reference to the 23 police officers who died on 9/11. Since those infamous terrorist attacks, New York City has, not necessarily surprisingly, been on something of a state of perpetually heightened alert. The New York State National Guard even continues to operate a standing task force, called Joint Task Force-Empire Shield , to provide various on-calls support in the event of any terrorist attack or other major crisis in and around the city. It’s still interesting that the New York Police Department decided to acquire an aircraft focused primarily on monitoring for “dirty bombs.” Experts continue to debate how realistic a threat these types of weapons actually pose and how easy it might be to craft one that would be capable of producing any sort of widespread danger . For the city, this apparently remains enough of a potential threat that, in 2017, officials began an initiative to help medical facilities replace devices with radioactive components in order to prevent the possible theft of hazardous material for an improvised weapon. Individual police officers reportedly carry, or have carried, radiation dosimeters so they can also act as sort of mobile monitors. New York Police Department officers stand guard during a special event., Niall Carson/PA Wire via AP Still, how effective the C208 aircraft is at spotting possible dirty bombs isn’t clear. The officers who flew the plane in the phallus-shaped route – an apparently not unheard of way law enforcement and military aviators express displeasure with their superiors – around the city were specifically upset with how low they had to get to have a chance of collecting useful samples. They felt that this put them at unnecessary risk when trying to scan ships sailing in the waterways around New York City. Their fear was that they would have little chance of gliding or otherwise making it to safety if the Cessna’s single engine gave out at these low altitudes, according to the Post . Based on what we know from the Department of Energy’s Aerial Measuring System, N23H could have to fly very low to be able to gather detailed information that might actually point to the presence of a dirty bomb. This would seem to be a mission better suited to a helicopter-mounted sensor package. Beyond its radiation sniffing mission, the plane has already become some of a lightning rod for other controversies. On July 5, 2018, the New York Post reported that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had used the plane to fly from Canada, where he was on vacation with his family, back to the city for a memorial honoring a member of the force who had died in the line of duty. Then, on July 16, 2018, the Post uncovered that members of the New York Police Department had, in 2017, used the Cessna to travel to Allentown, Pennsylvania for a wake for the mother of then-Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce. City officials have dismissed allegations that they are misusing the plane. “As far as using the plane, we did not see any obstacles. I don’t think there’s going to be pushback from Washington,” New York City Police Commissioner James O’Neill said of de Blasio’s flight specifically on July 10, 2018 . “We didn’t ask for clearance, and I haven’t heard from them.” New York City Police Commissioner James O’Neill, Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA via AP O’Neill thought wrong and FEMA told the Post that it is now looking into whether or not the New York Police Department has violated the terms of the grant. If nothing else, it’s hard to imagine that the joy ride was approved in the agreement. In its Email to The War Zone, FEMA said that it could impose various penalties on the department if they found it had been wasting government money. These punishments could include withholding cash payments until the situation is sorted out, forcing New York City to pay FEMA back what it wasted on the various flights, suspending or terminating the deal entirely, and even blocking the city from getting any new grants in the future. The city already disciplined the individuals involved in the incident with the penis-shaped flight path, so that might be enough for FEMA in that particular case. It remains to be seen how the agency will view the trips that Boyce or de Blasio took in the Cessna. We’ll definitely be keeping our eye out for any another unusual activity from N23FH.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 28, 2019",The Talos Missile Had A Wonderfully Complex Shipboard Assembly Line Of A Launch System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Looking back now, it’s downright amazing what weapons designers were able to accomplish with 1950s technology during the early days of the Cold War. This was a time when the most basic of computers took up a large room or even an entire floor of an office building. Yet with slide rules and protractors, engineers designed remarkably complex and usable weapons that pushed the boundaries of what was even thought possible a handful of years, or even months before. One of those systems was the Navy’s hulking RIM-8 Talos long-range naval surface-to-air missile system. Talos emerged out of the U.S. Navy’s Operation Bumblebee —a protracted endeavor aimed at developing ‘mid-layer’ defensive umbrella (tactically situated between deck guns and carrier-borne aircraft) to protect ships from bombers carrying anti-ship missiles. The initiative was spurred by tough lessons learned in WWII, where Japanese kamikaze and German guided missile attacks haunted military planners. From those experiences, the future of naval combat and the emerging threats that would go along with it seemed alarmingly clear. As did the glaring reality that the WWII era weapons concepts that existed at the time were no match for confronting it. Talos during testing., USN By the mid-1950s, a number of systems resulted from the project—some of which still share ‘DNA’ with weapons currently in the Navy’s current arsenal. The hardest hitting was Bendix’s Talos surface-to-air missile system which would equip the Navy’s heaviest surface combatants. This was truly an ‘atomic age’ missile, capable of packing a big 465 pound conventional warhead or a W30 nuclear warhead with a two to five kiloton yield. The missile was guided semi-actively throughout its entire flight by two separate high-power emitters, the monstrous AN/SPG-49 Tracking Radar and the AN/SPW-2 Guidance Radar that worked to continuously illuminate a path for the missile to travel on as it headed out to its target. All this was coordinated by the then state-of-the-art Mk77 Fire Control System. AN/SPG-49 and AN/SPW-2 radars that provide guidance for Talos seen onboard USS Oklahoma City (CLG-5)., USN After being launched by its solid-rocket booster, a Talos missile was basically a flying ramjet engine that would sustain speeds of around mach 2.7 and reach out between 50 and 100 miles depending on the variant. Talos could also be used for launching tactical nuclear attacks on surface targets by sending the missile into an automated dive at a certain point along its flight path. It wasn’t a pinpoint operation, but it was accurate enough to take out a flotilla of ships or an area target on land. The same warhead could be used to take out formations of enemy bombers. Crazy stuff! Talos was truly a modular design, with three distinct components—missile, booster, and control fins—needing to be mated together and tested before being declared ready to use. The complex and outsized nature of Talos—the missile was 32 feet long and weighed nearly 8,000 pounds when fully configured—meant that it couldn’t be stored in large numbers in a ready-to-use fashion aboard a ship. So a huge, elaborate, and wonderfully automated storage, mating, and launch system was devised in order to make the missile deployable in a naval combat environment. This support system was literally an armored missile assembly line that has to be one of the coolest and quirkiest Cold War naval innovations. Dubbed Mark 7 Mod 0 Guided Missile Launching System, this half a million pound, heavily armored, hangar-like installation used a complex overhead crane, elevator, and “rammer” system to move Talos missile components from storage, along the assembly line, and out onto the launcher’s rails. Taking up two stories, it was primarily separated into three distinct sections. The Mk7 Guided Missile Launch System. , via Okieboat.com The aft-most section, Area 3, was the Missile Magazine and had two levels where Talos missiles and boosters were stowed. A strike-down elevator and crane would move the missiles around in a complex puzzle-like manner. Once a missile was selected, the system would bring it up and place it along one of two tracked carts located on either side of the warehouse-like like magazine. 30 missiles were typically stored in Area 3 during normal operations. The missile would then be rammed through an armored and hydraulically operated hatch and into Area 2, the Ready Service Area. Here sailors would mate a hulking 4,400lb solid rocket booster to a Talos missile, readying it for launch. 14 mated missiles were usually stored in trays within this section at any given time. Once that was done, the rammer would push the missile along its track through another automated armored door and into Area 1, the Test Cell. This section is where sailors installed missile’s control fins and wings—a dozen in all. The missile was transferred from its railed cart to overhead launch rails to do this. The missile was then put through a quick series of diagnostic checks using a computer system before one of two large armored hatches flung open and the rammer would seamlessly push the missile out onto the rails attached to the twin-armed Mk7 launcher turret. Once fire control made sure that there were no ships near the first nine miles of missiles path that could be impacted by its huge booster as it fell away or if the missile failed, the Talos round was sent into the air, roaring and belching smoke as it ascended towards its target. Area 1 also had a number of other duties. For instance, it collected telemetry day on ultraviolet paper of each flight. This tape-like paper had to be exposed by bright light and would continue to pour out of an imprinting system as the missile flew off. Post-flight analysis of this information would prove confirmation that the missile hit its target as advertised or malfunctioned. Oh, and there was the whole warhead storage aspect of all this too. Unmated warheads were stored dozens of feet below Area 1 in their own separate and heavily armored magazine located deep in the keel of the ship. Another elaborate set of cranes and elevators were used to load warheads through a hatch atop of Area 1 and all the way down into the magazine, and to bring the warheads up for fitment on missile rounds as needed. A unique fire suppression system would immediately flood the warhead storage magazine, and drown anyone in it, if a large increase in temperature was detected. How I explained this process was just about as simplified as possible while still being at least somewhat accurate. This was an incredibly complex system that was loaded with intricate processes, many of which are done only at a missile factory today. It also worked in reverse when missiles were taken apart and their components sent back into storage. Luckily, we have this awesome Navy video circa the 1950s that details how the entire system works and showed it in action. Talk about fascinating!: https://youtube.com/watch?v=gpct4CLp9d4 Suffice it to say, this was an incredibly complex system that relied on the best possible technology available at the time. But for sailors working within the launching system, it was dangerous and stressful work. Just having an arm in the path of a Talos as it was forced out onto the launcher or a hand in the wrong place while components were in motion could cause horrific injury. And considering that we are talking about tubes filled with rocket fuel being scurried about in an environment surrounded by 1950s electronics, one spark or other mishaps could lead to a devastating chain of explosions. Because nuclear weapons were stored in the Warhead Magazine and in Area 3 and would traverse the entire set of compartments if need be, security was very tight throughout the Talos handling facility and its spaces were alarmed. Anyone with access to the areas needed a high-security clearance and had to be approved by the ship’s captain. An embarked Marine security contingent monitored access in and out of the areas and a two-man rule was implemented at all times. Firing a nuclear-armed Talos was also far more involved process than firing a conventionally configured missile. If the missiles were ordered into the Area 2 where they would be mated with a booster for quick use during a crisis, a number of safeguards were put in place that would keep them from being launched accidentally or by a saboteur. The cruiser USS Albany (CG-10) seen firing two Talos and one Tartar missile during an exercise in 1963., USN In Area 2, a locked rig was attached to the missile in its tray that would keep it from being loaded onto the missile launcher rails. This could only be unlocked by the ship’s Weapons Officer. A safing plug was also installed that would be detected by the automated Talos diagnostic system and it would not allow it to be moved to the launcher’s rails. A special purple-colored arming plug would have to be put in its place and those were locked in safes in Area 1. Only the captain had the safe combo and it would be conveyed from the bridge to the compartment by the captain in the event that a nuclear launch was ordered. Finally, a large switch-like handle had to be thrown in both Area 1 and in Weapons Control. The one in Weapons Control was locked and could only be unlocked by a key held by the Weapons Officer. Only then could the Talos system proceed with the launch sequence. USN So considering that Talos could start Armageddon, it couldn’t happen without a number of fail-safes being unlocked by multiple people both in the Mark 7 Guided Missile Launching System and in two other command areas on the ship. Maybe what’s most amazing about the Talos Guided Missile Launching System is that it took under a minute to launch a Talos missile once it was moved from Area 2 to Area 1, and interval times decreased after the first salvo was fired (two missiles were used to attack a single airborne). So considering how convoluted, clunky, and manpower intensive it was, the system was remarkably efficient in combat. Talos was truly one of the most intricate combat systems of the era and its huge launching mechanism is just one aspect of its story. But it remains one of the most representative contraptions that captured the unique mix of heavy industrial ingenuity, atomic weaponry, emerging computerized systems, heavy manpower, and the all-American production line mindset that permeated the era. In comparison, today, a missile with similar range and far more capability and reliability comes packed in an ‘all up round’ container and can be launched in an instant from an enclosed vertical launch cell remotely. A human being may not even touch the missile for an entire cruise or even much longer. An all-up round gets loaded in a Mark 41 vertical launch cell aboard an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer., USN This won’t be the last you will hear from me about the Talos systems or its two cousins, Tartar and Terrier, which made up the Navy’s ‘Three Ts’ missile complex from that colorful era.  But there is no better source on the ins and outs of the Tartar system than over at Okieboat.com .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 8, 2019",The Navy Could Need More Than 15 Years and Over $1.5B To Scrap USS Enterprise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report from the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, says that it could cost the Navy more than $1.5 billion to fully dispose of the retired ex-USS Enterprise , a complete process that could take more than 15 years to finish. The watchdog says the service should get at least one independent review of those projected costs and begin keeping studious records, not only to make sure it’s getting the best deal, but to also learn as much as possible from this unprecedented ship breaking effort for when it retires its Nimitz class supercarriers. The Navy officially decommissioned Enterprise , also known by its hull number CVN-65, in February 2017, after more than five decades of service . The ship had already effectively been in mothballs since 2012 and Newport News Shipbuilding completed a lengthy “inactivation” process, which included removing nuclear fuel, mission systems, and other items from the ship, in April 2018 . “At approximately 76,000 tons, CVN-65 will require an unprecedented level of work to dismantle and dispose of as compared to previous ships,” GAO’s review, which the congressional office published publicly on Aug. 2, 2018, said. “Regardless of the approach the Navy chooses, CVN-65 will set precedents for the processes, costs, and oversight that may be used to dismantle and dispose of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the future, such as the Nimitz -class carriers which the Navy will begin to retire in the mid-2020s.” The only ship of her class, Enterprise was also the first ever nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to enter service anywhere in the world. The Navy expects to send the USS Nimitz , the first ship in the class that came after CVN 65, into retirement in 2023, after sometime after the future Ford -class flattop USS John F. Kennedy enters service. There is already considerable debate over this plan, though, and Congress may block the retirement in order to maintain a 12-carrier fleet. Tugs move the USS Enterprise into Newport News Shipbuilding’s yards in 2013., USN How to dispose of the “Big E,” as she was nicknamed, has already been a complicated and arduous affair. The Navy originally projected that it would cost somewhere between $500 and $750 million to scrap it, but by 2013, this figure had grown to over $1 billion. The difficulties have forced the service to push back the start of the process more than once already and the ship’s hulk is presently sitting in Hampton Roads, Virginia. The Navy is now considering two potential options, according to GAO. The first of these is doing the work at a naval shipyard with the help of contractors, while the second would see the service turn the ship over to a private company to break down at their own facility. A basic breakdown of the Navy’s two options for what to do with the ex-Enterprise., GAO Historically, the Navy has done this work at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Bremerton, Washington. When it comes to breaking down nuclear-powered vessels, this facility has the added benefit of being relatively close to the Department of Energy’s Hanford low-level radioactive waste disposal site, which is also in Washington State. This is where the Navy would send the eight de-fueled nuclear reactors and related components from the ex- Enterprise . GAO acknowledged in its review that the Navy had a better sense of the costs and time required to proceed with this plan based on its existing experience. Unfortunately, there are serious concerns that using one of the service’s own overworked shipyards to scrap the supercarrier would only add to an increasingly troubling maintenance backlog for active ships and submarines. An infographic showing how the Navy typically moves decommissioned nuclear reactors from the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Hanford., GAO In September 2017, the watchdog released a separate review highlighting the poor and decaying state of the Navy’s shipyards. The next month is published yet another report specifically on delays in maintenance availabilities for Los Angeles – and Virginia -class attack submarines. At the time of writing, the Los Angeles -class boat USS Boise is still just sitting idle pier side after more than 30 months of inactivity. The Navy only expects the repairs on Boise to begin in 2019 . On Aug. 2, 2018, the service put out a request for information to try and identify commercial shipyards that it could certify for government work or ones that already have that certification, but are not working at full capacity, in order to try and make up for some of these shortfalls. The fear is these shipyard capacity issues could also lead to greater costs if the process drags out. The Navy says the Puget Sound option could cost anywhere from $1.05 to $1.55 billion, take 10 years to complete, and wouldn’t even start until 2034. The other option, then, is to have a contractor, such as Newport News, do the job at one of their facilities. This could shorten the time it takes to break down the former Enterprise to only five years and get the work going in 2024. The issue here is that no government or private shipyard has ever done anything like this on this scale. It could quickly become expensive as contractors begin ripping things apart and find out that their expectations don’t line up with what they’ve discovered waiting for them – something that’s happened before with much smaller, less complicated systems, such as fighter jets . The unique nature of Enterprise ‘s design could make things even more complex. More than two decades after the Navy struck it from the rolls, the bulk of the hull, including the reactor compartments, of the ex- USS Long Beach , another one-off design and the first-ever nuclear-powered cruiser in the world, is still sitting in long-term storage at the Washington State base. A graphic showing how the Navy would plan to break down the ex- Enterprise if it did the work at Puget Sound., GAO And though the Navy has moved reactors and other irradiated materials from Puget Sound to Hanford in the past, the sheer volume of materials associated with eight individual reactor plants will make this effort more akin to decommissioning a nuclear power plant. For a commercial contractor, getting legal and regulatory approval to dismantle the reactors, in particular, could be complicated and limit the available sites where the work could occur. The Navy and the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) already disagree on what standards should apply to the commercial option. The Navy says that if a commercial company does the work, NRC’s should view it through the lens of commercial nuclear regulations. The NRC says that dismantling a naval nuclear reactor is akin to disposing of a nuclear weapon from a regulatory standpoint and that the Navy needs to be responsible for the process and disposing of the waste at a site such as Hanford. Furthermore, NRC only has direct authority over such matters in thirteen states, not including Virginia, where the ex- Enterprise is now. State authorities have entered into agreements with the commission in all other instances to take responsibility for nuclear waste and other related matters and might not be willing to take on the task of overseeing the disposal of eight military-grade reactors. And not mentioned at all is the highly classified nature of U.S. naval nuclear reactor design, the details of which any company would have to guard very closely throughout the process regardless. So, while there might be an understanding of the general approach a commercial company would take to break up the ex- Enterprise , there’s no real understanding of what the process might entail, especially with regards to the nuclear components. For example, GAO said in its report that the Navy, for unknown reasons, estimated that it would cost less to dispose of each of the ship’s nuclear reactors than it typically does to get rid of commercial reactors of a similar size. With so many unknowns, the estimated final cost for the commercial option is a wide range that sits anywhere from $750 million to $1.4 billion. The USS Enterprise in dry dock at Newport News’ yard in 2016 during the inactivation process., Steve Helber/AP “As the Navy considers how to proceed, it will be critical to ensure that there is sufficient oversight and accountability for what likely will be an effort greater than $1 billion that lasts the better part of a decade,” GAO’s reviews wrote in their conclusion. “Without establishing a cost and schedule baseline that has been validated by an independent cost estimate or assessment, it will be difficult for decision makers to track cost and schedule performance or have confidence in CVN 65 costs.” As such, the watchdog recommended that the Navy have the Pentagon’s Office of Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation or the Naval Center for Cost Analysis draw up independent cost analyses of the two potential courses of action. They also said the service should keep and supply details accounting of the projected costs and the money it spends on the project, which it is not presently required to do for disposal programs. In addition, GAO said that the Secretary of Defense needs to demand that the Navy craft a risk management plan no matter what course of action it takes and goes through a formal process to establish a baseline cost and schedule for the entire effort. Without this it would be difficult, if not impossible, to truly evaluate how things go, which could hamper the service’s ability to avoid the same mistakes in the future. The Department of Defense told the congressional office that it agreed with all of these suggestions. It’s also worth noting that how the disposal of Enterprise shakes out could have an impact on how the U.S. government views the costs associated with nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and could impact the growing debate about whether it makes sense to invest in smaller, conventionally-powered types . Since taxpayers will be responsible for the bill, a more accurate estimated lifecycle cost of a nuclear supercarrier should include this $1 billion or more to dispose of it at the end of the day. As it stands now, the Navy hopes to have arrived at a final decision on what to do with the remnants of the Enterprise by 2023. We might not have to wait long to start seeing hints of which course of action the service truly prefers. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 10, 2019","Russia Can’t Afford Its New T-14 Armata Tanks, Turns To Updated Older Designs Instead","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than three years after Russia’s T-14 Armata tank made its widely touted and much scrutinized public debut, the country has made it clear it has no plans at present to buy more than 100 of them. The design’s ballooning cost has forced the Kremlin to focus its efforts on upgrading its T-72 , T-80, and T-90 tanks , instead. In 2015, Oleg Sienko, then-Chief Executive Officer of Uralvagonzavod, or UVZ, the T-14’s state-owned manufacturer and Russia’s largest producer of tanks, had said that he expected the Kremlin to order as many as 2,300 Armatas by 2020. The first examples made their initial public appearance ahead of the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow that year and one suffered an embarrassing break down during a rehearsal. The Russian government’s planned purchases of the type have steadily shrunk since then. “We don’t really need to for this, these models are quite expensive in relation to existing ones,” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov explained to reporters to reporters on July 30, 2018. “Well, why flood the all Armed Forces with the Armata tanks, we have the T-72s in great demand in the market, they take it all, compared to the Abrams , Leclercs and Leopards , for their price, efficiency, and quality.” The Russian T-14 Armata tank., Iliya Pitalev/Sputnik via AP Russia’s decision on the T-14 is hardly surprising and one that we at The War Zone , among many others , have long suspected would occur. Even in 2015, there were reports that the Armata’s unit cost was more than double that of UVZ’s original estimates. Since then, a combination of international sanctions and a sluggish domestic economy have forced the Kremlin to make cuts to their defense budget overall. Competing priorities and limited funds have already led the Russian government to put plans for new destroyers and carriers on hold and cancel two intercontinental ballistic missile programs , among a number of potentially painful decisions . “Having a military budget ten times smaller than that of NATO, we are achieving our objectives due to such efficient solutions,” Deputy Prime Minister Borisov noted in his comments, clearly trying to put a positive spin on the Armata news. In May 2018, the Kremlin had announced a new round of budget cuts, slashing annual defense spending by almost 20 percent from the previous year. But there is also a possibility that these shortfalls have limited the resources to properly develop the T-14, as well. If the design is not mature, it would only make sense for Russia to decide to hold off mass producing the tanks. Otherwise, it could find itself face a “ concurrency ” dilemma by taking delivery of hundreds of armored vehicles that could need potentially significant and costly upgrades almost immediately. “We can … boost the series production [of the T-14] when needed and stay ahead of our colleagues, so to speak,” Deputy Prime Minister Borisov had claimed in 2017 . He also described this as a “trump card” Russia cold play at any time. These comments are virtually identical to ones he has made regarding the decision to push off large orders of the Su-57 stealth fighter indefinitely. The entire situation seems similar, with the Kremlin having initially expected to have hundreds of the jets in service by 2020 and various developmental and economic troubles instead having left the program in a precarious state. There could similarly have been difficulties in finding the funding to fully establish the Armata production line to handle higher volume. The tank represents a dramatic departure from decades of Soviet-era tank design that had continued in Russia after the end of the Cold War and it’s not clear how much, if anything, it shares with UVZ’s older product lines, which are still churning out. Most notably, the T-14’s crew of three rides side-by-side in the hull, controlling the main turret remotely and using an array of cameras mounted around the vehicle to “see” in all directions while safely sitting inside the armored shell. Combined with improved passive armor and an active protection system , Russia claimed that the T-14 was unique survivable compared to existing designs. The video below offers a look inside the crew compartment on the T-14. Aramata also reportedly has a number of other more advanced sensors, communications, and fire control systems compared to earlier Russian designs, but there is still a healthy debate about just how advanced and capable it actually is in its present form. For one, the vehicle shares its main armament, the 125mm 2A82-1M gun, with the T-90M and plans for a larger or more capable weapon have repeatedly failed to materialize . The Russians may be able to leverage some components or other experience from the Aramata program and apply it to upgrades for their latest T-72B3 , T-80BVM , and T-90SM tanks in the meantime, as well. The T-90SM, for instance, features a remote weapon station with a 12.7mm machine gun on top of the turret, which allows the crew to engage close-in and otherwise more limited targets in any direction from within the safety of the vehicle. A T-90SM tank with the remote weapon station., Aleksey Kitaev via Wikimedia These updated tanks all feature roughly the same armor package, too, featuring a combination of passive armor and explosive reactive armor around most of the hull and turret and slat armor on the rear engine deck. The latter two systems are particularly useful for defeating the shaped-charge warheads, which need to detonate a certain distance from a vehicle’s hull to be most effective and are common on anti-tank guided missiles and shoulder-fired infantry anti-tank rockets . You can read more about these armor systems here and here . There are also plans to add additional active protection systems and passive defenses to the vehicles to further protect against these the missile and rocket threat. Russia has been able to observe how dangerous those weapons can be from its own experiences in Syria and from those of its Syrian allies . Ukraine is in the process of receiving American-made Javelin anti-tank missiles , too, which it could use to take on separatists using Russian-made tanks . There are still reports that actual Russian personnel , or shadowy Kremlin-linked mercenaries , may be operating some of those vehicles. All told, it would seem sensible to focus on these more cost-effective upgrade programs in the near term. In addition to helping modernize Russia’s own forces, the T-72 and T-90 series serve in dozens of countries around the world and continue to enjoy export success . A Russian T-73B3 tank., Vitaly Kuzmin At the same time, the small fleet of Armatas as a test and evaluation force that could support future developments. The one or two independent battalion-size “brigades” that will likely receive the vehicles could also deploy as a small “silver bullet” type force during a serious crisis. Still, the updating of older vehicles might point to concerns about Armata’s viability in the mid-to-long term. The decision to overhaul the T-80s, in particular, has been a curious development that could suggest the Russian military is scrambling to find other ways to modernize its tank fleets in lieu of procuring the T-14 en masse. The Kremlin had planned to retire all of its remaining T-80s by 2015 , but decided to put them through a deep overhaul and upgrade two years later. The vehicles, which appear similar to the T-72 and its successor the T-90, are a distinct design that the Soviets originally built at a plant in Ukraine. Based on the T-64 and featuring a gas turbine engine like the American M1 Abrams , the design turned out to be substantially more complex and maintenance intensive than the traditional diesel-powered T-72. Ukraine went so far as to refit its T-80s with diesel-engines, a decision that carried over to its improved T-84 design . T-80s and their derivatives have not seen nearly as much use in Russia, or elsewhere, compared to the T-72 family. As of 2016, the Russian Army had nearly 2,000 T-72s and 350 T-90s in service, but only 450 T-80s, according to the International Institute for Security Studies’ The Military Balance for that year. A Russian T-80BMV tank., Andrey Luzik via wikimedia The Russians would have had to have made a very conscious decision to refurbish this relatively small number of logistically demanding and fuel-hungry vehicles rather than devote those resources to other projects, including just pulling more T-72s out of storage and rebuilding them to the capable T-72B3 standard . Another factor, in this case, could have been that the gas turbine-powered T-80s perform better in cold weather climates and could be more suitable for Russia’s dramatically expanding plans for militarizing the Arctic Region. As with the Su-57, by the time Russia might decide to pursue mass production of the T-14, or even have the resources to do so, the situation may have changed, as well. It seems likely that UVZ is continuing to mature the design and could use it as a springboard to a further advanced tank concept. The Kremlin’s abortive work on the Black Eagle and T-95 designs in the 1990s and 2000s similarly helped pave the way for the Armata. It’s not hard to imagine that there might be yet another new Russian tank that everyone will be talking about in another five to seven years. In the meantime, the Kremlin looks set to continue squeezing the very most capability possible out of its venerable Cold War-era types.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 11, 2018",Iran To Practice Blockading Strait Of Hormuz As Saudis Say Mandeb Strait Is No Longer Safe,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , or IRGC, is reportedly preparing for a major naval exercise involving dozens of small boats to demonstrate its ability to close off the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz , which separates the Persian Gulf from the Gulf of Oman, to international shipping with mines and other hazards . The snap drill follows a new surge in tensions between the United States and Iran and comes amid efforts on the part of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen to block the equally vital Bab Al Mandeb Strait linking the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. Reports of the impending exercise first began to emerge on Aug. 1, 2018. Though the drill in of itself is not unusual, the timing is, with the annual event typically occurring later in the year. There are also indications from various outlets, including Fox and CNN , citing unnamed sources, that this year’s iteration will be larger than normal, featuring over 100 watercraft of various descriptions. “We will make the enemy understand that either everyone can use the Strait of Hormuz or no one,” the IRGC’s commander Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari said on July 5, 2018 . The powerful quasi-military organization has hundreds of small boats and semi-submersibles and often works with the regular Iranian Navy’s midget submarines . Any of these boats could lay mines and otherwise harass both civilian maritime activities and foreign military operations in and around the Strait. “The Americans have claimed they want to completely stop Iran’s oil exports,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also said in July 2018 before making what could be considered to be his own veiled threat . “They don’t understand the meaning of this statement because it has no meaning for Iranian oil not to be exported while the region’s oil is exported.” A map showing the Strait of Hormuz, the main neck of which is seen between the marker for Bandar Abbas in Iran and Ras Al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates., Google Maps Rouhani made those comments while in Switzerland trying to maintain support for the international deal over his country’s controversial nuclear program. In May 2018, the U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration withdrew the United States from the agreement and pledged to re-enact various sanctions against Iran, including efforts to block its oil exports. Subsequent comments from Rouhani prompted a fiery tirade from Trump on Twitter. The U.S. military has made it clear that it, along with its regional partners, will take steps necessary to keep the Strait open in the event Iran decides to follow through on its threats. “We are aware of the increase in Iranian naval operations within the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of Oman,” Captain William Urban, the chief spokesman for U.S. Central Command, which oversees all American operations in the region, told CNN on Aug. 1, 2018. “We are monitoring it closely, and will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways.” Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz repeatedly in the past and the threat is well understood at this point. In January 2018, the IRGC held another exercise in the region that also coincided with heightened rhetoric between Iranian officials and their U.S. counterparts. Over the years, the U.S. military has positioned various mine hunting and sweeping assets in the region , including one of its new Expeditionary Sea Base the USS Lewis B. Puller , and has been working with its allies to mitigate the impact of any potential incident as a result of these standing threats. But these latest drills continue to demonstrate just how quickly Iran could decide to act upon these threats if it decided to and how hard it might be to respond quickly enough to prevent them from laying hundreds of mines or otherwise making the Strait unnavigable. Even if no further fighting erupted, clearing the mines could take weeks or months. A look at the various vessels available to the Iranian Navy, in the green section, and the IRGC’s naval units, in the red area., USN With approximately 20 percent of the world’s oil exports heading to their destinations via the Strait of Hormuz, if it were to end up closed for any appreciable amount of time it could have serious global economic repercussions. The waterway also serves as a pathway for nearly 90 percent of the region’s overall energy exports, including natural gas, which could make it particularly devastating for Iran’s regional opponents such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And this is exactly the point from Iran’s perspective. More worrisome, Iran may be in the process of something of a “dry run” in the Bab Al Mandeb Strait on the other side of the Arabian Peninsula or is otherwise using that zone to explore just what it can do directly and indirectly to impede international maritime traffic. On July 26, 2018, Saudi Arabia announced it had halted oil shipments through that equally constrained waterway after a pair of attacks on its oil tankers, which Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for afterward. A map showing the Bab Al Mandeb Strait, which is narrowest near the border of Djibouti and Eritrea to its north on the western shore and Yemen on the other side., Google Maps The raiders damaged one ship, the Arsan , but caused no casualties. This is not the first time the Houthis have targeted commercial shipping , either. Still, these latest attacks do represent a significant escalation in the Iranian-backed fighters push to attack Saudi economic interests , as well as naval vessels belonging to that country and its allies . It can be hard to verify the exact nature of Houthi attacks in the area and it is possible there have been other, unreported attacks, as well. Subsequent reports suggested an Iranian-flagged cargo ship might also be actively supporting the Houthi naval activities, but it is also possible that this ship, the M/V Saviz, has been helping smuggle weapons to the group or otherwise gathering intelligence on their behalf. The Saudi Arabian-led coalition has been engrossed in a grueling and controversial fight with the Yemeni faction since 2015. The United States has been supporting these operations and has found itself drawn into the conflict on multiple occasions . Iran has supplied the insurgents with a variety of weapons and provided additional support to aid their own local production. The United States and other countries have provided evidence that the two parties are actively cooperating on suicide drones , remote-control explosive-laden boats , improvised naval mines , surface-to-air missiles , and ballistic missiles . An asymmetric Iranian or Iranian-backed “blockade” of both the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab Al Mandeb Strait simultaneously would represent something of a nightmare scenario for the United States and its partners in the region. It’s a situation we at The War Zone have been warning about for years , too. Naval countermine operations are complicated and dangerous to begin with and its easy to see how this kind of hostile action could quickly escalate into a larger skirmish. Even if the parties manage to avoid an immediate, larger conflict over the issue, American and other forces sweeping the hazards away would face the ever-present threat of Iranian small boat swarms , shore-based anti-ship cruise missiles , and ballistic missiles that could be carrying weapons of mass destruction , among other dangers . This would be something U.S. commanders would have to take into account and could slow down operations. The video below shows scenes from the IRGC’s “Great Prophet IX” exercise in 2015, which involved simulated swarming boat attacks and anti-ship missile strikes on a mock aircraft carrier . https://youtube.com/watch?v=CkbS4BQxTgg And there is a definite possibility of a larger conflict, especially if Iran or its allies were to step up their activities in the Bab Al Mandeb Strait, which handles all sorts of international shipping. On July 27, 2018, CNN reported , citing unnamed U.S. officials, that there were discussions about potential military options to the increasing Houthi attacks between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The suggestion was that the U.S. military could extend its support for the Saudi-led coalition into the maritime domain, potentially helping provide intelligence information on rebel naval activities, which could then lead to air or other strikes . The officials stressed that, in keeping with the current American policy regarding the conflict in Yemen, the United States would not be engaged in direct action against the Houthis. Given the international nature of the Strait, it is possible that the United States and the Saudis could build a maritime coalition of sorts to protect commercial shipping, similar to the multi-national forces the U.S. government and its allies set up to fight piracy off the coast of Somalia. Israel, for one, has already threatened to respond if the situation there becomes any more dangerous as part of such a notional force. The Royal Saudi Arabian Navy’s Al Riyadh -class frigate Al Makkah ., Jacques Lahitte via Wikimedia “If Iran will try to block the straits of Bab al-Mandeb, I am certain that it will find itself confronting an international coalition that will be determined to prevent this, and this coalition will also include all of Israel’s military branches,” Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Aug. 1, 2018 . He also alluded to direct threats from either Iran or the Houthis toward Israeli shipping, but gave no specific details. Netanyahu and his administration have repeatedly stated their intent to block Iran’s ability to expand its influence in the Middle East and Beyond , by military force if necessary. Israel has been particularly active in this regard in Syria, conducting regular strikes against Iranian interests . It’s worth noting, as well, that, between 1987 and 1988, the United States conducted an extended military campaign against Iranian naval assets to protect its own maritime commercial interests during the Tanker War side-show to the Iran-Iraq War. However, this was a relatively low-level affair on both sides and doesn’t necessarily reflect what might occur if the United State and Iran were to find themselves in the midst of a larger, more sustained fight. The Iranian oil platform Rostam burns after US destroyers attacked it in 1987, Iran has used the structure as a launching pad for small boat attacks and mining operations., USN Iran’s military was also heavily focused on its brutal war with Iraq at the time. In any new conflict over the Strait of Hormuz, the Iranians might be able to commit many more resources into challenging the Americans and their allies. Iranian authorities might also be less inclined to back down, even in the face of sanctions or punitive military actions. Iran’s president Rouhani, a political moderate by Iran’s standards, has increasingly found himself embattled at home over a number of different policies and could see a conflict of any kind with the United States or the country’s regional rivals as a way to distract from domestic issues or win over the support of more hard-line elements in the country. His rhetoric in Switzerland in July 2018 seemed more in line with his country’s most conservative elements than his statements had been in the past. The region is definitely no stranger to complex, intertwined political disputes in general. Saudi Arabia and a number of its allies have been engaged in a notably protracted diplomatic spat with Qatar, which juts out into the Persian Gulf, over that country’s ties with Iran, which could make forming a unified front against Iranian maritime actions more difficult. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani., Sergey Guneev/Sputnik via AP There are also increasing concerns that Trump and his administration might decide to take military action against Iran’s nuclear infrastructure preemptively, which could touch off a larger conflict, as well. The upcoming exercise will also demonstrate Iran’s ability to close off the Strait of Hormuz and potentially the Bab Al Mandeb straight in retaliation for any such strike. Of course, Iran has a variety of options at its disposal if it finds itself in an all-out war against the United States, including ballistic missile barrages against countries in the region, enabling proxies to conduct spectacular acts of terrorism, or even widespread cyber attacks . It’s not clear, though, if Iran’s latest threats will turn out to be anything more than bluster, as they have in the past. For all the talk of how closing the Strait of Hormuz could hurt the Saudis or other Arab oil and gas producers, Iran’s oil heads out to the world the same way and despite American efforts to curtail these exports, other countries are still buying it . And Iran would almost certainly face widespread international condemnation for attacking civilian shipping in international waters, an act that would violate any number of international agreements and basic norms . This seems incongruous with the country’s present effort to try and work with partners in Europe and elsewhere to try and paint the United States as solely responsible for the possible complete collapse of the Iran Deal and lessen the impact of any unilateral American sanctions. Tugs move a tanker carrying Iranian crude oil into position at the Port of Zhoushan in China’s Zhejiang province in March 2018., Imaginechina via AP Images It would also feed into domestic discontent in Iran over the country’s adventurism. Some critics and protesters have already called out the regime in Tehran over its costly support for Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and other regional proxies, such as the Houthis and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , rather than focusing those resources at home. There are similarly very real questions about whether the IRGC can effectively mount any sort of large-scale operation when it is itself so heavily engaged and has suffered significant losses in Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. It has also come under pressure from Rouhani in the past as the Iranian president has tried to curtail the group’s parallel authority. This could help explain the sudden decrease in instances where Iranian boats have harassed American naval vessels in the Persian Gulf and the uptick in the use of drones, which require less manpower, to do the same . On July 31, 2018, U.S. President Trump did offer to meet with Rouhani and other Iranian officials without preconditions, which has created the potential for even more diplomatic wrangling , even though the Iranian president rejected the offer and senior American officials walked back the idea almost immediately. Of course, Rouhani’s quick dismissal of the offer could also be a signal that he feels he has too little domestic political capital to spend on negotiations with the United States or room back down from his hardline position, or simply that he no interest in doing so at present. But none of this changes the fact that the Iranians continue to present very real threats to normal maritime operations in the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab Al Mandeb Strait. The up-coming IRGC exercise seems determined to prove that it can still do so at will, regardless of any attempts by Rouhani to engage with the United States or other members of the international community to reduce tensions.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 12, 2018",Navy’s Old Harpoon Anti-Ship Missile To Get New Tricks After Scoring Six For Six At RIMPAC,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It may be over four decades after it initially entered service, but the U/R/AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missile still is no slouch and for what it may lack in cutting-edge features, it seems to make up for in raw reliability. Additionally, even after all this time and a number of increasingly capable variants being fielded, the Harpoon still has more capacity left for enhancements. In fact, Congress has just approved tens of millions of dollars in funds to upgrade a number of these weapons that are already in the U.S. Navy’s inventory. During the U.S. Navy’s giant Rim of The Pacific (RIMPAC) international naval exercises, which occurs every other year off the coast of Hawaii, six Harpoons of various sub-types were fired off at targets, which include two decommissioned warships, the ex- USS Racine and the ex- USS McKlusky . These six missiles were fired from U.S. and Australian P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft in the air, from the Singaporean frigate RSS Tenacious on the ocean’s surface, and from an American Los Angeles class fast attack submarine from below the waves. Out of the six missiles fired, every one of them worked just as advertised, resulting in an awesome showing for Boeing’s supposedly near-obsolete anti-ship missile. The firing from USS Olympia was particularly interesting as it was the first time an American submarine had been equipped yet alone fired a Harpoon in over two decades. We talked all about this special and somewhat peculiar event in this past article . Some 30 allies, along with the U.S. Navy continue to field Harpoon in various forms, so it’s not as if the missile is going anywhere anytime soon. But with the new upgrade package, dubbed the Block II+, it will feature at least some of the key capabilities of the latest anti-ship missiles that are now becoming the darlings of well-financed western navies, including the United State’s own seagoing force. These upgrades include the internationally exported Block II’s GPS receiver and flight control system that will help the missile navigate its way to its target more precisely even in complex littoral environments and a two-way data-link (Strike Common Weapon Data-Link) to that allows the missile to be retargeted mid-flight. USS Gettysburg (CG-64) firing off an RGM-84 Harpoon during a training exercise. , USN Boeing also stresses that the Block II+ is ‘all weather’ and its performance is not degraded by rain. This is clearly in reference to other seeker arrangements that may have trouble prosecuting maritime targets when there is sizeable precipitation—which is very common in the maritime combat environment. They are probably referencing the imaging infrared seekers found on anti-ship capable missiles like the Tactical Tomahawk Block IV , Naval Strike Missile , LRASM , and many of the newest batch of high-end anti-ship missiles. The Harpoon uses an active radar seeker to detect its target once in the target area and to make its terminal attack run. https://youtube.com/watch?v=FOG0nw0z4E8 Although the Harpoon lacks high speed or low-observability like the most advanced anti-ship missiles that are on the market around the world today, the Block II+ offers a logical set of features balanced against cost and risk that still combine to form a formidable threat to potential maritime foes. And above all else, when it comes to anti-ship missiles, quantity has a quality all its own. Firing multiple missiles at a single target can go a long way when it comes to overcoming a ship’s point defenses , especially in all but the highest-end combat situations. And for those situations, the Navy is developing other, longer-range and more survivable options to layer into its combat doctrine as well. Just the fact that the Harpoon uses active radar homing is reason enough for it to exist alongside its new, high-end, imaging-infrared guided anti-ship missile competitors. AGM-84 Harpoon being launched by an Australian P-8 Poseidon during RIMPAC 2018 SINKEX., Australian MoD It’s also worth mentioning that when it comes to anti-surface warfare operations, presence is key above all else. Harpoon is out there in force already, and you can’t shoot at the bad guy with powerpoint presentation or a missile development program. Considering the Harpoons to be upgraded are already bought and paid for—nearly 8,000 have been delivered in total over the life of the program—enhancing them seems logical. According to 2019 budget documents, each Harpoon Block II+ upgrade kit runs about $240,000. This is not big dollars when it comes to modern cruise missile prices. Under the latest budget just passed by the Senate, the Navy would seem to be set to receive roughly double the number of upgrade kits it had requested, or around 100 missiles and other associated items, worth roughly $26.5M in total. This seems quite reasonable considering the capability being gained. US Budget Document As for the possibility of returning the Harpoon to America’s fast attack submarine fleet, that is a very real possibility. USNI News’s Megan Eckstein did an awesome write-up on this possibility. In it she quoted Commander of U.S. Pacific Fleet’s Submarine Force Rear Admiral Daryl Caudle as stating the following: “We thought we could get by with our heavyweight torpedo, our advanced capability (ADCAP) Mk 48 torpedo, because we thought the predominant threat at the time when that decision was made was submarines, instead of needing the standoff distance of an anti-ship cruise missile. We took those missiles and, like we do so well in our Navy, we shelved them and thought we may need to bring them back. Today’s highly capable navies and adversary countries, the competitive countries we’re in great power competition with, have extremely good surface ships with very capable missile systems themselves. So to be able to actually improve our lethality at ranges much greater than the Mk 48 torpedo, we want to actually bring back an anti-ship cruise missile. … The way to bring back that in a phased way was to basically go to our Naval Undersea Warfare Center, NUWC, and have them reconstitute the capability, to build the software necessary to use our existing combat control system and talk to that Harpoon cruise missile. Olympia was chosen because we knew she was going to be part of RIMPAC. … We decided to shoot for the 2018 RIMPAC to test the Harpoon cruise missile system again. So this has been at least a year in the making. The folks doing the software coding were working hard up in Newport to get that system built, that coding built. The guys onboard the squadron here, Submarine Squadron 7 that owns the Oly ( Olympia ), working hard on that ship to practice the tactics, techniques and procedures to shoot the Harpoon; had to bring those back out of the mothballs as well to actually know the language that we speak to prepare for firing and actually shooting the weapon. So had to dust those procedures off.” Rear Admiral Daryl Caudle, USN The admiral continued, describing just how well the shoot went for Olympia , which had two Harpoons loaded, one being a backup: “Got in position on the range at PMRF (Pacific Missile Range Facility), which is over off of Kauai. We thought we were going to have to shoot second, and as luck turned out and I was very thrilled, the Air Force mission which was to shoot a LRASM, a long-range anti-ship missile, they got delayed, so we got to shoot first. We shot the Harpoon perfectly, went into cruise and hit the ex- Racine , which is an LST, dead center. … The beautiful part of this is, the Oly was not expected to shoot the torpedo too. They had been scheduled for the next hulk (decommissioned ship) to shoot the Mk 48, but the way that things unfold in the real world, the shooters changed that day, so Oly got tasked about mid-day to go and actually shoot an ADCAP also. … So we got to move into position and actually then shoot the heavyweight torpedo. That torpedo, again, a warshot, worked perfectly, went out there and did its job and honed in on the Racine , broke its keel, and a couple hours later it was on the bottom. Our torpedo is an extraordinary weapon, it really is. So the interesting part is, you can see kind of almost a tactic there that I think is important that we got to practice just by happenstance: shooting a long-range shot and then move in for the close-range shot. … No question… From my perspective, it worked flawlessly.” There’s a lot of interesting information in here, but one tangental fact worth mentioning is apparently Lockheed’s stealthy and very smart LRASM , was also fired, or was supposed to be fired during, during the first SINKEX drill. This hadn’t been disclosed prior to this interview, at least to our knowledge. A UGM-84D being loaded onto Olympia before the SINKEX exercise. , USN After the Harpoon’s great success at RIMPAC, and Olympia’s live-fire in particular, the Navy brass in Washington, D.C. will have to decide if they want to place Harpoon back aboard its fast attack submarines. But considering the fact that the Navy wants its submarine force to get back into the anti-ship missile firing game, and in a very high-end and exotic fashion via its secretive Sea Dragon program , the Harpoon could be the perfect lower-end capability in a flexible high-low capability mix of submarine-launched anti-ship missile capabilities. And seeing as it is an off-the-shelf and proven solution, it almost seems too glaringly logical for the Navy brass shoot-down. Boeing has also developed a new extended-range variant of the Harpoon, the Harpoon Block II+ ER, which features the same Block II+ capabilities but with double the weapon’s current range of around 80 miles. This missile features a lighter warhead—300lbs instead of 500lbs—and other alternations to provide far greater reach. Harpoon Block II+ ER in testing., USN The Navy passed over the Harpoon Block II+ ER for the Naval Strike Missile recently as part of an initiative to outfit its Littoral Combat Ships and future frigate, the FFG(X) , with an over-the-horizon anti-ship cruise missile, but Boeing is continuing with the type’s development and is marketing it abroad . Also, the Army still hasn’t decided what anti-ship missile it will buy, and this latest Harpoon variant could be a contender. So there you have it, the Harpoon anti-ship cruise missile, still going strong as it enters its fifth decade of front-line service.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 23, 2019",Army Reboots Plans To Buy Concealable 9mm Submachine Gun For VIP Protection,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has restarted a program to evaluate various 9mm submachine guns just weeks after canceling it to reexamine the requirements. The service says it could end up ordering as many as 1,000 of these “Sub Compact Weapons,” or SCWs, to give personal security details extra firepower they can carry concealed when they guard senior officials in high-risk areas. On July 26, 2018, the Army’s Product Manager for Individual Weapons office at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey re-announced the SCW project and stated it had plans to award contracts to up to six potential contractors. Any firm the Army selects will have to submit 15 examples of their weapon for evaluation, along with three suppressors, various magazines, any necessary special tools, and spare parts. The service had first gone looking for suitable weapons in May 2018, but scrapped those plans earlier in July 2018 to reassess its needs. “The Secretary of the Army and/or the Chief of Staff approves senior commanders and key personnel as High Risk Personnel (HRP),” the contracting notice officials at Picatinny posted on FedBizOpps explained. “HRPs are authorized a Personal Security Detail (PSD), which are assigned to guard against outlined threats.” The Army has determined that those personnel have a need for a weapon that is more capable than their standard sidearms, but that can still be concealed and otherwise more handy than a traditional rifle or carbine. It is unclear whether PSDs are typically equipped with the Beretta M9 or the compact Sig Sauer M11 pistols at present or if they’re in line to get either the newer full size M17 or smaller M18 Modular Handgun System pistols , also Sig products, in addition to the SCWs. The Army also has a number of Heckler and Koch MP5 and MP5K submachine guns in inventory, but is unclear whether these are worn out or are not readily available enough to troops in the field to meet present demands. A US Army soldier carries an MP5K submachine gun while working a personal security detail in Iraq in 2008., US Army The service did not cite any particular incidents or potential threats that have driven demand for such a gun, though an Afghan Army soldier did murder a member of the U.S. Army working a personal security detail, and wounded two others, on July 7, 2018. At the time of writing, the public affairs office at Picatinny Arsenal has not yet responded to a query for additional information on the SCW program. The latest requirements call for a submachine gun firing the NATO standard 9x19mm round that has a barrel length of five and a half inches or shorter, weighs seven pounds or less, and is 15 inches long or less overall with a telescoping stock in its collapsed position and without a sound suppressor attached. With a clear eye to very close-quarters situations, an average operator has to be able to reliably put four out of every five rounds within a four-inch circle at a range of fewer than 40 yards and have relatively low recoil to help the shooter keep on target. The bulk of the Army’s requirements for the SCW., US Army The pistol-caliber submachine gun as a category of weapon has appeared increasingly obsolete in both military and law enforcement use. These weapons have had increasingly limited utility at even moderate ranges and against targets behind cover or wearing any kind of body armor. The concealability requirement that seems to have pushed the Army toward sticking with a gun firing the 9x19mm round rather than looking into a subcompact rifle and specialized cartridge, such as increasingly popular .300 Blackout, which you can read about in more detail here . Even Sig Sauer’s tiny MCX Rattler, which U.S. special operations forces are evaluating separately, is still almost 20 inches long in some configurations . There are, however, other weapons that typically fall into a category referred to as personal defense weapons that use more specialized ammunition that is more capable of defeating targets wearing body armor or behind other barriers and would still fit the Army’s other SCW requirements. These guns are already in service in the U.S. military and elsewhere in U.S. military, with SEAL Team Six reportedly has a number of Heckler and Koch MP7s in 4.7mm, while the US Secret Service uses 5.7mm FN P90s . A member of the US Army fires a German soldier’s MP7 personal defense weapon during an exchange event in Afghanistan., US Army A 9x19mm weapon would ease any logistics strain of having to keep supplies of these more exotic rounds on hand and the service Army has stipulated that the guns be able to use existing standard 9mm ammunition. At the same time, though, this means the primary advantages of the SCW over existing pistols will be a higher rate of fire and greater ammunition capacity rather than improved terminal effectiveness. With this in mind, they might be able to further increase the SCW’s lethality, at least to some degree, by issuing the new XM1153 hollow point cartridge it has adopted along with the Modular Handgun System pistols to troops receiving SCWs. Significant legal questions remain about how and when troops might be able to use those rounds in combat, though, which you can read about in more detail here . At the close ranges in question, even regular 9mm rounds may be sufficiently lethal for the Army’s needs. Modular Handgun System pistol magazines loaded with XM1153 hollow point rounds during a test., US Army Regardless, the Army’s demands are still relatively broad. When the service had first called for submissions in May 2018, it had subsequently handed out deals to more than a dozen companies, worth over $260,000 in total. The Army has since canceled all of those contracts. The new requirement that the weapon has to have a collapsing stock rather than a side-folding one immediately boots at least 4 of the original competing designs – Beretta’s PMX , B&T’s MP9 , CZ’s Scorpion EVO 3A1 , and Heckler and Koch’s UMP9 – out of the running for the revised SCW program. The remaining contenders largely fall into two basic categories. The first is guns derived in full or in part from Heckler and Koch’s iconic MP5 submachine gun . Heckler and Koch’s own super compact MP5K version featured a side-folding stock, but the standard sliding collapsible stock for the full-size guns will work with an adapter. Third parties have since developed even shorter stock options that will work with various types of MP5s, too. Full-size MP5s with the standard sliding stock., HKparts.net Another one of the previous entrants with MP5-based designs, Zenith Firearms , offers its a collapsible stock option similar to the one found on the Army’s standard M4 carbine. Unfortunately, it also produces these weapons in cooperation with Turkish firm MKEK , which could make that choice politically complicated given strained U.S.-Turkey relations . Beyond buying more MP5s, there are 9x19mm derivatives of the AR-15/M16 rifle platform the Army could choose from. Any one of these designs that otherwise meets the Army’s demands might prove attractive depending on how many parts it shares with the service’s existing M4 carbines, which could help reduce any logistical complications from fielding the SCW. These weapons have been and may still be in limited service within the U.S. government, as well. There are two other guns from the original group of contenders that are more unique, the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 Micro and the Sig Sauer MPX . The Czech EVO 3 Micro is a distinct design and has a collapsible stock unlike the folding type found on the larger EVO 3A1. Sig’s MPX series is derived from the AR-15/M16 pattern, but is not a straight conversion of a rifle-caliber version. The Scorpion EVO series is already in service in various numbers with military and police services around the world, including with Afghan commandos , which the Army could see as a vote of confidence in the design. Afghanistan, where the threat of “ insider attacks ” on American troops in close quarters by insurgents posing as security forces personnel or government personnel upset at U.S.-backed coalition remains high, is almost certainly one of the theaters of operations where troops working personal security details were clamoring for something like the SCW in the first place. A Scorpion EVO Micro with a collapsible “arm brace” that CZ could substitute for a true shoulder stock., CZ-USA The MPX is also likely to be a front-runner due to the increasing popularity of both that weapon and its rifle-caliber cousin the MCX. Earlier in July 2018, the Army also hired the company to deliver a host of weapons, including the MPX, as part of a bulk purchase for American special operators , other unnamed U.S. government agencies, and unspecified foreign allies . Of course, given that the Army was willing to consider 13 different designs initially suggests that it won’t hesitate to fully explore all of its options. If the service awards the maximum six deals for prototypes, this could still include the EVO Micro, MPX, and multiple examples of the MP5- or AR-15/M16-based types. The Sig Sauer MPX K submachine gun would seem to be ideally suited to the Army’s requirements., Sig Sauer Based on the schedule the Army has outlined now, the service could begin testing the guns within weeks and expects to have secured the full initial batch of 350 SCWs within five to seven months of picking a winning design. It could then decide to order up to 1,000 examples in subsequent batches of no more than 350. So, as early as the spring of 2019, Army troops may be protecting VIPs in conflict zones and other high-risk areas with new submachine guns.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 5, 2018",High-Quality Shots Of Unpainted Chinese J-20 Stealth Fighter Offer New Capability Insights,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The steady flow of intriguing new images of China’s stealthy heavy fighter-interceptor, the J-20 , continues over seven years after the jet first appeared. The aircraft is already in operational service with the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and it continues to evolve and spread its wings, participating in increasingly high-profile joint-exercises and deployments near hotspots along China’s borders. Three new shots help us better understand the build quality of this game-changing machine as well as handicap some aspects of its true capabilities. But above all else, like I have stressed since its first appearance, the photos are a reminder that China’s ability to make great leaps in aerospace materials and manufacturing sciences should not be underestimated. The latest images, which recently emerged on Chinese internet, show a J-20 without its gray paint and in its primer coating flying out of Chengdu Aircraft Company’s plant and test airfield. We have seen the J-20 in its yellow undercoatings before, but these images are very detailed in comparison to the vast majority of the shots that have surfaced in the past. Note that the dragon symbols on the nose and tail were added in post-processing and were not actually painted on the aircraft. Chinese Internet The images show the areas where antennas are embedded below the J-20’s skin, as well as where other stealthy composite structures are used to minimize the aircraft’s radar cross-section. The J-20’s large Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI) is shown in great detail as well, including various porous panels that also help separate turbulent boundary layer air from its skin—a process required to feed its engines with stable airflow throughout its flight envelope. The jet’s giant maneuvering canard foreplanes are also displayed in grand fashion. These control surfaces help to give the big jet its agility, although they are unlikely to move much when the aircraft is in combat cruise configuration where minimizing its frontal radar signature is critical to its survival. They also work as big air brakes during rollout after touching down. A Luneburg lens is also seen attached below the jet to provide an ample radar return. Like American stealth fighters, these bolt-on devices are used to help air traffic controllers see the aircraft during transient flights and for some training operations. In some cases, they also work mask the true nature of the aircraft’s radar signature. On the J-20s nose, apertures for a missile approach warning system and what could eventually be a distributed aperture electro-optical system are seen, as are formation light strips embedded seamlessly into the jet’s skin. A single pitot tube in the exact same place as the one found on the F-22 is also visible. Maybe the most interesting of all is the under-nose optical sensor system. In the past, China has been quite sensitive about showing off this chin-mounted sensor enclosure, with it being blurred out in official J-20 images and videos. For a long time, the enclosure didn’t really even exist, with an aerodynamic fairing acting as a placeholder. Then it seemed as if a fairly simple looking golden-mirrored enclosure with a far wider field of view than the one we see in these latest pictures appeared for a while. But this was likely just another placeholder—one with the added benefit of confusing foreign intelligence agencies. Now, after years of avionics development, which has included the use of a specialized flying avionics laboratory , a real chin-mounted electro-optical capability looks to have become operational on China’s growing J-20 force, and the PLAAF is more willing to show it off in pictures. Remember, very little actually leaks out of China in regards to sensitive weapon systems without the government allowing it. In other words, they let us see what they want us to see. Many have posited that this enclosure is intended to house an analog to the F-35’s Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS). But based on these images, it seems to have a far more limited purpose. The F-35’s EOTS enclosure offers a far wider field of view than the one seen on the J-20. This is necessary because it replaces the turreted targeting pods found on most western fighters that are used primarily to engage ground objects. With this in mind, the J-20’s optical sensor is likely air-to-air centric, with limited to no ground attack capability at this time., USAF Instead of acting as a multi-role optical ground surveillance sensor and laser designator for dynamically targeting objects on terra firma—as is the case with EOTS on the F-35—this sensor’s enclosure appears to offer a far more limited field of view oriented towards the forward hemisphere of the aircraft. This points to it being used primarily as an air-to-air targeting and situational awareness sensor system. It’s worth noting that the F-35’s EOTS has integrated air-to-air functions as well, but air-to-ground remains its predominant use. https://youtube.com/watch?v=tF4KA8vtFRk The J-20 was supposedly designed with a faceted, turret-mounted infrared-search and track (IRST) system—a critical sensor found on all Russian-built fighters that will allow the J-20 to better survive in a high-threat air combat environment even against America’s advanced stealth fighters (read all about IRSTs in this past feature of mine). Known as EORD-31, the J-20’s IRST lifts upwards out of its nose in front of the windscreen when in use. The large, diamond-like aperture for this system is clearly seen in photos of the jet, but its development could be delayed. In its place, Chengdu Aircraft Corporation engineers could have mounted a fixed IRST sensor in the stealthy ventral enclosure below the aircraft’s nose. This would allow for the J-20 to maintain a constant radar signature while using its IRST. Alternatively, and more likely, the sensor inside the under-nose enclosure could be the other planned primary optical sensor for the J-20 that would work with the aircraft’s IRST, radar, end electronic support measures, and other combat systems. Dubbed the EOTS-86, this sensor surely operates at shorter wavelengths than an IRST and allows for long-range visual identification of potential threats. Used in conjunction with the IRST, it would allow the J-20 to silently detect and engage targets at beyond visual ranges—with the IRST detecting and the EOTS-86 identifying targets—even while operating under the most restrictive rules of engagement and without emitting any electromagnetic energy that can be detected by opposing forces. Even without the help of the IRST, the EOTS-86 would be able to be slaved to the J-20’s radar and could provide visual tracking and identification of targets in a way in which its radar cannot. America’s F-15C/Ds are employing Sniper targeting pods in a very similar fashion and are slated to receive an advanced long wave-length IRST sensor as well. The Super Hornet will also feature a similar mix of capabilities and the F-35’s EOTS does long-range airborne visual identification as a secondary function, but the jet lacks a traditional IRST entirely. But once again, this sensor cannot be used to the extent of the F-35’s EOTS. It would be used for target identification and possibly targeting from the frontal hemisphere only, not from steep angles below or even behind the aircraft as traditional targeting pods are capable of. It probably doesn’t have a laser designator either. But just as a situational awareness tool alone, and a passive one at that, it represents a potent capability even the F-22 doesn’t possess. It’s also possible that a true multi-role sensor similar to the F-35’s EOTS and its wide-field of view faceted sapphire glass enclosure will find its way on the J-20 sometime in the future as its mission set expands and as China’s sensor know-how improves. But that simply doesn’t exist at this time. Chinese Internet In these photos, we also get to see the fine details of the construction of the J-20’s outer airframe, and they look very similar to those found on the F-22, and in some cases, on F-35, although the aircraft doesn’t feature the continuous curvature structures of the latter aircraft and is far more akin generally the F-22 in this regard. Still, the construction quality appears to be quite impressive, with the near seamless joining of structures, sawtoothed access hatches and operating doors, edge-aligned apertures, and overall smooth surfaces. None of this comes as that much of a surprise as China has become a master at cyber espionage and the theft of classified intellectual property from America’s most capable defense contractors. In particular, these operations have targeted stealth aircraft programs , with vast amounts of data being stolen over the last decade or so. Still, as I have said for many years, the J-20’s overall shape and configuration has far more in common with defunct Russian fighter programs than American ones. The PLAAF’s ascent from a third-rate air arm to the USAF’s most threatening peer state competitor has been dizzying. And keep in mind, the J-20’s design is now nearly a decade old. China is working very hard at moving into the broadband low-observable combat aircraft arena in the form of unmanned combat air vehicles and possibly a new stealth bomber that could emerge from the shadows at any time. China’s medium-weight J-31/FC-31 stealth fighter is also showing signs of drastic maturation and is now in its second iteration of a flying prototype. The J-20 remains a highly interesting machine that will continue to improve in the coming decade. Powerplants have been a continuing issue for type, but China is making strides when it comes to indigenous engine manufacturing capabilities as well. But even without extreme kinematic performance, the J-20 appears to be a potent and stealthy sensor and weapons platform that could prove to be very challenging to deal with, especially when combined with creative cooperative platform tactics . Yet what’s most impressive is that China has leapfrogged Russia when it comes to advanced fighter aircraft design in most respects. And by many indications, that disparity will continue to widen with each passing day as the J-20 fleet grows and evolves while Russia’s Su-57 program stagnates towards irrelevance .

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 11, 2019",Japan’s New Super-Sized Destroyer Will Help Defend Against Ballistic Missiles And More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japan Marine United, or JMU, has launched the first example of a new subclass of guided missile destroyers for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, which will significantly boost the country’s ballistic missile defense capabilities , particularly with regards to North Korea . At the same time, though, the ship will enhance Japan’s ability to defend its own territorial claims and project naval power more broadly in East Asia and beyond. The future JS Maya slipped into the water during a ceremony , with Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera in attendance, at JMU’s shipyard at Isogo Ward in Yokohama, near the Japanese capital Tokyo, on July 30, 2018. The destroyer is the first of two so-called 27DD or 27DDG ships, which are subvariants of the Atago -class that is already in Japanese service. The Atago -class is itself an evolution of the Kongō -class , which are derivatives of the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class , but feature a better radar horizon due to the superstructure radar placement being higher than it is on its American counterparts among other changes. The Japanese Defense Ministry unveiled plans for the new subclass in August 2015. Maya is set to enter service in 2020, with her as yet unnamed sister slated for commissioning in 2021. Though derived from the same hullform as the Atagos , the 27DDGs are bigger and heavier than their predecessors. The existing destroyers have a standard displacement of around 7,700 tons, while the new types will displace approximately 8,200 tons. The future JS Maya at JMU’s shipyard at Isogo Ward on July 30, 2018., Kyodo via AP Images Perhaps the most notable feature of the 27DDG design is its improved combined diesel-electric and gas, or CODLAG , propulsion system. In this configuration, the diesel engines for propulsion and the generators for electrical power are combined into a single system, improving power management and efficiency and reducing maintenance requirements and operating costs. This upgrade is a necessity in order to provide electricity to simultaneously propel the ship and supply power for the increasingly energy-hungry radars and other mission systems found on modern guided missile destroyers . When it comes to the 27DDGs, the most immediate demands are the ship’s advanced Aegis Baseline J7 combat system, which includes the AN/SPY-1D air search radar , as well as new Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) equipment. A breakdown of the improvements found in the 27DDG subclass, which, though in Japanese, clearly shows the addition of the CODLAG propulsion system, written here as “COGLAG,” but with the same meaning, and the CEC networking equipment., Japan MoD via Navy Recognition The existing Atagos also use the Aegis Baseline J7 and AN/SPY-1D, but do not have the networking functions that the CEC offers. The CEC is part of the U.S. Navy’s broader Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air ( NIFC-CA ) concept, which seeks to link all of that service’s ships, aircraft, and other assets together. Japan is also considering adding this network functionality to four E-2D Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft it has on order from Northrop Grumman. With the CEC systems, the 27DDGs , will be able to more rapidly share information with each other, as well as American ships during any potential crisis. This means the ships could receive high quality targeting data from other assets with the appropriate data links to cue their own surface-to-air missiles or anti-ballistic missile interceptors, even beyond the range of their onboard sensors. They could similarly provide that information to other Japanese or allied assets directly or by way of other platforms, such as the improved E-2Ds. Either way, this will be especially valuable in the ship’s primary air and missile defense role. When it comes to the ship’s armament, when the 27DDGs enter service, they will likely have access to the same basic arsenal as the Atagos. The 96 Mk 41 verticle launch system cells can accommodate the RIM-66 Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) surface-to-air missiles and RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), as well as the RIM-161 Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) anti-ballistic missile interceptor. Each one of the cells can actually accept four quad-packed ESSMs, dramatically increasing the total number of weapons the ships can carry. The new destroyers, along with their predecessors, will also eventually gain the ability to carry the still-in-development SM-3 Block II , which the United States and Japan are developing together. This is a much more capable anti-ballistic missile weapon than the existing SM-3s and, despite its name, is essentially a new design. A breakdown of the SM-3 Block IIA missile’s configuration and the parts that both the United States and Japan are supplying., MDA When the two 27DDGs arrive, together with the two Atagos and the four Kongōs , the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force will have a total of eight SM-3 Block II-capable Aegis-equipped ships. This will give it the ability to maintain a much more persistent maritime-based missile defense posture, which has become especially important in recent years given North Korea’s rapid development of increasingly capable medium-range , intermediate-range , and intercontinental ballistic missiles . The North Koreans have also shown a tendency to fire these weapons over the Japanese home islands, potentially putting Japanese citizens at risk, even during tests where an unarmed missile might fail and then fall into a populated area. “In the past, the MSDF [Maritime Self-Defense Force] used to send Aegis destroyers [to monitor missile flights] only after it found some signs” that North Korea was preparing a launch, retired Japanese Vice Admiral Toshiyuki Ito, who served as commandant of the Kure Naval District, told The Japan Times . “But the North started repeatedly test-firing missiles without any advance signs. So the MSDF now needs to regularly deploy two Aegis destroyers.” The Japanese Atago -class destroyer Ashigara. , USN On July 30, 2018, the same day JMU launched the future Maya , Japan also announced it would be buying a pair of Lockheed Martin Long Range Discrimination Radars to go along with its two planned Aegis Ashore land-based ballistic missile defense sites. These facilities will also be networked together with ships offshore, including those the CEC data links and the first one could be operational by 2023, further expanding the country’s missile defense shield. But the 27DDGs could signal the beginning of even more significant and far-reaching capabilities for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. For years now, the Japanese government has been instituting a steadily more active foreign policy involving its military and is coming closer all the time to amending the country’s pacificist constitution , which would allow it to deploy ships and other forces outside of missions that authorities can claim are self-defense related. A US Navy Aegis Ashore facility., MDA In addition to their extensive air and missile defense package, the ships will come with an updated AN/SPQ-9B surface search radar optimized for spotting and tracking low- and fast-flying targets, such as incoming anti-ship cruise missiles. Coupled with vertical launch cells full of quad-packed ESSMs, this could improve the ship’s defenses while operating off North Korea or while sailing into contested waters around Japan, such as the East China Sea , or further afield, such as the South China Sea . Japanese and Chinese authorities dispute the ownership of certain islands in the former region and the government in Tokyo has increasingly joined other members of the international community in challenging Beijing’s claims in the latter area. In the South China Sea specifically, China recently installed new anti-aircraft and anti-ship defenses on some of its man-made outposts to further deny access to any potential opponent during a crisis. On top of that, Japan has plans to add the increasingly impressive RIM-174 Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) to the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s surface ships, including the 27DDGs, and possibly the Aegis Ashore sites. This weapon is fully networked and has the ability to receive targeting data from off-board sources, such as CEC/NIFC-CA equipped ships and aircraft. A look at the components of the SM-6 missile, which leverages some of the technology from the older SM-2., MDA This makes it a particularly capable surface-to-air missile against air-breathing targets, but it also has the ability to defeat certain kinds of ballistic missiles during the terminal stage of their flight. Manufacturer Raytheon has now even demonstrated its abilities secondary surface- and land-attack roles. A mix of SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6 missiles could increase the flexibility of all of Japan’s Aegis destroyers significantly. This would increase their capabilities when acting independently or as part of a larger surface task force. The latter role could become especially important in the coming years as Japanese authorities look into modifying their Izumo -class “helicopter destroyers” into the short take-off vertical-landing aircraft carriers they’ve apparently always been at heart . Any future Izumo carrier, loaded with F-35B Joint Strike Fighters and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors , could dramatically change Japan’s power projection capabilities, but would also need escorts. The 27DDGs, as well as the country’s other Aegis destroyers, would undoubtedly be important parts of any such strike groups. Japan’s two Izumo -class “helicopter destroyers.”, Kyodo via AP Images In July 2018, Japan announced that it would send the Izumo -class ship Kaga to the Indian Ocean by way of the South China Sea as part of a regional tour. This is the second year in a row that the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force has done this, but it will only send the vessel with a single escort, hardly enough to protect it during an actual high-end conflict. The two ships are unlikely to even make much of a serious show of force given how rapidly China is expanding the size and capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army Navy. The Chinese are in the process of building a fleet of at least six new, advanced Type 055 destroyers of their own. Looking even further into the future, the enlarged 27DDGs with their improved power-generating capabilities are also better suited to accommodating future upgraded systems. When the subclass first appeared in 2015, JMU went so far as to suggest that the ships might receive solid-state laser close-in defense systems or even an electromagnetic railgun in the future. An artist’s conception of a railgun installation on a 27DDG ship., Japan MoD via Navy Recognition Artist’s conception of a solid-state laser close-in defense system on a 27DDG ship., Japan MoD via Navy Recognition Of course, the U.S. Navy is exploring similar systems as possible additions to its own future surface ships , but has also increasingly come to the conclusion that its similarly sized Flight III Arleigh Burke -class ships simply do not have the physical space and power necessary for these upgrades. Japan may also hit the limits of the Atago – Maya hullform well before it gets around to installing any advanced weapons. As it stands now, Japan does not even plan to purchase any additional 27DDG type ships beyond Maya and her sister-ship. If the Japanese government decides to further expand its military capabilities overall, though, the ships would offer an existing and known type that could add additional capability even if they turn out to have relatively limited room for further growth in the long term. With an individual price tag of around $1.5 billion, the 27DDGs are already cheaper than late generation Flight II Arleigh Burkes and the design, or another derivative thereof, could offer a cost-effective path to expanding or modernizing the Japanese fleet. The youngest of the four Kongō s, the Chōkai has already been in service for 20 years. Whatever the case, the future Maya and her sister ship will be important additions to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, especially when it comes to deterring North Korea, but also potentially in new roles as the size and scope of the country’s military continues to evolve.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 29, 2018",Listen To This Highly Interesting Radio Recording Of The F-117’s Latest Flight Over Nevada,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday we posted an article that showcased a video of a pair of ‘retired’ F-117s, callsign NIGHT 17 and NIGHT 19, taking off from Tonopah Test Range Airport on July 26th, 2018. The stealth jets went on to refuel from a KC-135R tanker, callsign SIERA 98, orbiting near Area 51’s highly-restricted airspace . Then one of the jets returned to base for some pattern work while the other continued on to play with something inside ‘the box’ surrounding Area 51 . Once again, you can read all about the F-117’s murky status and why it could still be flying in our previous piece on the July 26th mission, but now we have some awesome audio to go along with that the video posted in that piece. The recording comes to us from Youtube user ‘ Pdgls ‘ who also posted the July 26th F-117 video. It is hours long and is incredibly interesting to listen to because it paints a picture of just how busy the Nellis Test and Training Range is on a weekday while a Red Flag international training exercise is underway. You can listen to the Red Flag mission in the first half or so of the recording, including the calls from ground-control intercept (GCI) controllers pointing out targets for ‘red-air’ aggressors . 64th Aggressor Squadron F-16C over the NTTR., USAF The Colombians in their Kfirs also seem to be quite chatty, speaking in Spanish. Then, once the daytime Red Flag mission wraps up, all the other tests and training flights commence. During one particularly interesting portion of the audio, you hear in great detail an F-35 air-to-ground test flight in which one of the pilots—with an English or Australian accent—appears to have major problems with his laser designator and getting his bombs to land on target. Later on, another pilot makes small talk on the radio about how Australia’s KC-30 Multi-Role Tanker-Transport’s refueling basket is spectacular, with the pilot wondering what ‘special magic’ they built into it to make it stand so still during refueling operations. These examples are just a tiny fraction of the interesting chatter that can be heard in the recording. Finally, we come to the F-117 mission, which occurs at around four hours and thirty minutes into the recording. You get to hear the pilots depart Tonopah and work with SIERA 98, a KC-135R tanker, for refueling training. They even practice an emergency disconnect from the tanker. Then you hear the section of jets split in two with NIGHT 19 heading back to Tonopah for pattern work and the other F-117, NIGHT 17, heading south to what sounds like the southern end of Area 51’s test airspace. USAF It seems as if NIGHT 17 changed its callsign to DAGER 17 as it headed south, but before that, we hear BLUE BIRD and BLONDE GIRL mentioned, which are likely controllers of some type. Then the F-117 checks in with ‘RAMROD’ and begins the testing. RAMROD tells the F-117 to ‘spin’ which usually means begin an orbit, and then we hear commands to execute a series of coded test cards. RAMROD sounds like a sensor system of some type. Most likely it is the DYCOMS radar cross-section measurement facility at Area 51 , which can surveil and validate the radar signature of an aircraft while in flight and at different angles in relation to the sensors on the ground. It’s also possible that RAMROD could be an airborne platform that offers similar signature diagnostic capabilities using an array of sensors . The F-117 part starts at 4:30:00 into the recording, but the whole thing is very much worth listening to: Overall this is an awesome recording that you should listen to in its entirety.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 31, 2018",New Video Of F-117s Flying Out Of Tonopah Emerges Despite Their Fates Being Sealed,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack jet is still one of the most enigmatic flying machines ever created. The sinister-looking aircraft that was born into a top-secret realm still has many stories to tell even a decade after its official retirement. In fact, those stories don’t just include tales from its operational life . The aircraft had continued to fly without explanation out of its original home at the shadowy Tonopah Test Range Airport located in the northern reaches of the remote Nevada Test and Training Range . As a new video shot last week shows, this is still the case even after Congress had put in motion a plan that would see the F-117s pulled from their crypt-like hangars at Tonopah and finally put to rest . The video, which was supposedly shot on July 26th, 2018, shows a pair of F-117s taking off from Tonopah with one staying over the air base and executing some pattern work and the other heading south for a test mission. The poster describes the video as such: “Night 17 and 19 departed and tanked with Sierra 98 (KC-135 Fairchild AFB). Night 17 then flew a test mission while Night 19 returned to the Tonopah Test area.” The callsigns Night 17 and Night 19 are not surprising for the F-117s and neither is Sierra 98 for the tanker. Sierra 99 is the callsign given to KC-10s out of Travis AFB that usually refuels secretive test flights emanating from Tonopah or Area 51. Sierra 98 is used by KC-135s with a similar mission. Whenever a video like this surfaces—and they have from time-to-time —the big questions always are what are these supposedly retired aircraft doing? Why are their operations kept secretive? And who is flying them? I broke down all the different possibilities five years ago, which you can read here . Since then, it has been made clear to The War Zone that roughly six of the F-117s are kept flyable at any given time and it seems that contractor pilots, likely working for Lockheed Martin, are at the controls of the stealth jets when they are airborne. This tiny flying force is maintained in addition to any other undisclosed programs that may have been executed over the years involving the mothballed Nighthawks. This video is particularly interesting as it was taken over a year after the congressional mandate to keep the F-117 force in ‘Type 1000’ storage—where they could be returned to flying status relatively quickly during a crisis—was terminated. The change stated that the Nighthawks would be disposed of at a rate of four per year, with the entire fleet decommissioned or destroyed by the latter half of the coming decade. The process appears to have already begun many months ago. It’s also interesting in that the videographer notes that one of the Nighthawks continued on its way south for a test mission while the other hung back and did pattern work before recovering. The jet that stayed back was almost certainly an air-spare that could have undertook the mission if the other F-117 had a mechanical issue. I have long posited that the F-117 continues with testing of low-observable (stealthy) treatments as part of the type’s small ongoing flight program, stating : “At the time of the F-117s official retirement, and its subsequent banishment to tomb-like hangars deep in the Nevada Desert, the aircraft was the most understood low observable platform in the history of aeronautics. Hundreds of thousands of hours were flown on the fleet of 64 aircraft (including pre-production versions), crashes were deeply investigated and improvements on the effectiveness of the aircraft were constantly being made. In other words, the F-117 is a known commodity to the DoD and the USAF, and this is especially true when it comes to the aircraft’s unique radar, radio and infrared signature. In fact, I would not be surprised if the F-117 represents the most studied aircraft “signature” of all time. With this in mind, the F-117 could be theoretically used as something of a “flying measuring stick” for evaluating a radar system’s ability to detect and track low-observable flying objects. Or conversely, it could be used as a surrogate to test new radar absorbent materials and coatings applied to its flat, facet like structure that was originally built to accept such applications. By specifically utilizing the F-117 for such-real life tests and evaluations, defense program managers could have a control variable, in this case, the F-117′s well-documented radar cross-section, infrared, and visual signature, and an independent variable for which to test upon it. That independent variable being an experimental radar absorbent material or other signature control application. Testers of new signature control applications, such as an innovative new version of radar absorbent material (RAM), could leverage highly accurate real-life metrics and historical data collected throughout the life and development of the F-117. They can then fly their new application on the jet so that new data can be collected for which to compare and help judge the effectiveness of the experimental capability being tested. On the radar and infrared tracking side of the argument, the F-117 is also a near-perfect and highly available low observable aircraft to test everything from ground-based radars and SAM systems, both foreign and domestic, AWACS modifications, fighter radars and even infrared search and track systems. By doing so, testers can come up with a clear idea of what the capabilities of the system being tested are against a hard to detect target. In doing so, tacticians can work on solutions for defeating any weaknesses in the system while at the same time working on emphasizing its unique strengths. Even keeping a couple “sterile” F-117s available for calibrating and improving the DYCOMS array at Groom Lake, used for measuring the radar cross sections of aircraft flying under real-world conditions, may be in itself an entirely necessary and worthwhile reason to keep a small cadre of F-117s operational.” Over the last decade, F-117s have been seen making runs over Area 51 (where the DYCOMS signature measurement facility is located) and interacting with airborne testbeds—in particular, the somewhat horrendously modified and phantom-like NT-43 , better known by its callsign ‘Rat 55.’ This aircraft is loaded with radar and infrared sensors that allow it to take measurements of aircraft in an air-to-air manner. The very shy 737 derivative is said to be one of the Pentagon’s most important tools when it comes to low-observable aircraft development and for understanding the unique signatures of existing non-stealthy combat aircraft, both of domestic and foreign origin . It seems abundantly clear that the Nighthawk still provides a very valuable service to the USAF and its industry partners as the cost of keeping a handful of the exotic and finicky airframes flyable isn’t cheap. Maybe, in a decade’s time, when the last of the F-117s are about to meet their final end, we will get to see the Nighthawk close-up in a flying state one last time and get a better idea of what it has been up to for all these years during its supposed retirement out at Tonopah Test Range Airport. As for where the F-117s will end up once they are pulled from their climate-controlled hangars once and for all? That remains unclear. But turning them into museum pieces is a notoriously costly and intricate affair. With this in mind, they have a better chance of being ripped apart or even buried than being shipped to your local aviation museum. As we recently noted , the B-2 Spirit will also likely find itself in a similar predicament when it begins to be put out of service in the late 2020s. In the meantime, somehow it’s comforting to know that there is a place where the Skunk Works’ famous ‘Black Jets’—an aircraft that began the stealth revolution —is still wheeling around the sky.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",USAF Plans To Test A System Called ‘Symphony’ Inside An ‘Irascible Pod’ On A U-2 Spy Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force Research Laboratory is planning to install a new system, or systems, that it calls “Symphony” on a U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane, which will require a new underwing mission pod called the “Irascible pod.” The Air Force can’t say yet what the equipment does, but the project may be related to the “ Triple Intelligence ” concept that aircraft’s manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, has been pitching to the service since at least March 2018 or another effort to grow the plane’s capabilities . On July 20, 2018, the 25th Air Force, previously known as the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency, announced plans to hire Lockheed Martin to help in the development of the Irascible Pod in support of the Symphony program on FedBizOpps , the central U.S. government contracting website. The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor continues to be the sole provider of heavy depot maintenance and other major support services for the Air Force’s U-2 fleet at Site 2 within its facilities at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. “Overall, this effort is to gain air worthiness approval to fly the pod,” Brian Cook, Chief of the Air Force Cryptologic Office for ISR-Cyber and Multi-Domain Innovation, part of the 25th Air Force, told The War Zone in a statement regarding the contracting notice. “We aren’t demonstrating the pod’s payload capabilities, but envision the capability to generate/perform cross-functional effects at some future point.” Cook couldn’t offer any additional details about possible payloads or Irascible itself, but did note that the Air Force Research Laboratory’s engineer lead on the project had come up with the moniker for the pod and that it wasn’t a forced acronym. Unfortunately, we don’t have any more information on why that unnamed individual chose this particular word, which means quick to anger . A U-2S Dragon Lady., Lockheed Martin We do know from the FedBizOpps announcement that Irascible Pod is a “reconfigured” underwing Super Pod, but we don’t know if this means it is simply a change in the unit’s internal arrangement or a more extensive modification of the entire assembly. The Air Force’s U-2S aircraft can carry one Super Pod under each wing to accommodate additional sensors or other equipment. The basic description, as well as Cook’s duty title, could point toward Lockheed Martin’s still-in-development Triple Intelligence concept, also known as “Tri-Intelligence” or “Tri-INT,” for the U-2S. From the details available now about that proposed modification , it would require either rearranging the sensor suites inside the aircraft’s Super Pods or developing entirely new pods to accommodate the necessary equipment. As it stands now, the Air Force’s Dragon Lady’s can fly in one of two primary configurations. One includes the Senior Year Electro Optical Reconnaissance System-2 (SYERS-2) multi-spectral camera, while the other features the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System-2 (ASARS-2) imagining radar. The spy planes can only carry one or the other in the nose. The aircraft also typically fly with the Senior Glass signals intelligence suite in the Super Pods and elsewhere in the fuselage. You can read more about the functionalities of these different sensors here and the different U-2 configurations here . A look at various U-2 senor and equipment payloads, including the varous components that can go inside the Super Pods., USAF Lockheed Martin’s plan for the Triple Intelligence arrangement is to devise a way to consolidate the components of Senior Glass so that they fit inside just one pod and potentially improve upon its capabilities at the same time. A multi-spectral camera, such as the United Technologies Aerospace Systems’ (UTAS) MS-177A , would go under the other wing. This would allow the U-2S to simultaneously be able to collect multi-spectral still imagery and full-motion video, radar imagery, and signals intelligence – hence the Triple Intelligence name. This, in turn, would make each Dragon Lady much more flexible individually and allow a smaller number of the aircraft to scoop up the more information during fewer sorties, speeding up the intelligence gathering process overall. This concept would seem to align well with the “cross-functional effects” that the 25th Air Force’s Cook alluded to in his statement as being the ultimate goal for the Symphony system in the new Irascible pod. The Air Force Cryptologic Office , which liaises with the National Security Agency and is co-located with that organization at Fort Meade, Georgia, undoubtedly has an interest and input in any changes to the Senior Glass system and the U-2’s overall signals intelligence capabilities in particular. It is also possible that Symphony and the Irascible pod are unrelated to the Triple Intelligence concept. Despite the Air Force’s Cryptologic Office’s involvement, they might not have anything to do with signal snooping, or be limited to that role, either. A view of the underside of a U-2S with the existing underwing Super Pods., USAF Given the aggressive name of the pod itself, the arrangement could potentially be a new electronic warfare system that might even allow for more directed electronic attacks against hostile emitters. The Dragon Lady already has an advanced self-defense system to detect and jam enemy radars and missiles. Similarly, taking in account Cook’s ISR, cyber, and multi-domain titles, Symphony might have something to do with increased sharing or the integrating of information from multiple sources, including space-based and cyberspace assets . In June 2018, Air Combat Command gained control of 24th Air Force, also known as Air Forces Cyber, in part to better sync that organization’s cyber defense and cyber warfare mission with the 25th’s intelligence gathering focus. This would hardly be the first time the Air Force has experimented with expanding the U-2’s mission set . In 2017, the service demonstrated the ability of the aircraft to operate as a communications and data hub and relay similar to Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft using a Lockheed Martin designed system known as the “ Einstein Box .” The Air Force is also looking to replace its aging E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management command and control planes with a mix of different platforms providing various portions of the older aircraft’s functionality. It is possible that the service might consider adding the U-2 to that mix as a sensor platform or communications node. A U-2S equipped with the “Einstein Box,” the white section with the yellow-gold antenna, during a test., Lockheed Martin “Multi-domain command and control…to me that’s part of how do you fuse data and get it out to the tactical edge,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General  Veralinn Jamieson, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, told reporters at an event the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute sponsored in January 2018. “How do we actually go in with space integrated in there, integrating with cyber, from an ISR support and operations perspective?” In any of these roles, as is the case with its existing intelligence function, the U-2S would continue to be relevant in “ marginally contested ” environments given that it can fly at altitudes above 70,000 feet and features the aforementioned highly capable self-defense systems. From those heights, the aircraft can look deeply into certain target areas without actually having to risk flying directly over them. Depending on the range and capability of any new communications or other systems, the aircraft might similarly be able to orbit at a safer distance required to avoid ever improving air defenses of potential high-end adversaries. But regardless of what capabilities Symphony and the Irascible pod end up offering the U-2, the project is another clear indication that the Air Force remains invested in the Dragon Lady as a capable multi-purpose platform even after more than six decades of operation. In May 2017, the service abandoned its most recent plans to retire the manned aircraft and replace them with RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, electing to operate both types for the foreseeable future. Lockheed Martin had proposed, and may still be offering, unmanned or pilot-optional aircraft based on the venerable U-2 design, or derived from it , as alternatives itself. But the reality is that the RQ-4 cannot fly as high as the U-2 or carry the same breadth and quantity of systems, making the Dragon Lady a high-flying sensor truck the service just can’t dispense with. We’re definitely eager to see what new tricks the service might have in store for the aircraft. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 12, 2019",Remembering When The 366th Wing Was An Experimental Rapid Response ‘Air Force In A Box’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The storied 366th Fighter Wing, better known as the ‘Gunfighters,’ which calls Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho home is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. Today, the base houses two active F-15E Strike Eagle squadrons and an F-15SG unit that trains Singaporean crews, but over the decades it has taken on many forms. Maybe the most interesting of which began in the 1990s when the wing transformed into a composite ‘air intervention’ force replete with fighters, tankers, and bombers, all meant to quickly deploy together during a crisis. The concept was very ambitious and was intended to confront the complex challenges of a post-Cold War world, but it turned out to be a bit more challenging to implement and sustain than originally thought. The air intervention wing concept was brought to life in 1991 by then Air Force Chief of Staff Merill McPeak. McPeak saw his role as transformational, turning America’s flying service from a largely monolithic force designed to counter the Soviet Union to a far more flexible and nimble one. For some, the idea of creating a SWAT team-like composite air wing was a gleaming illustration of how America was settling into its role as the world’s sole superpower and the globe’s heavily-armed policeman of sorts. Mountain Home AFB, home of the 366th Fighter Wing, is a big installation dominated by a 13,510 foot runway. , Google Earth McPeak’s vision was to organize wings not based on a type of aircraft, but on a general mission-set. This meant that if the mission was to go in and take on the enemy with kinetic firepower, the wing should have all the primary aircraft it needed to accomplish that mission with minimal external support. General Merill McPeak, a controversial visionary of sorts that oversaw the transition of an Air Force built to take on the Soviet Union to one that attempted to tackle the more complex nuances of the post-Cold War era. , USAF By basing all these disparate aircraft together, it also meant that they could constantly train as an integrated combat unit. Traditionally, such training was reserved for a small handful of large force exercises that a normal wing made up of one or maybe two types of aircraft would participate in each year. Under the new wing organization, this type of training could occur daily. Additionally, an air intervention wing would need to be able to mobilize on short notice and provide a full package of capabilities to combatant commanders pretty much anywhere in the world. EF-111 Ravens dominated the skies over Mountain Home AFB prior to the ‘Gunfighter’s’ transition into an intervention wing., USAF The 366th Wing at Mountain Home AFB became the flying guinea pig for this new wing organization. The base had been home to EF-111 Ravens—an electronic warfare aircraft based of the F-111 Aardvark that was highly valued during Operation Desert Storm—prior to the change. By early 1992, the Ravens were relocated to Cannon AFB in New Mexico and Mountain Home AFB’s aircraft inventory was in the process of ballooning. The air intervention configured wing would include single squadrons of Block 52 F-16Cs, F-15Cs, F-15Es, and B-52Gs . The last and probably the most critical piece of this force-mix equation was tankers. All these combat jets would need a lot of fuel during operations and even just to ferry them to distant locales on short notice. With this in mind, a KC-135R squadron was integrated directly into the wing as well. The early ‘9-1-1 force’ mix of aircraft at Mountain Home AFB., Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing The idea was that the wing could work as a highly-trained and deeply integrated tactical air power team, with F-15Cs providing counter-air duty, F-15E’s executing the all-weather precision strike mission set, and B-52Gs bringing their massive volume of firepower to bear and the ability to fire the AGM-142 Have Nap missile (aka Popeye) for standoff precision attacks. The F-16Cs would kick down the door as Wild Weasels, suppressing enemy ground threats with their AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles. They would also work as light attackers, specifically during daytime operations. KC-135R tankers would provide the gas for everyone. There was also quite a bit over overlap mission-wise for the fighters, especially in the air-to-air realm. It truly was an ‘air force in a box’ concept. Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing By 1996, the B-52G bombers would be traded out for B-1Bs, which had lost their nuclear strike mission and were in the process of becoming the USAF’s hardest-hitting dedicated conventional strike platform. Other non-flying units were also added, like an air control squadron that brought mobile radar and command and control capabilities to the composite force. Later in the decade, the USAF still saw promise in the concept but wanted to better refine how it could be operationally employed. The establishment of the Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) was seen as a major step in getting the most out of the wing and to help better replicate it in the future. Also, part of AEFB’s mission was working to pre-plan deployments to likely theatres so that the wing could more easily and seamlessly respond to a crisis on short notice. The 366th Wing executed their composite force deployment strategy during a deployment to Egypt (seen above and below) for multi-national exercises in the mid-1990s. , Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing Although the logic behind this concept was fairly clear, there certainly were drawbacks and roadblocks to executing it as originally envisioned. First off, basing five different aircraft types in operational units on a single base was grossly expensive. Each aircraft had its own infrastructure and logistical needs and with just one squadron of each type on strength, economies of scale were nowhere to be found. After years of real-world evidence, it became clear that replicating the intervention wing concept multiple times over would be near fiscally impossible in an era of declining force structure and budgets. The post-Cold War ‘peace dividend’ was going to be realized one way or another, and pumping huge sums of money into composite wings seemed to many like a lavish luxury with questionable utility. Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing McPeak was fully aware of the fiscal demands his composite wings would place on the USAF’s budget, stating the following at an Air Force symposium in 1991: “The reason we haven’t done such a thing [formed composite wings] over the years is that we have been afraid of costs… It’s expensive, especially if you have to create intermediate-level maintenance organizations on each base where you have a composite wing so organized.” He had hoped that new innovations in maintenance and fleet reliability, along with a new multi-tier maintenance plan would help offset some of those costs, but those savings seemed to be illusive in retrospect. Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing McPeak also realized that ‘monolithic’ wing structures of the past, where multiple squadrons of the same aircraft were bedded-down at the same base, would still have a place in the USAF, but he clearly intended to replicate his intervention wing concept many times over: “We might still want to have some wings–especially CONUS wings with the principal mission of overseas reinforcement–to be organized in a monolithic form, because of the economies of scale that are possible in that kind of organization. So in the end, I think, we will need a balance, a mixed [force] structure of monolithic and composite wings–some composite wings, mostly forward deployed, and some monolithic wings that might be stationed more to the rear.” Additionally, demands of the Air Force when it came to deployments abroad, such as those to enforce the no-fly-zones over Iraq and to provide capabilities to NATO for operations around Bosnia, as well as domestic and international training events, meant that the wing’s tenant units had to peel off for prolonged periods of time. This worked to weaken the whole concept of constantly training together and being ready to deploy abroad as a complete force on short notice. Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing Following the attacks on 9/11 and the subsequent war in Afghanistan, as well as the broader Global War on Terrorism, and all the deployment demands that went along with it, the intervention wing seemed less relevant and executable than ever before and the concept began to unwind. In 2002, the 366th Wing lost the 34th Bomb Squadron and its B-1B bombers and the 22nd Air Refueling Squadron and its KC-135 tankers as part of a grand asset consolidation plan. As a result, the wing was redesignated as a Fighter Wing. After 2002, one F-15C, F-15E, and F-16C squadron each still called the base home., Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing The 2005 Base Realignment And Closure act was the final nail in the coffin for Mountain Home’s air intervention wing experiment. All but one of the base’s aircraft types would be sent packing—the F-15E Strike Eagle. The last F-16 left the base in 2007 ending what was without a doubt an interesting and transitional era in USAF history. The composite wing concept, which was always a controversial idea, was also employed to varying degrees at Pope and Moody Air Force Bases, but not with leading-edge air combat punch like Mountain Home possessed during the nearly decade and a half period of time when the air intervention wing concept was in full swing. Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing Although it didn’t stick in the long-run, many lessons were learned from the grand experiment. The success of the Air Force’s Air Expeditionary Wings overseas, which draw in a multitude of different aircraft types from different units based around the globe for collective combat operations, owe a lot to the modern composite air wing concept that was tested at Mountain Home AFB in the decade and a half following the end of the Cold War. Today, Mountain Home Air Force Base is truly a world-renowned hub of multi-role heavy fighter excellence, with its trio of Strike Eagle units filling the skies with thunder on a daily basis. The three current tenant fighter squadrons that call the base home., Mountain Home AFB The size of the base and its close proximity to high-quality ranges means that it also receives regular visitors. Everything from F-35As to Indian Su-30MKIs have used the base in recent years, often times to spin-up before taking part in large exercises like Red Flag or for simulating high-tempo deployments abroad. An Indian Air Force Su-30MKI lands at Mountain Home in 2008 during pre-Red Flag work-ups and LITENING pod familiarization flights. , Mountain Home AFB/366th Fighter Wing Also, the base is still a testing ground for new wing structures. Just recently, it was announced that the 366th Fighter Wing would be the first to implement the Air Force’s new streamlined wing management structure concept. You can read more about this initiative here . Still, it must have been pretty awesome to see McPeak’s ‘SWAT team of the skies’ dispersed across the base’s miles-long apron. What I have heard from crews that flew as part of team Gunfighter during this unique period of time is generally positive, with many noting that when the concept worked it really worked and the quality of daily training was remarkable. One F-15E weapons system officer told me that flying at Mountain Home back then was like “being at a mini Red Flag every single day.” But he also noted that it was a grossly complex and expensive affair that had limited potential to become standard Air Force-wide. Regardless, the base and its air combat cadre are still going strong, and the F-15E brings a bit of every mission—aside from refueling—to the table that the composite wing once offered.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea has turned over 55 cases of remains of American troops who died during the Korean War to the United States, which U.S. President Donald Trump got North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to promise to do after a historic, but controversial summit . It’s a positive step, but the U.S. government still has a lot of work to do to give the families of the fallen closure and make the most of this apparent diplomatic momentum. The White House formally announced the repartition operation on July 26, 2018, though the remains arrived at Osan Air Base in South Korea via a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III transport plane on July 27, 2018, local time. The transfer did appear intended to coincide with the 65th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice Agreement that ended the majority of the fighting on the Peninsula, which the North Korean government celebrates as a holiday called the “ Day of Victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War.” The C-17 “is accompanied by service members from United Nations Command Korea and technical experts from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency,” the White House said in a statement . “The United States owes a profound debt of gratitude to those American service members who gave their lives in service to their country and we are working diligently to bring them home.” The aircraft, based at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii, transported the remains to Osan from Wonsan in North Korea. A solemn ceremony followed as American and South Korean personnel offloaded the cases and placed them into six silver SUVs. A procession led by personnel carrying the flags of the United States, South Korea, and the United Nations, then took the remains from the tarmac to another site on the base for storage. The U.S. government has been very careful to stress that it has received 55 cases of remains and it is unclear whether or not these belong to just 55 individuals or how many sets the North Koreans claimed to have turned over. We don’t know if there are already additional repatriations planned for the near future that would result in the final transfer of all of the known remains. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA, plans to conduct an initial assessment of the contents at Osan, before flying them to Hawaii for further DNA analysis. There will be a formal repatriation ceremony there on Aug. 1, 2018, according to the White House . More than 7,000 U.S. service members who took part in the Korean War remain unaccounted for, but limited and often poor relations between the United States and North Korea have made it difficult to search for and recover the more than 5,000 remains that may be on that portion of the Peninsula. Between 1996 and 2005, DPAA worked with the North Korean government to investigate 33 individual sites and collected 229 sets of remains. After the collapse of the previous Agreed Framework deal between the United States and North Korea in 2003, relations between the two countries further deteriorated and left the remains in limbo. In part due to lobbying efforts by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Trump made sure to elicit a pledge to repatriate the fallen from Kim during the summit in Singapore in June 2018. The procession at Osan Air Base, including the six vehicles carrying the 55 cases of remains that had just arrived from North Korea, on July 27, 2018., USAF “It is a solemn obligation of the United States Government to ensure that the remains are handled with dignity and properly accounted for so their families receive them in an honorable manner,” the White House said in its statement . “Today’s actions represent a significant first step to recommence the repatriation of remains from North Korea and to resume field operations in North Korea to search for the estimated 5,300 Americans who have not yet returned home.” Still, simply ensuring that there are as many remains as the North Koreans say they are will be important in verifying that the North Koreans are keeping up their end of the deal. There has been significant controversy in the past over North Korea’s repatriation of remains it says belong to Japanese citizens it has abducted, but which DNA testing indicated might belong to other individuals. However, independent scientists have since cast doubt on the validity of those results. Since the U.S. government doesn’t have DNA already on file for the vast majority of individuals still unaccounted for from the Korean War, any verification will be a challenge. DPAA researchers will have to try to track down surviving family members to find potential matches. Dental records and other medical information could yield additional clues. Beyond the difficulty of simply identifying the remains, it remains to be seen how much the Trump administration will be able to truly get out of this tangible display of good faith in the long term. In June 2018, the president himself falsely said that all of the more than 200 sets of remains had already arrived in U.S. government custody when this was not the case. Trump and Kim sign a joint statement at the end of their summit in Singapore, which included the pledge to repatriate the remains., AP Subsequent reports indicated that the North Koreans might have canceled a previously planned transfer without telling their American counterparts, which could have been in retaliation for public statements from the Trump Administration calling on the country to abandon its nuclear arsenal and implying it was already doing so. Kim Jong Un and his regime had repeatedly made clear they have no intention of giving up these weapons and that their understanding of “denuclearizing” the Peninsula does not align with that of the U.S. government. Otherwise, there has been very little clear movement on North Korea’s part to make good on the other elements Trump and Kim outlined in Singapore in June 2018. The North Korean government’s reported dismantlement of a test stand at Sohae related to the country’s nascent space program, which many experts believed was a cover for work on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), is of dubious value as a concession. North Korea has now successfully demonstrated that it has an ICBM capability and there is no guarantee it is not continuing further work in that field, and on other advanced missiles , at other locations with similar capabilities. At the same time, North Korea continues to produce additional fissile material to build more nuclear weapons to go onto those missiles. It also further suggests that the North Koreans actually demolished their nuclear test site at Punggye-ri because they no longer had any need for it since they had finished development of fully functional weapon designs. In addition, the North Koreans have expanded their facilities to build solid fuel missiles , which require less preparation to fire and are safer to handle. The new designs could go onto road-mobile launchers or submarines to make them even harder to monitor and detect before a launch. None of this is to say that it is not good to have secured at least some of the remains of fallen service members from North Korea. The U.S. government rightfully seeks to account for any American personnel killed in the course of any conflict. Hopefully, this transfer is the start of a broader cooperation between the United States and North Korea on this particular issue and with any luck maybe it will help jump-start further diplomacy between the two countries on much more complex matters.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 24, 2018","We Are Getting A New Submarine Action Flick, For Better Or Worse","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I love a good submarine flick, and pretty much our entire commentariat does too. The last worthy one I saw was 2014’s grossly underappreciated Black Sea starring Jude Law—who gave an incredible performance by the way. But that was a gritty, smaller-scope film that was as much a psychological thriller as it was a set-piece action romp. Come this October, the plot pendulum is set to swing massively in the opposite direction and Gerard Butler, Common, and Gary Oldman take on Russia below and above the waves in Hunter Killer. Gary Oldman brings a lot of cachet to this film, but it still may end being far more Olympus Has Fallen than Crimson Tide . Regardless, it will feature some iteration of modern submarine warfare and a plot that is likely designed to play on our present-day geopolitical anxieties. Take a look at the preview and let us know what you think: This brings me to an idea that is worth floating—no pun intended. Now seems like the perfect time for a Hunt For Red October sequel. Sean Connery is still willing to work and Alec Baldwin has had a major career resurgence. But beyond the major players, considering the time in which we find ourselves, one of great submarine warfare expansion that is dominated by changing technologies, not to mention the West’s spiraling relationship with Russia, means the plot really writes itself. The movie could actually make a valuable point if it dared to, as well. But in the meantime, we will get Hunter Killer. If anything else it should be good for a few corny laughs and some fun visuals. But maybe, just maybe, it will surprise us and offer at least a partially quality take on modern submarine combat and the geopolitical intrigue that goes along with it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Official Story On The Rockets The Army Fired At A Ship During RIMPAC Doesn’t Add Up,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There have already been a number of notable instances where the U.S. military and its allies have demonstrated new and emerging capabilities during the latest iteration of the U.S. Navy’s biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise, or RIMPAC. But the available details about one notable portion of the event, the U.S. Army’s use of 227mm guided artillery rockets to help sink a decommissioned ship , simply don’t make sense. On July 12, 2018, a number of RIMPAC participants employed various missiles, as well as the rockets, and finally torpedoes, to send the ex-USS Racine, a retired Newport -class landing ship tank amphibious vessel, to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Elements of the Army’s 17th Field Artillery Brigade, based at Joint Base Lewis–McChord in Washington State, were the ones to employ the truck-mounted M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS , during this portion of the exercise. “Thank you for reaching out regarding the recent SINKEX [sinking exercise] at RIMPAC,” U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Julie Holland, a spokesperson for the RIMPAC Combined Information Bureau Media Cell, wrote in an Email in response to a request for more information about this event from The War Zone on July 19, 2018. “I can confirm that all the HIMARS rounds were Reduced Range Practice Rounds, known as RRPR rounds.” The only problem is that this physically can’t have happened. The U.S. Navy towed the ex- Racine to a spot approximately 55 nautical miles, equivalent to more than 60 regular “statute” miles, from the Hawaiian island of Kauai. The blunt-nosed RRPR , which the Army developed specifically for use in constrained training areas, has a maximum range of approximately 10 miles and contains no guidance system or warhead whatsoever. What appears to be the HIMARS rockets impacting near the target area can be seen beginning at around 2:00 in the runtime of the video below. https://youtube.com/watch?v=k4K8_YWigyc It’s also worth noting that, even when using standard 227mm GPS-guided rockets , HIMARS can only hit targets at distances up to around 50 miles at the very most, which still wouldn’t necessarily have given the Army artillery troops the range they needed to reach the ex- Racine ‘s floating hulk. Video the Navy released, seen above, also seems to indicate that none of the rockets hit their mark, or at least directly. This would seem to call into question the practicality of using a weapon with a unitary warhead and only GPS and Inertial Navigation System guidance against even a stationary target at sea. At present, there are no public plans to integrate a data-link, laser guidance package or imaging infrared or radar seekers to the 227mm rockets, which could drastically improve its utility against ships at sea and moving targets in general. It might be possible to use rockets with cluster munitions or special fragmentation warheads to increase the probability of the weapon affecting its target, at least to some degree, which could result in a mission kill or suppression of combat activities. This would make particular sense for countering an attempted amphibious operation. Rockets, at top, and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, below, available or in development for the tracked Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and truck-mounted HIMARS as of 2016., US Army After we followed up, Holland again confirmed that the doomed landing ship was indeed 55 miles offshore and that the Army fired only RRPRs. When we asked about the discrepancy, she indicated that we would have to follow up against with the Army. We subsequently reached out to the public affairs office for the Army’s I Corps, the unit that oversees the 17th Field Artillery Brigade’s parent organization, the 7th Infantry Division. An I Corps public affairs officer then referred us to another individual with the brigade itself for further clarification. At the time of writing, a week after our initial inquiry, we have not yet received any additional information about the use of HIMARS during RIMPAC. What we do know is that the 17th’s 1st Battalion, 94th Field Artillery fired at least five 227mm rockets of some type at the ex- Racine from the Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands on Kauai . A standard ammunition pod for the HIMARS system contains six rockets, which could indicate that one of them failed or was otherwise grossly off target. It’s also clear that RIMPAC 2018 was a major opportunity for the HIMARS crews, as well as other Army personnel. For instance, it was the first time an element of the 17th had been under the control of a Navy commander as part of a larger joint force. It was the first time MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones from the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, situated in Hawaii, had worked as part of a so-called “Multi-Domain Task Force” together with units from other U.S. services and partner nations on land and at sea, as well. Together with an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, the unmanned aircraft supplied targeting information to the HIMARS crew, as well as American and Japanese shore-based missile launchers, as well. The Gray Eagle then monitored the situation as the missiles and rockets impacted, continuing to sharing information all the while via its Link 16 data link to Army and other units. “Soldiers crowd around the television screen in the TAC [tactical command post] as they watch the feed … The target is a decommissioned naval vessel also known as ex-USS Racine … it’s a good hit!” the Army described in a subsequent news story . An MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone., US Army “We are an asset the Navy and our joint services can utilize,” U.S. Army Colonel Chris Wendland, the commander of the 17th Field Artillery Brigade, told the service’s reporters earlier in July 2018 . “What our maritime adversaries conducting this exercise are looking for are other ships or submarines as threats. What they are not looking for is the Multi-Domain Task Force, our ground forces, who can acquire the target and fire upon it using land-based surface-to-ship missiles, then be able to move freely.” The ability of Army units to work together seamlessly with other services and allied units during distributed operations is especially important for any potential crisis in the Pacific region, as we at The War Zone have explored in depth on multiple occasions . At the same time, HIMARS has continued to present itself as an increasingly viable tool for supporting those operations on land and at sea, with the U.S. Marine Corps having now successfully test fired the system from the deck of an amphibious assault ship. Using unmanned aircraft to help spot and monitor targets for ground-based stand-off weapons , and even provide information to cue those shells, rockets , and missiles directly onto a target, is likely to become an increasingly common part of U.S. military operations, as well. With all this in mind, it would make sense for the Army to also use RIMPAC to experiment with longer-range versions of the 227mm guided artillery rocket, which would be especially useful in the open expanses of the Pacific. In June 2018, the service disclosed that it was working on just such as variant, the Tail Controlled Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or TC-GMLRS , which has already hit a test target at a range of approximately 70 miles. In announcing the success of the TC-GMLRS experiment, the Army also noted that a second flight test would be coming, though it didn’t say when it would occur specifically. It seemed very possible, given the distances involved, that HIMARS units at RIMPAC had employed this particular round during the exercise, which is why we asked what ammunition they had used in the first place. If the Army didn’t fire TC-GMLRS rockets, it seems almost certain that they used some other extended-range type or otherwise employed the launchers from a position closer to the landing ship. It seems difficult to believe that the service would have used the shorter range practice rockets in this case for any reason. If the HIMARS crew did employ RRPRs, the exercise would have allowed them to go through the motions of receiving the targeting information and performing a “multi-domain” fire mission against the ex- Racine. It would not have given the Army an opportunity to actually gauge the weapon’s effectiveness against a naval target, though . One of the few pictures of artillery troops from the 17th Field Artillery brigade and their HIMARS launcher at RIMPAC 2018. Curiously, it appears to show only three rounds loaded in the ammunition pod., US Army It’s unclear when we may get clarification on these particular points, though. As journalists who cover the U.S. military have felt increasingly compelled to point out , there has been a steady decrease in the quantity and quality of official responses to inquires. This has impacted the release of even relatively basic information that the U.S. military has readily given out in the past without any impact on operational security. We will, of course, be sure to give an update on the Army’s contributions to the ex- Racine SINKEX when we learn more about this important demonstration of the service’s ability to take on enemy ships in a littoral environment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Congress Set To Put the Brakes On Marine Plans To Buy More Of Its Popular M27 Rifles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Congress is moving to slow the U.S. Marine Corps’ purchases of M27 Infantry Automatic Rifles , or IARs, in a new defense spending bill for the 2019 fiscal year. Lawmakers want to withhold 20 percent of the funding for the new guns until the service better explains its own future small arms plans and how they fit with a U.S. Army-led study that calls for standard infantry weapons in new calibers to respond to emerging threats, especially improved body armor . The provisions are included in a final draft version of the proposed defense budget law, also known as the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which the House of Representatives passed on July 26, 2018. It now heads to the Senate, where it already has support , and could be headed to President Donald Trump’s desk to become law early in August 2018. The relevant sections demand a report on the “near-term and long-term modernization strategies for small arms weapon systems of the Marine Corps” before the Marines can spend all of the money they requested to buy additional M27s, according to Marine Corps Times . That same review must include information on how the rifles fit in with the Small Arms Ammunition Configuration Study, or SAAC, which the Army, in cooperation with all the other branches of the U.S. military, wrapped up in 2017 . The ammunition question looms particularly large over the Marine’s M27 purchase program. The rifles use the same 5.56x45mm cartridge that is standard across the U.S. military. The Corps first began issuing the weapon in 2011 as a substitute for the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon , but in 2016 began moving toward issuing it as a new standard infantry weapon across the board. Though there is no publicly available version of the SAAC report, by all accounts it includes recommendations to adopt a so-called “intermediate cartridge” as the standard round for U.S. military infantry rifles. This category of ammunition typically refers to cartridges that fall somewhere between the existing 5.56x45mm type and the larger 7.62x51mm round , generally firing bullets between six and seven millimeters in diameter. The Army has publicly stated that one of the driving concerns is improvements in body armor among potential opponents, including Russia and China, which could render the 5.56x45mm round ineffective, especially at the tail end of its existing maximum effective range. The service even briefly considered issuing 7.62x51mm rifles to select units as an interim solution. Now, the Army says it has plans to adopt a new squad automatic weapon that could be in an intermediate caliber by 2022. The service has also indicated that this weapon might serve as the basis for a new standard infantry rifle or guns to serve in other specialized roles. A pair of experimental squad automatic rifles from AAI Corporation, which may be the basis of the company’s entry into the Army’s Next Generation Squad Automatic Rifle ( NGSAR ) program., Joseph Trevithick At the same time, U.S. Special Operations Command has announced that it is developing designated marksman rifles in a 6.5mm caliber and is looking to adopt a light machine gun firing the same rounds. However, special operations forces don’t have any plans at present to substitute any of these weapons for existing 5.56x45mm rifles or carbines. It’s worth noting that the U.S. military as a whole has had an on-again-off-again relationship with six-millimeter cartridges for nearly 50 years already , but the trend does seem to be finally heading in that direction. The primary concern legislators then have with the Marine’s plans to adopt the M27 as a new standard infantry rifle is that those guns could easily be obsolete within a matter of years. This, in turn, could force the service to either replace or substantially modify those guns if the U.S. military broadly decides to adopt a new type of ammunition as standard, either of which could be potentially costly options. German firm Heckler and Koch did experiment with a version of its HK 416 rifle , which the M27 is based on, chambered in the 6.8mm Remington Special Purpose Cartridge , but it is unclear how many parts that type shared with the 5.56mm rifles. Based on examples of conversions of other AR-15/M16 pattern rifles and derivatives, this could as simple as swapping out the upper half of the gun. It’s not clear if it would be as easy to modify the weapons to accommodate any other type of six-millimeter round, though. A slide from a Heckler and Koch company briefing in 2007 depicting a 6.8mm HK 416 carbine in between a standard 5.56x45mm model and the larger 7.62x51mm HK 417 rifle., Heckler and Koch Still, Congress has already admonished the Marines over the steep price of the M27s to begin with. In April 2017, the service told legislators it had been able to get Heckler and Koch to drop the unit cost of the rifles down from a whopping $3,000 to around $1,300 . However, this is still double the price of a new M4A1 carbine, the existing standard service weapon. This hasn’t been the only hiccup for the IAR program, either. There have already been questions about how well the weapons work with their existing 5.56mm ammunition. In December 2017, the Marines formally adopted the Army-designed 5.56x45mm M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round (EPR), which has been controversial in its own right , as its standard ammunition type. Testing showed the cartridges caused “some durability issues” in the M27, but the service insisted the guns were still “operationally suitable,” according to Marine Corps Times . Previously, the Corps had been primarily using the Mk 318 cartridge , which the U.S. Navy had developed at the request of various U.S. special operations forces. A complete M855A1 EPR cartridge, at top, and the bullet itself, below., US Army In April 2018, a leaked testing report also suggested the M27 could have reduced accuracy when fitted with the Knight’s Armament Company (KAC) QDSS-NT4 sound suppressor. This accessory is in widespread use across the U.S. military and the Corps is looking to make it a standard piece of kit for infantry Marines. The Marines, however, stand behind the gun itself and have already been pushing ahead with plans to buy and issue more M27s. In April 2018, the Corps handed Heckler and Koch a sole-source contract worth nearly $30 million for as many as 15,000 rifles and spare parts. Marines train with M27s., USMC “What I expect is that with the issuance of the M27 to all Marines in every squad, the ongoing mass employment of suppressors, and the development of variable power optics, every Marine in the squad will have the M38 capability in his own rifle,” retired Chief Warrant Officer 5 Christian Wade, who had previously been a member of the 2nd Marine Division and had led a number of experiments related to modernizing the service’s infantry formations, told Marine Corps Times in April 2018. “The rifleman with an M27 IAR [Infantry Automatic Rifle], suppressor, variable power optic, advanced NODs [night vision], etc. who is fully trained, is a game changer.” But, if the latest iteration of the defense spending bill for the 2019 fiscal year becomes law, the Marines will have to, once again, make that case to Congress or risk losing funds to purchase more of the rifles.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 31, 2018","Exclusive: Unmasking The F-15X, Boeing’s F-15C/D Eagle Replacement Fighter","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last week, the aerospace-defense community was overwhelmingly intrigued by a report from Defenseone.com that said Boeing was pitching a new variant of its 45-year-old F-15 Eagle line of fighters to the United States Air Force. Still, next to nothing is known about this initiative, including where it came from and what it entails exactly. Although it has been framed as a Boeing solicitation to the USAF, the opposite is actually true—the USAF began the discussion over a year and a half ago. Since then, ongoing talks have been kept incredibly hush-hush, along with the details of the aircraft involved—until now. According to sources familiar with the discussions, The War Zone has learned about the F-15X’s origins, its intended capabilities and features, and where it would fit inside the USAF’s tactical airpower ecosystem. F-15Cs execute a mock alert scramble., Tyler Rogoway/Author USAF Looks Back To The Future The F-15X came out of a quiet USAF inquiry to Boeing and Lockheed Martin about fielding an aircraft that could seamlessly plug into their existing air combat infrastructure as part of better-defined high-low capability mix strategy—one intended to specifically help counter the service’s shrinking force structure. The airframe would have to be cost-effective both in terms of operation and acquisition, very low-risk, and most of all, it would need to be non-disruptive to the larger F-35 procurement initiative. If anything else, it had to be seen as complementary to the F-35, not as an alternative to it. USAF The USAF has not procured a 4th generation fighter since 2001. This was over 15 years before the discussions that led to the F-15X began. For a decade and a half, USAF brass had been adamant about only buying stealthy 5th generation fighters to fill out its tactical jet ranks. Even upgrading or retaining existing and battle-proven fighter platforms was in question early in the current decade as the service was myopically focused on stabilizing the F-35 program. Tightened defense budgets under sequester didn’t help with the situation, either. As time moved on, it became clear that the F-35 might not be the USAF’s one-size-fits-all solution some thought it would be. This is not a mark against the F-35, but just the reality that the USAF has tactical air power needs that don’t necessitate or even benefit from the F-35’s unique and costly capabilities. The last F-16 delivered to the USAF was contracted in 2001. A handful of F-15Es was also ordered that year to replace lost aircraft. They were the last 4th generation fighters the USAF has bought. , USAF So the F-15X initiative is not some cold-call Boeing pitch, it was born out of hundreds of ever-strengthening discussions between various stakeholders within USAF and the aircraft manufacturer. All parties involved had worked hard not to disclose the talks out of respect for ongoing procurement programs and the USAF’s stated needs. Additionally, doing so without providing adequate detail would surely result in the F-15X being misconstrued by the press as being some huge challenger to the F-35, when that was never actually the case or the scope of the proposed initiative. The F-15X Concept Is Born The result of those discussions is the F-15X. Our sources describe the aircraft as a single seat variant of the latest F-15 advanced Strike Eagle derivative—the F-15QA destined for Qatar —but it will also integrate many of the features and upgrades that the USAF intends (or intended as it may be) to include on its nearly four-decade-old F-15C/D fleet. And no, the aircraft is not a repackaging of the semi-stealthy F-15 Silent Eagle concept that Boeing floated nearly a decade ago. The F-15X features no low-observable enhancements of any kind. F-15X is an outgrowth of the latest export Strike Eagle derivatives and the upgrade pathway the USAF has devised for its decades-old F-15C/D fleet. It also draws on past concepts like the 2040C F-15 configuration seen in this image and in the banner image at the top of this article., Boeing rendering The F-15X configuration is impressive as it includes a flat-panel glass cockpit, JHMCS II helmet mounted display (HMD), revised internal wing structure , fly-by-wire controls, APG-82 AESA radar , activation of outer wing stations one and nine, advanced mission computer, low-profile heads-up display, updated radio and satellite communications, the highly advanced Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) electronic warfare and electronic surveillance suite, Legion Pod -mounted infrared search and track system (IRST) and the list goes on. With the help of the company’s new AMBER missile carrying racks, the F-15X will be able to carry a whopping 22 air-to-air missiles during a single sortie. Alternatively, it could fly with eight air-to-air missiles and 28 Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs), or up to seven 2,000lb bombs and eight air-to-air missiles. We are talking crazy weapons hauling capabilities here. Keep in mind that the F-15C/D Eagle can carry eight air-to-air missiles currently, and the penultimate Eagle variant that is currently being built, the F-15SA, can carry a dozen. What the F-15X doesn’t include is a high price. The War Zone has learned that Boeing intends to deliver the F-15X at a flyaway cost well below that of an F-35A—which runs about $95M per copy. And this is not just some attempt to grab business and then deliver an aircraft that costs way more than promised. Our sources tell us that Boeing is willing to put their money where their mouth is via offering the F-15X under a fixed priced contract. In other words, whatever the jets actually end up costing, the Pentagon will pay a fixed price—Boeing would have to eat any overages. This is possible because the F-15 is a very known commodity as it has been in production for 45 years and has flown hundreds of thousands of hours in continuously more capable configurations. Additionally, foreign customers have paid for the jet’s advanced development already, with around $5B already spent by international operations on evolving the aircraft over the last decade and a half. A South Korean F-15K Slam Eagle departs on a Red Flag sortie. , Tyler Rogoway/Author Boeing is also likely apt to make the Pentagon a heck of a deal on the F-15X as it will help ensure fighter production at the company’s storied St. Louis plant for years to come and it would keep the door open for additional foreign Eagle orders. It would also provide an ongoing tactical aircraft production relationship with the USAF. This relationship could also be sustained via the T-X contract that aims to replace the USAF’s half-century-old T-38 Talon jet trainers, but who exactly will win that contract remains a question mark as the award isn’t slated to arrive until late this Summer at the earliest. Trading In The Old For The New The biggest question most have about the F-15X is where would these fighters be inserted into the USAF’s existing force structure? The answer to that, and the whole impetus behind the F-15X program, has been made clear to us—the jet is intended t directly replace the USAF’s entire F-15C/D fleet. It would have no impact on the existing F-15E Strike Eagle fleet or its planned upgrade pathway that is underway now. Currently, the F-15C/D force is largely arrayed along America’s maritime borders, with five Air National Guard units flying the type. A squadron at RAF Lakenheath in England and two squadrons at Kadena Air Base in Japan round out the full front-line force. A small number of F-15C/Ds are also assigned to test, evaluation, and tactics development units, and a single schoolhouse based at Kingsley Field in Oregon provides “Eagle Drivers” to the fleet on roughly 235 ‘air superiority Eagles’ in all. A 173rd Fighter Wing F-15C taxis back to its parking spot at Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, known inside the USAF as the “the land of no slack.” The unit is the USAF sole F-15C/D training squadron and is renowned for producing some of the world’s best fighter pilots., Tyler Rogoway/Author The fate of the F-15C/D within the USAF ranks has been in doubt for over a year now , with the USAF evaluating if it will continue to deeply upgrade and eventually basically rebuild its existing decades-old F-15C/D force or if it will replace them entirely with upgraded F-16s. In fact, just last May, reports surfaced that indicated the USAF had all but formally announced that they will draw-down and retire the F-15C/D fleet. Swapping F-15s for F-16s means a capability deficit in almost every regard. Even if the USAF wants to do this it will likely result in a major dogfight on Capitol Hill. But replacing the old F-15C/D fleet with drastically enhanced F-15s could alleviate this major stumbling block and prove to be a much more attractive option. The USAF’s F-15E fleet would not be unaffected by the F-15X plan., Tyler Rogoway/Author Even if the F-15X is cheaper than an F-35 and ends up being closer in price to a late-block Super Hornet (around $65M), the money will have to come from somewhere to acquire the fleet. But spending money now to acquire F-15Xs may actually save money in the long run. The USAF already intended to upgrade its F-15C/D fleet so that it could remain viable into the 2030s and possibly well beyond. Doing so would cost many millions of dollars per jet, especially if those aircraft end up needing new wings in the coming decade, which according to most accounts, they will. And then you still have an airplane that is in the back-half of its service life and costs more to keep in the air than a totally fresh jet. The F-15X will have a 20,000 hour service life. Yes, you read that right, 20,000 hours —pretty much three times that of most fighters being produced around the globe. As such, a new F-15X can serve for roughly 80 years . When you spread the cost of the jet over all that flight time, it does appear to be a comparative bargain. Boeing had marketed a version of the F-15SA as the F-15 Advanced, but the single seat F-15X will incorporate many of the latest export Eagle capabilities along with the upgrades that were intended for the USAF’s aging F-15C/D fleet., Boeing In addition, our sources tell us that F-15X cost-per-flight-hour has been deeply investigated both by Boeing and by third parties by leveraging metrics from legacy F-15 operations and those of late-model Strike Eagle derivatives and even other fighters in the USAF’s inventory. The final figure is said to be around $27,000 per flight hour. This is far less than the aging F-15C/D’s hourly operating cost (about $42,000 per hour) and about $6,000 more than what the USAF is paying to fly their largely middle-aged F-16 fleet today. Compared to the F-22 or F-35 this figure is very attractive as well. Apparently, it also takes into account a single-seat, multi-role mission set similar to an F-16 and the manning demands associated with it, not just an air superiority role. And once again, because the F-15 is a known commodity, this number is not some optimistic guess. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xGY2JBuSCU0 With all this in mind, the business case for the F-15X is that the jets will pay for themselves in about a decade’s time based on operational cost savings over their F-15C/D brethren—the last of which was built in 1986—alone. The Seamless Integration And Plenty Of Production Capacity It’s also worth noting that the cost of an aircraft’s development—which in this case is nothing—and its ‘flyaway price’ tell just part of the fiscal story. New logistics chains, centralized sustainment facilities, training squadrons, the unique infrastructure required at every base a new fighter is stationed, program offices, operational test and tactics development, weapons integration, and so on are all extremely expensive but seldom discussed aspects of introducing a new fighter aircraft. The F-15X is specifically configured to require none of this. It slots directly into the USAF’s existing Eagle infrastructure down to the using the same ground support equipment as its F-15C/D and F-15E predecessors. Even pilot training is said to be seamless, with it supposedly taking just single sortie, a bit of class work, and a couple simulator hops to convert an existing Eagle pilot over to an advanced Strike Eagle derivative. It is truly a plug-and-play concept above all else. The flight-line of the 142nd Fighter Wing. The F-15X will be able to leverage the F-15C and F-15E’s infrastructure., Tyler Rogoway/Author The F-15X could also allow current F-15C/D units to migrate to multi-role mission sets instead of the strictly air-to-air mission that they have traditionally performed. The F-15QA will be capable of deploying close to every weapon in the Pentagon’s tactical fighter weapons inventory and so will the F-15X. This includes weapons like JSOW , Harpoon , and even HARM. But once again, taking on new missions can be done selectively and F-15C/D units could just as well continue concentrating on air-to-air combat exclusively. Yet even a suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses ( SEAD /DEAD) role that leverages the F-15X’s powerful electronic warfare and electronic surveillance measures suites, along with new weapons like JSOW and HARM, would fold nicely into the ‘Gray Eagle’ community’s counter-air role. As for how quickly the USAF could obtain F-15Xs to replace its F-15C/D fleet, that is really up to the USAF. It is known that the F-15 production line is quite elastic and could scale up to dozens of jets a year if the demand was there. Currently, Saudi Arabia’s Eagles are being built and/or refurbished into the F-15SA configuration and soon the first of Qatar’s 36 F-15QAs will begin production. It is likely that Qatar will also execute an option for another 36 Eagles as well. Another order for F-15s from Israel is more likely to occur than not at this point, and other prospects for export remain, from Europe to Asia. But getting the USAF back on the pages of the Eagle’s order books would be a huge coup for the program and it alone could very well lead to additional foreign orders. The Heavyweight Of Tactical Aerial Weapons Platforms The F-15X initiative may be all about getting already available capabilities to the USAF at a low cost with next to no fuss, but in the future, the jet could play a pivotal role in supporting many of the most buzz-worthy air combat concepts being discussed by USAF today. These include man-machine teaming , in which the F-15X would play quarterback for stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) that can go where even the F-35 and F-22 cannot. The F-15X could also act as a weapons truck for stealthy fighters operating forward of their position into more highly contested airspace. This will become an especially critical capacity as ultra-long-range weaponry becomes too large for stealth fighters’ weapons bays or to be carried in relevant numbers by smaller fighters. In the decades to come, it’s very likely that standoff tactical jamming support will be necessary to ensure the survivability of America’s current cadre of narrow-band low-observable fighters. The E/A-18G Growler provides this to a certain degree today, but additional capability organic to the USAF could come via F-15Xs outfitted with jamming pods or conformal jamming arrays installed in modified conformal fuel tanks/fast packs . This mission could benefit from the F-15’s long-endurance as well. Fast Packs were originally envisioned back in the 1970s as having many more uses than carrying additional fuel. This adaptability is still a largely untapped resource for the Eagle family, especially in an age of conformal arrays and increasingly miniaturized sensor and even directed energy systems. , Public Domain Directed energy weapons—namely lasers —and large surveillance sensors, and even outsized anti-ballistic missile weaponry, would be at home on the F-15X more so than virtually any other fighter. The jet’s legendary ability to lug large payloads over long distances to execute standoff attacks could also be very beneficial, especially considering how vulnerable tanker aircraft are increasingly becoming —a problem that is only slated to get worse in the future . A fighter with a larger combat radius that can carry more weapons to hit more targets than its stablemates equates to enhanced survivability for tankers that support them and less dependence on them in general. An Eagle Encore’s Feasibility As far as how serious the USAF is about actually acquiring the F-15X as an F-15C/D replacement, sources familiar with the ongoing discussions indicate that the service is very serious about it. And frankly, the powers that be need to make a decision about the F-15C/D’s fate as spending billions upgrading the fleet just to retire it from service in a few years time makes no sense and is incredibly wasteful. Above all else, the reality that the F-15X concept is actually a thing, and has been in the works for the better part of two years no less, is a promising indication that the USAF is coming to terms with the need to field a diverse mix of tactical fast-jet capabilities, with each platform bringing something special to the table. An all stealth force sounds good, but in reality, it is fiscally unsustainable and not beneficial, and even a hindrance, to many of the missions the USAF conducts on a daily basis and will continue to do so for decades to come. The Eagle’s (old or new) heavy lifting and long endurance capabilities alone are somewhat indispensable in regards to where the future of air combat is headed. The F-15 is the heavy lifter of the USAF’s fighter cadre. It has been used to launch anti-satellite weapons and for tests with outsized missiles, including the AIM-54 hypersonic test missile as seen above. There have even been concepts that envisioned the F-15 carrying Patriot missiles aloft for anti-ballistic missile duties. , NASA In the end, when it comes to the USAF’s tactical airpower needs, it needs to invest in narrow-band low-observable fighters, deep-penetrating wide-band low-observable UCAVs , and non-stealthy fighters that can lug a lot of weaponry over a good distance and/or provide economical solutions for the USAF’s ‘bread and butter’ fighter missions. You don’t need an F-35 to take out a Taliban opium lab or to sit alert duty day in and day out to guard America’s sovereign airspace . And this is what the F-15X is all about. It’s a non-risk, relevant, and supposedly cost-effective solution to a lot of the USAF problems. And once again, it is not meant to compete in a big way with the F-35 program. The recent precedent of the U.S. Navy placing substantial advanced Super Hornet orders —which can be at least partially attributed to the Trump administration’s intent to spread the wealth around when it comes to Pentagon fighter procurement and its overall push for a larger defense budget—also gives additional credence to the F-15X concept. Block III Super Hornet, Boeing In the case of the recent advanced Super Hornet’s orders from the Navy, it’s not as if the service canceled the F-35C—which will attain initial operating capability next year. It just came to terms with the fact that buying more Super Hornets now alleviates risks that have manifested themselves in the F-35 program and above all else, doing so relieves pressure on the Navy’s buckling fighter fleet. The act also helped out with alleviating USMC’s own fighter woes as it allows for younger Navy F/A-18Cs to be transferred to the USMC, many of which will receive substantial upgrades of their own. And enhanced Super Hornets and F-35Cs will complement each other nicely on many levels for decades to come. In other words, both fighters can coexist in production. It doesn’t have to be an ‘all or nothing’ proposition as so many have tried to instill over the last decade or so. As to whether or not the USAF should actually move forward and procure the F-15X as a direct F-15C/D replacement, we’ll save our analysis for an upcoming post. But the concept is certainly enticing and it is more relevant now that it would have been a decade ago when the USAF saw stealth as a threshold qualifier for nearly all front-line future fighter operations. We will keep you in the loop as we learn more about the F-15X and its potentially bright future within the ranks of the USAF.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Unique Horse-Mounted USAF Unit Went Hunting For That RQ-4 Drone That Crashed On Mt. Whitney,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a U.S. Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk drone crashed near Mt. Whitney on June 21, 2017, the service found itself presented with the difficult task of assessing the crash site and retrieving components of the aircraft from the rugged, mountainous terrain. In the end, a one-of-its-kind horse patrol unit from Vandenberg Air Force Base arrived in the area to help with the recovery effort in areas that would have been impossible to reach using vehicles and slow to maneuver through on foot. The 30th Security Forces Squadron’s Mounted Horse Patrol received its orders on June 27, 2017, and arrived at the impromptu base of operations in Lone Pine, California, situated close to the base of the mountain, the next day. The 30th created the horse unit in 1994 and it is the only element anywhere in the Air Force to have Military Working Horses and riders. It is also one of only a few dedicated mounted elements left anywhere in the U.S. military. “The objective was to use the Military Working Horses to expedite the search area of 13 square miles and traverse the area troops could not effectively search due to chest-high sage brush,” U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Salvador Aceves, a member of the Mounted Horse Patrol, told the service’s reporters in July 2017. “ATVs [all terrain vehicles] were not authorized for use due to being on Bureau of Land Management property, as well as the terrain consisting of high sage brush and large rocks.” The restrictions on the use of motorized vehicles that Aceves noted were as much a product of what was on the land as the terrain itself. The Global Hawk had come down right in between California’s Sequoia National Park and the Inyo National Forest in California. The entire crash site was also within a congressionally designated zone known as the John Muir Wilderness . Members of the 30th Security Forces Squadron’s Mounted Horse Patrol and their Military Working Horses take a break while assisting in the recovery of the RQ-4 Global Hawk that crashed on Mt. Whitney in June 2017., USAF There “the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain,” the Air Force said in documents related to the recovery effort that it released in July 2018. The area is home to the Sierra Nevada Big Horn Sheep , an endangered species, and the Whitebark Pine , a candidate endangered plant species. That’s to say nothing about potentially disturbing items of cultural or historical significance, including artifacts related to Native American inhabitants of the area. As such, there are a host of laws and regulations to help conserve the flora, fauna, and other aspects of the John Muir Wilderness. An RQ-4 Global Hawk drone., USAF Beyond the environmental concerns, just getting near the crash site was a challenge. The bulk of the RQ-4 had come to rest at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. Surveying much of the site and the surrounding enviorns on the ground would have been hard to do even on a small 4×4 ATV. This is exactly why various U.S. military units, especially special operations forces , and various U.S.  law enforcement agencies continue to maintain the ability to use horses and other pack animals, as necessary, alongside more modern transportation options. For the 30th’s mounted personnel, though, the complexities of the situation near Mt. Whitney were very similar to what they had to deal with during their normal day-to-day activities at Vandenberg. Along with the rest of the squadron, the unit helps keep watch around the base, its associated facilities, and the land that surrounds them. Staff Sergeant Aceves and the other members of the horse patrol have to be mindful of many of the same restrictions during any of those rides as they did in the John Muir Wilderness. A map showing the John Muir Wilderness, at center, and the town of Lone Pine, at bottom right., US Forest Service “Our role is to enforce all federal, state, local cultural, and natural resource laws here on Vandenberg,” Staff Sergeant Elias Romero, another member of the unit, explained in July 2017. “We patrol over 99,000 square acres [more than 150 square miles] of land, 70,000 [nearly 110 miles] of which are designated for hunting. … We also patrol the 36 miles of coastline owned by Vandenberg.” These areas include 17 designated hunting grounds, with various special firearms restrictions, and contain 17 endangered species and 2,500 known cultural heritage sites. The horses and riders even sweep through some of the hardest to reach spots around Vandenberg’s various space vehicle launch pads before any rocket actually blasts off. This process ensures that there are no individuals or protected animals in areas where debris might come crashing down if the launch fails. A map of Vandenberg Air Force Base., DoD Partners in Flight In the four days they spent working the crash site on Mt. Whitney, the Mounted Horse Patrol covered a total distance of 30 miles. This included a 15-mile route reconnaissance mission to scout out a path to a new forward base camp further up the mountain. Romero said that the horse-mounted team had been able to cover an area in the first two days that it would’ve taken personnel on foot a week to traverse. The Air Force saved approximately 168 man hours of work and estimated $1.5 million in salaries and other costs by using these specialized airmen from the 30th instead. According to separate Air Force documentation , personnel never managed to get to the crash site by foot, only ever reaching an altitude of approximately 7,400 feet up the side of Mt. Whitney. Helicopters inserted other individuals further up the mountain, at a height of around 11,500 feet, who then descended to a stable location close to where most of the wreckage was situated. The Air Force subsequently hired a contractor to use a heavy-lift helicopter to try to recover some of the larger portions of the RQ-4. The plan was also to prevent as much environmental contamination as possible from the crash. Members of the 30th Security Forces Squadron’s Mounted Horse Patrol during a more typical mission., USAF The service has yet to release the results of its investigation into the crash publicly. It has also declined to give any additional details about the recovery effort until that review is complete. What we do know is that the Mounted Horse Patrol and its Military Working Horses were an important part of the Air Force’s response to the accident.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2018",Israel Shoots Down Syrian Jet As Tensions Along The Two Countries’ Border Ratchet Up (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel says shot down a Syrian Su-22 Fitter combat jet with a pair of Patriot surface-to-air missiles , the latest in a series of intercepts along the two countries’ shared border. This follows the recent first-ever use of the David’s Sling missile defense system, which failed to knock down some of Syria’s OTR-21 Tochka quasi-ballistic missiles due to a technical fault, and the Israeli government’s reported rejection of a Russian-brokered deal to try to stabilize the situation. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that they observed the Syrian aircraft, identified initially only as a Russian-made Sukhoi, heading toward the border at high speed on July 24, 2018. They intercepted it after it flew more than a mile into Israeli territory. On July 23, 2018, the Israelis had similarly attempted to destroy the Tockhas after they detected the missiles flying in the direction of areas it controls in the Golan Heights region. “Since morning hours [on July 24, 2018], there has been an increase in the internal fighting in Syria, including an increase in the activity of the Syrian Air Force,” the IDF subsequently explained. “During the day, we identified increased aerial activity in the Quneitra area and in the southern Syrian Golan and sent messages through several channels and in several languages about Israel’s security interests.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=YFRQun3KgT4 This is actually not the first time Israel’s Patriots have brought down a Su-24 [See update at the end of the story] near the Golan. In 2014, the IDF shot down another Fencer after it reportedly flew less than a half of a mile into Israeli airspace . According to Israel’s Ynet news , in this instance, Israeli officials reached out to their Russian counterparts in Syria to confirm that it wasn’t one of their aircraft. The two countries reportedly operate a “hotline” system of some kind, similar to the often dubious de-confliction arrangement the United States and Russia maintain in eastern Syria . The fate of the pilot or pilots in the Syrian aircraft remains unclear. Syrian officials, through the countries state-run SANA media outlet, said the Su-24 was conducting operations against rebels along the border and denied it crossed the border. The Syrian Arab Air Force has just a few of the Fencers and there are among the country’s most capable combat jets. These factors, combined with its difficulties in keeping military aircraft operational and its resources required to train qualified pilots, mean the loss of the one jet could have an outsized impact on the service’s ability to conduct operations. [See update at the end of the story] In addition, Syria’s own claim that the plane was flying missions against rebel forces near the edge of the Yarmouk River Valley, which effectively forms its boundary with the Israeli occupied Golan, as well as Jordan, highlights the potential for mistakes and miscalculations on both sides. It already appears to be increasingly difficult to separate the fighting in southern Syria from potential strikes aimed at Israel. In the case of the Tochkas, Israeli officials had to concede that they were not actually heading for targets in Israel. After it became clear that the missiles were not going to cross the border, IDF self-destructed one of the interceptors over Israeli territory. The second interceptor did not respond to commands to blow itself up. The IDF is now attempting to determine whether or not it actually intercepted one of the Syrian missiles, or if it fell into Syria, or did actually explode as directed. The video below shows a test of the David’s Sling system in the United States. These incidents are only the most recent cross-border skirmishes , which have been of varying severity . The most significant was a burst of rocket fire from Iranian forces in Syria into Israel in May 2018, which prompted a massive Israeli counterattack . Earlier in July 2018 , after a Syrian drone crossed the border, the IDF struck three sites under the control of Bashar Al Assad’s government in response. On July 23, 2018, Israel also appeared to be signaling to someone within Syria about its continued willingness and capability to respond to any threats emanating from the country by flying an advanced F-35I Adir stealth fighter near the border with a transponder turned on. Airplane spotters watched the jet flying routes in northern Israel using online flight tracking software. In May 2018, the Israeli Air Force revealed that it had sent these aircraft into combat for the first time. It also employed various types of F-15 combat jets and F-16I Sufa multi-role fighter jets, as well as ground-launched rockets and missiles , to conduct strikes in Syria. But the recent spike in these interceptions and retaliatory strikes appears to be primarily linked to Assad’s latest offensive in southern Syria, which began in earnest in June 2018 . Since then, with the help of Russia and Iran, as well as proxy forces those countries support , the government in Damascus has been steadily regaining control of much of the region. After the jet went down on July 24, 2018, Syria said it was encircling the city of Saida, which sits less than 10 miles from the Jordanian border. Israel and Russia had reportedly been trying to come to an agreement to reduce the growing tensions, including a plan that could have moved Iranian personnel and militias under their direction out of a more than 60-mile wide buffer zone along the border. But on July 23, 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected that offer, according to Reuters . “We will not allow the Iranians to establish themselves even 100 kilometers [approximately 62 miles] from the border,” Netanyahu reportedly said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. “This was a very important meeting at a significant time, during which we delved into many details, produced maps and shared intelligence, and explained in great detail our policy,” an unnamed senior Israeli official said, according to a seperate report from The Times of Israel . While we don’t know why the deal, which has been in the works for weeks now, apparently collapsed, it has never been clear how the Russians expected to be able to order Iranian forces to leave the area. It is possible that Israel was equally concerned about the viability of the Kremlin as a guarantor of any such agreement, especially in light of its recent abrogation of a previous de-escalation zone arrangement with the United States and Jordan that had kept southern Syria under de facto rebel control for nearly a year . Beyond that, despite previous pressure from the Russians on the issue, Assad appears to have no intent on scaling back ties with the regime in Tehran or Iranian-backed proxies in the region, including the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which Israel also sees as a direct threat. The IDF has already struck Syrian targets on many occasions , actions that appeared to be linked to blocking arms shipments bound for Hezbollah and other terrorist groups. Israeli officials have repeatedly declared that they find Iran’s growing influence in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to be unacceptable to their interests. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, shakes hands with Syrian leader Bashar Al Assad., Mikhael Klimentyev/Sputnik  via AP Perhaps more importantly, Israel and Syria could be on a collision course over issues entirely separate from Iran. The two countries remain effectively in a state of war and dispute the status of the Golan Heights. In 1974, they agreed to establish a U.N.-enforced demilitarized zone in that region to separate their forces and reduce the likelihood of renewed conflict. Israel now accuses Syria of exploiting the chaotic situation and violating that deal by moving forces into the buffer area . In its statement about shooting down the Syrian jet, the IDF specifically references the international agreement, implying that they might have shot down the plane simply for zipping through this restricted zone. Since 2016, Israel has itself been working right along the edge of Syria, and even within the country itself , providing medical and other humanitarian aid as part of what it calls Operation Good Neighbor. Most recently, as part of that mission, the IDF escorted members of the White Helmets volunteer civil defense organization and their families through the Golan and into Jordan to safety . Other countries have since offered asylum to these individuals, who have worked to save lives in the face of indiscriminate Syrian and Russian military operations, especially aerial bombing campaigns. This all further calls into question how inclined Israel might be at present to entertain any deal that involves Assad’s regime, even with the support of the Kremlin. The evacuation drew fierce criticism from both Syria and Russia . The government in Damascus, along with Russian officials, has long accused the White Helmets of being a front for terrorists and of staging false flag chemical weapon attacks, unsubstantiated conspiratorial claims that are widely repeated worldwide and are often coupled with false, misleading, or otherwise manipulated information and imagery. It had already been clear that a failed Israeli-Russian border deal could leave the region open to the increased risk of a multi-faceted conflict, with Assad trying to use his southern Syrian offensive as a springboard to advance other, long-standing regional goals. He could seek to manipulate both his Russian and Iranian benefactors, exploiting their growing animosity toward one and other, in service of this broader strategy. The IDF’s recent involvement directly in the Syrian civil war points to a similar potential outcome arising simply the failure of Israel and Russia to work out a deal in the first place, which would remove any incentive for Assad to pull back Iran’s forces and stop his own harassment of Israel at all. Iranian-backed militias are supporting his southern campaign in the meantime. There was the possibility that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could have bolstered such a deal, or otherwise helped facilitate it, with an agreement during their recent summit in Helsinki, Finland. However, the backlash to that meeting, both inside the United States and among many of America’s allies and partners, make it unlikely that any such arrangement will come into force in the near future. The U.S. government, including the U.S. military, is reportedly still struggling to determine what Trump and Putin did and didn’t agree to, including regarding cooperation around the conflict in Syria. The two leaders did apparently discuss potentially repatriating Syrian refugees , despite concerns that many of them could face detention, torture, or worse from the Assad regime for deserting from national service or suspected links to rebel forces. “You don’t just go do things,” U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, the top commander for all U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, told reporters on July 22, 2018, insisting he had received no word from the White House on any plans for Syria. “I have not asked for that. I am not recommending that. And that would be a pretty big step at this point.” US Army General Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command., Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP At the same time, Trump seems to remain determined to extricate the United States from the conflict in Syria by any means available. If the United States does end up cooperating with Russia or otherwise draws down its involvement without clear guarantees about the status of various groups and regions, it could easily end up leaving the door open to renewed fighting or new complex conflicts between various nation-states and non-state actors with competing agendas. As the latest aerial intercepts near the Israeli border show, it might not even take a direct attack by any group inside Syria on Israel to risk touching off a broader conflict between those particular countries. Update: 7/25/2018, 10:00am EST— Subsequent reports , including images of the wreckage, suggest that the aircraft the IDF shot down was a Su-22 Fitter ground attack aircraft rather than a Su-24.  The source for the original information was the Israeli Air Force .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 25, 2019","USAF Offers New Details About New Air Force Ones, But Doesn’t Back Up Trump’s Cost-Cutting Claims","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recently released U.S. Air Force document justifying the decision to hire Boeing directly to build two new presidential aircraft to replace the service’s existing VC-25A aircraft, commonly known as Air Force Ones , offers new details about the actual configuration of the highly specialized planes. At the same time, details of any substantial cost savings, as U.S. President Donald Trump claims he personally negotiated earlier in 2018, are conspicuously absent. Air Force Material Command, which is overseeing what is formally called the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, released the updated “justification and approval” document on July 20, 2018 on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps. In 2015, the service first announced it would formally give Boeing the deal to design and build the two future Air Force One aircraft, now known as VC-25Bs, without holding an open competition. The revision is necessary “in order to execute the informal agreement dated 20 February 2018 made between President Donald J. Trump and Mr. Dennis Muilenburg, the Chairman, President, and CEO of The Boeing Company,” the new document explained. The Air Force is treating the changes as a modification to the existing sole-source contract. Any time an arm of the U.S. government wants to award a contract to one specific firm without opening it up to competing bids, the entity in question has to submit a formal statement justifying why it is the only practical way to proceed. Typically, these arguments focus heavily on the contractor’s past performance and unique ability to perform whatever the work is, as well as how those factors combine to give the American taxpayer the best possible deal. There is usually some explanation about how the time it would take to find another suitable company would cause an unacceptable delay that would either cost more money, potentially result in sub-par work, put lives at risk , or some combination thereof. One of the existing VC-25A aircraft., Press Association via AP For example, the Air Force’s written justification for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program notes that the existing pair VC-25A aircraft will have a concurrent availability rate through 2025 of just 28 percent, meaning the planes will both be mission ready less than one-third of the time, on average. The two VC-25Bs will have an expected availability rate across their life cycle of around 56 percent, better-ensuring one is always to provide important executive transport services to the President, his closest advisors, and family. Similarly, the Air Force said it would be more expensive to continue operating the essentially custom-built older aircraft and modify them as necessary than it would be to sustain the newer planes, which will have various advanced features to begin with. It is worth noting that in a previous Air Force-driven effort to save money, the service made the decision that the VC-25Bs will be conversions of a pair of existing commercial 747-8i aircraft, which Boeing built for a privately-held Russian airline that went bankrupt before it could take delivery of the planes, rather than built them from the ground up as Air Force Ones. But, given the written justification’s emphasis on cost, it’s notable that the document makes no mention of the purported $1.5 billion Trump said he cut from the program by negotiating personally with Muilenburg in February 2018. The White House said the president did this somehow without having any impact on the estimated total cost of the project, a discrepancy we at The War Zone called into question at the time. There is only one actual cost-savings estimate in the document, which is dated May 2018, which explains that sole-sourcing the deal to Boeing could trim approximately $200 million from the program cost by having the company handle certification processes internally and letting subcontractors bid on various systems integration efforts. This exact same language was also present in Air Force’s original argument, which it released publicly in 2015 . President Donald Trump waves from the door of Air Force One., Press Association via AP The justification document does confirm that Trump and Muilenburg “reached an informal agreement on ‘the total [VC~25B] program price’ on 20 February 2018,” but conveniently does not offer an actual figure. Elsewhere in the document, the Air Force once again confirmed the that well established estimated cost of the program is approximately $3.9 billion, a figure that we at The War Zone have explained in detail before has been relatively stable since at least 2015. It seems difficult to believe that the Air Force would not have devoted at least one sentence to a savings of $1.5 billion. It seems even more difficult to see how the service could have omitted this if it were true given that the entire reason this new version of the document exists at all is to reflect the outcome of the Trump-Muilenburg deal. The updated document does say that the Air Force successfully negotiated special licensing rights to the VC-25B design that will allow it to put the contractor logistical support contract up for competitive bid in the future. This could potentially reduce costs if another firm underbids Boeing for this deal. However, Boeing, despite recent criticism , has already gotten a deal to provide these services for five years after the planes reach initial operational capability, which the Air Force says will occur in 2024. That same year, the aircraft are also supposed to reach full operational capability. During negotiations, Boeing also offered eight additional years of warranty on any commercial 747 components that remain on the aircraft. The extended warranty deal could help the U.S. government save money in the future on basic preventive maintenance and replacing simple parts. Still, it is unclear just how much will actually remain common between the 747-8i and the VC-25B when the conventions are complete. There is a slim possibility that Trump could have been referencing estimated savings across the life cycle of the new Air Force Ones. If this is the case, we still can’t assess their accuracy since the Air Force has not given an estimate of how much it has or expects to save from these negotiated terms or other cost-cutting initiatives. In addition, there is no indication that the president’s personal intervention rather than existing arrangements between the service and Boeing resulted in any concessions. In fact, the Air Force’s argument in favor of giving the Air Force One deal to Boeing is relatively straightforward. Its core line of reasoning is that the company was responsible for the existing pair of VC-25As and has a unique understanding of the requirements for such an aircraft. In addition, since the service has insisted on sticking with a derivative of the 747 airliner as the basis for the new VC-25B, the Chicago-headquartered planemaker is likely to be able to save additional time and money given its existing and extensive experience modifying that airframe to the presidential airlift mission. The VC-25B Air Force Ones will be substantially different inside and out from a commercial standard 747-8, as seen here., Boeing Beyond that, “Boeing declined to sell or otherwise provide the United States Government or other contractors the license rights needed to conduct an adequate competition while avoiding a substantial duplication of costs or unacceptable delays,” the document noted. “Furthermore, prior to initial contract award, Boeing declined to provide additional engineering services in lieu of data rights.” With all this in mind, the Air Force provided five examples where Boeing alone would be able to perform the necessary modifications to the 747-8i aircraft at the best possible value. These details, in turn, offer some new information on the exact configuration of the aircraft. For one, the VC-25Bs will need a military GPS that works seamlessly with the aircraft’s mission systems. Boeing will also replace the commercial transponder with an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system. Together these systems will allow the future Air Force Ones to navigate both commercial and restricted airspace, using civilian navigation and air traffic control data when available and appropriate. It seems almost certain that the navigation system will also have special features to harden it against jamming and other electromagnetic interference. The new presidential aircraft will also feature a pair of auxiliary power units, or APUs, as is the case on VC-25As, than a single unit as found on the standard 747-8i. This will provide the necessary power to run the jet’s much more expansive communications and other missions systems on the ground without the need for an external power source, as well as providing backup power in the air. There will also be specialized, but unspecified modifications to the “environmental controls, electrical power, water management, fuel system, and engines,” which Boeing is best suited to perform, according to the justification notice. A shot of the rear of one of the two VC-25A Air Force Ones, showing the large exhaust for the existing dual APU arrangement., Press Association via AP The last specific example of specialized features that will go onto the VC-25B is the need for two new entry and exit doors, one forward of the wing and one behind it. These would allow the passengers and crew to enter or depart the plane even at airports or other sites where there might be limited infrastructure to handle such a large aircraft. This feature could be necessary if Air Force One has to transport the president to a meeting or other event in a certain location without facilities to handle a 747-airliner or during an emergency that requires Air Force One to operate from a remote or austere landing strip for safety or convenience. The two doors also allow staff, the White House press corps, and other individuals traveling onboard to rapidly board and deplane without having to use the same entryway as the president. Having the ability to get people on and off the aircraft can also just come in handy if there is a dispute on the ground over the ability of a more conventional airstair. The present VC-25As already have these doorways for exactly this reason. It’s these kinds of changes and additions, most of which remain classified or otherwise highly sensitive, that lead to the high price tag associated with Air Force One. We know this has to include an especially elaborate suite of self-defense systems , hardening against the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear weapon going off, secure communications equipment , and more. Boeing has done the integration work for all that on VC-25A. As the justification notes, the VC-25Bs will have a “no fail mission.” Former President Barack Obama uses the onboard airstair on one of the VC-25A Air Force Ones during a visit to China in 2016., Imaginechina via AP That’s not to say that there can’t be feature creep, higher than expected costs as of the result of unnecessary systems, and features the U.S. government could cut or scale back to save money. In May 2018, the Air Force just canceled a $24 million contract to upgrade the refrigerators on the existing VC-25As after criticism from members of Congress. “Even with the understanding that the Air Force One mission brings with it unique requirements and challenges, a $24-million sole-source contract just didn’t pass the smell test,” Joe Courtney, a Democratic Representative from Connecticut and the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee’s Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee, said in a statement at the time. “I commend the Air Force for reversing this decision and look forward to working with them to ensure the next-generation Air Force One program stays on schedule.” But, so far, there continues to be no evidence that the cost of the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program has ever been anything but approximately $4 billion or that Trump’s handshake deal with Boeing netted significant additional savings in the upfront development and procurement costs or long-term sustainment expenses. In its latest justification of its contracting processes in relation to the project, the Air Force does not even imply otherwise. And with Trump now saying he wants a new and potentially more complex paint scheme for the jets, as well as other luxury features, he may ultimately end up adding to the price tag.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Those Suped-Up OV-10 Broncos That Took On ISIS In Iraq Are Being Sold Off,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is expecting to facilitate the delivery of four OV-10 Bronco light attack aircraft to an unspecified American partner overseas. This could very well be the Philippines, which is the last military user of the type anywhere in the world, and might reflect a shrinking number of government operators of any type worldwide rather than any serious revival of interest in its capabilities. On July 19, 2018, the Proven Aircraft Program Office at Hill Air Force Base, a division of the U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, announced it could potentially hire a contractor to crate up two OV-10A and two OV-10G+ variants and deliver them to a location overseas. The same firm would then reassemble the planes once they arrive where ever it is that they might be going. Jane’s Aviation Editor Gareth Jennings was among the first to spot the notice . Of particular note, the “two G+ models had over five thousand (5,000) new wires installed during last upgrade without disconnects,” according to the notice that appeared on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps . “All wiring needs to be pulled back and stored in the fuselage to avoid cutting the wires.” Otherwise, whoever the Air Force might hire simply has to break the Broncos down into their fuselages, wings, nacelles and booms, sponsons, and horizontal stabilizer components for shipment. They would have to custom-build the crates to hold these components, as well. One of the two OV-10G+ aircraft during its time U.S. Special Operations Command., John Lequerica The announcement does not say where the aircraft are coming from, but it seems almost certain that they are, or were until very recently, the property of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). An official, publicly available inventory of planes and helicopters the Air Force has in storage at the main U.S. military boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona does not list any OV-10s of any type. NASA, however, has two OV-10A Broncos and, more importantly, the only two OV-10G+ aircraft in existence. It acquired these planes from the U.S. State Department after they passed through the hands of various U.S. government agencies after the U.S. Marine Corps retired them from combat duty in the 1990s. As part of NASA, the four aircraft subsequently helped study low-speed flight, noise, and other aeronautic effects. Selling these aircraft to a foreign government would effectively end the organization’s Bronco operations with little likelihood that it would ever acquire additional examples of the type in the future. All four of NASA’s OV-10s together in a hangar at the Langley Research Center in Virginia. The two gray OV-10G+ aircraft are notably missing their sensor turrets under the nose., NASA It’s not clear what, if any, modifications the planes might receive before delivery, either. Both the OV-10As and OV-10G+s are demilitarized in many ways at present and could require some level of work to bring them back to a combat-capable configuration. This might not be difficult to do in the case of either variant, given the design’s relative simplicity and the extensive work the U.S. Navy already did to the G+ versions as part of a deal that also involved NASA and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). These heavily modified aircraft, which you can read about in detail here and here , subsequently went to Iraq in 2015 for what became a highly successful combat evaluation supporting American-led operations against ISIS terrorists. A description of various updates found on the OV-10G+ aircraft. The Navy modified two NASA OV-10D+ aircraft to this new configuration as part of a light attack aircraft experiment in cooperation with U.S. Special Operations Command., SOCOM via FOIA As of July 2016 , the aircraft were back in NASA custody. Per the agreement with the Navy and SOCOM, U.S. military personnel or contractors removed weapons and the ability to employ them, as well as a host of other military equipment, before returning them. And while we don’t know what country is in line to potentially get the Broncos, the Philippines seems to be the most likely recipient. It’s hard to imagine that another country with no actual or recent experience with the type would decide to acquire such a small number of these aircraft now, especially given the increasingly limited availability of support services for the type. The Philippine Air Force presently has a fleet of eight upgraded OV-10M aircraft . It is possible that they would bring the ex-NASA OV-10As to this configuration or use them as a source of spare parts for these existing aircraft. One of NASA’s OV-10As with a long air data probe at the front for research purposes., NASA The OV-10G+s, on the other hand, could add new capabilities to the Filipino Bronco fleet. Thanks to their U.S. military-sponsored modifications , these aircraft have all-new glass cockpits, provisions for a modern sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras and the space for the necessary systems to give them the ability to employ precision-guided munitions. When SOCOM operated the aircraft , they also had support for helmet-mounted displays , a special-purpose geo-location system to home in on enemy radio and cell-phone transmissions, as well as additional communications systems and data links. Some of this mission equipment could go back into the aircraft before they head off to the Philippines. The Philippine Air Force’s existing OV-10Ms do not have anything approaching these capabilities. During brutal fighting against Maute and Abu Sayyaf militants, who had pledged allegiance to ISIS, in the city of Marawi in 2017, these aircraft had to conduct attacks with unguided bombs . This posed an inherent risk of collateral damage and civilian casualties in the dense urban environment. By contrast, during their time in Iraq, the OV-10G+ aircraft exclusively employed the low-cost, laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) 70mm rocket. Unfortunately, official NASA pictures show that the planes, as of at least as of February 2018, no longer have their MX-15HD electro-optical turrets installed, indicating that it may require some amount of work to restore this and other more advanced capabilities. But if the Broncos do end up going to the Philippines, it’s still not entirely clear how much longer the country intends to operate them. The aircraft has been out of production since 1986 and it has only become increasingly difficult to sustain the type as the total number of operators around the world continues to contract. North American Rockwell only ever built approximately 360 of the aircraft in total. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aPXh0SpQU6w If NASA stops flying the OV-10, the only remaining government organization using the type in capacity in the United States will be the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CALFIRE . This organization uses the aircraft to direct water bombers during forest firefighting operations. A small number of the planes also remain active on the warbird circuit , performing or otherwise appearing at airshows and similar events. In December 2017, Embraer announced that the Philippines had signed a formal contract to buy six A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft after years of back and forth negotiations. The Brazilian planemaker said it would begin delivering the planes in 2019, at which time they could begin replacing at least some of the aging Broncos. The Super Tucanos will very likely feature a sensor turret and precision-guided munitions capability, features already found on examples of this aircraft in service with other military forces around the world. This purchase also appears to be part the country’s firebrand president Rodrigo Duterte’s larger push to modernize the Philippine military’s capabilities. In June 2018, he announced a five year, $5.6-billion spending plan known as Horizon 2. The wishlist includes a host of new systems across the board, including new fighter aircraft and heavy lift helicopters, howitzers and rocket artillery, light tanks, and even submarines, among other things. The Philippines has received pledges from both the United States and China to provide additional defense assistance, as well. With this in mind, it seems very likely that the Duterte administration is interested in replacing the Broncos for good in the coming years. In addition to its direct order for A-29s through Embraer, the country could submit new requests to the U.S. government for assistance in purchasing additional aircraft of this type. An A-29 Super Tucano during the US Air Force’s OA-X light attack aircraft experiment., Embraer/SNC The United States has already facilitated the delivery of Super Tucanos to Afghanistan , Lebanon , and Nigeria . Further deals could come if the aircraft wins whatever contract might come out of the U.S. Air Force’s own OA-X experiment, which the service says will focus heavily on supporting foreign allies and partners . All told, it looks as if the Philippines is planning to continue operating the Bronco in the near term, but only as a bridge until it receives new light attack aircraft. It is possible that the OV-10s, especially the OV-10G+s, could serve alongside the newer A-29s for a period afterward before going into retirement permanently. It will be interesting to see whether any other country or private company decides to pick up what’s left of their OV-10 fleet at that point, or if the type is finally on its way to leaving military service entirely. We have reached out to the U.S. Air Force already for more information about this potential deal and will let you know if we learn any more about the Bronco’s future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 29, 2018",Two Vintage Warbirds Crashed In Separate Incidents On Eve Of Oshkosh Air Show (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are sad to report that there have been two separate mishaps involving vintage military aircraft, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport and a De Havilland DH112 Venom jet fighter, over the last 24 hours. The Venom had taken off from Sheboygan County Memorial Airport in Wisconsin at around 4pm on Friday when something went very wrong. It crashed into a farm close to the airport perimeter. After initially impacting into a cornfield, the jet careened into a barn and calving building, resulting in a large fire. Fire and rescue personnel had to be called in from around the region to fight the blaze. The pilot died in the crash, along with livestock, and two farm workers were injured, as well. Thankfully, nobody on the ground died. Around 50 animals were in the buildings and some died on impact and others had to be put down due to their injuries. Our sources say the aircraft was registered as N747J and belonged to World Heritage Air Museum located in Harper Woods, Michigan. You can see a photo of the aircraft here. The aircraft, along with many other warbirds, were taking part in a formation workshop in preparation for EAA’s yearly AirVenture air show at Oshkosh, which is about 45 miles from Sheboygan. The aerial huge bash is slated to begin on Monday with thousands of aircraft making the pilgrimage there over the weekend. Warbirds like the Venom are one of the event’s biggest draws. In a separate incident that took place in Barnet, Texas, at around 9am on Saturday, a C-47 loaded with passengers crashed on takeoff from Burnet Municipal Airport. All 13 people survived the crash but seven were injured and one had been badly burned. The aircraft was beginning its trip to Oshkosh when it veered off the runway and into a grass field late during its takeoff sequence. You can see the actual crash below: The C-47 was known as Bluebonnet Belle and belonged to the Highland Lakes Squadron of the Commemorative Air Force. Here is the background on the aircraft as posted on the squadron’s website : “The C-47 “Bluebonnet Belle” on display in our hangar is owned by the Commemorative Air Force. It was built in Oklahoma City in late 1944 as a C-47B serial number 43-49942; then flown to Montreal, Canada where it was transferred to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease program.  The aircraft was ferried to England and served with the RAF. In 1945 it was assigned to the No. 435 Transport Squadron, a Canadian unit as KN270. It was ferried to Canada in 1946. The aircraft received the Canadian Forces serial 12909 in 1970.  It was surplussed and entered civilian service in 1974. From 1974 until 1995, the aircraft was owned by a number of Canadian airline and charter companies, after which it was repatriated to the USA. The Highland Lakes Squadron purchased this aircraft from a Part 135 cargo operator and donated it to the CAF in 2002. While legally airworthy she was in need of a lot of tender loving care. It required a two-year restoration project by the Highland Lakes Squadron to bring the aircraft up to operational standards. Named the “Bluebonnet Belle” in honor of her home base Burnet, Texas, the Bluebonnet Capital of Texas, she is flown by experienced crews and treats air show crowds to the roar of her two mighty Pratt and Whitney radial engines. She serves as a living memorial to the thousands of men and women who built, serviced and flew them during the war years.” Highland Lakes Squadron The NTSB is investigating both incidents. This is a very rough start to the highly anticipated aerial festivities at Oshkosh. Hopefully, it will be smooth flying from here on out. Our best wishes to all who were injured due to these tragic events and our condolences to the family and friends of the perished Venom pilot. Update: 2:15pm PST— The pilot of the Venom has been identified as Martin J. Tibbitts who was a co-founder of the World Heritage Air Museum.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 29, 2019","Watchdog Says USAF Is Wasting F-22s On Patrols And Deployments, Should Consolidate Force","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is reassessing the distribution and structure of its F-22 Raptor units, as well as their assigned missions and deployment schedules, following a highly critical review of how it is utilizing the aircraft from a top Congressional watchdog.  At present, the stealth fighters suffer from low availability rates and their crews have limited time to train for their primary air superiority mission, especially due to having to fly alert missions in defense of the United States, which could lead to a shortage in capability from the already small fleet during any potential high-end conflict. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released the report publicly online on July 19, 2018. It acknowledges that the short-sighted decision to truncate the total purchase of F-22s has exacerbated many of the issues it uncovered and may make certain problems unavoidable to some degree, but makes clear that the Air Force is still not making the most of the Raptors it does have in inventory. “The Air Force’s utilization of its F-22 fleet has limited pilot opportunities to train for air superiority missions in high threat environments,” the reviewers wrote in the executive summary. “Without conducting a comprehensive assessment to identify and assess F-22 organization, the Air Force may be foregoing opportunities to improve the availability of its small yet critical F-22 fleet, and support combatant commander air superiority needs in high threat environments.” The Air Force has divided the fleet up among six combat-coded squadrons, including one in the Air National Guard, each of which has between 18 and 21 primary mission aircraft, along with a small number of additional planes in reserve. There are also two test and evaluation units with Raptors, as well as a formal training unit squadron. The structure and distribution of US Air Force F-22 units., GAO As of the 2016 Fiscal Year, on average, at any given time less than half of the Air Force’s 186 F-22s are mission capable, according to GAO. Only around 125 of those are assigned to combat units in the first place. GAO’s findings into how this has come to be the case fall into two broad categories. The first is that the composition and number of F-22 squadrons create impositions that inherently limit aircraft availability, while the second is that Air Force’s deployment of the Raptors on homeland defense and overseas missions , as well as the demands of various training exercises, take aircraft away from their core mission of air superiority in high-risk environments and degrades pilot proficiency in that regard. Among the problems that the report identifies in that first category, that the F-22’s low-observable coatings are maintenance intensive and require climate-controlled hangars for the aircraft on the ground are inescapable issues. The same goes for the fact that the Air Force is the only operator the type, which is now out of production, anywhere in the world and that its fleet is so small can only limit demand for and availability of other spare parts, as well. In some cases, the service has to make small and costly special orders to obtain critical replacement components. The F-22’s F119 engines , which are also no longer in production, have become an especially problematic maintenance issue, according to the report. The issues go far beyond that, though, and GAO said personnel at one operational location explained it took a 30-week lead time just to obtain a wiring harness for the aircraft. As such, units routinely cannibalize parts from already non-mission capable aircraft to keep others flying. USAF When Raptor production ended in 2011, the Air Force did put the original tooling for the aircraft into storage at Sierra Army Depot in California for the express purpose of making new parts as necessary, according to documentation we at The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. It is unclear whether the Air Force lets contractors use that equipment for these small runs of components or if they simply turn over the design specifications. This raises a question not found in the public GAO review about whether the service is making the most of any in-house capability, even if it were to be contractor-operated, to help with supply chain issues. But while these issues may be, at least in part, out of the Air Force’s hands, decisions that it has made itself have only exacerbated the problems. With small squadrons at numerous different bases, the service has to replicate the complex and costly support infrastructure required for the F-22 at each location. For instance, this means that every base has to have climate controlled hangars, facilities to maintain the jet’s stealthy coatings, and stocks of replacement parts on hand. GAO found, not surprisingly, that operational units at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, both of which have two squadrons of Raptors apiece, had higher availability rates than the single squadrons at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. Differences in availability rates between locations with two F-22 squadrons versus one., GAO The 199th Fighter Squadron in Hawaii is also both the smallest of the operational units and the most detached from outside support. Officials there told GAO that if they had just 4 additional F-22s, they’d be able to increase the total number of sorties they could fly by more than 30 percent. It is also important to note that Tyndall actually has two squadrons when the training unit at the base gets taken into account and has the largest number of F-22s of any one site, yet the operational squadron’s readiness still lags behind the units at Langley and Elmendorf-Richardson. GAO’s analysis curiously doesn’t take the additional presence at the base into account and doesn’t explain the discrepancy. Beyond the actual disposition of the squadrons, the Air Force’s practice of deploying force packages with a third or fewer of a squadron’s Raptors, but with more than half of a squadron’s personnel means that routine maintenance and other tasks suffer for the portion of the unit that remains at its home base. This, in turn, makes it unclear whether or not the squadrons would even be able to deploy as cohesive units if necessary during a major crisis. An F-22 at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska., USAF This all feeds into the second category of issues dealing with how the Air Force operates the jets it can put into the air. Existing operational demands mean that F-22 pilots simply do not have enough time to train and remain proficient in high-end air-to-air combat. “An Air Force analysis conducted in 2016 determined that, based on current aircraft availability rates, pilots in an F-22 squadron with 21 primary mission aircraft need 270 days of home station training each year to meet their minimum annual continuation training requirements,” GAO noted. This isn’t happening and, on average across squadrons of all sizes, Raptor pilots get approximately 191 hours of training. GAO acknowledged that pilot and other personnel shortages , among other issues , meant that units across the Air Force were having trouble meeting training requirements regardless of aircraft type, but said that these issues were especially pronounced among F-22 squadrons. “One squadron identified training shortfalls in its primary missions for four consecutive years in its annual training reports,” the review said. The loss of training time can quickly have a cascading impact. The longer a pilot goes without taking the appropriate amount of time to train, the longer it can take to get them back to the necessary skill level. By the service’s own appraisal, it can reportedly take between seven and eight years for pilots to fully master the F-22. The high number of scheduled exercises at other bases for F-22 squadrons and their high demands for “red air” adversaries to fly against – a higher requirement than exists for training pilots in fourth-generation aircraft such as the F-15C Eagle and F-16C/D Viper – only make things worse. On average, a Raptor pilot can expect to face off against a mock opponent between 145 and 171 times each year, while F-15C pilots might only do so 45 to 73 times annually, according to GAO. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6HDIKOtS9to But by far the biggest factor limiting training opportunities was tasking F-22s to fly alert missions from their home stations and sending them on overseas deployments to support operations in Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan . None of those operational activities necessarily require the F-22’s stealth characteristics or other advanced capabilities as an absolute necessity and fourth generation aircraft fly similar missions to the Raptors in nearly every instance . It’s debatable how relevant any real-world experience the pilots gain from these missions is when considering their primary role performing offensive and defensive air-to-air operations in a high-end conflict. F-22s fly alert missions in a non-stealthy configuration complete with external fuel tanks and radar reflectors. GAO also says that the Air Force informed it that the Raptors flying in the Middle East and Central Asia were primarily flying close air support, which is not even officially a secondary mission for the aircraft. However, this makes little sense given previous reports that indicate the jets have been conducting combat air patrols and interdiction missions against fixed targets. The F-22’s official primary and secondary missions, according to the US Air Force., GAO As of 2015, Air Force officials were confusingly and incorrectly using close air support and interchangeably on the record, as I reported at the time for War Is Boring, which could explain GAO’s description of F-22 operations in both theaters. Regardless, Raptor pilots must train in the skill sets required for those mission sets, which further reduces the time they have to spend keeping sharp in more demanding air-to-air combat tactics In yet another admission of how poor the decision to cut back purchases of F-22s have been, one of GAO’s first recommendations to help alleviate these issues was to restart Raptor production. Since the Air Force has categorically rejected this idea , the reviewers identified a number of other places where the service could look to improve the situation. USAF Their suggestions included assigning other aircraft to the homeland defense mission, removing F-22s from exercises where their participation isn’t absolutely necessary, and scaling back the aircraft’s participation in current conflicts that don’t require its capabilities. At the same time, the report recommended that the Air Force look into consolidating units within the United States, creating a more productive deployment mechanism that doesn’t leave aircraft at their home station without key support, and increasing the availability of aggressors, either within the service itself or through contractors , to meet the needs of Raptor units during training. “Unless the Air Force takes steps to assess and make necessary adjustments to the current organization and use of its F-22s, F-22 units are likely to continue to experience aircraft availability and pilot training rates that are below what they could be,” GAO wrote in its conclusion. “As a result, the Air Force may be incurring increased risks in future operations in high threat areas.” The Air Force has officially concurred with the GAO’s assessment and says it is now looking into its options. The fact that the USAF is taking the findings seriously is a very good sign, because, frankly, they sound incredibly relevant and logical. In fact, consolidation of the F-22 force has happened before. Raptors that were assigned to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, once the master base for F-117 Nighthawk operations, were realigned to Tyndall in Florida, with the last Raptor leaving the base in 2014. F-16s were transferred to Holloman to take the place of the F-22s. Another round of Raptor consolidation makes a lot of sense, but the question of what units would get moved comes into play. The Hawaii Air National Guard and their F-22s seem like the most logical unit to pull the Raptors from. The base supports a single squadron and the same role could be fulfilled by F-15s as it once was. But those Eagles would have to come from somewhere and the USAF is currently mulling eliminating the entire F-15C/D fleet as a whole and replacing those jets with upgraded F-16s. USAF Even more drastic measures could be taken, such as removing all F-22s from Elmendorf-Richardson and replacing those aircraft with updated F-16s, as well. The F-35 may be another option, though GAO notes in its report that the Air Force has no plans at present to use the Joint Strike Fighters for the alert mission. This, of course, could easily change as more of those jets enter service. At the very least, the alert commitment should be taken off the F-22’s back in Alaska. The mission sucks up three to four jets at any given time and the training requirements required to execute it also eats into the Raptor’s core mission syllabus. The alert role could be assigned to a stateside Air National Guard unit, which is not an uncommon practice. Even years after California’s 144th Fighter Wing converted to F-15s, the ‘Lobos’ F-16s of the South Dakota Air National Guard still sit alert at March Air Reserve Base, although that commitment is finally coming to an end soon. Also, when the F-15 Eagle was grounded for months in the late 2000s, F-16 units provided detachments of jets and crews to fulfill alert capacity across the United States, including in Alaska. Maybe a better solution, at least logistically speaking, would be to increase the aircraft inventory and pilot roster of the 18th Aggressor Squadron based at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. The unit could then provide alert aircraft and crews at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage. The F-16 unit is heavily tasked with adversary support duties, but not with operational missions, so there should be more flexibility in adding the alert mission than in other fighter units that are called on for operational deployments. In fact, the unit’s sister squadron, 64th Aggressor Squadron based at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, has this exact secondary mission during a time of crisis. 18th AGRS F-16C/Ds., USAF Then again, if the Hawaii Air National Guard were to relinquish their F-22s and those jets moved to Elmendorf as a third Raptor squadron bedded down there, the resources required to execute the alert mission may not be as big of a hindrance as they are now. And although the GAO report discounts putting the Raptor back into production, it doesn’t take into account the fact that Japan may be willing to do just that, albeit in a much-upgraded form. We have written about this opportunity in detail , one that the Air Force would be nuts not to jump on. In doing so, they would make the whole project far more fiscally feasible for Japan as well. It would be a win-win and would solve the service’s capacity gap when it comes to its top-of-the-line thoroughbred fighter force. The fate of the Air Force’s F-15C/D community, as well as the possibility that the service could buy new-build F-15s from Boeing under the F-15X designation , also plays into all this. But just because the flying force could buy more Eagles, it doesn’t mean that doing so would be money wisely spent. We will be addressing this issue in detail in the coming days, so stay tuned for that. Regardless, the GAO has given the USAF a dose of much-needed medicine in regards to how they arrange, employ, and sustain their regrettably tiny F-22 fleet. We’ll have to wait and see if they actually act on the report’s findings, but if they do, it could very well be part of a much grander reshuffling of tactical air power that could end up with major changes in fighter capacity elsewhere.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 16, 2019","CVN-81, The Fourth Ford Class Supercarrier, Is Slated To Cost A Whopping $15B","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The cost of an American nuclear-powered supercarrier has risen massively with the introduction of the Ford class and there doesn’t appear to be any relief in sight even as the design matures and is reproduced. Updated cost estimates were published in the Congressional Research Agency’s latest report to Congress on the Ford class carrier program that was released on July 2nd, 2018. It comes as USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-79), already the most expensive ship ever built, continues to face major developmental issues and unforeseen cost overruns. USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), procured in 2008 and already in testing, is now calculated to cost $13B. That is roughly double the cost of the last Nimitz class carrier built, the USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77), including inflation. USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79), procured in 2013 and is currently deep in the construction process, is now calculated to cost $11.3B. USS Enterprise. (CVN-80), procured this year and is still in the very early stages of construction, is projected to cost $12.6B. The yet to be named CVN-81 is slated to leap in price to just over $15B. The last of the Nimitz class and the first of the Ford class in port at Norfolk, Virginia. , USN It’s worth noting that the figures are in then-year dollars (based on procurement date) but inflation alone does not justify the increase in cost. The original idea was that the cost would decline after the first Ford class ship and also keep in mind these figures do not include research and development, which represents many billions of additional dollars. It’s not exactly clear why CVN-81 will cost $2.5B more than its predecessor, but that is a massive increase. Overall the numbers are staggering across the board, with little to no savings realized as the design matures. It’s possible that the part of the increase in cost—or at least the lack of savings on successive ships—may be in part due to the fact that there will be some differences between them. The Dual Band Radar (DBR) mounted on the Ford has proven to be problematic and it will only exist on the USS Gerald R. Ford and a truncated version of it will be installed on the Navy’s three Zumwalt class destroyers . This reality could make it very expensive to support and limit the upgrades and expanded capabilities it receives in the future. A more modular and updated radar system, the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR), will outfit American aircraft carriers and their amphibious assault ship cousins from Kennedy on in two distinct variants. One will have three arrays (instead of six on the DBR) and is intended for static mounting on the Ford class’s island superstructure. The other will have a single rotating array that will be installed on America class (from LHA-8 on) and LX(R) amphibious assault ships. But beyond the radar system, small changes between carriers in a class are nothing new, and the spike in cost happens after Kennedy , not before. Regardless, these ships are not going to get any cheaper and that is probably the most important takeaway from this report. Congress will have to make decisions on accelerating the rate at which is procures supercarriers in an effort to realize a 12 ship fleet in the coming decades. Currently, just ten nuclear carriers are active in the Navy’s inventory. The idea is that by the late 2020s this number will increase to 11, but President Trump says he wants 12 , and that isn’t an unheard of point-of-view in defense policy circles. But getting there will be expensive and it will require an accelerated shipbuilding schedule. The CRS report reads: “Another issue for Congress for FY2019 concerns the date for achieving the Navy’s 12-ship force level goal for aircraft carriers. As noted earlier, under the Navy’s FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan, carrier procurement would shift from 5-year centers to 4-year centers after the procurement of CVN-82 in FY2028, and a 12-carrier force would be achieved on a sustained basis in the 2060s. As also noted earlier, shifting carrier procurement to 3- or 3.5-year centers could achieve a12-carrier fleet as soon as the 2030s, unless the service lives of one or more existing carriers were extended. Other things held equal, procuring carriers on 3- or 3.5-year centers rather than 4-year centers would increase Navy funding requirements during the period of the 30-year shipbuilding plan for procuring aircraft carriers and for operating and supporting a 12-carrier force rather than a force of 11 or fewer carriers.” The possibility of extending the life of existing Nimitz class carriers is being examined to help boost the Navy’s carrier fleet, but doing so will result in increased fiscal requirements for sustaining and upgrading those vessels. Doing this while also accelerating procurement of new carriers will just add to budgetary demands. USN Also, Congress will need to decide on approving a two or three block buy of carriers, or at least long-lead materials needed for their construction, in order to ramp up output and achieve any benefits of scale. A block buy would also make it much harder for Congress to slash carrier output in the future if the defense budget were to retract. Considering how political and special interest-laden shipbuilding is—in some ways, it is the ultimate Pentagon pork—a block carrier buy is looking more likely than not at this point. Amazingly, shock trials for CVN-78 still have not been fully approved and funded, and that critical test could be foisted on the second ship in the Ford class years in the future. This is so laughably stupid and reckless that I really don’t need to provide any more commentary on it than I already have . But realize that the fourth of these vessels could be under construction by the time they shock test the design. Additionally, none of this confronts the major deficiencies in many of Ford’s critical components that I have been reporting on for years and that continue to plague the ship even though the Navy’s mouthpieces work hard to act otherwise. The glaring lack of available data alone on the current performance of these systems in relation to their threshold requirements is concerning in itself. The report doesn’t detail the growing cost of reworking and fixing issues with Ford following a series of shakedown cruises. $62.9M was just requested to fix a number of these problems. According to Defensenews.com , they include: * $12.7 million to fix “continuing technical deficiencies” with the Advanced Weapon Elevators. * $30 million for “tooling and repair” of the main thrust bearings, issues that the Navy has blamed on the manufacturer. * $20 million for additional repairs, a prolonged post-shakedown availabilty, and parts and labor. The ship also suffered a second thrust bearing failure during tests earlier this year, requiring it to return to port. This was blamed on a manufacturing defect. The ship’s voltage regulators have also been a source a frustration. Then, in May , the carrier had to return to port shortly after setting sail due to issues with providing adequate steam to spin its four massive propellers. Once again, these issues are in addition to the larger problems with the vessel’s major components dating back many years. With all this in mind, the big question is when will the ship be able to actually enter operational service and meet its threshold requirements and how much will it cost to get it there? All this also impacts the future USS John F. Kennedy as its construction continues to move forward. Finally, and unsurprisingly considering what this report highlights, it also brings up the congressionally mandated study ordered to explore the possibility of building smaller, less expensive and less complex aircraft carriers instead of just nuclear supercarriers. I have long posited that building smaller carriers will be critical to maintaining a flexible and fiscally sustainable carrier force. You can read my detailed case for such an initiative here , here , here , here , and here . The RAND study was commissioned in 2015, delivered in 2016 in classified form, and was published publically in 2017. Its executive summary is pasted directly into this CRS report and for good reason. There has been little action on this document since it emerged. This is likely a result of a far more generous defense budget and the end of sequester under President Trump. But the current defense budget levels are unsustainable and looking toward a mixed fleet of supercarriers and smaller carriers may not be a choice but a necessity in the years to come. But at present, the U.S. Navy continues to buy only supercarriers for its traditional fixed-wing naval airpower needs and the cost of those ships is approaching the entire yearly defense budget of Canada, each.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 21, 2018",Marines Conduct First Field Test Of ‘Non-Lethal’ Mortar Rounds Full of Flash-Bangs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise, or RIMPAC , typically offers an opportunity for the U.S. military as a whole, as well as its foreign allies, to test out new , unusual , and still-in-development capabilities. The most recent iteration of the event saw the first-ever field test of an 81mm mortar round that’s supposed to disperse crowds and distract opponents rather than kill anyone, which could be extremely valuable for American forces taking part in peacekeeping, humanitarian relief, embassy defense , or even combat missions. According to Stars and Stripes , Marines from 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment fired 56 prototype Non-Lethal Indirect Fire Munitions (NL-IDFM) at the Pohakuloa Training Area in Hawaii earlier in July 2018. The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate, the Pentagon’s centralized less-than-lethal project office , is in charge of the program, which has included input and support from all of the services. “Currently, the armed forces are unable to deliver non-lethal effects at extended ranges,” Michael Markowitch, an engineer at the Army’s Picatinny Arsenal said in 2016 shortly after he and his colleagues received a patent for the 81mm mortar projectile’s design. “Our goal was to develop a mortar that would be capable of delivering a non-lethal payload at ranges typical of mortar systems.” The round’s design, as it stands now, consists of a modified 81mm M853A1 illumination shell body containing 14 submunitions. Each one of these is a stun grenade, or “ flash-bang ,” that delivers a painful 180 decibel bang – which could cause permanent hearing loss if a person had to endure it for a sustained period – and a blinding 1 million candela burst of light – a common candle gives off about one candela for comparison – to anyone in a five foot radius. An annotated cutaway of the NL-IDFM mortar projectile showing its major components., US Army When the round hits an altitude of around 650 feet, it breaks in half, with parachutes pulling it apart at both ends. The flash-bangs, each with a streamer tail to slow their descent, then fall onto the target area. Engineers added delay fuzes in each one of the submunitions to do their best to makes sure they hit the ground before going off for maximum effect. A single round can effectively cover an area of more than 4,000 square feet, according to the Army . Otherwise, the NL-IDFM functions the same way as a standard M853A1. It has a range of between 490 and 1,640 yards, depending on the number of propelling charges the mortar crew attaches to the round. An annotated image from an earlier test showing the NL-IDFM in action., US Army This is a significant stand-off range compared to most less-than-lethal systems, which typically require the operator to be extremely close to their target. As such, it could expand U.S. forces options short of using lethal force in a variety of scenarios. The most obvious would be if a small number of American troops found themselves trapped by a potentially violent crowd of civilians during a non-combat or combat mission . Rather than having to wait for additional support, a length of time where tensions and the possibility of making a deadly mistake could increase, they could quickly call for a less-than-lethal fire mission and then attempt to leave the area. The rounds could also be valuable in protecting an embassy or other U.S. government facility abroad during a period of civil unrest , a mission the U.S. Marine Corps, in particular, is often called on to perform . Troops can employ the NL-IDFM “selectively” in order to “deny an area, warn or move individuals, and suppress threats,” according to an official Marine Corps fact sheet. So, instead of relying on short-range systems to deter individuals once they’ve gotten close to the site itself, troops could seek to dissuade crowds that might be blocks away from even getting near the buildings. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6oaRU0ilT-8 There might even be a role for the rounds in more traditional combat situations. The light and noise could easily draw the attention of enemy forces away from the main force of an attack at a critical moment or otherwise confuse and disorient them. “They’ll be disoriented … and while their heads are hunkered down making sense of what happened we can assault,” U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Joshua Jackson, in charge of one of 1-3rd Marines’ smaller 60mm mortar sections, told Stars and Stripes after the evaluation during RIMPAC. “It would be much more effective at night … once that flash goes off you’re going to be night blind.” There are also plans for additional features to go into the final design. As of 2016, there were also plans to add an invisible marking dye, visible only under an ultraviolet lamp or “blacklight,” which personnel could use to identify violent protesters who might flee the scene. A description of the desired marking dye capability from a 2016 US Army briefing. , US Army This could also be useful in a limited combat operation to uncover insurgents who might disperse after a firefight and go back into hiding among the local population. The U.S. Navy briefly considered a similar concept during the Vietnam War using what unfortunately turned out to be a carcinogenetic chemiluminescent chemical. The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate has also expressed an interest in the past in developing a similar round for 60mm mortars, too. In the mid-2000s, the Army even experimented with a 155mm howitzer shell that featured a payload of what were essentially over-sized stink bombs . The service never revealed exactly what compound or compounds it used in these experimental XM1063 Non-Lethal Personnel Suppression Projectiles or what they smelled like, but they fired off the last of them in a test sometime between 2006 and 2007, according to information I previously obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. This effectively ended that program and the Army does not appear to have revisited it since then. The U.S. military did have tear gas artillery shells in inventory for a time, but finally disposed of them completely in the 1990s. A description of the XM1063 155mm Non-Lethal Personnel Suppression Projectile., US Army Unfortunately, as with any less-than-lethal system, the NL-IDFM program has struggled to find the right mix of useful effects while still ensuring that the rounds won’t seriously injure or kill individuals in the target area. The U.S. military has been working on the project in one form or another since 2000 and there were two previous tests of the shells in a more controlled environment in 2014. By that time, engineers had settled on the flash-bang payload over a host of different options, including whistles, smoke and tear gas canisters, and substances that produced unbearably bad odors, indicating that it provided the best combination of safety and utility. The dual-parachute concept also prevents individuals below from getting showed by parts of the mortar shell body after it breaks open. Wind tunnel models of proposed 81mm less-than-lethal mortar shell body and fin designs circa 2000., US Army The tests at Pohakuloa show that the system still needs more work, with Marines reporting that approximately one in 10 rounds did not function properly. According to Stars and Stripes , the shells wobbled oddly in flight, as well, and the parachutes did not always seem to deploy completely. Nathan Rush, a munitions capabilities integration officer, told Stripe that there are at least six more months of developmental tests left to go, followed by an estimated two years of qualification testing. The goal is for the round to go into mass production in 2021, which will be more than two decades after the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate first started working on the concept. Hopefully, U.S. troops won’t have to wait much longer for what could be a useful and novel capability to add to their existing options for tackling complicated operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 26, 2019",Army To Replace M249 SAWs With New Squad Automatic Rifles Only In ‘Close-Combat’ Units,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army says, at least at present, it is only considering doling out new squad automatic weapons to front-line or “close-combat” units, while rear echelon elements would continue to use their existing M249 Squad Automatic Weapons for the foreseeable future. This comes soon after the service announced it had picked five companies to supply prototype designs, one of which could begin entering service as early as 2022. Military.com was first to report the new details about which soldiers might get the guns after an interview with U.S. Army Lieutenant General Paul Ostrowski, the Principal Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, earlier in July 2018. The service announced it had awarded developmental contracts to Textron System’s AAI Corporation division, FN America , General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems , PCP Tactical , and Sig Sauer as part of what it officially calls the Next Generation Squad Automatic Rifle (NGSAR) program on June 25, 2017. This notice on FedBizOpps , the U.S. government’s main contracting website, did not say what weapons each of these firms would submit. “This is not for every soldier,” Ostrowski told Military.com. “We are looking at it for 100,000 close-combat soldiers.” The Army started the NGSAR effort, which is ostensibly aimed at replacing the M249, in May 2017 and it has become a major priority for the Army’s Soldier Lethality Cross-Functional Team, or CFT. This organization is part of the service’s new Futures Command , which has the main objective of connecting service members, subject matter experts, and industry representatives to explore and develop new systems and technologies across a number of different functional areas . A US Army soldier fires an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon., US Army As such, the Army has given relatively basic requirements to the five competitors. “We have given them our priorities and said ‘innovate,’ and these companies are doing it,” Ostrowski said. The empty weapon, consisting of the gun itself, a sling, a bipod, and a sound suppressor – an increasingly default accessory across the U.S. military – should weigh 12 pounds or less. The Army says that appropriate optical sights, aiming lights and lasers, and other “fire control” systems, which have to be suitable for use during the day or at night, shouldn’t add more than three more pounds to the system. For comparison, a standard M249 with a full-size 20-inch barrel and fixed, polymer buttstock is approximately 17 pounds. The new weapon, with the suppressor attached and any folding or collapsible buttstock extended, also has to be 35 inches at most, which is more than five inches shorter than the SAW. The suppressed weapon has to have a muzzle flash 80 percent less bright than the existing M249 and be no more than 140 decibels loud to the shooter. The latter requirement is a very modest goal, comparable to the sound of a jet engine at takeoff. The Army’s desired requirements for the NGSAR as of April 2018., US Army The Army wants the guns to be relatively accurate and user-friendly, with a shooter able to keep all their shots within a 14-inch circle out to around 440 yards. Soldiers must be able to, using an optic, engage a man-sized target at 55 yards within two to four seconds and hit them with more than half the shots from a three-to-five round burst. We don’t know whether these requirements are specifically for shooting the weapon prone from a bipod or offhand while standing up or kneeling, but it is likely there are other parameters that did not make it into the public documentation. The gun also has to be able to withstand sustained fire. For the NGSAR program, the Army has defined this as firing at least 60 rounds every minute for 15 minutes without needing a barrel change or getting hot enough to cause the ammunition inside the gun to “cook-off” and fire inadvertently. The ammunition the guns use is one of, if not the most significant requirement and the one that the Army has been the most tight-lipped about. The stated requirements simply say that it has to weight 20 percent less than an equivalent brass-cased cartridge in the same caliber. Some of PCP Tactical’s lightweight ammunition, which uses polymer cartridge bodies and a metal base. The firm says that these cartridges are 30 percent lighter than their equivalents with full brass cases., PCP Tactical It is almost certain that the Army is primarily interested in a so-called “ intermediate cartridge ,” rather than the standard 5.56x45mm ammunition the M249 SAW uses now. This category of rifle and machine gun ammunition typically has ballistic characteristics that fall between 5.56x45mm and larger cartridges such as 7.62x51mm, with various 6mm types being the most common. “We know that the 5.56mm is not going to be the round of the future because we have issues associated with adversaries’ body armor,” Lieutenant General Ostrowski made clear to Military.com. In 2017, the Army also briefly considered buying a small number of 7.62x51mm rifles for certain infantry units to address the threat of improving individual armor among potential high-end adversaries, such as Russia and China. But there’s no apparent firm stipulation on what the prospective vendors have to do to reach these ammunition weight and lethality goals, either. Of all five competitors, AAI does seem to be particularly well positioned to begin with given its wealth of experience working with the Army on advanced ammunition, including cased-telescoped and caseless rounds. The former involves burying the actual bullet deep inside the case together with the gun powder, reducing its overall length and subsequently the necessary length of the weapon itself. Experimental AAI-developed cased-telescoped rounds, at top, and caseless ammunition, below, US Army AAI has already built and demonstrated experimental squad automatic weapons and standard infantry rifles that use the cased telescoped rounds. The NGSAR program has reportedly been using the company’s weapons as testbeds already. This doesn’t rule out significant challenges from the other competitors, though. According to Army documents that The Firearms Blog obtained , the service rated AAI’s weapon in a middle “blue” tier in both terms of both the maturity of the concept and feasibility for large-scale production, reflecting its still largely experimental design. US Army ratings for the various proposals. The Army selected FN’s “adaptive” option, explained later in this story, over its “lightweight” offering., US Army via The Firearms Blog “Some will probably come with a polymer case that looks just like a current 5.56mm round except there won’t be as much brass [and] some will come with a polymer case that is of the non-traditional form,” Ostrowski explained. “We don’t know. We are allowing [companies] to make that decision.” Only PCP Tactical’s proposal was rated “green,” or especially viable, in both categories. While we don’t know what the Florida-headquartered firm proposed, it’s major business is polymer-cased lightweight ammunition rather than firearms themselves. It seems very likely that they have pitched a conversion of an existing design, to use larger, but lighter rounds in an intermediate caliber such as 6.8mm. The Mk 48 Mod 1 , a 7.62x51mm derivative of the M249, could be an ideal, in-service starting place for this design. AAI’s experimental cased-telescoped squad automatic rifle in front of the one chambered for the caseless ammunition. A prototype cased-telescoped carbine, similar to the standard M4A1, is behind and to the right., Joseph Trevithick General Dynamics has similarly been working with the U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Marine Corps on a new machine gun that fits in between existing 7.62x51mm and .50 caliber weapons. It might be leverage aspects of this the increasingly mature Lightweight Medium Machine Gun (LWMMG) in developing a much more compact weapon that meets the NGSAR requirements. The Army also rated this firm’s concept as “green,” but put the feasibility of production into the middle “blue” category. Sig Sauer was the only other company to receive a “green” rating on its concept, but again had a “blue” assessment when it came to feasibility. It seems almost certain that the company pitched a design based in some way on its increasingly popular MCX brand of rifles and carbines. General Dynamics’ LWMMG., Joseph Trevithick These are derivatives of the AR-15/M16 platform, but feature a physical gas piston to move the internals rather than using the older “ direct impingement ” system that blows actual propellant gas into the middle of the gun to cycle the action. Many believe the piston offers superior reliability and requires less maintenance since it keeps particulate matter out of the weapon’s inner workings. We have no idea whether Sig Sauer proposed a belt-feed conversion or the existing magazine fed system, which can also accept high-capacity drums. It is worth noting that the U.S. Marine Corps has found it acceptable to replace select M249s within its units with the magazine-fed M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR), a version of Heckler and Koch’s HK 416 rifle . That rifle uses a similar operating concept as the MCX. https://youtube.com/watch?v=GuORTk8CqPw Thanks to an official company press release , we actually know that Belgian firm FN’s U.S.-based subsidiary proposed a version of that company’s Heat Adaptive Modular Rifle , or HAMR. This is a derivative of the company’s SCAR-series , which is in service with U.S. special operations forces units. HAMR, which FN submitted as a contender for the Marine Corps’ IAR competition, differs from the standard rifles in that it has a heavier barrel and features a special system that switches from so-called “closed bolt” to “open bolt” operation as the weapon gets hotter. It’s not entirely clear how this system works, but this entry was the only concept the Army rated “yellow.” The FN HAMR., FN America In closed bolt operation, the gun’s resting position is with the action locked in place with a round in the chamber. The open bolt state locks the bolt to the rear after a shooter stops firing, allowing the action to cool faster and eliminating the possibility of a cartridge cooking off. We also don’t know how much HAMR shares with the other SCAR-series weapons, but that could be an added advantage for FN. In August 2017, the Army told prospective manufacturers that during the 2019 Fiscal Year it would decide whether or not the NGSAR would also be suitable as a “squad designated marksman, medium machine gun, and the carbine,” according to a contracting document. This means the gun, or variants thereof, could actually serve as the basis for a replacement for M4A1 carbines , M110 designated marksman rifles , and other systems. The medium machine gun concept would be new, but it is one that U.S. Special Operations Command is already investigating . The top special operations headquarters is interested in a 6.5mm gun that would fill a capability gap between the M249 and similar guns and larger 7.62x51mm weapons such as the Mk 48 and M240. A US Navy SEAL wields a Mk 48 machine gun., USN It is very possible that at least some of the NGSAR entrants are looking to submit proposals for that program, as well. It would make sense to try and pitch a weapon that could share a common logistics chain with the much larger Army program, both in terms of ammunition and spare parts. Any commonality with existing systems could be a boon, too. “Our 5.56mm is going to be in our inventory for a long time,” Ostrowski added. This makes a certain amount logistical and fiscal sense since the Army still has millions of rounds of this ammunition and hundreds of thousands of guns chambered to fire it. If the Army keeps to its plans to make a decision on the additional variants in the 2019 fiscal cycle, which begins on Oct. 1, 2018, we might not have to wait much longer to see how this program evolves. Ostrowski also indicated to Military.com that the project was on track to see the first weapons go to combat units in 2022, though this could end up pushed back to 2023. That would still be two years earlier than the service had planned just as of 2017. In the meantime, we will definitely keep keeping our eyes open for any new information about the various proposals, any one of which could become the Army’s next squad automatic weapon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 26, 2019","The World’s Oldest Active Fighter Pilot, A Grandfather Of Four, Retires","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When talking about fighter pilots, 40s to early 50s is usually considered really old. Just like pro athletes, there seems to be a shelf-life for what the body can endure when it comes to this kind of work. Flying high-performance tactical jets looks like an incredibly fun and mentally challenging occupation, but in the cockpit, it is a physically brutal and painful task that can press human physiology to the brink. With this in mind, it’s not inaccurate to say, that generally speaking, flying fighters is a young person’s game. But there are exceptions to this rule , and one of them is an extreme outlier to say the least—Royal Australian Air Force Squadron Leader Phillip Frawley. Frawley has held the Guinness World Record for the oldest active fighter pilot for years now—the previous holder was a 60-year-old Israeli F-16 pilot. Frawley is now 66 years of age, and his record has become more impressive with each passing year. A grandfather of four and an avid surfer who has served with the RAAF for just shy of 50 years, Frawley started his career as an instrument fitter’s apprentice in the RAAF back 1969. In 1974 he entered pilot training. After getting his wings he failed to get a fighter slot, but went on to fly C-130 Hercules transports. Still, Frawley dreamed of fast jets. In a recent piece published by the RAAF, Frawley states: “Flew the Hercules for five years, thoroughly enjoyed that but always wanted to be a fighter pilot. So I reapplied and came back to Williamtown after I was successful, second time around. Then I served five years on Mirages and spent another two and a half years at Point Cook as an instructor, then back to Williamtown, this time instructing on Macchi’s and then I was onto F/A-18s. Flew F/A-18s for another five years.” With a true talent for training other fast jet pilots, he went on to command RAAF’s 76 Squadron at RAAF Base Willamtown and served a stint in Saudi Arabia as well. By 2002 he returned to 76 Squadron as a reservist and has spent the last 16 years flying Hawk 127 lead-in fighter trainers with the unit. The squadron not only trains future RAAF fighter pilots, but it also provides an aggressor capacity for Australian Naval ships and Hornet and Super Hornet crews. It also helps forward air controllers master their deadly art. In total, Frawley has trained 499 pilots and has amassed a whopping 10,000 hours of flying time. That is a gargantuan amount for a military pilot, and especially for one that spent most of that time in tactical jets. Phil in a Hawk 127., fighterjet.com.au In a 2014 interview for Manspace , the veteran fighter pilot noted: “It’s definitely a unique occupation but not for me. I’ve been doing it for 40-odd years and I consider it a bit of an addiction because I can’t get enough. It’s going to be a sad day when I get kicked out of the gate for the last time. … The older I get, the more one-eyed I become about what I do. I am just so wrapped up in flying. If I go on leave I can’t wait to get back. It never really feels like I’m at work. … Flying is definitely my outlet. It’s hard work but it’s also very satisfying. There are a lot of checks to do in the cockpit before and during flying. I guess I’d compare it to the likes of a carpenter confronted by a really hard job. He reaps the benefits in completing the task to a high standard. For me also, it’s about instructing the kids. I get the satisfaction out of seeing them later in life when they are fully blown Hornet pilots.” For a guy that has been around the RAAF for the majority of its existence, he has seen a lot change, but it’s the little things that can be most challenging to adapt to: “For me, within the area of fighter flying, the tactics have evolved over many, many years as the platforms have become more and more complex and more capable… For me as an instructor, it takes a bit more practice to deal with that digital stuff.” If you were a student struggling to wrap your brain around all the intricacies of flying and fighting in a tactical jet, imagine how great it would be to have this guy in the backseat giving you pointers? When it comes to flying fighters, nothing counts more than experience in the cockpit. Age is such a relative thing really. I know 65-year-olds that seem younger than some 35-year-olds. But society seems to value youth above all else these days when historically it has been the other way around. Master fighter pilot builder Phillip Frawley proves that age doesn’t need to stop you from doing something you love, and wisdom can be a far more precious commodity than youth. You can read more about this 66-year-old fighter pilot over at his blog, which has some awesome posts, including one on flying the Hawk 127 and another on the time Frawley accidentally went into pressure-suit territory in a Mirage fighter. You can also go fly with him ! In his spare time, aside from surfing and making speaking appearances, he puts on air shows and takes people on adventure flights in an L39 and does civilian flight instruction. “I still get a massive buzz from flying. You just get so good at it after a while that it becomes second nature, like driving a car. I’ll continue to fly as long as it’s fun because if it isn’t fun, what’s the point?” Enjoy your retirement from flying sir, and enjoy the flying!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russia Releases Videos Offering An Unprecedented Look At Its Six New Super Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has released new footage of all six of the advanced weapon systems that President Vladimir Putin revealed in an impassioned speech in March 2018. The goal seems to be to prove that there are physical prototypes of each one, but questions remain about how close any of the systems, especially the Poseidon long-range nuclear-armed torpedo and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered and armed cruise missile, are to actually entering service. The Russian Ministry of Defense posted the clips on YouTube on July 19, 2018. In contrast to previous imagery the country has shown of the weapons involved, in many cases, censors blurred or otherwise obscured certain components, as well as identifying markings on the systems. The new imagery also comes after a controversial summit between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump that reportedly included discussions about existing and future arms control agreements . “I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country’s development: all what you wanted to impede with your policies have already happened,” Putin had said in his state of the union-style address on March 1, 2018. “You have failed to contain Russia.” A closeup of the nuclear-powered cruise missile…sort of The most interesting video of the group is one that offers the first official close-up look at the Burevestnik cruise missile , which reportedly uses a nuclear-powered engine to give it essentially unlimited range. The weapons are heavily obscured in the video, hidden inside launch canisters and under tarps, and censors blocked out additional information in post-production. We do get a good sense of the missile’s overall side, though, which seems surprisingly small given the scale of previous designs for nuclear-powered air-breathing engines for aircraft and missiles. From what we can see, the missile has a large, high-mounted main wing over its mid-section that pops out after launch and smaller stabilizers at the rear. It also has a very angular nose cone, suggesting that it may have some level of low-observability. Its immense range would already allow it to skirt defenses and avoid detection, but this could make it even more difficult for an adversary to spot it and try and shoot it down as it penetrates into contested airspace. “The missile’s component makeup is being improved based on clarified requirements, while ground tests continue and preparations are being made for experimental flight tests of the improved missile,” a Russian Defense Ministry official told reporters on July 19, 2018, according to state-run outlet TASS . “In the meantime, launching systems are also being designed, while technological processes to manufacture, assemble and test the missile are being improved.” It remains unclear exactly what sort of progress the Russians are actually making on this system. Previous reports, citing unnamed U.S. intelligence officials, said that the initial tests had been failures . More recent information suggests that the Kremlin may not even be testing the design with the nuclear powerplant yet, which would make sense. A conventionally powered version would allow the Russians to continue working on other aspects of the system and then integrate the new reactor-powered engine when and if it becomes viable. Still, we at The War Zone have already examined the potential hazards of doing so at all in detail . There is also a question about whether or not the Burevestnik will violate the bilateral U.S.-Russia Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , which bans both nuclear and conventional ground-launched missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles. The weapon would occupy a gray area since it will be able to fly well beyond those distances, as well as being able to hit targets less than 3,420 miles away. The Kremlin could easily get around this issue entirely by mounting the final weapon on a naval platform, which the agreement doesn’t cover at all . A capture from the newly released video showing a Burevestnik in a launch canister, as well as other examples under tarps in the background. , Russian MoD See the Poseidon torpedo’s propeller spin…kind of The views of the Poseidon long-range torpedo, previously known as Kanyon or Status-6 , are even more unique. Censors blocked out the weapon’s propeller, but one can still see it moving during an apparent test. The rear fins also move back and forth in what is likely an effort to show the example on camera is more than just a mockup. This weapon remains one of the more controversial systems Russia is developing now. The country may end up coupling it with a nuclear-powered underwater drone, possibly based on the Harpsichord-1R design, that has effectively unlimited range and is especially difficult to detect, as well. Another Kremlin attempt to avoid western ballistic missile defenses, from the information available now , it appears that Poseidon’s main job is to strike at coastal installations with little to no warning. It reportedly has an especially dirty warhead , which means it would not only cause immediate damage, but also contaminate the area and impede any continued operations or repairs. New computer generated graphics accompanying the live footage show a submarine firing two of the weapons, including one at a coastal radar installation. This is a somewhat ominous reference given recent Russian mock attacks on exactly this sort of site in Norway. The submarine uses the other Poseidon to attack at carrier strike group. Notably, the notional flattop in the clip is a Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR), a configuration that the United States and its allies do not employ . The only countries that do are China , India , and Russia itself . The STOBAR carrier “target” in the computer-generated portion of the new Poseidon video., Russian MoD A new look at the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle We also get an entirely new, if still limited, look at the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top of what may be either an RS-26 Rubezh or UR-100N UTTKh Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The entire missile is shielded from view as crews load it into a silo, but the especially flat planform of the vehicle on top is clear. Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles have few of the vulnerabilities associated with traditional ICBMs since they have a more limited signature and can rapidly change course in flight to avoid detection and defenses. Their speed gives any potential opponent very little time to react even if they do see the weapon coming. It is “like a meteorite, like a fireball,” Putin said of Avangard in March 2018. Russia has spent considerable resources on getting this particular system ready for operational service, going so far as to shelve the RS-26 program entirely to free up additional funding. The U.S. military’s admission that it has no defenses what so ever at present to counter hypersonic weapons has almost certainly provided the Kremlin with an added emphasis to complete the system’s development. The goal is to have the weapons ready for combat by 2019 and using the older UR-100N UTTKh design appears to be part of that plan. However, in the future, Avangard may find its way onto the RS-28 Sarmat, as well as road-mobile missiles, such as the RT-2PM2 Topol-M and RS-24 Yars , which could further expand Russia’s capabilities in this regard. A more detailed view of the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM Another video offered a new look at the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM , known to NATO as the SS-X-30 Satan 2. Russia has been working on this silo-based weapon since at least 2014 as a replacement for the existing R-36Ms or SS-18 Satans. In May 2018, Putin said that the RS-28 would enter operational service in 2020. After that, it will likely steadily become the country’s primary heavy ICBM. The clip shows a transporter loading the missile into a silo and a higher-resolution look at a test launch than we have seen before. More interestingly, the second half of the video gives a detailed look at components of the Sarmat’s body, as well as the parts that link the sections together, under construction or test. Again, the Russian Ministry of Defense blurred out the faces of individuals working on the missile. They did not block out any views of the parts themselves. Sarmat is perhaps the least novel and best known of the weapons Putin talked focused on in March 2018. Questions remain, though, about what type of warheads it might use. It is possible that it might feature the ability to carry Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, have a fractional orbital bombardment capability , or employ independent post-boost vehicles (IPBV). Each one of these arrangements is intended to help defeat ballistic missile defenses. Russia has repeatedly criticized U.S. and European efforts in this regard, despite the fact that none of the existing systems can, in any way, challenge the country’s nuclear deterrent capabilities . To reinforce the point of Sarmat’s ability to strike the United States, one computer-generated clip in the March 2018 speech notably showed an RS-28 depositing its warheads onto the state of Florida. Putin has, unsurprisingly, since denied this was the case. “As far as the footage is concerned, well, they did not specify that it – the missile is about to hit the United States. You have to look at it more carefully,” Putin told Fox News’ Chris Wallace in an interview on May 16, 2018. Wallace subsequently pressed the Russia leader on the issue. “It – that was not signed ‘Florida.’ There was not a caption saying ‘Florida,’” a clearly exasperated Putin countered again. “They could – take a more careful look at it. There was never a caption, ‘Florida.’” You can decide for yourself below. A computer-generated image showing nuclear warheads falling on Florida., via Channel One Russia More of the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile In the order they were posted, the first video features the hypersonic Kh-47M2 , a modified ground-launched Iskander-M quasi-ballistic missile, and the specially modified MiG-31K carrier aircraft. Out of the six new weapon systems, this is the one we have already seen the most of in official pictures and video. The clip is relatively uneventful, showing MiG-31Ks taking off, launching the weapon, and returning to base. It is notable that the Russians blocked out the faces of pilots and ground crew, as well as the “Bort” numbers on the side of the aircraft. This could be an attempt to obscure just how many MiG-31Ks the country actually has available. Two of these jets flew over Moscow during the annual Victory Day parade in May 2018. “The MiG-31 is its carrier, this aircraft is most suitable to disperse this missile to the required speeds at the right altitudes,” Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov told the Russian military’s official news outlet Zvezda that same month. “In support of the fact that this is not some kind of exotic: Today, ten aircraft are on experimental combat duty and are ready for use depending on the situation.” Russian officials have said that the Kinzhal has a maximum range of between approximately 930 and 1, 240 miles, three to four times that of the ground-based Iskander-M. Earlier in July 2018, CNBC reported , citing unnamed U.S. officials, that Kremlin had only tested it out to a range of nearly 500 miles. It is likely, that the boost in momentum from the MiG-31K itself, as well as the launch altitude, has an impact on the weapon’s flight path and the total distance it can cover. Computer generated graphics that accompanies Putin’s March 2018 announcements showed the weapon initially following a ballistic trajectory before dropping down to a lower altitude before striking the target, but there is no indication that this is an accurate representation of its capabilities. You can read more about the Kh-47M2s possible capabilities in our past analysis here . According to CNBC , the U.S. government expects the weapon to truly enter operational service by 2020. The Peresvet laser weapon reappears The last video is the last informative, showing the Peresvet laser, but offering little in the way of new details. There are no clips, live or computer generated, of the directed energy weapon in operation to give a sense of its capabilities. As we at The War Zone noted in the past , it looks very similar in size and purpose to the U.S. Navy’s own AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System . Still, there is every indication that it could be useful as a point defense weapon, especially against small drones, a threat that Russia is particularly aware of given its experiences in Syria. There are reports that Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in that country suffered yet another attack by small unmanned aircraft earlier in July 2018. Past official statistics indicate that this has become something of a regular occurrence . Post-summit posturing Whatever the actual status of any of these programs is or isn’t, it’s clear that Russia was eager to tout its advanced weapons developments following Putin’s meeting with Trump. Though politicians and experts in the West widely criticized the outcome of the meeting, it was very positive for the Kremlin. Russian officials have said that the two leaders made a host of agreements, despite there being no written documentation or other evidence to support these claims. As noted, Russia has been particularly eager to find a way to halt the expansion of missile defenses in Europe, as well as elicit a host of other concessions related to its illegal occupation of Ukraine’s Crimea region , its intervention in that country and in Syria , as well as negotiate favorable new terms for arms control agreements, including those covering strategic weapons. “It’s crucial that we fine-tune the dialogue on strategic stability and global security and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,” Putin told reporters on July 17, 2018. “We submitted our American colleagues a note with a number of specific suggestions.” Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to the press after his summit with US President Donald Trump., Dmitry Azarov/Kommersant/Sipa USA via AP The United States already accuses Russia of violating the INF treaty and the Open Skies Treaty , the latter of which is supposed to improve transparency in military affairs. Putin has also warned that the New START arms control deal might sunset when it comes up for renewal in 2021 if relations between the two countries remain so poor. There have been indications in that past that the U.S. government may be willing to trade away some of its own new strategic weapons developments in exchange for the Kremlin halting work on various systems and agreeing to extend existing limitations. With these videos, the Russian government seems keen to emphasize that it is willing and able to dramatically expand its nuclear weapons and other advanced weapon capabilities if any future negotiations collapse .

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 24, 2018","No, Russia’s Su-57 Stealth Fighter Program Isn’t Dead, At Least Not Yet","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has no plans to put its vexing but also often misunderstood Su-57 stealth fighter aircraft into large-scale production at present and will continue to produce only small numbers of planes to fulfill one existing contract. The Kremlin insists it could decide to place bigger orders for the aircraft in the future, but it is unclear when and if the country will have the necessary resources to truly reboot the project and whether the jets will still be relevant by the time it does. Yuri Borisov, Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister, made the Kremlin’s plans for the Su-57 during an interview with the state-owned Russia 24 television network on July 2, 2018. The Kremlin finally placed its first order for low-rate production aircraft, 12 in total, in June 2018, nearly a decade after the program began, but there is no indication that there will be any additional purchases in the near future. “You know that today the Su-57 is considered to be one of the best aircrafts [sic] produced in the world,” Borisov boasted , despite the reality being much more nuanced, which you can read about in depth here . “Consequently, it does not make sense to speed up work on mass-producing the fifth-generation aircraft.” His logic is that the Russian military’s most advanced fourth generation fighter jets, such as the MiG-29SMT Fulcrum and Su-35S Flanker-E , are more than capable of fulfilling the country’s air combat needs. When that is no longer the case, the Kremlin would then order the Su-57 into full-scale production. A Russian Air Force MiG-29SMT, Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia In the meantime, Russia will still take delivery of the dozen jets it has on order, with the first pair of early production examples set to arrive in 2019. These aircraft will, not surprisingly, go to Lipetsk Air Center , home of the 4th Center of Combat Application and Conversion of Frontline Aviation, which runs Russia’s analog to the U.S. Navy’s Topgun program . It is likely that at least some of these aircraft will support the continued development of the aircraft and new aerial munitions , as well as work on advanced air combat tactics, techniques, and procedures. It’s not clear how long it will take for the other 10 to reach the Russian Air Force. If production levels stay where they are now, Sukhoi could build two a year through 2024. Between the jet’s first flight in January 2010 and January 2018, Russia has managed to take delivery of less than a dozen flyable pre-production aircraft. The original goal was to have 150 of the stealthy planes in service by 2020. It is “our trump [card], which we can always play when the aircrafts [sic] of previous generations will start to lag behind in capabilities when compared to similar aircraft from the world’s leading countries,” Borisov continued. Taken by itself, there is something to be said for this argument. To be sure, stealth fighter programs are expensive and time-consuming affairs. Russia has a host of competing defense spending priorities , including a raft of costly and complex strategic weapons projects . If it doesn’t need to build dozens of Su-57s, then it would seem to make sense not to do so – but that’s a truism that one can say about almost anything. Even setting aside whether Russia can truly afford to delay the large-scale introduction of a fifth-generation fighter in a world where it is only increasingly lagging behind potential opponents who either operate such aircraft already or are moving in that direction , Borisov’s comments did not come in a vacuum. The most immediate issue actually seems to be that the aircraft is not ready for mass production due to long-standing engine problems that might not be solved for years. The Russians seem to have finally arrived at the conclusion that the Saturn AL-41F turbofan simply isn’t powerful enough for the Su-57. In December 2017, a Su-57 flew for the first time with the more capable Saturn Izdeliye 30 . The video below shows a flight test of a pre-production Su-57 with on AL-41F and one Izdeliye 30. Saturn says the Izdeliye 30 could be ready for serial production by 2019, but other sources suggest that it might not be able to pass the required state testing regimen before 2020. Mishaps in the past have called the company’s overall quality control into question, too. There could be a number of other outstanding issues with the design as well and further testing of the pre-production and limited production Su-57s could expose new problems. Developmental issues with sensors and other mission systems , sensor fusion , software , low observable structures , and systems integration have all plagued other stealth programs, including in the United States . As such, it makes a good amount of financial sense for the Russians to hold off on large-scale production until they can be certain they have resolved any major issues with the design. Otherwise, they could easily run the risk of ending up in a “ concurrency ” situation whereby they take delivery of dozens of aircraft with limited functional capability pending major and potentially costly upgrades. Considering it is debatable if Russia can afford large numbers of the new jets at all, building them with major defects that need to be rectified certainly isn’t an attractive option. In February 2017, Deputy Defense Minister Borisov himself acknowledged that it was very likely that the Kremlin would only begin allocating the necessary funding for larger scale Su-57 production in the 2018-2025 State Armament Plan. “We are not in a hurry,” Borisov said at the time, echoing his more recent comments. “We are holding an operational evaluation and have purchased limited batches. We’ll see how they will operate in practice,” Borisov continued, according to state-run outlet TASS . “We are now revealing all drawbacks and making changes to ensure that we purchase practically proven examples when [the] time comes.” A pair of Su-57s fly over the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow in May 2018., Evgeny Biyatov/Sputnik  via AP Still, it’s not entirely clear if the new turbofan will provide the added power and efficiency the jet truly needs, as the AL-41F and the Izdeliye 30 are both derivatives of the AL-31F . The Russians, or any prospective foreign customers, may still demand further improvements to the design in the future, too. The Kremlin’s only partner on the program so far, India, was apparently not convinced that the Su-57 was moving in the right direction, at least per its own requirements, with regards to both the aircraft’s engines and its stealth characteristics . In April 2018, they pulled out of the project , removing a critical source of outside funding and production scalability and throwing the entire effort into uncertainty. Russia has since made it clear that they are still interested in attracting international customers and potential foreign partners for the program. The Kremlin hopes the Su-57’s low price can undercut sales of other fifth-generation aircraft. The Russians claim the jets cost approximately $45 million each , around half the price of an F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. In July 2018, Vladimir Gutenev, a member of Russia’s parliament, or Duma, reiterated that Russia’s Air Force did not have a need for a large number of Su-57s in an interview with the newspaper Interfax . “[It] has a wonderful export potential, many countries would like to buy it,” he added. This seems optimistic, though, since this price tag would be comparable to existing fourth-generation Russian aircraft. Also, if it’s not ready for serial production for the Russians, it may be hard to pitch it to anyone else, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dan8gd2XS9Q Without a fresh influx of cash, it might be hard for the Kremlin to keep the program on its existing schedule, This could create a negative cyclical effect where unit cost skyrockets due to low production numbers. This is often referred to as a fiscal ‘death spiral.’ This could result in a situation in which Russia can’t afford to make the Su-57 attractive to the foreign buyers it needs to push the program along. Russia itself has already seen two successive years of significant defense budget cuts , which have led to the cancellation of two nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile projects . At the same time, the country has put other major defense projects, such as new nuclear-powered destroyers and aircraft carriers , on hold. If the Su-57 production line only produces a very small number of the jets each year, or goes cold entirely, it could be difficult, if not fiscally impossible to quickly ramp up production in the 2020s. The labor and physical space necessary to increase the turnout might be already in use on other projects. Experience in any specialized production processes necessary for the stealthy design may also wither in the interim and it could take years to establish an adequate supply chain for certain long-lead materials and mission systems. The Russians are experiencing the same issues already with the Tu-160M2 bomber project, the first of which appears to be a rebuilt airframe that had been sitting in storage for decades. Since the Kremlin first announced that program in 2015, it has pushed back the scheduled start date of serial production of those aircraft from 2021 to 2023. Even if the Russians do begin taking larger deliveries of Su-57s in 2027, it’s not clear how relevant the design will necessarily be by the time it reaches a true full operational capability. Russia is reportedly already working on a supposedly sixth-generation design , which could be pilot optional, and plans to begin flight tests of the “Okhotnik,” or hunter, a stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), by the end of 2018. The country is also continuing work on the “ Skat ,” or manta ray, another UCAV. On top of that, in 2017, Russian officials, including Deputy Defense Minister Borisov, claimed that Russia had at least two new fighter jet programs in the works, one to replace the MiG-31 long-range interceptor and a new carrier fighter . It’s not clear if these will be derivatives of existing fourth generation designs, part of a long-standing plan to develop subvariants of the Su-57, or entirely new and potentially more advanced developments, or if they’ll ever come to fruition at all. So, even if one accepts Borisov’s arguments at face value, by the time the Russians might be in any position to decide to put the Su-57 into large-scale production, they may well have moved on to more contemporary alternatives. Similarly, the Kremlin could have otherwise decided the design no longer meets the demands of the country’s military, or at least in any significant quantities. An infographic showing a number of proposed variants of what was originally known as the PAK-FA stealth fighter, none of which have so far materialized., Sukhoi All in all, it may look as if the Su-57 program isn’t officially dead just yet, but this all may be just be a formality. Russia seems to have little choice but to defer the project until there are sufficient numbers of the new Izdeliye 30 engine and adequate resources to support the program overall. Not to mention solving other potential deficiencies in the design. The Su-57s the Russians have and will receive from the present order will almost certainly continue on as valuable research and development tools . They might even represent a viable “silver bullet” type force for major contingencies if the Kremlin adds a small number of additional aircraft to the fleet in the coming years. But This could create its own challenges, since small fleets of aircraft are, by their nature, typically very expensive to operate and sustain. This is even more pronounced when it comes to particularly advanced designs . But by the time the Kremlin find itself ready to consider additional and larger Su-57s orders, we may well be talking about the state of an entirely different Russian advanced fighter jet or UCAV program.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This is such an exciting time for commercial adversary support providers. Developments from multiple firms are coming fast and furious as they ready their 4th generation threat simulation aircraft to satisfy exploding demand from the USAF, the Navy and Marine Corps, and foreign air arms. Tactical Air Support Inc., better known as TacAir, chose the F-5E/F as their platform, procuring 21 of the jets from abroad , which are now going through a deep refurbishment and upgrade process. Part of this includes the installation of an entirely new set of cockpit interfaces and avionics to support new sensors and to satisfy this emerging and challenging mission set. In a press release, avionics giant Garmin announced that they will be providing a version of their Garmin 3000 and integrated flight-deck suite for TacAir’s remodeled F-5s. This will provide these older jets—the last F-5 was produced 31 years ago—with a proven, easily supportable, and highly adaptable avionics suite. Garmin states: This configuration, which consists of a G3000™ flight display and dual Garmin touchscreen controllers (GTCs), boasts an open architecture design that seamlessly integrates with typical mission equipment and hardware so pilots experience a single integrated cockpit system. Utilizing this rapidly deployable solution, the first flight of the Garmin-equipped F-5 is expected later this year. … The modular G3000 integrated flight deck boasts a large and vibrant, high-resolution flight display that seamlessly interfaces to the F-5’s existing mission computer, enabling advanced mapping, tactical radio capabilities, radar display and more. The bezel keys, GTCs and L3 ForceX mission system serve as the pilot interface to the flight display, and the touchscreen controllers incorporate infrared technology so pilots can use gloves in the cockpit. The G3000 has an open architecture that enables seamless mission computer, sensors and systems integration and easily facilitates future upgrades without impacting the avionics. The NVG-compatible G3000 contains modern, state-of-the-art synthetic vision technology (SVT™) that blends an “out-the-window” view of surroundings on the primary flight display, which is particularly helpful during nighttime operations or in terrain-prone environments. The G3000 also has worldwide communication, navigation, surveillance and air traffic management (CNS/ATM) capabilities. Additional features within the G3000 integrated flight deck on the F-5 include Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS), global Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) traffic and weather, as well as a video input. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Garmin hardware and software allows TacAir to take advantage of technological advances, cost savings and rapid procurement. These COTS solutions offer significant opportunities in reduced development time, faster integration of new technology and lower life-cycle costs. The G3000, along with many other Garmin solutions, also interface with a wide range of third-party products using industry standard protocols, reducing cost and streamlining installation complexity. Garmin Clearly, this outfit brings a ton of capability and technological agility to TacAir’s adversary support offering, it also will make flight operations much safer, but it doesn’t come cheap. Investing in this type of money into the company’s burgeoning fleet of F-5s is a serious commitment. But considering how competitive this once cottage industry is quickly becoming, up-front investments like this can pay off not only in contract awards but also in supportability and upgradability down the line. Modern pulse-doppler radars, radar warning receivers, and electronic warfare capabilities may be the threshold requirements for 4th generation threat simulation support now, but in the future, advanced data-links, infrared search and track systems, AESA radars and other sensors are likely to become sought-after resources. Having a solid open-architecture and integrated avionics foundation for which to efficiently integrate these new capabilities will be certainly beneficial. In fact, the lack of such a setup even on some of America’s front-line fighters has become a challenge , to say the least. One of TacAir’s recently refurbished F-5Es., TacAir We reached out to Mick Guthals, senior manager of business development over at TacAir, about this impressive upgrade. Although he couldn’t share a lot about it just yet, he noted that the picture Garmin published doesn’t represent the exact final configuration for the company’s F-5s. I asked if a heads-up display would be included and he said it would. He did state that they are really excited to get the Garmin 3000 and the integrate flight-deck architecture because of all the expandability and supportability it brings to the table. As for exactly what sensors TacAir F-5s will eventually sport—namely what radar—he couldn’t disclose just yet, but he said he would let us know as soon as he can. This may not be too far into the future either, as Guthals noted that TacAir is looking to officially roll-out their fully equipped F-5 adversary jet this fall. It’s worth noting that the Navy and Marine Corps’ own fleet of around 44 F-5N/F aggressors still fly with their gunsights and ‘steam’ gauges dating back decades. Their air-to-air radars are based on 1960s vintage technology and have only rudimentary capabilities. But they did recently receive a navigation system upgrade that came with a color multi-function display. Yet this enhancement pales in comparison to the powerful avionics suite TacAir is acquiring for their F-5s. The current center stack n the Navy’s F-5N., USN A handful of air arms around the globe fly highly upgraded F-5s that have glass cockpits , but those don’t feature the open architecture, integrated feature set, or supportability that the Garmin system offers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 17, 2020",Oops! The Spanish Navy Is Constructing New Submarines That Are Too Big For Their Pens,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Spain’s diesel-electric S-80 Plus submarine program has hit a new snag, with the boats now reportedly being too big for the existing pens at the Spanish Navy’s base in Cartagena. It could take millions of dollars to improve the facilities and the issue underscores the hurdles the country and many of its fellow NATO members face in attempting to revitalize their military capabilities after years of post-Cold War neglect . Spanish newspaper El País was first to report on the new developments on July 18, 2018. The outlet included graphics highlighting that the docks at Cartagena are just shy of 256 feet long, while the S-80 Plus is over 265 feet long. The report also said that Spanish authorities would have to dredge out the pens to accommodate the new boats, which are larger overall compared to the country’s existing S-70 Galerna -class submarines, with the complete upgrades to the facilities costing more than $18 million. “There have been deficiencies in the project,” Margarita Robles, Spain’s Defense Minister, who took up the post in June 2018, had said in a separate radio interview, according to the BBC . “They are already corrected and that the project is absolutely viable.” The issue is that the S-80 Plus is larger than manufacturer Navantia had said it would be when the Spanish government approved construction of four boats all the way back in 2003. The program to develop a new submarine for Spain’s Navy dates back to before the end of the Cold War, at which time it was a joint Franco-Spanish effort . Both countries shelved what was originally known simply as the S-80 project after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but rebooted their efforts separately it in the late 1990s. Delays and economic upheaval repeatedly extended the new Spanish submarine project over the next decade. Then, in 2013, Navantia uncovered a serious and potentially fatal design flaw. The addition of more than 100 tons of added weight during development had thrown off the boat’s buoyancy characteristics, which meant it might not be able to resurface reliably. An artist’s conception of the S-80 Plus submarine., Navantia “Apparently somebody in the calculations made a mistake in the very beginning and nobody paid attention to review the calculations,” Rafael Bardaji, formerly the director of the Office of Strategic Assessment at Spain’s Defense Ministry and subsequently a defense consultant, said at the time . He blamed the matter on a single misplaced decimal point. The company, with outside help from American sub maker Electric Boat , a division of General Dynamics, eventually added 16 distinct extensions in the hull, renaming the resulting design the S-80 Plus. The entire modification program cost more than $18 million and set back the already protracted production schedule. Spain originally expected to have the first boat in hand by 2015 and take delivery of the last one in 2018. As of January 2018 , Navantia’s goal was to have the first submarine finished by 2022 – nearly two decades after the Spanish government approved the project. According to Matthew Bennett, an independent journalist, Spanish authorities have already pushed back against El País ’ report. They noted that the Spanish Ministry of Defense, or MoD, has had plans to enlarge the width of the pens at Cartagena and otherwise improve the facilities since 2009. “There is no modification of the project or decision taken in the MoD that implies the lengthening of the pens for the submarines,” an unnamed spokesperson told Bennett . “It is possible that they won’t need lengthening because they don’t have to fit on the dock lengthways anyway.” This logic seems dubious, though, since it would expose their tails and present a potential hazard to the boats and other marine traffic within the base’s harbor area. It is possible that the S-80 Plus could fit inside the existing space diagonally, but this seems to be an ad hoc solution at best. S-74 Tramontana , one of Spain’s existing Galerna -class submarines, moored in Cartagena., Eugenio Castillo Pert via Wikimedia In addition, this would limit the ability of the pens to each accommodate two submarines, as they do now. This, in turn, could require Spain to have to modify or build alternate pier side space for all four S-80 Plus boats, which could require additional funds. Regardless, the S-80 Plus program still has other issues to overcome, chiefly with its fuel-cell based air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. This type of arrangement is a core feature in any modern non-nuclear submarine designs. The technology is steadily advancing to the point that boats with AIP systems, as well as improved batteries , may be quieter, and therefore stealthier and more survivable, than nuclear-powered types and be able to remain underwater for weeks at a time. But rather than leverage an in-production system or hire an established manufacturer to build a new one specifically for the S-80 Plus, Spain hired two domestic firms, Técnicas Reunidas and Abengoa, to build one. By most accounts, their design has been underperforming, with past demonstrations indicating that the system will be able to propel the boats while submerged for 21 days , a week shorter than required. These problems appear to have put plans to export the design on hold, as well. In October 2017, Navantia decided not to enter the S-80 Plus in an Indian Navy submarine competition , despite its initial interest in the program. The first S-80 submarine under construction in 2012, before Navantia uncovered the design issue that led to the S-80 Plus configuration., Navantia According to El País , Spanish authorities are now expecting to take delivery of the first two S-80 Plus submarines – the future S-81 Isaac Peral and S-82 Narciso Monturiol – with a traditional diesel-electric propulsion system. The third and fourth examples – the S-83 Cosme García and S-84 Mateo García de los Reyes – which are now expected to enter service in 2026 and 2028 respectively, would be the first in an AIP configuration. The Spanish Navy would then upgrade the Peral and Monturiol with the improved propulsion system when they arrive at their first major maintenance availability, expected to come around 2032. This plan might help get the initial submarines into service faster, but it would almost certainly be costly and complex to modify the S-81 and S-82 with the AIP system further on down the line. The total cost of the S-80 Plus program has already risen from more than $2 billion in 2003 to nearly twice that amount. Without the AIP system, the capabilities of the first two submarines will be significantly limited in that intervening decade. This will impact not only Spain’s ability to conduct underwater operations, but also support its NATO allies during any potential contingency. Spain , along with other members of the alliance, has already come under fire from U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration for not contributing more to the bloc. In 2017, Spain was fourth from the bottom in defense spending among NATO allies, ahead of only Belgium, Luxembourg, and Iceland, the last of which has a special exemption from the organization’s goal of member states spending two percent on national security. US President Donald Trump speaks at the NATO summit in July 2018., Alexey Vitvitsky/Sputnik via AP What the Spanish government does spend it does “in a very active manner,” Josep Borrell, the country’s Foreign Minister, said in July 2018 , ahead of what turned out to be a very controversial NATO summit . “So we spend less, but we use it really well.” Spain is an active contributor to various NATO missions, including training activities in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the Baltic Air Policing operation. It has troops in Latvia as part of the alliance’s effort to increase its deterrent posture in the face of Russia’s ever more aggressive foreign policy agenda and has a battery of Patriot surface-to-air missiles guarding Turkish airspace against potential air and ballistic missile threats in that region. And to be fair, Spain suffered greatly in the global economic downturn that began in 2008. Political shifts in leadership between the country’s conservative and socialist political blocs have also had impacts on defense spending . Unfortunately, the latest hurdles for the S-80 Plus program show that the country still faces significant hurdles as it tries to modernize its military capabilities.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have been waiting to find some good video of Lockheed Martin’s LM-100J flight demonstration from the Farnborough International Air Show, and finally, it has emerged. What you are about to see is downright awesome . C-130J pilots have told me that in the right hands the aircraft could do things that would make anyone look at it in a very different manner. Lockheed’s top C-130 test pilot Wayne Roberts proved this statement correct and did so in front of tens of thousands of spectators from around the world. Here’s a direct link to the Facebook video posted below in case it doesn’t load on your mobile device. Apparently, this is Wayne Robert’s last air show display before retiring and he clearly knew he could go out with a bang behind the controls of the LM-100J. The LM-100J is Lockheed’s fully certified commercial variant of the C-130J-30 Super Hercules. You can read all about the LM-100J in this past article of mine. Also during the show, Lockheed announced that the type will be marketed in a firefighting configuration dubbed the ‘FireHerc.’ The option of two modular retardant delivery systems is envisioned to help fulfill this mission. The first is the Modular Aerial Fire-Fighting System II (MAFFS II). This system, which already flies on some USAF C-130s, can drop 3,500 gallons of retardant through spouts mounted in the aircraft’s paratrooper doors. Our Super Hercules family is growing!

An enlarged variant of the system with a capacity of 5,000 is also being planned. RADS requires some airframe modifications as it is a gravity drop system that goes through the aircraft’s floor but it can drop from higher altitudes than MAFFS II and it can do so at more flexible rates and in more concise patterns. When either system isn’t in use, the LM-100Js can work regularly as cargo-carrying aircraft. The LM-100J’s avionics, which includes a heads-up display, terrain avoidance system, advanced stall and wind-shear warning systems, among other features, also enhances its firefighting abilities and overall safety when it comes to executing the unique and demanding mission.

Jeff Allen's killer shot! pic.twitter.com/WMdublBIt8 — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) September 7, 2017 Lockheed is also looking at adding millimeter-wave radar and a distributed aperture electro-optical system that may allow for tanker operations after dark. This could be a huge advantage over other firefighting aircraft that have to call it quits once the sun sets. As for maneuverability down-low, after that flight demo, there is no question that the aircraft is more than capable, and multiple types of C-130s, many far less powerful and advanced, are already doing this mission and have been for many decades. The LM-100J only has 20 percent of its certification testing left before completion. Two aircraft are flying and five are on order for an undisclosed buyer, but more are likely to follow. Lockheed originally saw a market for about 75 LM-100Js but that number could end up expanding as it picks up additional missions. The militarized C-130J Super Hercules and its Hercules predecessors have proven to be the multi-tools of the skies, with all types of modular equipment being built for their use. These include everything from new weaponry and sensors to nuclear sniffing and air spraying equipment . Lockheed is also marketing new special operations C-130J variant. The Hercules remains an intriguing and incredibly relevant flying machine that does some of the most unglamorous but absolutely critical flying the world over nearly 65 years after its first flight. But underneath its utilitarian-appearance, the ‘Herky Bird’ has the heart of an acrobat, which isn’t surprising considering its long and storied history, one that has included acrobatic flying by the Blue Angels’ iconic Fat Albert transport and even stunt formation flying by the Four Horsemen. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qjZMWI77b84 In fact, if everything is still proceeding as planned, the Blue Angels will be receiving a second-hand C-130J to replace the KC-130T that currently flies as Fat Albert.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 3, 2018",Army Buys Small Suicide Drones To Break Up Hostile Swarms And Potentially More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. defense contractor Raytheon says the U.S. Army has begun buying a version of its expendable Coyote drone that can operate alone or in a swarm, along with a compact fire control radar, to bring down small hostile unmanned aerial vehicles. Since the unmanned defenders have a small warhead, the service may also be able to readily employ them as loitering munitions and the entire system could eventually take on other roles. The Massachusetts-headquartered company announced that it was in the process of delivering the Coyote Block 1B variants to the Army in response to an “urgent operational need” at a press conference on July 17, 2018, at the biennial Farnborough Airshow in the United Kingdom. At present, the firm has provided more than 32 drones to the service and it is set to fulfill the full order of an unspecified number of the unmanned aircraft by the end of 2018, according to Shepard . “We modified these vehicles to have small warheads to take down a quadcopter, for example, or other types of Class I or Class II UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles],” Thomas Bussing, Raytheon’s Vice President for Advanced Missile Systems, said at Farnborough. The two categories of drones he mentioned cover designs that are less than 55 pounds heavy, can’t fly higher than 3,500 feet, and have a top speed under 280 miles per hour, per the U.S. military’s official definitions . The complete system consists of two four-tube launcher on the back of a standard Army 6×6 tactical truck, along with Raytheon’s own Ku-band Radio Frequency System, or KRFS, and a generator to provide the necessary power. This fire control radar cues the unmanned aircraft to intercept their targets. A low-quality image showing the KRFS-equipped launch vehicle Raytheon developed for the US Army., Raytheon “First, you’ve got to see it, but then you need to track the target with high accuracy,” Don Williams, in charge of Raytheon’s Multi-Function Radio Frequency System, or MRFS, product line, which includes the KRFS, said in a company statement . “It’s a true multi-mission radar.” Coyote, by itself, weighs less than 10 pounds. Operators otherwise fire it like a traditional missile from a launch tube that is readily adaptable to air-, sea-, and ground-launched applications. After leaving the launcher, the drone’s six-foot wide main wing, rear stabilizers, and signature twin tail all pop out. An operator remains “in-the-loop” at all times and can make course corrections or issue other commands. The firm said that in tests, the KRFS-directed modified Block 1B versions successfully hit 11 out of 12 targets, according to Military.com . It is unclear whether or not the drone can spot and engage threats autonomously or if it requires some user input, if even just to get it into the right general area. It’s also not clear how long the warhead-equipped Coyotes can fly or how far away from the control station they can go. As of 2016 , Raytheon had developed a version with approximately 1 hour of loiter time and a 50-mile range, but this might be the more advanced Block 2 rather than the Block 1B version the Army is buying. Raytheon offered few details about the Army’s specific requirements, but the company suggested that the complete system would supplement existing point defenses at potentially remote and austere forward operating bases . A Coyote in flight., Raytheon “Enemy unmanned aircraft are among the biggest threats facing our ground troops today,” said Bussing, the Raytheon VP, said at Farnborough. “Our small expendable Coyote provides the army with an affordable and highly effective solution for countering the growing UAS [unmanned aerial systems] threat.” The ability for small unmanned aircraft to observe friendly forces and even launch harassing attacks is very real and will only become more ubiquitous as time goes on. The Army has already begun including examples in official manuals , along with instructions for how soldiers should respond, and troops playing mock enemies now employ quadcopter style drones during training exercises for increased realism. A graphic from a 2016 US Army manual warning about the threat of small unmanned aircraft conducting indirect attacks., US Army The conflicts in Iraq and Syria have shown that this capability is well within the reach of non-state actors , as well as nation-state military forces , as well. In January 2018, a mass drone attack on Russia’s main outposts in Syria – the Khmeimim air base and the naval base in Tartus – demonstrated that these improvised attacks could still be relatively sophisticated and launched from a stand-off distance. The potential for more mass attacks, as well as the danger of hostile autonomous or semi-autonomous drone swarms, will only add to the list of emerging threats the Army and other military forces have to defend against. “It’s almost impossible to defend against [swarms of UAVs],” Pete Mangelsdorf, Director of Unmanned Air Systems at Raytheon’s Missile Systems, said in another company statement . A US Army soldier, playing the role of a member of the enemy forces, pilots a quadcopter style drone during a training exercise in Germany., US Army But Raytheon says multiple Coyotes might be able to defeat drone swarms, too. The company can load the drones with software that it developed as part of the U.S. Navy’s Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology effort, or LOCUST , which lets them operate as a group themselves. “You may have a swarm of UASs engaging another swarm of UASs,” Raytheon’s Bussing explained at the airshow in the United Kingdom. This may be the only cost-effective and functional method of neutralizing especially dense swarms with hundreds of small drones in the future. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo Our own Tyler Rogoway noted this could be a possibility in August 2017 when examining the U.S. military’s desperate need for new and improved short-range air defenses to counter these and other threats, writing : “Being networked together, and being autonomous in nature after being loaded with a target area location, along with other mission parameters, these swarms will be extremely hard to defend against using even the best SHORAD systems in development today. It’s the saturation nature of the attack, the size of the attackers, and the fact that they work as a coordinated swarm, employing dynamic tactics to see as many in their company survive long enough to make their suicidal attack, that make them so deadly. They could even drop micro-munitions and be reused for a later attack. Just the knowledge that such an attack is possible would be psychologically stressful and demoralizing for troops on the ground. … “Although it may sound like a page out a science fiction novel, the only thing that could probably counter such a dense swarming attack on ground forces or a garrisoned force would be for those forces to have their own counter-swarm swarms at the ready. This would result in dozens or even hundreds of mini kamikaze dogfights in the sky—a life and death suicide struggle among diminutive hive-minded flying robots.” Coyote’s relatively low cost could make this an even more practical option, especially compared to many existing alternatives , too. The basic drones, without the warhead, cost around $15,000 each and Raytheon is hoping to trim that cost back further. It’s unclear how much higher the price is for the complete counter-drone system with the KRFS radar. That base price, though, is approximately half that of a FIM-92 Stinger short-range shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile and exponentially less expensive than a Patriot surface-to-air missile , though. This has already pushed the Army to seek out lower-cost interceptors to shoot down smaller, more numerous threats such as rockets, artillery shells, and mortar bombs, as well as small drones. And using Coyote to blow up enemy drones could easily be a stepping stone to other capabilities, as well. Raytheon already says that the truck-mounted radar can cue other air defense systems , including future directed energy weapons , to engage the targets instead, potentially using additional information from the drones already in flight. The video below shows Raytheon’s own counter-drone laser weapon system, one of many now in development. Coyote is inherently modular, too, meaning that Raytheon could add in a set of day- and night-capable full motion video cameras to create a man-in-the-loop weapon . Israel pioneered this sort of munition , where an operator can make precise adjustments in the terminal phase of flight to be more precise, engage moving targets, or even abort a strike almost at the last moment to avoid inadvertent civilian casualties. That same modularity means that the Army, or other services interested in the platform, could look into Coyote as a pure surveillance and reconnaissance platform, either singly or in a swarm , too. There are reports that an unknown operator may have used the drones in this role in Syria in the past. If Raytheon can continue to extend the drone’s flight time and range, it might be possible to launch electronic warfare attacks or conduct other missions that require longer range in support of more dynamic operations. The easily adaptable nature of the launch and control systems – which can fit on the back of a trailer or light truck – means that troops may be readily able to add these capabilities even to smaller units. They could also easily operate more than one variant at a time or launch entire swarms with a mix of kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities. In this case, certain versions could use sensor packages to act as pathfinders and spotters for armed versions flying behind. https://youtube.com/watch?v=JMUB91uQQBA Unarmed or dedicated training versions could be recoverable, further lowering the cost of operating them. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has used Coyotes to monitor hurricanes and other extreme weather and has used parachute-equipped types to train personnel on their operation. Other services are almost certain to be interested in where the Army takes Coyote, too. The U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Special Operations Command are both looking to acquire more multi-purpose loitering munitions themselves. A member of NOAA holds a Coyote set of up with a parachute so personnel can recover it after a training flight., NOAA Whatever happens, the Army’s order does underscore the flexible potential of Raytheon’s low-cost unmanned aircraft. Even if the service sticks with Coyote as a point defense weapon against small drones, it could still jump start further developments that take the design in new and interesting directions.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a ‘lively’ NATO summit and trip to the UK, to say the least, President Trump headed to Helsinki for the highly controversial one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin. What came next has become an explosive story that will dominate the week, and one that has huge strategic, intelligence, foreign policy, and general national security implications. Not all the action occurred in Finland. Over the weekend a dozen indictments were issued against Russian officials that the U.S. Justice Department says had a direct hand in the information warfare campaign against the United States during the 2016 election. Then, just before meeting with Putin, firearms activist Maria Butina was declared a foreign agent and was indicted for using the NRA to influence American politics. It didn’t end there, unrest rapidly grew from both sides of the aisle, and from within the intelligence community itself, following Trump’s press conference with Putin . Then, just hours ago, the President rolled back his statement saying that he had no reason to believe Russia meddled in the 2016 election and now says he meant the opposite. And all this is happening as Robert Mueller’s probe continues to expand and accelerate. Instead of giving you my take on all of this, I want to know yours.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",These Newly Released Nuclear Test Videos Are Horrific And Beautiful At The Same Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory just posted a bunch of newly declassified and digitalized films of past nuclear tests. The high quality of the footage and the extent of it provides a whole new perspective on the ominous power of the world’s most destructive weapons. The videos are taken from a number of above and below-ground nuclear detonations that took place in the 1950s. They include multiple angles covering different aspects of each detonation, from the initial shockwave that propagates just after the reaction, to the glowing fireballs that morph into towering mushroom clouds, to the shock effects that roar outward from the epicenter at high-speed. Some of the films are even in color, and one, in particular, is especially dreadful looking. The Juniper test of Operation Hardtack I occurred on July 22nd, 1958. It was the last test at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. The 65 kiloton device was detonated on a barge just a dozen feet above the waterline and it sent a cloud rocketing up 40,000 feet into the sky. The conditions that day resulted in a film that looks incredibly bleak and foreboding, if not downright evil, with blast’s mushroom cloud appearing charcoal black as it rises from the sea. The film, posted below, is one of the most interesting nuclear test films I have ever seen. I also included another close-up video of the detonation: There is so much other content worth watching, like the Sandford test of Operation Hardtack II, which is quite beautiful before you remember that you are watching a manmade device built to kill massive amounts of people and lay waste to large areas of the planet. Sandford was a 4.9 kiloton device that was detonated a few thousand feet in the air aboard a balloon over the Nevada Test Site. The detonations that were part of Operation Teapot in 1955 provide some of the most amazing views of the early stages of a nuclear explosion. The Tesla and Turk tests, in particular, have videos that illustrate the physics behind these blasts just as the shockwave is created. The footage is eerily otherworldly looking. Maybe the best part is that with this latest video dump, Lawrence Livermore National Lab also posted a video explaining a bit about what we are seeing in these films and how they were captured. The timing of the release of these once highly classified films is quite convenient as the specter of nuclear warfare , even on a limited scale, has definitely loomed larger in recent months . Following a Nuclear Posture Review, the Pentagon isn’t just working to freshen-up the nuclear arsenal it already has, but also to expand it with new weapons that are deemed by many as more ‘easily usable’ than most of those currently in the inventory. And all this comes at a very high, if not unsustainable cost . Just the updated B61 tactical nuclear bomb literally costs a multiple of its weight in gold.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 19, 2018",U.S. Trying to Sell Turkey Patriot Missiles to End Spat Over Russian S-400 Purchase,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government is in talks with their Turkish counterparts over a potential sale of Patriot surface-to-air missile systems . Such a deal could finally create a path to ending an increasingly tense political spat between the two countries largely centered around Turkey’s purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system , which the United States and other NATO allies fear could pose a security risk if the Turks operate it alongside the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . Tina Kaidanow, Acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, disclosed that the talks were in progress at the biennial Farnborough Airshow in the United Kingdom on July 16, 2018. Kaidanow is heading up the U.S. delegation at the event with broad instructions from President Donald Trump and his administration to promote U.S. arms sales abroad. “[We’re] trying to give the Turks an understanding of what we can do with respect to Patriot,” told reporters, according to Reuters . “Turkey has had an interest in Patriot, so we’ve been working for a while how we can make that work.” Turkey has been interested in acquiring a new, long-range surface-to-air missile system with some level of ballistic missile defense capability since at least 2007, when it kicked off the Turkish Long-Range Air and Missile Defense Systems ( T-LORAMIDS ) program. In 2009, the State Department approved the possible sale of 13 complete Patriot batteries, along with more than 70 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles, nearly 200 MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missile-Theater Ballistic Missile ( GEM-T ) missiles, and various other associated equipment. The entire package was valued at nearly $8 billion. A German Patriot missile launcher in Turkey in 2014., Bernd von Jutrczenka/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images In 2013, Turkey selecting the Chinese FD-2000 surface-to-air missile system as the winner of the T-LORAMIDS program, but canceled the contract before it took delivery of any of the weapons two years later amid U.S. government pressure. Turkish authorities rejected Patriot in the end reportedly because manufacturer Raytheon was unwilling to meet its requirements for technology transfer and industrial cooperation. Then, in July 2017, Turkish authorities confirmed the country would be buying Russian S-400s after extended negotiations with the manufacturer, Almaz-Antei. The State Department is likely looking to see if they can update the 2009 offer in an attempt to offer an alternative to the deal with the Kremlin. Whatever the proposed package includes, the U.S. government is eager to find a way to get Turkey to abandon the S-400, which has caused a major political impasse between the two countries and has contributed to a serious chill in their relationship. Most recently, in June 2018, the U.S. Senate voted to try and block the transfer of any F-35A Joint Strike Fighters to the Turkish Air Force until the matter is resolved. The major issue is that, if the Turkish military acquires the S-400 and integrates it into its larger defense networks with the help of Russian contractors, this arrangement might give the Kremlin a means of acquiring sensitive information about the stealthy Joint Strike Fighter and its capabilities. In addition, NATO members have voiced concerns that in a crisis the Russian-made system will not be able to work directly with other air and missile defense systems across the alliance, potentially creating a dangerous disconnect in the transfer of information or the coordination of defenses at a critical moment. If Turkey were to halt the S-400 deal and acquire Patriots, it would immediately eliminate these potential problems. It would also fulfill the Turkish military’s legitimate and pressing need for a new air and missile defense system to replace dated Cold War-era weapons and guard against present and emerging threats in the region. Without its own adequate defenses in place, the Turks have had to request other NATO members bring their own Patriot missiles – the only system within the alliance at present that is able to provide the appropriate capabilities – to defend their territory, in particular from potential ballistic missile attacks, on multiple occasions since 1991. These have proven to be costly and complex arrangements for other allies. At present, Spain has a battery of Patriots in Turkey. Patriot also remains a popular surface-to-air missile system and Raytheon has seen a boost of sales recently. The marketing has gotten help from the missile’s combat performance in Saudi Arabia against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and their ballistic missiles . It has also seen recent action in Israel against small drones, highlighting its ability to tackle a diverse array of targets . The latest interceptor, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE), which Lockheed Martin makes in cooperation with Raytheon, only promises to further expand the weapon system’s capabilities. An infographic showing the improvements found on the PAC-3 MSE interceptor., Lockheed Martin But getting Turkish authorities to change course and go with Patriot might be easier said than done. For one, even if the State Department can negotiate a good deal for Turkey with Raytheon in terms of price, it’s not clear whether the U.S. government or the manufacturer would be keen to approve any significant industrial cooperation. This is what pushed the country to choose the FD-2000 over Patriot in the abortive T-LORAMIDS program. In talking to Reuters separately about the U.S.-Turkey spat on the sidelines of Farnborough, Lockheed Martin went so far as to offer its own alternative, the Medium Extended Air Defense System ( MEADS ). The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor has been developing this system in cooperation with the European missile consortium MBDA. The MEADS truck-mounted transporter-erector-launcher., Lockheed Martin That Lockheed Martin and MBDA are pitching MEADS as an open-architecture system could make it particularly attractive in this case. Turkey could purchase the systems, which also uses the PAC-3 MSE missile, and then work with the pair to integrate its own domestically-produced interceptors, radars, and other associated systems in the future. “Turkey has a fairly well developed industrial infrastructure,” an unnamed Lockheed Marine missile defense executive said, according to Reuters. “They have their own indigenous interceptors that could be integrated, if we can move to something more of an open system.” Unfortunately, even if the State Department and American or European defense contractors can find a suitable alternative at a good price that meets Turkey’s demands for industrial cooperation, it still might not be enough for either U.S. or Turkish authorities. Though the question of the S-400s is a major issue, the two countries remained locked in a number of other disputes. These include the U.S. military’s support for certain Kurdish groups in Syria that Turkey considers to be terrorists and the Turkish government’s detention of American evangelical minister Andrew Brunson on charges of attempting to undermine its authority. The aforementioned Senate vote, on a provision that is part of the most recent draft of the proposed annual defense spending bill, which has yet to become law, tries to block the transfer of F-35s over the S-400 question and the matter of Brunson. Members of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a predominantly Kurdish group that Turkey says includes members of terrorist organizations., US Army On top of that, Turkey remains incensed that the United States will not turn over Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen , a former political ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who Turkish authorities claim masterminded a 2016 coup attempt . The U.S. government says the Turks have yet to provide sufficient evidence to support these charges, which would be necessary for any extradition proceedings. In addition, Erdoğan and his increasingly dictatorial administration have made a number of rhetorically charged statements about the S-400 purchase, which could make it difficult to back out of the plan now and still save face politically. That is to say nothing of the legal ramifications of terminating the contract with Almaz-Antei, which has already begun producing the missiles . In addition, the Russian government is covering more than half of the up-front costs of the $2.5 billion order through low-interest loans , which Turkey could still have to pay back if the deal collapses. “I tried to buy from my allies,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu complained at the NATO summit, according to Defense News . “I wanted to buy from the U.S. for the last 10 years; it didn’t work. I couldn’t buy from NATO allies, so Russia gave me the best proposal. And now I’m buying from Russia.” Turkish media outlets have also reported that the country’s government rejected a proposal from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to accept delivery of the S-400s, but not deploy them, which could make this course of action or a similar arrangement more complicated now. This would have offered an immediate way for Turkey to take delivery of the S-400s, but assuage U.S. and other NATO allies’ fears over having the Russian missiles. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, right, shakes hands with Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev., Alexander Astafyev/Sputnik via AP The Turks, possibly with the help of the Americans, could then have found a way to sell the S-400s to an agreeable third party. This would actually mirror the circumstances by which NATO member Greece came into possession of a number of older Russian-made S-300s, a saga unto itself that you can read about in more detail here . The United States may be looking for additional concessions it can make to ease the process, too. The U.S. military has already begun putting a plan into place that sees Kurdish groups leave the strategic northern Syrian city of Manbij in deference to Turkish interests and concerns. At Farnborough, Acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kaidanow sounded hopeful that the two countries could find an acceptable middle ground on the missiles. She also made it clear that hoped the negotiations could be a model for other U.S. allies and partners who might otherwise be considering the purchase of Russian-made systems. “Ultimately, we are concerned that by purchasing these systems from the Russians, it will be supportive of some of the least good behavior that we have seen from them in various places, including in Europe but also elsewhere,” Kaidanow said. “That’s true of a number of our partners. It’s not just … the Turks.” Acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Tina Kaidanow in 2012 when she was Deputy Ambassador to Afghanistan., US Department of State The S-400 itself is a major issue beyond just Turkey. Traditional U.S. partner Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-backed government in Iraq are in talks to acquire the weapons. India, increasingly a major American ally in Asia, is also moving ahead with a purchase of the missile systems. As with Turkey, there are a number of other factors at play in each one of those situations, as well. Still, how the United States does or doesn’t resolve its dispute with Turkey could have an impact in any of those cases or any future political conflicts over arms purchases. With Russia set to deliver the first S-400s to Turkey in July 2019, there’s still time for the Turks and the Americans to come to an arrangement, but it remains to be seen whether or not it comes to pass or involves Patriot in the end.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 13, 2019",The U.K.’s New ‘Tempest’ Stealth Fighter Project Already Faces Serious Challenges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has unveiled new plans for a new stealth fighter jet called Tempest at the biennial Farnborough Airshow. The announcement coincides with the release of a new Combat Air Strategy, which focuses heavily on sustaining and expanding the United Kingdom’s domestic defense industrial base and international cooperation in that sector, but there are already questions about the project’s viability given the country’s increasingly uncertain political and economic future . Underscoring the emphasis on engagement with the private sector, U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson offered details about Tempest and the country’s new aerial warfare strategy in front of a full-size notional mockup of the jet at BAE’s booth at Farnborough on July 16, 2018. The U.K.-headquartered firm will lead “Team Tempest,” which also includes engine-maker Rolls-Royce , Italian defense contractor Leonardo , and the European missile consortium MBDA . “We have been a world leader in the combat air sector for a century, with an enviable array of skills and technology, and this Strategy makes clear that we are determined to make sure it stays that way,” Williamson said. “British defense industry is a huge contributor to U.K. prosperity, creating thousands of jobs in a thriving advanced manufacturing sector, and generating a U.K. sovereign capability that is the best in the world.” Though Tempest’s design isn’t anywhere close to firm, slides Team Tempest showed at the event described a number of increasingly common basic requirements for an advanced fighter jet design. Though described as a sixth-generation design, what BAE Systems and its partners have shown so far looks very much like what many countries are looking at for new fifth-generation types . The mockup and concept art show a stealthy, modified delta-wing planform with a pair of vertical small, outwardly-canted vertical stabilizers. The aircraft will have two engines hidden away deep inside the airframe to help keep its radar and infrared signatures as low as possible. Rolls-Royce says they are working on an engine design that will leverage composite materials and advanced manufacturing processes to be lightweight, have better thermal management, and still keep costs low. The powerplants will have digital controls for more precise power management and to readily provide maintenance personnel with information about whether components need replacement and other aspects of the system’s “health.” Tempest will have a wide array of sensors, including advanced radars and multi-spectral cameras, as well as unspecified data links and communications equipment. As with other advanced fighter jet designs, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , the goal is to provide the pilot with as complete a picture of the battlespace as possible, allow the jet’s the to share that information with other friendly forces, and let the pilot pull additional data from other assets in the air, on the ground, and even potentially in space . The United Kingdom is looking for a significant amount of modularity and reconfigurable components in the aircraft, too. The jets will have a modular payload bay, which could accommodate weapons – including offensive and defensive directed energy weapons – additional sensors , electronic warfare suites , or other systems to allow it to perform multiple roles. This could allow different aircraft in a single flight to carry only one type of system, with sensor-packing planes locating targets and feeding that information via their data links to others in the formation loaded with a maximum amount of weaponry. Related plans to bake physical growth potential into the design seem harder to realize given the constraints of stealth aircraft designs. Despite what the presentation at Farnborough showed, it could be especially hard for BAE to bolt on additional equipment and maintain the aircraft’s low-observable characteristics. The slides also described a need for “scalable autonomy,” which would imply an optionally manned capability, as well as a potentially artificial intelligence-driven set of flight and mission systems to reduce strain on the pilot and speed up their decision making processes. In addition, the goal is for a single manned Tempest to be able to issue orders to multiple autonomous pilotless versions , a concept commonly known as a “ loyal wingman ,” or otherwise control swarms of other, smaller drones . The video below shows the BAE Taranis, as stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle the company has already been developing with an eye toward teaming with manned aircraft. There appears to be a desire to push that level of autonomy into the ground support arena, as well. The briefing showed what appear to be notional robotic vehicles servicing the aircraft on the ground , which could, theoretically, help reduce the costs of sustaining the aircraft and mitigate the impact of a shrinking overall force, the latter of which being an especially pronounced concern for the relatively small United Kingdom. Making this work could be easier said than done, though, and might end up adding additional costs rather than saving any money. The Tempest plan calls for at least one flying demonstrator aircraft by 2025 followed by deliveries of a production design beginning in 2035. By modern stealth fighter terms, it’s a somewhat aggressive schedule, which the overarching Combat Air Strategy seems to recognize is something of a theme. The document’s subtitle is “an ambition vision for the future.” It’s not the first time the United Kingdom has attempted to develop its own advanced fighter jet, either. In the 1990s, the Royal Air Force launched the Future Offensive Air System (FOAS) program, which eventually led to the BAE Replica fighter jet concept. The video below shows the mockup of the BAE Replica on display the company’s Warton Aerodrome. That aircraft, which Tempest appears to borrow from in many ways, never flew and FOAS came to halt in 2005. The country decided instead to purchase the F-35. In 2012, the United Kingdom and France embarked on what they called the Future Air Combat System (FCAS) project, which focused on developing stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles. Airbus has since used FCAS to describe a Franco-German stealth fighter program that also includes a number of similar requirements to the Tempest program, including supporting loyal wingman-style manned-unmanned teams. An infographic Airbus released in 2017 showing details about the Franco-German FCAS program, which is, in many ways, similar to the United Kingdom’s Tempest project., Airbus Regardless, the U.K. government is clearly hoping to leverage these efforts for its own use to both speed up development and find ways to share burdens and otherwise lower costs. By their very nature, stealth fighter programs have proven to be very time-consuming and costly endeavors . On top of that, despite the prominent Union Jack in the Team Tempest logo, it’s hard to deny that the program already has a distinctly pan-European flavor given the involvement of Leonardo and MDBA. Also, prior to the announcement, the Ministry of Defense had reportedly been in talks with Swedish officials about a shared stealth fighter effort . BAE Systems is already working together with Turkey’s TAI on its TFX program and could join Japan’s future stealth fighter project, as well. A scale model of the single-engine Generic Future Fighter, a conceptual stealth fighter design that Swedish firm Saab and engineers at the country’s Linköping University developed together. This aircraft is reportedly the basis for the Swedish Air Force’s Flygsystem 2020 program and could influence the final design of any future Anglo-Swedish design., Linköping University “Government and industry will work together to achieve a more open and sustainable industrial base which invests in its own future, partners internationally and breaks the cycle of increasing cost and length of Combat Air development programs,” the document explained.  “We will seek to balance military capability, international influence, economic and prosperity benefits.” The immediate problem, of course, is whether the United Kingdom will be able to position itself as a viable partner, let alone leader in such a program given its present political and economic turmoil. This is almost entirely a result of plans to leave the European Union , also known as the British Exit or Brexit. The U.K. government is struggling to firm up its own negotiating position ahead of attempting to begin talks with E.U. officials on a deal to disentangle themselves from the organization. If and when the United Kingdom succeeds in extricating itself from the regional bloc, it will immediately throw up barriers to direct industrial cooperation with European defense contractors. It will almost certainly make existing multi-national partnerships, such as MBDA and the Eurofighter consortium that produces the Typhoon fourth generation fighter jet, more complicated. Possible configurations for the Turkish TFX stealth fighter, a program that BAE is now involved in., Mehmet Delice via Wikimedia In many ways, Tempest appears to be a response to the Franco-German FCAS development, which itself was a response to concerns that Brexit would upend previous plans for a new European fighter jet program. However, Airbus itself has said that it could invite the United Kingdom to join the new FCAS program in the future and the Combat Air Strategy makes it very clear that the Ministry of Defense is interested in preserving those partnerships. There is a certain sense of desperation on both sides, though, who seem eager to downplay issues that are becoming increasingly unavoidable. “For us, an eventual no deal with the E.U. would be a problem because we have a significant presence in the U.K.,” Alessandro Profumo, Leonardo’s CEO, said on July 16, 2018 in an interview after the Tempest announcement. “I hope that next month there will be the capability for the base of continuous cooperation in the defense areas.” If Tempest doesn’t eventually merge with the European FCAS effort, the two programs could find themselves in competition, as well. Export sales would be an easy way to help try and lower the program’s costs, but, in this case, there might just not be enough potential buyers to make this a realistic possibility. Earlier in July 2018, Dirk Hoke, head of the Airbus Defense & Space division working on FCAS, argued that there simply wasn’t enough market space for more than one European stealth fighter project. A bilateral or multilateral partnership, especially with partners outside Europe could still help spread the burden. However, countries such as Sweden and Japan are unlikely to buy any final product in large enough numbers to bring the United Kingdom’s share of the development costs or unit prices down substantially. Economic uncertainty and austerity measures in the United Kingdom itself also mean that’s not entirely clear where the funding for a new generation fighter jet program will come from in the near term. The U.K. Ministry of Defense insists it is committed to also modernizing the Typhoon fleet and buying nearly 140 F-35s , among a host of other often competing priorities across its various branches. Unfortunately, whether or not the United Kingdom will actually purchase the total planned fleet of F-35s is already questionable. The country only has 48 aircraft on order so far and there’s no guarantee this number will increase in the end , especially given the U.K. government’s recent cuts to defense spending. In January 2018, the country put plans for additional defense budget cuts on hold until it had completed a still-ongoing spending review. It says it has already earmarked more than $2.5 billion for Tempest, but this is only a fraction of what would be necessary just for development of the plane, let alone significant purchases of actual planes. There is also the matter of sustainment costs since the United Kingdom’s present plan is for the Tempest to serve alongside both Typhoon and the F-35 for at least a period once it begins entering service in 2035. If this is the case, the U.K. ministry of defense will be presented with the challenge of supporting two distinct stealth fighters, as well as a legacy design, at the same time. The experience with the Joint Strike Fighter program has already shown that keeping even modestly sized fleets of similarly advanced jets flying can be an especially expensive operation in its own right. A Royal Air Force F-35B., Lockheed Martin This only raises further questions about not just if, but why the United Kingdom would start work on another advanced fighter jet that is likely to offer similar capabilities to the F-35, but would immediately be in competition for the same pool of resources with that program. And the Joint Strike Fighter already has significant burden sharing among almost a dozen participating countries, including the United States, and the costs of upgrades are likely to end up spread across those partners. With a demonstrator aircraft not even scheduled to take to the sky for more than six years, there is a distinct chance that the political and economic environment in the United Kingdom will have changed substantially before the Tempest project even gets going. Prime Minister Teresa May’s government has suffered a number of important resignations just in July 2018, including that of now former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson , and it is unclear how long she may last in that post . With all this in mind, the Ministry of Defense will have to work hard if it wants to move Tempest ahead at all, let alone keep to its stated timetable. Otherwise, it’s very possible that the program could end up being a repeat of FOAS and the Replica. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Fighters Stealth"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 2, 2018",Watch USS Racine Get Pummeled To Death During RIMPAC 2018 Sinking Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s biennial Rim Of The Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise is well underway and the Navy just posted a video of a sinking exercise (SINKEX) involving the retired Newport class Landing Ship-Tank amphibious ship USS Racine. The 5,100-ton displacement vessel was decommissioned 25 years ago but finally met its end on July 12, 2018, at the hands of a flurry of friendly missiles and torpedoes. Multiple types of weapons were fired at the ship during the highly anticipated drill, which included land-based attackers for the very first time, and in a big way. A variant of the U.S. Navy’s recently selected Naval Strike Missile was launched by the U.S. Army—which is also looking to acquire the weapon —from a palletized truck-mounted canister. It flew 63 miles to impact the target successfully. Japan also unleashed four of its Type 12 land-based anti-ship missiles at the ship, which marked the first time Japanese anti-ship missiles were fired under the command of U.S. military assets. According to Military.com , nearly half a dozen HIMARS guided-artillery rockets were also fired at the vessel. The push to migrate the hugely successful HIMARS into a maritime and even an anti-ship role is something we once suggested ourselves and have been following closely as of late. It was all but a given that it would be featured in some sort of live-fire fashion during RIMPAC 2018. USS Racine (LST-1191) during happier times. , USN Rounding out the international participants on the SINKEX was close U.S. ally Australia, which used one of its new P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to launch AGM-84 Harpoon at the ship. Last but not least, the Los Angeles class nuclear fast attack submarine USS Olympia also attacked the doomed amphibious ship . As we noted last week , the submarine had been loaded with a submarine-launched version of the Harpoon anti-ship missile—a weapon U.S. submarines haven’t carried for two decades—in advance of the exercise. In addition to firing the UGM-84 Harpoon, USS Olympia also launched a Mk48 torpedo. The torpedo, which often comes last during sinking exercises due to their devastating ability to ‘break the backs’ of even the hardiest combat ships, did exactly that. Still, it took about an hour for Racine to finally succumb to the seas, passing below the waves at around 8pm on its way to its watery grave 15,000 feet down. SINKEXs are largely designed to give very high-quality experience to all those involved and to evaluate the effectiveness of weapons and tactics. It’s hard for us to accurately evaluate the comparative effects of all the weapons fired as we don’t know which ones were loaded with live warheads and which ones we were shown hitting the ship in the video. The location of the impacts and detonations and how the ship was prepped for SINKEX are also important factors. Additionally, much of the video from the exercise isn’t released due to the sensitive nature of some weapons’ capabilities. But the impacts we do see would likely result in at least a mission kill. The ship was originally targeted by a Japanese P-3 Orion, but it’s ability to track the target and pass that info to ‘shooters’ was jammed as part of the realistic drill. A Gray Eagle drone and AH-64E Apache Guardian team then targeted the ship and sent that information via data-link back to the shore-based missile and artillery sites where it was loaded into the weapons before they were sent on their way. Of course, all this fits perfectly into the Pentagon’s emerging multi-domain battle strategy that aims to closely integrate distributed capabilities at sea, in the air, in space and cyberspace, and on land by quickly and securely sharing intelligence and targeting data. Also, building up the ability to repulse enemy naval advanced in multiple ways is also seen as a key requirement for fighting potential future peer-state battles, especially ones in the vast reaches of the Pacific. One of Japan’s Type 12 anti-ship missiles is seen being launched on its way to the ex- USS Racine. , USN America’s long-neglected anti-ship capability is now migrating away from being the domain of strictly sea and air forces and into the hands of land forces as well. The U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps are looking to rapidly acquire various anti-ship capabilities to provide organic maritime defenses capable of denying the enemy vessels access to strategic littoral waterways as well as remote operating areas and forward staging bases. Part of this grand plan that evolved from previous buzzword-worthy concepts is to work seamlessly with allies, especially when it comes to sharing targeting data and situational awareness enhancing intelligence. This becomes even more important when there is a requirement to fight across a huge area. Having an Apache-Gray Eagle team pass off targeting data on a maritime contact—not a traditional use of those platforms by the way—to multi-national ‘shooters’ on land is a nearly ideal display of this concept. Historically speaking, RIMPAC has been used as a testing ground for new technologies and tactics, many of which are transient in nature. But multi-domain warfare is here to stay, as is the need to drastically increase anti-ship capabilities across all four of the services and the push for greater interoperability of those capabilities with America’s regional allies. In other words, this is a small sample of what is to come both in terms of how the U.S. and its friends intend to fight future conflicts in Asia and when it comes to the procurement of new anti-ship systems for the various services. A Naval Strike Missile (NSM) is launched from the back of a Palletized Load System (PLS) by the U.S. Army at Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands on Kauai., DoD As for the ex- USS Racine, she put up a good fight and it isn’t clear at this time if she will be the only ship sunk during this RIMPAC evolution. Racine was one of six vessels the Navy had earmarked for SINKEX drills, which sadly includes one of the youngest mothballed Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates as we discussed in detail in this previous article . The next known SINKEX drill will be Valiant Shield in September, during which that relatively young Perry class frigate, the USS Ford (FFG-54), is slated to face a similar fate as the Racine . According to the U.S. Navy, RIMPAC 2018 includes “twenty-five nations, more than 45 surface ships and submarines, 17 national land forces, and more than 200 aircraft and 25,000 personnel… RIMPAC 2018 is the 26th exercise in a series that began in 1971.” The exercise runs through August 2nd.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 6, 2019",Watch This CH-47 Chinook Stick An Awesome Pinnacle Landing During Mount Hood Rescue,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mount Hood, just an hour’s drive from Portland, is one of the most beautiful mountains in the world. That beauty and easy access draws a lot of climbers and adventure seekers, a handful of which will require rescue. When alpine rescue teams can’t get the job done, Oregon’s national guard choppers are brought in to execute what are often daring operations. This happened yesterday when an Oregon Army National Guard CH-47 was called in to extract a suicidal climber and a rescue team off of the mountain. The ordeal began on Thursday with a call to police from a climber on the summit of Mount Hood who said he was going to take an overdose of medication. Police called the number back but there was no answer. Eventually, a search and rescue operation was ordered which was commanded by the Oregon Air National Guard’s storied 304th Rescue Squadron. The individual was found on the 11,250-foot summit by a six-man rescue team but hot conditions made it unsafe for the team to make the descent down from atop the mountain. A CH-47D from the 168th Aviation Regiment, based in Pendelton, Oregon, swooped in to execute an extraction operation. For rescues above roughly 8,000 feet, and especially in warm conditions, Oregon Army National Guard UH-60M Black Hawks step aside and the tandem-rotor Chinook is brought in for the same reasons why it is so beloved in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan. The 168th trains specifically for these kinds of operations, which includes sending crews periodically to Colorado for High Altitude Aviation Training. The Chinook pilots seemed to have tried to make a landing on a small outcropping on the ridge but then moved to plan B when that didn’t appear to be the best route for extraction, although we don’t know for sure why this decision was made. The tactic then put in play to get everyone off the summit is one unique to the Chinook. https://youtube.com/watch?v=1P98-bd2Oeo The big chopper executed a ‘pinnacle landing’ right on the slope below the top of the mountain. This is when the crew drops the Chinook’s ramp and balances the helicopter on its rear wheels while personnel climb aboard. In this case, the pilots absolutely stuck their pinnacle landing as the CH-47 looks as if it was temporarily pinned immobile to the snow-covered slope. It was truly amazing work by all involved and you have to remember that those blades are spinning very close to the slope at or below eye level for those rescue climbers. Intense stuff! The pinnacle landing maneuver has been used for decades by Chinook crews, but in Afghanistan and in special operations around the globe in the Global War On Terror it has become an especially useful and even life-saving tactic. You can read all about it in this past feature of mine. Helicopter rescue operations on Hood can and have gone very wrong in an instant: https://youtube.com/watch?v=sIlnptpdEkg The man, who clearly had no plans of coming down off the Mount Hood before making what was literally a cry for help, was spotted sitting up before being loaded onto an ambulance and taken to the hospital for treatment. It’s amazing to think that the Chinook crew and the six rescue climbers were willing to risk their lives for someone who didn’t seem to value their own. There are true heroes among us.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 9, 2018",USAF Reveals Details About Some Of Its Most Secretive Drone Units With New Awards,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has handed out its first medals with an “R” device indicating the award is in relation to “remote” operations involving drones. In doing so, the service has also offered a rare acknowledgment of the secretive activities of its 732nd Operations Group and provided unusually specific details about a mission to take out an individual terrorist. At a ceremony on July 11, 2018, U.S. Air Force Colonel Julian Cheater, commander of the 432nd Wing presented Meritorious Service Medals and Air Force Commendation Medals with the R device to five airmen from both the 732nd and 432nd Operations Groups. The Wing controls both units and their assigned squadrons. The Air Force did not say which individuals had received which medals and referred to them only by first names due to operational security concerns. “It is a great honor to recognize the contributions of these Airmen,” Cheater said at the gathering. “Much of the world will never know details of their contributions due to operational security, but rest assured that they have made significant impacts while saving friendly lives.” By themselves, the awards are a notable step in the Pentagon’s efforts to come to terms with the ubiquity of unmanned aircraft over the battlefield and how to acknowledge the service of their crews, who might never be anywhere near the actual fighting. Even after decades of drone operations, pilotless planes and their activities remain controversial, especially in the public sphere among advocates who challenge the efficacy and legality of using armed examples to kill terrorists and militants in areas outside of traditional war zones. An MQ-9 Reaper carrying a mix of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and GBU-12/B laser-guided bombs., USAF Within the U.S. military, there has been a struggle for acceptance of “remote” operations, as well. In February 2013, an attempt to craft a specific award for drone crews, the Distinguished Warfare Medal , quickly became the subject of an outcry after it emerged that the honor would go above the Bronze Star, an award for valor in combat, in order of precedence. Within a month, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel killed the plan for what had become derisively known as the “ Nintendo Medal .” In 2016, the Pentagon approved the R devices instead. In the Air Force, these can go on the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, and Air Force Achievement Medal. Meritorious Service Medals, in front, and Air Force Commendation Medals with the R devices., USAF But in awarding these devices, the Air Force will also have to reveal at least some details about the circumstances leading to their award. This could lead to a greater understanding of the service’s drone operations. One crew from the 432nd Operations Group received their medals for successfully eliminating insurgents in a technical truck in an unspecified conflict area while also avoiding civilian casualties . Another individual from that unit received his honor for providing critical support to friendly troops engaged in a firefight below in the face of increasingly poor weather. It could also lead to additional controversy, especially when it comes to the 732nd Operations Group.  As we at The War Zone recently examined in detail , this unit oversees the Air Force’s most secretive drone units, including three squadrons of MQ-9 Reapers – the 17th, 22nd, and 867th Attack Squadrons – with reported links to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It also oversees the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, which flies the RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone, and the top secret 44th Reconnaissance Squadron , which operates still unknown unmanned aircraft. A 732nd Operations Group challenge coin showing both a pair of MQ-9 Reapers and an RQ-170 Sentinel., Aviatorgear.com According to the official citations, the two individuals from the 732nd who received medals at the July 2018 ceremony, referred to only as Major Asa – now retired – and Captain Evan, were involved in what may be a typical operation for the group’s Reaper units. The event involved persistent surveillance and ultimately a strike against a “high-value target and known terrorist” in an unspecified locale in February 2016. Asa and Evan, who was then a 2nd Lieutenant, helped surveil this unnamed individual over a period of 74 days before the strike occurred. “Once identified, the crew adapted to a dynamic situation as the target traveled through densely populated areas at a high speed,” the Air Force’s press release stated. The Reaper was not actually responsible for killing the individual in the end in this case. Instead, Asa and Evan’s drone used its laser designator to paint the target for another aircraft operating nearby. The Air Force did not say if this other aircraft was manned or unmanned, but it could highlight the relatively unexamined cooperation between drones and traditional combat jets in U.S. military targeted strikes. Leaked documents that The Intercept published in 2015 showed that, at least as of 2013, F-15E Strike Eagles flying out of Djibouti were routinely involved in these missions in Somalia and Yemen, working together with MQ-9s and other manned intelligence aircraft. A slide from a 2013 U.S. military briefing that The Intercept published showing forces supporting the Joint Special Operations Command’s Task Force 84-4’s terrorist-hunting missions in Somalia and Yemen, including MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones and F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets.  , DOD The Air Force did say that the Asa and Evan directly contributed to a mission that resulted in “successfully removing the theater’s number two high-value individual from the battlefield.” And while we don’t know who this might have been and what “battlefield” it was in this instance, there are some distinct possibilities. For one, the U.S. military itself acknowledged two strikes against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) terrorists in Yemen in February 2016. One of these missions reportedly killed one of the Al Qaeda franchise’s “regional emir,” Jalal Balaidi . The U.S. government had previously put out a $5 million bounty on Balaidi through its Rewards for Justice program. An undated file photo of Jalal Balaidi., US Department of State Separately, there was one reported CIA-linked strike in Pakistan in February 2016, which allegedly targeted Abdullah and Jamshed Markaz, who had been members of the Haqqani Network. It was unclear if they had died in that attack. The 2014 documentary film Drone – not to be confused with the 2017 dramatic movie of the same name – featured interviews with former Air Force unmanned aircraft crew members who indicated there was a connection between what was then known as the 17th Reconnaissance Squadron, already part of the 732nd at that time, and CIA-orchestrated targeted killings in Pakistan. The 17th subsequently became an “attack squadron” as part of an Air Force-wide move to rename Reaper units to better reflect their multi-purpose mission set. “There is a lie hidden within that truth. And the lie is that it’s always been the air force that has flown those missions,” Brandon Bryant, a former MQ-1 Predator pilot, said in the film. “The CIA might be the customer but the air force has always flown it. A CIA label is just an excuse to not have to give up any information. That is all it has ever been.” The Air Force may not be able to entirely conceal this reality for much longer. Given the demanding missions the 732nd’s personnel appear to get tasked with, it seems only likely that they will receive more medals with R devices in the future. Unclassified and declassified award citations have already proven to offer a wealth of information about the extent of otherwise secretive special operations missions around the world. It will definitely be a balancing act for the service to both acknowledge excellence during these missions and meet the demands of operational security. The Air Force’s drone crews themselves seem to be eager to have a better chance to offer their side of the story, though. “I went home that night and I knew what I did,” Evan said in an interview for the official Air Force news story. “I think to the outside community, something like this will give a sense of perspective.” It will definitely be interesting as time goes on to see how often the Air Force decides to award the R devices and what additional information it releases about its drone operations to go along with those awards.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020",Dry Dock Collapse In San Diego Floods Expeditionary Sea Base Under Construction,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The barrier that keeps the waters of San Diego Bay from rushing into General Dynamics’ owned NASSCO’s drydock partially collapsed on Wednesday , sending seawater rushing into the construction site of the future Expeditionary Sea Base Miguel Keith . Thankfully nobody was hurt in the incident but the ship is damaged and the Navy and General Dynamics are now trying to figure out just how badly. The pictures and video from the site aren’t pretty , though. The ship had large fissures in its hull open when the event occurred. Apparently, once the water hit a certain level the vessel floated off its blocks. A statement from Navy Sea Systems Command via Defense News reads: “On July 11, General Dynamics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (GD-NASSCO) reported a flooding incident in its graving dock where Miguel Keith (ESB 5) is currently under construction… The ship floated off the docking blocks and took on water through hull cuts that were made to support the ship’s construction and outfitting. The extent of damage to the ship will not be known until NASSCO and Navy personnel can fully assess the situation. Miguel Keith is currently in a safe and stable condition and all personnel are safe and accounted for.” Miguel Keith is the third ship of its kind. You can read all about these behemoths in these past articles of ours— here , here , and here . They are adapted from the Alaska class oil tanker design, so clearly, when empty they are super buoyant. NASSCO recently touted how far along they have come with the assembly the Miguel Keith in a Facebook video showing final structural components being loaded onto the vessel: It will be interesting to see how General Dynamics de-waters the drydock and how long doing so will take, but this is likely to be a big and costly incident for the shipyard which had a questionable future just a couple years ago. That was before obtaining a number of new contracts that will carry the facility through at least 2024. These include billions of dollars worth of new fleet oilers for Navy and commercial vessels, as well. As such, NASSCO is on a hiring spree, looking for 1,000 workers to accommodate the rash of new business. It’s worth noting that the drydock facilities that support the U.S. Navy’s shipbuilding and maintenance efforts are notoriously dilapidated after decades of fiscal neglect. With a larger budget overall under President Trump, Congress and the Navy are trying to pump more money into them in order to have any chance of achieving a 355 ship fleet in the coming decades. These issues may have not been a factor at NASSCO but this event is a strong reminder of the types of things that could happen if deeper investments aren’t made in the critical shipyard infrastructure that supports the fleet where the dry dock facilities average 80 years old.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 14, 2018",The Navy May Use One Hull Design To Replace Its Cruisers And Some Destroyers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says that it has likely hit the limit of what it can do with the Flight III Arleigh Burke destroyer design and isn’t sure if the hullform will be a useful starting place in any way as it begins developing a follow-on class of ships . This could have ramifications for the final shape and construction of the service’s future Large Surface Combatant, a prospective design packed with energy-hungry advanced radars and other electronics, directed energy weapons , and railguns , which could eventually replace both its older DDG-51 Arleigh Burke -class destroyers and its Ticonderoga -class cruisers . On July 11, 2018, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral William Galinis, head of the service’s Program Executive Office Ships, offered these and other new details about the project at a Navy League-hosted breakfast. The Large Surface Combatant, or LSC, is part of a broader fleet transformation effort that also includes the Navy’s future frigate, also known as FFG(X) , and unmanned surface vessels . “It’s going to be more of an evolutionary approach as we migrate from the DDG-51 Flight IIIs to the Large Surface Combatant,” Galinis said. With those most recent Arleigh Burkes , “you kind of get to the naval architectural limits of the DDG-51 hullform.” The Navy chose the Flight III Arleigh Burke design after it decided to dramatically cut its planned purchases of the more advanced DDG-1000 Zumwalt stealth destroyer. These new ships will be substantially more capable than their predecessors thanks to the addition of the AN/SPY-6(V)1 Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) and associated upgrades to the ship’s overall combat system. A breakdown of the Flight III Arleigh Burke upgrade., USN/GAO But the hull is also longer and stronger and the deckhouse is beefier to accommodate the upgrades and the additional power generation requirements. In total, nearly 50 percent of the technical drawings associated with the ship needed changes as part of the update. At present, the Navy has 64 Arleigh Burkes in various configurations in service. There are nine additional ships, all Flight IIA types, under construction. The service expects to take delivery of the first Flight III ship in 2023. “That’s going to bring a lot of incredible capabilities to the fleet but there’s also a fair amount of technical risk,” Galinis said at the Navy League breakfast. The Rear Admiral said that this was an important reason for the Navy to pursue an evolutionary approach to the LSC, which could leverage existing systems to help keep costs as low as possible. The USS John Finn , a Flight IIA Arleigh Burke -class destroyer., USN The problem, as the officer noted, is that the Flight III program seems to have found the basic structural limits of the existing Arleigh Burke design. It’s not clear how useful the hullform or experience with its construction would necessarily help if the Navy decided to pursue a clean sheet-ship design for the LSC, either. It wouldn’t be the first time the service has run into these issues, either. The Ticonderoga -class cruisers, which the new ships are also set to replace, use a hullform based on the now-retired Spruance -class destroyer design . The cruisers’ hulls were effectively overloaded and their aluminum superstructures became a source of persistent and costly cracking under the weight of the Aegis radar system as time went on. “Do we use the DDG-51 hull form and maybe expand that? Do we go with a new hull form?” Galinis added, rhetorically.  “[We] start with a DDG-51 flight III combat system and we build off of that, probably bringing in a new HME [Hull, Mechanical, & Engineering] infrastructure, a new power architecture, to support that system as it then evolves going forward.” The power architecture question will be critical in the future to support further improved radars, communications equipment, and data links. If the Navy does plan to replace Arleigh Burkes and Ticonderogas with a common design, or at least a hullform with any significant commonality, then the design will have to be able to accommodate the systems necessary to support a wide range of offensive and defensive functions. The video below gives a good overview of how the AN/SPY-6(V)1 AMDR on the Flight III Arleigh Burke -class ships works. These would include extensive air and missile defense capabilities , as well as the cruiser’s typical role as a battle management nerve center for Carrier Strike Groups and other surface task forces. Any future ship will also need to be able to run the data links associated with the Navy’s broader push network together all of its surface ships, submarines, and aircraft, as well as share information with platforms from other services and allies and facilities ashore. Power demands will only increase even more as the Navy pushes ahead in developing directed energy weapons, including solid-state lasers , high powered microwaves , and electromagnetic railguns . The service plans to begin outfitting existing DDG-51s with the 60-kilowatt Surface Navy Laser Weapon System ( SNLWS ), a close-in defense weapon for destroying small drones, as well as light manned and unmanned watercraft, in 2020, which could help expose any potential issues. An existing prototype 30-kilowatt Laser Weapon System (LaWS) is on board the USS Portland , a San Antonio -class landing platform dock. An artist’s conception of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer knocking down a target with the Surface Navy Laser Weapon System. The beam will not be visible as shown here., Lockheed Martin “We’re still working through what that power architecture looks like,” Galinis explained. “Do we stay with a more traditional [gas-driven] system… or do we really make that transition to an integrated electric plant – and at some point, probably, bring in energy storage magazines…to support directed energy weapons and things like that?” An integrated electric propulsion system typically involves some combination of fossil-fuel powered turbines and generators that in turn drive electric motors to move the ship and power its onboard systems. In addition to being more efficient and potentially having lower operating costs, in part due to the elimination of long drive shafts and other complex mechanical linkages, these systems can also be more compact, freeing up hull space for other requirements and making the overall internal arrangement more user-friendly. Unfortunately, they’ve also proven to be finicky and complex in their own ways. The Navy has already abandoned a plan to install this type of power architecture in existing Arleigh Burkes after disappointing tests on the USS Truxtun , which could be yet another strike against using any part of the hullform for a future LSC. The Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Truxtun , the only ship in the class to have an integrated electric propulsion system., USN The prototype system reportedly could barely handle the demands of the existing Aegis radar system and running the motors propelling the ship at the same time. “At that point you are a light switch flipping on away from winking out the whole ship,” an unnamed Navy official told Defense News’ David Larter in March 2018. If the Navy can’t use the Flight III DDG-51s as a starting place for the new LSC, it has limited options if it truly wants to stick to its evolutionary approach rather than commission an all-new class of ships. This is something the Navy’s top officer, Admiral John Richardson, said was an essential part of the LSC program in an interview with Defense News in April 2018. Power generation was another. There are very few suitably large surface combatant designs in production either in the United States or among its allies that could serve as the basis for its new ships without serious modification. Beyond the Arleigh Burke -class, there is the San Antonio -class . Shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls has pitched as a possible air and missile defense platform, along with a host of other configurations . A Huntington Ingalls infographic showing a number of potential roles for ships based on the hull., Huntington Ingalls Another option might be a design based on BAE Systems Type 26 City-class for the Royal Navy, which, while described as a frigate, is almost as long as first generation Arleigh Burkes and will displace nearly as much as those Fight I ships with a full combat load. BAE has its own working relationship with the Navy, having gotten contracts to do more limited upgrade and maintenance work on the existing DDG-51s. Unfortunately, the San Antonios, in their present configuration, are far too slow to keep up with a Carrier Strike Group. And if the Arleigh Burke design is maxed out in terms of power generation capability, it seems unlikely that the smaller Type 26 hullform would be any better able to handle these growing demands. Either option would almost certainly require significant modifications to be a viable basis for the LSC, which could be a costly endeavor. But the Navy’s power demands, present and future, could actually cause them to revisit the DDG-1000 Zumwalt stealth destroyer design. It is the only design in production that fits the basic LSC description and has the desired power generation capabilities. This choice would be somewhat ironic given that the Navy developed the Flight III Arleigh Burke design after it decided to dramatically cut its planned purchases of Zumwalts . But it too could come along with its own problems. The USS Zumwalt , prior to its official commissioning., USN For one, the ship has an exotic and complex hullform that Bath Iron Works designed with stealth in mind. Its tumblehome design already presents stability concerns in rough seas, which could limit the ability of any ship based on the design to operate under those conditions. Carrier Strike Groups have to travel anywhere and a future LSC based on the Zumwalt design might not be able to accompany the other ships in certain circumstances. This, in turn, could fur force the flattops to delay their arrival time on station or continue on without a full complement of escorts. The hullform could also limit how readily adaptable the design might be to meet Admiral Richardson’s third goal for the future surface ships, modularity, or any other LSC requirements, an issue that our own Tyler Rogoway examined in detail in the past. The Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS San Jacinto plowing the seas., USN The DDG-1000’s integrated electric propulsion system is the core of its impressive power generation capabilities but has had some troubles, too. A harmonic filter, which acts as a large surge protector to prevent damage from unintended power fluctuations, on board the second Zumwalt , DDG-1001, the future USS Michael Monsoor , failed on the first day of sea trials in December 2017, sending the ship back to port. The ship then suffered damage to the blades in one of its main Rolls-Royce MT30 turbines during acceptance trials, which wrapped up in February 2018. DDG-1001 now needs a replacement turbine and was still pier side in Bath, Maine waiting for repair as of July 11, 2018. It remains unclear whether these issues are isolated to this particular ship, though. The Zumwalt has not experienced any similar issues and the MT30 is widely used, including on the Navy’s Freedom -class Littoral Combat Ships. We don’t know if this same problem has shown up persistently in any of the other ships that use this engine. The future USS Michael Monsoor during sea trials in 2018., USN The exact sort of ship the Navy wants probably won’t be clear until it firms up its requirements for the design. Rear Admiral Galinis said that his office hoped to begin reaching out to industry for some feedback on their initial plans before the end of 2018. “We’re going to have the requirements discussion with Navy leadership and then we’re going to want to engage industry as we start thinking about what options might be available,” Galinis said. “Frankly, industry’s probably best suited to try to help us with the technology piece, especially if we start thinking [that] we want an innovative electric plant.” The real question then will be if vendors can offer a variant or derivative of an in-production ship that meets those needs. If the Navy is truly interested in a common ship to replace the Ticonderogas and at least some of the existing Arleigh Burkes , an all-new hullform may be necessary and would make sense in the long term. A clean-sheet design could give the Navy an opportunity to choose a ship that has better growth potential and will be better able to accept upgrades and additional systems in the future. Any existing design will be more limited in this regard just like the Arleigh Burke and the only one that seems at all to be a workable starting place is the Zumwalt , which may not be a cost-effective option. If the Navy does find itself forced to go with an entirely new class of ships, though, it could easily be an expensive and time-consuming experience. The service is right to make sure it has its requirements ironed out first and then see what its available options might be, especially when considering its recent track record of procuring advanced surface ships .

It’s amazing that the Antonov An-225 Mriya (Dream) has been flying for three decades now and has held the mantle of the world’s largest plane that whole time. That looks like it is set to change in the near future, but regardless, the super-sized adaptation of the already gargantuan An-124 Condor continues to earn its keep by flying outsized cargo for Ukraine’s Antonov Airlines. Being one of the world’s most photographed and videoed airplanes means there aren’t many angles of the one-off jet that we haven’t seen, but Antonov is going the extra mile to continue showing off the Mriya in new and creative ways.

Check the video out below as well as one showing the cockpit and ground perspectives: https://youtube.com/watch?v=5Scet2zoJtE Watching all those gear fold into the fuselage and the An-225’s petal-like gear doors close up is fascinating, but probably the coolest part of the video is seeing the An-225’s transforming wing in action from takeoff to cruise.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Donald Trump made the already ongoing procurement of new Air Force One aircraft a token defense spending issue even before taking office . Since then, the first year and a half of his presidency has been chock full of news regarding what is a relatively tiny but critical acquisition program within the Pentagon’s massive portfolio. Outright false claims of huge savings on the new aircraft, the controversial move to buy orphaned airframes once destined for Russia , and the airplane’s apparent lack of critical capabilities are just some of the issues that have reared their ugly head regarding the White House’s direct involvement in the program. Now the President wants to do what seems to be unthinkable, to change the iconic blue, white, gold, and seafoam (“Luminous Ultramarine”) paint scheme that has adorned the flying White House since JFK sat in the Oval Office over half a century ago. In fact, Jackie Kennedy was a pivotal player in the creation of Air Force One’s now iconic livery, transforming the design from the less than elegant flight-test orange motif to the one know so well today. President Kennedy and the First Lady arrive in Mexico City on Air Force One, then a VC-137A, before the first VC-137C arrived with its iconic paint scheme. , National Archives The President and the First Lady get off the new Air Force One (SAM26000) the day before the President was assassinated. , Kennedy Library The New England Historical Society tells how the famous paint job came to be: Air Force One looks the way it does because President John F. Kennedy sat on the floor of the Oval Office with an industrial designer, scissors, paper and crayons. It was May 1962, and the Air Force had ordered a Boeing C-137 Stratoliner for the president… The Air Force had designed a red-and-gold color scheme for the plane, a modified long-range Boeing 707. Raymond Loewy, the world’s preeminent industrial designer, viewed the Air Force One design as hideous. Loewy owned the largest design firm in New York. He had designed Lucky Strike cigarettes, Studebaker cars, Coca-Cola bottle, Electrolux refrigerators. The press called him The Man Who Streamlined America . First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy , with her unerring sense of style, lobbied the president to hire the French-born Loewy. Loewy met with the president twice. The first time, he and Kennedy sat on the floor of the Oval Office drawing with crayons and cutting up paper to come up with a livery for Air Force One. Then Loewy visited the National Archives to examine historic documents. He was struck by the first printed copy of the Declaration of Independence, it had the country’s name set widely spaced in capital letters in a typeface known as Caslon. Kennedy had already ordered the Air Force to remove the military lettering in favor of the simple United States of America. And he told Loewy he liked blue. Loewy chose two blues: slate and cyan. He left the underside of the fuselage silver and added the presidential seal near the nose, a large American flag to the tail, and the words “United States of America” in capital letters using the Caslon typeface. The First Lady had a hand in designing the interior of the plane. Kennedy had his own entrance, a pale blue rug with an American eagle in the center of an oval with 13 stars, a customized bed, a stateroom, a conference room and glassware from Tiffany’s. Air Force One to this day carries the Loewy design. VC-137C SAM26000 served Kennedy and many other Presidents, Vice Presidents, and dignitaries over its long service life. Here it is seen wearing the Air Force One livery as it is towed into the display hangar at Wright Patterson AFB., USAF So this is not just screwing with some airplane’s paint job, it is destroying a historic work of art by a legendary designer and one of America’s most beloved White House couples. The paint scheme is part of our collective heritage and a major reason why Air Force One remains one of the most recognizable symbols of American ingenuity, might, and prestige to this very day. Air Force One sits idle in the golden sunset light at Portland Air National Guard Base., Tyler Rogoway/Author Axios broke the story about Trump’s wish to remake the look of Air Force One, with Mike Allen writing: Axios has learned that Trump had one specification for the plane that could cause tension with the Air Force and surprise around the world: Trump wants to change the plane’s signature blue-and-white look that goes back 55 years, to a redesign of the presidential aircraft by President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jackie Kennedy in the early 1960s . We’re told that Trump wants a color scheme that “looks more American” and isn’t a “Jackie Kennedy color.” He doesn’t think the current blue (technically “luminous ultramarine”) represents the USA. The president’s preferred design is believed to include red, white and blue. “He can do it,” said a source familiar with the negotiations, when asked about whether Trump can make the change: But the change could cause friction with the Air Force. We’re told some top officers like the current look, which they point out is “known around the world.” Another upgrade: Trump is quite proud of his personal Boeing 757, which he used as his campaign plane: We’re told he wants the presidential bed aboard Air Force One to be larger and more comfortable — more like the executive livery package on his personal plane than the current, couch-like sleeping configuration aboard Air Force One. So POTUS seems to want Air Force One’s appearance to be a ‘louder’ visual affair, something akin to a flying flag. Donald Trump has a long history with aircraft of his own, which are famously known for wearing red, black, white, and gold schemes with a huge italicized TRUMP on their fuselages. Even his lower-profile Citation X had huge Rolls-Royce logos and his made-up family crest painted by its cabin door. Trump’s 757, which once belonged to Paul Allen and replaced his ultra-gaudy 727, was also used as a constant backdrop during his campaign. So although this development is troubling, it isn’t very surprising. What the President wants to do with his personal property is fine. I actually get a kick out of the crazy branding on his airplanes and helicopters and his in-your-face branding style has made him a wealthy and famous man. There is no doubt that he definitely has an amazing knack for self-promotion. But this isn’t his plane. It belongs to all of us. And turning it into a silly 4th of July fireworks stand billboard can’t happen. It wouldn’t make us look powerful. It would make us look ridiculous. Many people have joked that Trump will paint a giant eagle on the nose of Air Force One. When it comes to Presidential aircraft, there is actually a precedent for that. A VC-118 Liftmaster nicknamed Independence had just this motif when it flew President Truman around. This was before the cultural lore of Air Force One was established though. USAF Maybe the most conservative thing we can hope for is something akin to the old American Airlines 747 scheme that was also flown on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for years. But it will probably involve a lot more flash based on what we have seen on Trump’s own aircraft in the past. NASA It’s fine that the President wants to put his touch on the new jets. Including some unique interior elements and other small details like adding a big bed and some gold-plated fixtures or something really shouldn’t be a problem. But changing the aircraft’s outward appearance is. Clearly, the USAF brass will have some very strong opinions of their own about fooling with Air Force One’s historic and elegant look. But the question then becomes would they actually be willing to take on the White House over such an issue? Probably not, especially considering how this President holds brutal grudges. The good news is we still have at least a few years before the first of two 747-8i replacements for the USAF two aging VC-25As enters service, so enjoy their gorgeous paint scheme why you still can. And please, nobody tell POTUS that a new Marine One will be arriving even sooner.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 30, 2018",Syrian Drone Prompts Israel To Retaliate As Netanyahu and Putin Try to Cut a Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel struck three targets in Syria after a drone, reportedly under the control of forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, crossed the border and flew 10 miles into Israeli territory. This is the latest in the string of such incidents and came amid a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the future of the boundary and the status of Iranian-backed forces in southern Syria. The chain of events began on July 11, 2018, when unmanned aircraft passed over the border near the contested Golan Heights and Israeli air defense forces shot it down with a Patriot surface-to-air missile . The drone was reportedly in Israeli airspace for approximately 16 minutes and had also flown over neighboring Jordan during its flight. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) then responded with the strikes in Syria. “The IDF will continue to operate determinedly and decisively against any attempts to hurt Israeli civilians and breaches of Israeli sovereignty,” the Israeli military’s official Twitter account said after posting videos of the shoot down and the strikes. “The IDF holds the Syrian regime accountable for the actions carried out  in its territory and warns it from further action against Israeli forces.” Syrian forces apparently declined to respond to those attacks. The country’s state-run media did confirm Israel had destroyed the targets in its southern Quneitra Governorate, which borders the Golan. Footage of the Patriot missile intercepting the Syrian UAV that infiltrated Israeli territory today pic.twitter.com/g5MnjZLdyl — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) July 11, 2018 Earlier tonight, Wednesday July 11th, the IDF targeted three military posts in Syria in response to the infiltration of the Syrian UAV into Israel that was intercepted by the IDF earlier today pic.twitter.com/BvaEOfHNDv — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) July 11, 2018 The Assad regime claimed that Israeli jets had carried out the strikes, but the IDF did not say how it had conducted the operation. In response to an Iranian rocket barrage in May 2018, Israel employed both air- and ground-launched precision-guided munitions. The video that the IDF released was shot from a low and apparently static position, suggesting that the targets were close enough to the border that the IDF could have employed guided artillery rockets or ground-launched man-in-the-loop missiles rather that combat jets. The targets themselves appeared to be an observation post and a pair of larger structures that could serve as command centers or barracks. Regardless of the incident’s specifics, it underscores the growing tensions along the Israeli-Syrian border as Assad, with the help of his Russian and Iranian benefactors, continues to reassert his regime’s control over southern Syria. Since a renewed offensive in the area began in June 2018 , government forces and supporting militias have made significant gains, causing a large number of rebel fighters to abandon their posts and heavy equipment and cross into Jordan – which could explain, in part, why the drone was flying in the area in the first place.

There is significant evidence to suggest the developing situation is the result of new negotiations between Israel and Russia with the potential involvement of the U.S. government, which is further reinforced by Prime Minister Netanyahu’s visit to Moscow. On July 8, 2018, the Israeli leader reportedly told his cabinet that the meeting would cover two topics in particular. “First, we will not tolerate the establishment of a military presence by Iran and its proxies anywhere in Syria – not close to the border and not far away from it,” he said, according to an official statement from the Prime Minister’s office. “Second, we will demand that Syria, and the Syrian military, strictly uphold the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement.” In 1974, Israel and Syria agreed to a United Nations-enforced buffer zone between the two countries in the Golan Heights pending a final resolution of that territorial dispute. There have been multiple reports – including the video below – that Syria is violating the terms of that deal and moving forces into this neutral zone. כוחות המזוהים עם משטר אסד השתלטו על עמדת או""ם נטושה באזור החיץ סמוך לגבול. בצה""ל רואים את הדבר בחומרה, ומדגישים את הנחישות למנוע התבססות צבאית באזור. הדיווח של כתבתנו המדינית @gilicohen10 ב- #חדשותהערב pic.twitter.com/EjVJ6NkjDQ — כאן חדשות (@kann_news) June 24, 2018 Netanyahu also reportedly assured Putin that Israel would not attempt to unseat Assad in exchange for meeting these demands. “They [Russia] have an active interest in seeing a stable Assad regime and we in getting the Iranians out. These can clash or it can align,” an unnamed Israeli official told Reuters on July 11, 2018. But while Russia might be able to convince Assad to abandon any plans to exploit the situation to retake portions of the Golan, there is no indication that the Kremlin has any sway over Iran or their interactions with the Syrian regime. Russian and Iranian officials have increasingly sparred over each others’ presence in the country, but so far the government in Damascus does not appear to have made any clear attempts to sideline one party or the other. Russia itself has also shown on numerous occasions that it is either unable to or uninterested in exercising its influence over Assad. Putin also heavily downplayed his meeting with Netanyahu, which he described as “ private visit ” primarily to watch the World Cup. At the same time, whatever the outcome of any Israeli-Russian agreement might be, Iran does not appear to be interested in reducing its presence in southern Syria. In June 2018, Liwa Zulfiqar, an Iranian-supported Iraqi Shia milita in Syria, posted a video online showing its fighters supporting the Assad’s offensive in the border region. According to the Long War Journal , other imagery purporting to show fighters from Liwa Fatemiyoun, an Afghan Shia militia, or the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the same area were actually years old. Footage released by the Iranian-controlled Iraqi Shia militia, Liwa Zulfiqar, reporting to show its troops near Busra al Harir as part of the current Syrian regime offensive in Deraa – more LWJ #Syria analysis coming: pic.twitter.com/DjnSvx1ayY — Long War Journal (@LongWarJournal) June 27, 2018 Even if the parties reach a deal, there’s no guarantee it will hold, as I wrote in June 2018 after another drone incursion into Israel: “If that deal falters, Israel could easily find itself facing a complicated mix of Syrian, Russian, and Iranian forces along the shared boundary. Israel, as well as the United States, might also find they have few willing partners left in the region to oppose those forces, having ostensibly cast them aside in this attempt to get Iran off the border. “ As always when it comes to the conflict in and around Syria , there is a significant potential for any subsequent crisis to rapidly escalate into a larger conflagration. Assad could seek to play his Russian and Iranian benefactors off of each other while at the same time attempting to reassert himself in southern Syria to include parts of the Golan. “Israel is unlikely to find that any more acceptable than Iranian forces massed along their border in Syria and could decide to take unilateral action if the United Nations proves incapable of forcing Assad to temper his ambitions. Regardless of the outcome, the regime in Damascus would be hard pressed to ever completely deny Iran and Iranian-backed militias the freedom to at least harass Israeli, which serves its own interests.” There is also the matter of U.S. President Donald Trump’s upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin, scheduled to occur on July 16, 2018. The two leaders are set to discuss the situation in Syria and Trump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw U.S. military forces from the conflict. It is possible that the U.S. and Russian governments might seek to make an exchange of sorts in support of Israel’s policy objectives. There has also been the suggestion that Trump may look to accept that Ukraine’s Crimea region is now part of Russia, or at least ease sanctions over the Kremlin’s illegal occupation of the Peninsula, in exchange for this or other concessions. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, left, and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet on July 11, 2018. , Sergey Guneev/Sputnik via AP “More than one senior Israeli official has suggested to me that the United States should, in effect, ‘trade Ukraine for Syria,’” Daniel Shapiro, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and now visiting fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, wrote in a recent op-ed in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz . “Look the other way at Russia’s takeover of portions of Ukraine as the price for Russia expelling Iran from Syria.” These are bargaining chips that can only be spent once, though. Doing so could easily limit the ability for Israel or the United States to negotiate again with Russia, or Assad himself, in the event that any agreement fails. This could leave the parties facing the prospect of a newly tense status quo and the increased potential for outright conflict. The latest drone overflight of Israel, and the Israeli military response, only serves to highlight how fragile the situation is already.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 23, 2018",The OV-1 Mohawk Was One Of The U.S. Military’s First Forgotten Light Attack Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Air Force continues to stumble through its latest attempt to procure a light attack aircraft , it is important to remember just how often the U.S. military as a whole has waffled , dithered , and squabbled over the concept in the past. The U.S. Army’s OV-1 Mohawk, which did have a lengthy career as a surveillance aircraft, is one of the earliest examples of competing priorities and infighting between services killing plans for what could have also been an effective light attack platform. By the time the Grumman-made aircraft, also known as the G-134 , first flew in 1959, the Mohawk program had already been something of a saga for nearly three years. Originally the Army had teamed up with the U.S. Marine Corps to work on a plane to replace the small Cessna O-1 Bird Dog observation plane that both services were still flying at the time. “The requirement was for an aircraft capable of rough field operation with short take-off performance and equipped for tactical observation and battlefield surveillance missions,” according to an official Army historical monograph the service published in 1991. “The Marines withdrew from the project before the first flight, leaving the Army to continue development alone.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=cK591X5oEQs But the Army and the Marines had both relied on the U.S. Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics to do the contracting. So, as it happened, the Army received its first nine prototype Mohawks via a Navy-run deal in 1959. The Mohawk has a unique and instantly recognizable shape with a distinctive triple tail – the original design actually had a T-shaped tail – turboprop engines mounted over its wings, and bug-eyed cockpit. The latter design element provided the crew of two with excellent visibility to spot targets of interest on the ground. A low-quality image showing a mockup of what could have been the US Marine Corps’ “OF-1” Mohawk, featuring the early T-tail design., via SDASM By the end of 1959, the Army had ordered more than 70 Mohawks in three variants and assigned them each designations in its own short-lived aircraft nomenclature system. The bulk of these were AO-1AFs was a visual surveillance type with a KA-30 film camera in the fuselage that the crew could point to the left or the right of the aircraft as desired. Pods with upward ejecting flares would provide illumination for night photography. The AO-1BF carried a then state-of-the-art AN/APS-94 side-looking airborne radar (SLAR), a radar imaging sensor, in a long pod under the right side of the forward fuselage. The AO-1CF was virtually identical to the AF version, but carried an AN/UAS-4 infrared line-scanning camera. Both of these variants could collect imagery day and night without the need for flares. In 1962, under the new tri-service designation system, the AO-1AF, BF, and CF became the OV-1A, B, and C, respectively. An AO-1AF Mohawk, later known as the OV-1A., US Army The Mohawks were a key component of the Army’s then relatively novel “ airmobile ” concept, which envisioned troops employing both helicopters and light fixed-wing transports to rapidly deploy into certain areas to perform tasks such as establishing a “beachhead” of sorts for follow-on forces or quickly encircling opponents. The aircraft actually used the same Lycoming T53 turboprop engine as the then relatively new Bell Huey helicopter , which would have helped simplify maintenance requirements in the field. Since the airmobile doctrine inherently expected those troops to operate for an extended period of time without necessarily being able to rely on support from other Army units or forces from other services, the potential value of arming at least some of the Mohawks quickly became apparent. The service even experimented with using its new AC-1 Caribou light transports – later known as CV-2s and then C-7s – as small mid-air refueling tankers to help extend the range and loiter time of the OV-1s for both reconnaissance and light attack missions. The fledgling Special Forces community, which also expected to operate behind enemy lines for extended periods detached from conventional support, was also immediately interested in the Mohawk as a light attack aircraft. This was part of a larger plan called Light Aviation Special Support Operations, or LASSO, which shouldn’t be confused with U.S. Special Operations Command’s present-day Light Attack Support for Special Operations program, also abbreviated as LASSO , though it might help explain the choice of name. So, by the end of 1960, the Army had already begun testing the Mohawks with almost any weapons it could get its hand on. The vast majority of these were gun pods, unguided rockets, and dumb bombs. One of the gun pods that went under the Mohawk’s wings during testing was a design containing a single .50 caliber machine gun that U.S. Air Force had purchased for T-28 Trojan propeller engine trainers that it used to train foreign air forces before delivering them directly to those countries for light attack missions – something that services still does in many ways today with its A-29 Super Tucano training program . This system contained 100 rounds of ammunition. Weapons under an OV-1A Mohawk’s wing. From left to right, a 19-shot 2.75″ FFAR pod, a .50 caliber gun pod with 100 rounds of ammunition, and a Mk 79 Mod 0 napalm canister., US Army via Ray Wilhite The Army eventually developed its own, more capable pod, the XM14, which would work with both light fixed-wing aircraft, such as the Mohawk, and helicopters. This weapon system had a faster-firing M3 .50 caliber machine gun and 750 rounds to go with it. The OV-1s also served as one testbed for the much more obscure XM13, which contained a single 40mm M75 automatic grenade launcher . There was also the M18, with a fast-firing 7.62mm Minigun , and the XM19, containing a pair of 7.62mm M60 machine guns . The XM13 40mm grenade launcher pod on an OV-1 Mohawk during a test., US Army The rockets the Army tested on the Mohawk were a mix of old and new designs. These included 5” High Velocity Aircraft Rockets (HVAR) left over from the Korean War, as well as pods holding 2.75” Folding Fin Aerial Rockets (FFAR) and 5” Zuni rockets . The possible bomb loads similarly included World War II-era types still in U.S. military inventory, as well as the more modern low-drag Mk 80-series types . The Army also evaluated the OV-1’s ability to carry napalm tanks, incendiary cluster bombs , and flare racks, the latter being useful for nighttime attacks. Another Mohawk test loadout. From left to right, an AN/M65A1 1,000-pound class bomb, an AN/M64A1 500-pound class bomb, and another 19-shot pod of 2.75″ FFAR rockets., US Army via Ray Wilhite But the Army didn’t stop there. What if the Mohawks had to engage larger, better-protected targets because other support was unavailable or defend themselves against enemy aircraft? In these cases, respectively, the OV-1s might have carried AGM-12 Bullpup radio command-guided missiles or AIM-9B Sidewinders . A piece of contemporary promotional art from the Ryan Aeronautical Company depicted one of the planes carrying an experimental anti-radiation missile , presumably to take on hostile air defenses. However, this seems to have been a particularly optimistic understanding of the type’s capabilities, even against contemporary threats in the 1960s. An AIM-9B Sidewinder along with two Mk 80-series bombs on another Mohawk., US Army via Ray Wilhite By 1961, Grumman itself was marketing the Mohawk as a light attack platform with a low operating cost compared to combat jets, which would be easy to fly and maintain and able to operate from areas with unimproved runways with limited support – capabilities that are still the main selling points of light attack aircraft to this day . The firm even pitched the idea of installing a 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon in a blister fairing underneath the fuselage. An artist’s conception of a Mohawk armed with a Vulcan cannon., Grumman via the OV-1 Mohawk Association While the results of the tests were generally positive and the concept of arming the OV-1As and Cs seemed particularly viable, the prospect of light attack Mohawks almost immediately ran into a number of hurdles. Opposition from the Air Force to the idea of the Army having any fixed-wing aircraft, let alone combat-capable planes, was by far the biggest. The Army eventually renamed the aircraft it had configured to carry weapons as JOV-1A and JOV-1Cs, with the “J” standing for a temporary modification. This seems to have been an attempt to label the entire project as limited “experiment” in order to avoid complaints force the Air Force.

To the right, you can also see the tail of an Italian made Fiat G.91 combat jet, which the Army also evaluated briefly for its own use., US Army via Ray Wilhite Even within the Army, the idea of armed Mohawks wasn’t entirely safe. Many in the service’s senior leadership were particularly opposed to giving OV-1s in any configuration to Special Forces units, which had already found themselves in conflict with “Big Army” priorities, according to the 1991 Army history. The critics initially lost out, at least initially and in 1962, the Army began forming two Special Warfare Aviation Detachments. By the end of that year, the second one of these units, the 23rd Special Warfare Aviation Detachment, had arrived in South Vietnam with its six JOV-1Cs. Ryan Aeronautical Company concept art of an OV-1 Mohawk carrying a pair of anti-radiation missiles., SDASM Though billed as a supporting asset for Special Forces units in the country, the planes flew surveillance and armed reconnaissance missions in support of South Vietnam Army divisions and that country’s Railway Security Agency. In the latter case, the aircraft helped guard the railroads against Viet Cong sabotage and ambushes. The aircraft’s relatively low acoustic signature made it well suited to these missions during the day and at night, flying quietly around its assigned areas and giving the insurgents less time to react and either flee the area or try and attack the plane. Infighting with the Air Force hampered its operations with the Army eventually restricting the aircraft to load outs consisting of just a pair of XM14 gun pods and flares, which the crew could only employ in self-defense. Pictures existing that show the unit continued to employ rockets afterward, though. The 23rd and evaluators from the Army Concept Team In Vietnam (ACTIV), which reported on the value of new technologies in the war zone, were both of the belief that these limitations prevented the Army from getting the most out of its OV-1s. “Current test restrictions prevent exploitation of the full capabilities of these versatile aircraft,” ACTIV concluded in 1963. An XM14 gun pod in between two racks of flares on an OV-1 Mohawk, similar to the loadouts the 23rd Special Warfare Aviation Detachment and its successors could have used in South Vietnam., US Army via Ray Wilhite In 1964, the matter became increasingly moot when Army leadership finally succeeded in shutting down the 23rd. At that time, it merged with other units to form the non-Special Forces focused 73rd Aviation Company (Aerial Surveillance). This was in many ways the beginning of the end not just for the armed OV-1s, but for the fixed wing component of the Army’s airmobility concept. In 1966, the service finally made a deal with the Air Force and ended its fixed-wing tactical transport ambitions . The next year, it passed the remaining Caribous to the Air Force, as well, leaving airmobile forces with only helicopters. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps did operate a number of different fixed-wing light attack aircraft during the Vietnam War. In particular, the conflict gave the Korean War-era A-1 Skyraider another chance to shine and saw the introduction of the OV-10 Bronco , the aircraft the Marines went with after abandoning the OV-1 program. The JOV-1s that had provisions for weapons did filter out to other Mohawk units in South Vietnam and there is significant evidence that they continued to fly with both gun pods and rockets “for self-defense” in defiance of the Army-Air Force agreement. In February 1968, U.S Army Captain Ken Lee allegedly managed to shoot down a North Vietnamese MiG-17 with a combination of rocket and machine gun fire while flying in an OV-1A over the A Shau Valley near the border with Laos, though it may simply have crashed into a mountain after trying to jump the lower and slower flying aircraft. The story seems apocryphal given that it is hard to imagine a single MiG-17 would have been operating that far south in Laos at a time when North Vietnamese pilots typically avoided potential engagements with American aircraft, preferring to only briefly harass aircraft flying into North Vietnam and then return to the safety of their bases. And while it makes sense that Lee’s superiors would have told him to keep quiet about it the incident for fear of exposing that they were still flying with weapons, it also makes the event that much more difficult to confirm. Regardless, it does suggest that armed Mohawks continued to prowl South Vietnam for years after they were officially supposed to cease such operations. This didn’t survive the end of the Vietnam War, though. It’s not entirely clear what happened to the JOV-1As and JOV-1Cs, but it is likely that any surviving examples either went into retirement or got converted into OV-1Ds. This variant effectively blended the B and C models together, being able to carry the SLAR pod and infrared imaging equipment as necessary. Some OV-1Cs and OV-1Ds also ended up as electronic intelligence gathering platforms as part of the Quick Look project. These variants became known as RV-1Cs and RV-1Ds and the Army further converted an even smaller number to an improved configuration known variously as the EV-1E or RV-1E. Though it abandoned armed variants, the Army continued employing Mohawks for battlefield surveillance and reconnaissance missions in Europe, South Korea, and Latin America, for decades after the Vietnam War ended, notably deploying some during Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991. It retired all of the remaining OV-1s in 1996 in favor the larger, multi-mission four-engine EO-5C Airborne Reconnaissance Low aircraft. Few other countries followed suit in adopting the Mohawk, with France, Germany, and Japan all passing on the type after evaluating it. Small numbers did end up in service with Argentina’s Army and the Israel Defense Forces, as well as the U.S. Customs Service and NASA. A NASA OV-1B uses its SLAR and an additional sensor system mounted in the tail to map ice over the Great Lakes in 1973., NASA The OV-1 did enjoy a brief return to the limelight in the mid-2000s. After the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the security situation there quickly deteriorated, with improvised explosive devices becoming a particularly pronounced danger to U.S. and other coalition troops. The U.S. military as a whole kicked off a large number of crash programs to respond to the threat, including a host of aerial, persistent surveillance systems on manned and unmanned aircraft. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) led development on what it called the Sonoma Persistent Surveillance System . The main sensor was a large megapixel camera arrangement that could rapidly collect still images, combined with a processing system that could identify the motion of up to 8,000 vehicle-sized objects within the field of view. For perspective, the original 22-megapixel prototype camera system could take high-resolution images of an area roughly one quarter the size of Washington, D.C. The improved 66-megapixel design could scan the entire city. The third, sensor, which sources show was either a 163- or 176-megapixel , gave analysts the ability to spot targets in an area that would also have included suburbs in Maryland and Virginia. A satellite map of the greater Washington, D.C area as it could be viewed using different sensors. The second prototype Sonoma camera system, the 66-megapixel “Thunderbolt,” encompasses the entire city itself., LLNL With these images in hand, combined with the tracks noting vehicle motion, intelligence specialists could develop so-called “ patterns of life ” and isolate potentially unusual activity over time. In Iraq, this sort of capability helped analysts isolate activity near where American forces encountered roadside bombs and use that information to trace individuals and vehicles back to bomb-making workshops or other insurgent hideouts. Wide area surveillance systems have since become an invaluable tool for tracking small groups of militants or even individual terrorists . LLNL eventually developed a successor system and installed it on an OV-1D that the Army pulled out of storage. This system, dubbed Mohawk Stare, which went under the nose where the SLAR pod would have been, was functional, but eventually, the LLNL and the service decided to shift platforms . The follow-on Constant Hawk wide-area surveillance system ended up first on a contractor-operated Shorts 360 and then on ubiquitous Beechcraft King Air twin-engine turboprops. The Army subsequently bought the latter aircraft from the private companies that had been flying them and has since upgraded them, resulting in the MC-12S Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System-G ( EMARSS-G ) aircraft, with the “G” standing for geo-intelligence. Another successor sensor package, Gorgon Stare , is still in service on Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drones . A US Army OV-1D Mohawk with the Mohawk Stare pod, but without the camera actually fitted in the rear., PV Labs The armed configuration remained largely forgotten through these twilight years. Still, one has to wonder how effective a modernized OV-1D with its own weapons to take on any targets of opportunity might have been in Iraq in the mid-to-late 2000s or Afghanistan today. It would likely have taken minimal effort to install a more modern sensor turret – the Customs Service’s Mohawks got nose-mounted forward-looking infrared turrets in the late 1970s – which could have enabled the air to conduct persistent day and night surveillance and potentially employ precision-guided munitions. This all sounds almost exactly like what the Air Force claims it wants, at least conceptually , when it comes to a prospective future light attack platform. And when it comes to weapons, the low-cost Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II ( APKWS II ) laser-guided 70mm rocket, a vastly improved derivative of the 2.75″ FFARs the Mohawks employed in Vietnam, could have been a particularly deadly option. This was the primary weapon U.S. Special Operations Command personnel employed in a limited, but highly successful field test involving a pair of modernized OV-10G+ Bronco light attack aircraft in Iraq in 2015. If anything, the story of the armed Mohawks only underscores how much history the U.S. military has with light attack aircraft already, but that they have failed to take full advantage of for various reasons. Hopefully, the Air Force is at least making full use of this extensive institutional experience as it tries to push ahead with its latest light attack project.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of the many unique evolutions during the Navy’s giant, biannual, multi-national naval exercise known as Rim Of The Pacific or RIMPAC, a U.S. Navy nuclear fast attack submarine will be fire a live UGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile at a target in the waters off of Hawaii. What’s interesting is that Harpoon missiles were stripped from American submarines over 20 years ago, but the standoff range and flexibility that anti-ship missiles provide are once again becoming in-demand capability for America’s submarine force and its surface fleet as well . The U.S. Navy posted shots of a UGM-84 being loaded onto the Los Angeles class fast attack submarine USS Olympia (SSN-717), but no additional information was given beyond the fact that it would be used for a live-fire exercise during RIMPAC. Olympia is the second oldest submarine in the Navy’s fast attack fleet, having been commissioned in 1984. An UGM-84 is loaded into Olympia’s torpedo room before heading out on RIMPAC maneuvers. , USN Today, U.S. Navy submarines rely on their torpedoes alone for anti-ship warfare, but there has been some talk of the Harpoon returning to the torpedo tubes of America’s SSNs. Yet a clear plan to do so has not been put in place—at least as far as we know. The Block IV Tomahawk cruise missile has a secondary anti-ship capability though, which could negate the need for the much shorter-ranged (about 90 miles versus 900 miles) and less flexible Harpoon to be reintegrated into America’s subsurface arsenal. The Navy is also working on classified submarine-launched anti-ship missile systems that are far more exotic in nature than the Harpoon or the latest iteration of the Tomahawk. It’s possible that this test is related to such a program and uses a Harpoon as a surrogate weapon to evaluate a particular tactical scenario. We also don’t know the exact configuration of the Harpoon being used in the test but UGM-84D models are known to be compatible with the Los Angeles class. It’s also worth mentioning that surface and air-launched versions of the Harpoon still serve in the U.S. military and in dozens of militaries around the globe. But the Navy is slowly stepping away from the four-decade-old design and working on fielding stealthier and smarter anti-ship missiles types. We will probably find out more about this particular part of the exercise after it occurs as live-fire portions of RIMPAC often get a big public affairs boost. This is particularly so if the weapon in question is being used as part of SINKEX drill where retired a Navy ship will be pummeled with various munitions until it succumbs to the sea. Regardless, this is yet another sign that after decades of hibernation, the Pentagon is taking a whole new interest in anti-ship missiles as a result of a new era of anti-access and area-denial warfare riding peer-state competition on the high seas. We’ll let you know when we find out more information. Olympia visited its namesake city in March.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2018","It’s Not What Trump Said About Germany At The NATO Summit, It’s How He Said It","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump unleashed a scathing monologue about Germany’s investment, or lack thereof, in its own defense and its energy dependence on Russia, in which he stated that “Germany is totally controlled by Russia.” The on-camera verbal onslaught on Berlin’s policies occurred at a breakfast with the NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and dovetailed with the Trump administration’s general claim that NATO countries are not paying their fair share when it comes to defense spending and the collective good. It also coincides with the general malaise the President has shown towards the organization that dates back to the beginning of his presidential campaign. Here’s exactly what Trump said about Germany’s lack of sovereignty: “If you look at it, Germany is a captive of Russia… They got rid of their coal plants. They got rid of their nuclear. They’re getting so much of the oil and gas from Russia. I think it’s something that NATO has to look at. I think it’s very inappropriate.” You can see the part where he says Germany is controlled by Russia here: You can and should watch the entire largely one-sided exchange below: As it is with many things Trump, it’s not what he says necessarily but when, where, and especially how he says it. For the record, I have written at length about how Trump is right to demand more out of NATO partners. The U.S. subsidizes NATO countries’ defense to an overwhelming degree and it’s clear that many members could and should do more, especially considering the rise of Russia’s far more aggressive foreign policy over the last four years. Setting a monolithic percentage of GDP goal alone may not be a perfect way of doing it, and maybe this should change as well, with specific capability needs factored in, but it is the best single indicator we have as to how much each country is investing into their military. Currently, that goal is that all NATO countries spend two percent of GDP on defense, which many, including the some of the richest members, are not coming close to meeting. But that goal was slated to be achieved by the middle of the next decade, not overnight. Trump now is demanding that it is met far sooner. Still, Germany, in particular, has a crumbling military that is becoming woefully impotent and mismatched when it comes to capabilities versus capacity . It pays just 1.2 percent of GDP for defense and Trump is right, Berlin does have a uniquely close relationship with Moscow. This is due to a number of factors, including the fact that half country was once part of the Soviet Union, with the infrastructure that goes along with it. Part of this is also due to the increasing amount of its energy supplies coming from Russia. In 2015, Germany imported 63.5 percent of its energy, and Russia provided a sizeable amount of those imports—roughly 35 percent of the gas and 40 percent of the oil. Those numbers are only increasing in Russia’s favor as a new natural gas pipeline is being established. These imports are strategic in nature and could potentially make Germany’s policy decisions vulnerable to Russian influence. But that type of trade works both ways to some degree as well, with Russia receiving critical financial support from Germany in exchange for natural gas—money that they would hate to lose over a diplomatic woe or even a conflict. In other words, the old axiom that trade leads to stability and peace still holds true, but Germany’s addiction to Russian energy gives Moscow a greater strategic advantage over the country than vice versa. So it makes sense for Trump to address these issues, he should be applauded for doing so as they are strategically valid and important to NATO and the United States. But doing so on camera, in a demeaning and scathing manner, and stating that Germany is “controlled by Russia,” which it isn’t despite its energy exporting relationship with the country, is totally uncalled for and amounts to a strategic loss for all those involved. Putin greeting Merkel during a recent visit to Sochi for one-on-one talks. , AP Above all other goals, this is exactly what Vladimir Putin has longed for —a fissure in the NATO alliance and in military unity among ‘the West’s’ most powerful states. This strategic concern should supersede any the possibility of any gains that could be realized by having Germany quickly commit more cash to defense or becoming less reliant on Russian energy imports. In essence, Trump’s words couldn’t have been written better by the Russians themselves. Right idea, but the wrong execution—something that has plagued this administration’s foreign policy from the outset. The same message could have been delivered behind closed doors or even in an official communique, addressing each concern in detail diplomatically. If Trump insisted on talking about it on camera, then each issue could have been noted without demeaning one of our closest allies and declaring that their government is controlled by the same potential enemy that NATO is most concerned with countering. And really, all this is just complaining. Why not lay out a firm framework that describes clear consequences for Germany and other states for not meeting the two percent goal by a particular timeline and/or a restructuring of NATO’s collective defense capability goals altogether? Trump’s declaration of Russia’s control over Germany also invites a lot of criticism and outright claims of hypocrisy considering its own ongoing Russian influence woes. Also the fact that Trump himself has been quick to chide the leadership of foreign allies but rarely Vladimir Putin, a man he is meeting with one-on-one in just a few days no less, also continues to raise eyebrows. AP The thing is, many NATO countries are already moving in the right direction when it comes to upping defense spending and it was largely understood that a commitment to redouble these efforts would come out of this summit regardless of Trump’s rhetoric. But now Trump is demanding countries spend four percent of GDP on defense, which is higher than the 3.6 percent of GDP the U.S. currently plows into military spending. Such a goal is very unlikely to be realized, at least anytime in the foreseeable future, and it would require the U.S. to increase its own $700B+ defense budget, which is already seen by many as totally unsustainable. Trump also stated that countries owe the U.S. money retroactively for subsidizing their defense, stating : “Many countries are not paying what they should. And, frankly, many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back, where they’re delinquent, as far as I’m concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them… So if you go back ten or 20 years, you’ll just add it all up. It’s massive amounts of money is owed.” Some will say the new four percent goal and the retroactive payments are just bargaining tactics, but even so, they could turn off member states from even trying to reach the two percent goal in the short term as there seems to be no end in sight when it comes to spending beyond that goal. In Germany’s case, going to four percent would mean nearly quadrupling defense spending. For smaller and poorer NATO countries with relatively tiny defense budgets, this would be equally impossible. So far, everyone from ex-diplomats to the German Chancellor herself has rebuked Trump’s claim about Russia’s hold on Germany. Angela Merkel responded by recalling her own upbringing in East Germany during the darkest days of the Cold War and highlighting the country’s contemporary contributions to NATO missions, stating : I wanted to say that, because of current events, I have witnessed this myself, that a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union. And I am very happy that we are today unified in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. … Germany also does a lot for NATO. We are the second largest donor of troops, we put most of our military abilities into the service of NATO and we are strongly committed in Afghanistan, where we also defend the interests of the United States of America. Because the deployment in Afghanistan has to do with the only example of Article 5.” AP Other leaders, including Trump’s ‘sometimes buddy’ Emanuel Macron, dismissed the claim during a question and answer period with the press. Ex-Secretary of State John Kerry, a harsh critic of Trump’s foreign policy, lashed out in a formal press release over the statement, calling it strange and counterproductive: But poor and damaging message delivery aside, the majority of the 29 countries that make up NATO need to step monetarily, and tighter coordination when it comes to procuring collective capabilities to make NATO as a single fighting unit more efficient and effective needs to occur. Just dumping money into a defense category isn’t enough. In fact, in Germany’s case, the UK laughably suggested that they just invest in infrastructure, such as railways and roads, that could be used during a war, and call it military spending. This is a dim idea, especially when you considering Germany’s already famously mature transportation infrastructure and their decaying combat capabilities. AP Regardless of NATO’s fiscal demands, Germany should be far more concerned with the state of their military and its atrocious readiness rates. This is about hardware and sustainment dollars to support that hardware, as well as training, not about investing in dual-use infrastructure. But there are ways of pushing Germany in the right direction, and using the alliance itself is the best mechanism for doing that, not shaming Germany on television and driving a metal spike through the heart of the world’s most successful international military alliance. With trade becoming a much more tumultuous issue, Brexit ongoing, major political changes occurring in numerous European states , and one key NATO member’s allegiance to the pact increasingly in question , a fractured relationship between the U.S. and one of NATO’s most powerful members is the best gift the Kremlin could receive. It’s especially so just before the highly controversial summit between Putin with Trump slated for July 16th in Helsinki. So yeah, the issue could have been handled differently to say the least.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 30, 2019",Houthi Rebels In Yemen Have Technical Trucks Armed With Vulcan Cannons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Technicals, a term typically applied to commercial pickup trucks or similar light wheeled vehicles with improvised weapon mounts, are common among both state security forces and non-state actors, especially in the Middle East . But few are as heavily armed as a type that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen are employing, which packs a 20mm Vulcan cannon and looks like something one might expect to see in a new Mad Max movie . Earlier in July 2018, images emerged on one of these vehicles, which appears to be based a heavily stripped down Toyota Hilux 4×4 pickup , engaged in operations against the elements of the Saudi Arabian-led coalition in the country or local forces they support in Lahij Governorate, which sits near the Gulf of Aden . In June 2018, forces from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemeni militia had launched a new offensive against the Houthis in the heavily contested port city of Hodeidah further to the north, which led to an increase in fighting in surrounding areas. It’s not clear how many of these Vulcan-armed technicals the Houthis actually have. The group released a video in January 2017 that showed one in action in Taiz, north of Lahij Governorate. Additional imagery and video appear to show at least two different Toyota Hiluxes carrying the guns, but the rebels could have moved the weapon from one to another after the initial vehicle broke down or got destroyed. Houthi forces had captured examples of the towed Vulcan Air Defense Systems , also known as the M167, as early as 2015, though. Earlier pictures and clips show rebels with the guns mounted on U.S.-made M54-series five-ton truck and a Soviet-era BTR-152 wheeled armored personnel carrier. The original source of the weapons is also unclear, though they almost certainly came by way of former Yemeni military stocks or members of the Saudi coalition. Saudi Arabia and Sudan, the latter being a member of the multi-national bloc, both operate the M167. Sudanese forces have reportedly employed the weapon on the BTR-152 , as well. Wherever the Houthis obtained the M167s in the first place, the weapons could be a valuable addition to the group’s already extensive arsenal of purpose-built and improvised anti-aircraft weapons . While they have limited utility against fast- and high-flying combat jets , the guns could still be a realistic threat to lower- and slower-moving helicopters and drones . A South Korean M167, showing the weapon system’s original configuration., DOD But the rebels appear to be employing the system primarily against ground targets, where it can be especially deadly, particularly against lightly armored vehicles, unfortified structures, and troops out in the open. The M167 has a dedicated ground firing mode that disables any cueing from the system’s radar and selectable rates of fire between 1,000 to 6,000 rounds per minute, through 3,000-round-per-minute is the typical setting. The United States originally developed the M167, and the self-propelled M113-based M163 , as short-range anti-aircraft weapons. In the 1980s, it even considered adopting a wheeled version called Excalibur . Still, the U.S. military was quick to realize its value of the system in a ground support role itself.  A 1970s U.S. Army comic-book style training manual, titled “The Fastest Gun in the West” and which has a particularly dated “Cowboys and Indians” theme, shows that American troops even trained to use their Vulcans to indirectly engage targets behind cover with the help of spotters further down range. A page from “The Fastest Gun in The West” describing indirect fire operations with the M163 self-propelled system., US Army Though certainly fearsome, it’s not entirely clear how much use the Houthis have or will necessarily be able to get out of these weapons. The units using them have to contend with keeping up an adequate supply of 20mm shells, an especially important consideration give the gun’s rates of fire, as well as simply keeping the guns and their mounts working at all. The ammunition issue might not necessarily be an immediate concern depending on how many rounds the Houthis were able to capture along with the guns to begin with. The 20x102mm cartridge is apparently common enough that the group has also developed its own anti-materiel rifle, the Hasem , in this caliber. It is also possible that they are receiving additional ammunition from Iran. While the Iranians never operated the Vulcan Air Defense System, they do still have the six-barrel guns installed on a number of America-made F-4E and F-14A fighter jets , as well as the three-barrel M197 derivative on their AH-1J International Cobra gunship helicopters. They’re also making anti-materiel rifles of their own, the Arash, seen in the video below, in this caliber. https://youtube.com/watch?v=FP1P-1FLZ9s As a result, the country produces its own 20x102mm ammunition. The Iranians have already delivered a host of other weapon systems, including “suicide” unmanned aircraft and boats and ballistic missile technology , to the Houthis. The rebels have also proven themselves more than adept at performing not insignificant levels of maintenance and other work on a host of vehicles and other weapon systems , too. That the Vulcan-equipped technicals remain in service after more than a year and the guns themselves are still operational after nearly three years would seem to indicate that they are relatively simple enough for Houthi workshops to keep them in service. The radar-assisted fire control system, probably one of the more complex components of the system, does appear to have disappeared in part or in full from the group’s Vulcans, though. And there’s no getting around how vulnerable the unarmored Hilux chassis is to mines or roadside bombs or during any sort of protracted direct confrontation with the Saudis, their allies, or Yemeni forces they’re backing. With the grueling conflict looking set to drag on for the foreseeable future, it seems likely that the Houthis will continue using the Vulcan-armed trucks alongside more commonly seen technicals armed with heavy machine guns, light automatic cannons, and heavier guns and rocket launchers. As time goes on, it will be interesting to see the group’s technicians make any more significant modifications to the system or mount the guns on larger, better-protected vehicles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 13, 2018",The U.S. Air Force Is Hiding Its Controversial Flyoff Between the A-10 and F-35,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has, without any apparent public announcement, begun a much-awaited comparative evaluation of the close air support capabilities of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter versus the venerable A-10 Warthog . The event was already controversial before it even began and there is now evidence to suggest the service maybe be manipulating the test parameters to favor the stealthy fifth-generation fighter jet. The Straus Military Reform Project at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) was the first to reveal the tests have already started, according to a copy of the schedule that it got a chance to review. The evaluation began on July 5, 2018, and will last just one week, ending on July 12, 2018. Only four of those days involve actual flying. The Air Force had previously said the event would occur sometime in 2018, but did not offer a fixed timeline . “They are staging an unpublicized, quickie test on existing training ranges, creating unrealistic scenarios that presuppose an ignorant and inert enemy force, writing ground rules for the tests that make the F-35 look good,” Dan Grazier, the Jack Shanahan Military Fellow at POGO, wrote on the organization’s blog and his analysis is worth reading in full. “And they got the new testing director, the retired Air Force general Robert Behler, to approve all of it.” A US Air Force F-35A drops a 500-pound class Paveway laser-guided bomb with an inert warhead during a test., USAF According to POGO, here is how the first day of testing, which occurred at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona, was supposed to go: “The first day’s test—July 5, at Yuma—scheduled one F-35 two-ship flight and two A-10 pairs. Each flight was to spend one hour making attack passes at highly visible, bombed-out vehicle hulks and shipping containers simulating buildings (plus one highly visible, remote-controlled moving-vehicle target), all in flat, open terrain near a large simulated airfield target. Each A-10 carried two laser-guided 500-pound bombs , two captive-carry Maverick guided missiles , a pod of marking rockets, and only 400 30 mm cannon rounds . The F-35s carried a single 500-pound laser-guided bomb and 181 25 mm rounds , the most each plane could carry. For the last 20 minutes of each one-hour target-range session, altitude was restricted to 10,000 feet, an alleged evaluation of each plane’s ability to operate beneath low cloud cover. “The first day’s attack scenarios called for ‘permissive’ anti-aircraft defenses consisting of simulated shoulder-fired missiles and light anti-aircraft guns . A permissive environment is one in which there are few or no threats capable of shooting down an aircraft. Despite the “permissive” description, these are the anti-aircraft weapons that close air support planes will typically encounter while supporting our troops in battle against near-peer maneuvering enemy forces. However, the simulated defenses at Yuma had no precision instrumentation to track aircraft flight paths, gun aiming, or missile launch and homing. As a result, no quantitative data regarding the actual performance of the A-10 and F-35 will have been gathered. Rather than having charts of performance data, the evaluators will simply be able to report any results they want, without any way to verify the reports.” An especially weathered A-10 rolls away after detaching from an aerial refueling tanker during a mission over Iraq or Syria against ISIS terrorists. , USAF And here is a description of the remaining three testing days at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California: “The day two schedule—July 9 at China Lake—calls for four F-35Bs to conduct a mission covering two Ospreys extracting a pilot downed in enemy territory for one hour, then four A-10s covering a similar extraction. A similar set of missions under night conditions is scheduled for the late evening of day three. “On the afternoon of day three, A-10 and F-35 pairs are to spend an hour and a quarter on the China Lake target range attacking static, visible targets similar to the Yuma targets—but these are even less realistic, as they are just simulated attacks, with no weapons released. The stated reason for moving to China Lake, despite the restrictions on actually firing weapons, is to test the A-10 and F-35 against the range’s “elevated” anti-aircraft defenses, which include simulated medium-range surface-to-air missiles , as well as shoulder-fired short-range missiles and light anti-aircraft guns. “On the afternoon of the final day, a pair of A-10s and a pair of F-35s will undergo tests to gauge their ability as airborne forward air controllers, directing the strikes of at least three sections of F-18Cs , which will simulate the bombing of more uncamouflaged targets, against the same medium- and short-range air defenses. In the late evening, a pair of F-35s and a pair of A-10s will conduct night close air support against the same targets and defenses.” In his own analysis, Grazier noted that these test parameters give no weight to the A-10’s substantially greater endurance over the F-35, loiter time that can be essential during a close air support mission backing up troops in the middle of a battle that might last hours or even days. There is similarly no attempt to evaluate respective sortie rates , which is an important consideration “because combat doesn’t pause to wait for airplanes to become available,” as the Jack Shanahan Military Fellow wrote. In addition, setting a 10,000-foot operational ceiling during the Yuma test day was particularly generous to the F-35, given that low cloud cover can often force aircraft to fly below 1,000 feet, an environment where the A-10 excels . There is also apparently no specific mention of highly specialized equipment to precisely gauge the accuracy of various simulated anti-aircraft threats, which Grazier warns could lead to subjective bias creeping into the post-evaluation analysis of the outcomes of all four days of evaluations. https://youtube.com/watch?v=cHpmmgrMmEQ And for unexplained reasons, neither the A-10s nor the F-35s were carrying either of their respective maximum weapon load outs in any of the events. The decision to only load the magazines for the Warthog’s massive GAU-8/A Avenger cannon with less than half of the maximum number of 30mm cannon shells they can carry seems especially arbitrary. There were also possible limits the ability of the F-35 to perform since there is no apparent comparative evaluation within the comparative evaluation that takes into account the jet in its full-stealth configuration versus the aircraft with its external weapons pylons installed . One clear possibility, which the POGO analysis notes, is that the Air Force made its decision to only load up the Joint Strike Fighters with just one 500-pound class bomb internally in order to lighten them and improve their maneuverability. Otherwise, it would seem that the service had put the stealthy fighters at a distinct and equally artificial disadvantage when it comes to engaging multiple targets for no reason. That being said, we also don’t know what the objective number of targets each type of aircraft had to hit was, or how else the evaluators assessed how well the planes “destroyed” their mock opponents, which could make this a moot point. A US Air Force F-35A conducts a test with inert bombs on pylons under its wings., Lockheed Martin The test targets at Yuma themselves were another concerning element of the evaluation. There is no indication that the evaluators arranged the static and mobile vehicle type targets , or the stacked shipping containers standing in for structures, in such a way as to reflect a realistic close air support scenario. Yuma’s bombing range is relatively flat and open, which would make the mock threats easy to spot, as well. This would all seem to be intended to help the F-35 pilots who would have to rely heavily on the aircraft’s increasingly dated Electro-Optical Targeting System , which is based on technology that is now more than a decade old, to spot targets. Though the Joint Strike Fighter has the ability to fuse additional information from other sensors, such as the AN/APG-81 radar and AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System , as well as information from other aircraft , this is unlikely to be of much benefit in a close air support situation. Depending on how the test parameters take into account mock anti-aircraft defenses, this might give the F-35 an advantage by helping the jets to avoid those threats, though. The F-35 also lacks the ability to engage moving targets when it’s not carrying one specific type of precision-guided bomb, an issue you can read about in more detail here , and doesn’t have an an infrared pointer to help confirm targets with personnel on the ground. These are important tools in any close air support situation. In contrast, A-10s can carry more recent iterations of Lockheed Martin’s Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod and Northrop Grumman’s LITENING targeting pod . It also has the onboard moving target and infrared pointer capabilities that the F-35 lacks. And if, after all this, one feels that there is still something glaringly missing, you’re not wrong. According to POGO, it’s entirely unclear how, where, and when Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTAC), specially trained personnel on the ground who coordinate close air support and other air strikes, fit into the tests or if they do at all. The F-35’s ability to engage with JTACs is an essential consideration, especially given that the aircraft still lacks Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver ( ROVER ) or any similar capability . This system allows equipped aircraft to beam the video feeds from their sensors straight to personnel on the ground in near real time, allowing both parties to better and more rapidly identify and confirm targets. Without this system, or another set of equipment that offers an equivalent capability, Joint Strike Fighter pilots could find it much more difficult to quickly separate enemy forces from friendly troops and innocent civilians when it matters most. We don’t have to speculate about how bad things can get, either. In October 2015, a U.S. Air Force AC-130U made a horrific mistake and blew apart a hospital that the non-governmental organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders, was operating in Kunduz, Afghanistan. In its investigation, the U.S. military found that the gunship’s ROVER system, along with other data links, were malfunctioning , forcing the aircraft to try and locate its target using only verbal descriptions over the radio from JTACs blocks away from the actual fighting. According to POGO, none of this is particularly surprising. The sources that shared the information, who asked to remain anonymous out of a very real fear of retaliation from senior Air Force leadership, said the service had crafted the test plan without talking to a single member of the A-10 or JTAC communities or the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron, which provides Warthogs and Joint Strike Fighters, among other types, for test purposes. Army and Marine Corps personnel were also conspicuously absent from the discussions. Tactical Air Support Inc. , also known simply as TacAir, a private contractor that provides air-to-air and air-to-ground training support to the Air Force, led the development of the evaluation program. It’s worth noting that the Air Force has gone on the record to voice its opposition to this evaluation in the first place on more than one occasion. “I think that would be a silly exercise,” then-U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh notably said of the proposed fly off in 2015. A-10s assigned to the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron., USAF Welsh eventually got reminded that J. Michael Gilmore, then the Pentagon’s Director of Operational Test & Evaluation, had included the comparative testing in the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation plan for the F-35 regardless of his opinions on the matter. Then, in 2016, Congress added a clause into a defense spending bill mandating that the tests occur . To be fair, Welsh wasn’t entirely wrong. Pitting the F-35 against the A-10 is comparing apples and oranges and the outcome can only stir up controversy. The flyoff is unlikely to uncover anything the Air Force and independent experts don’t already know, chiefly that the two aircraft both have very real places in the Air Force’s force structure. At the same time, the Air Force deliberately put itself in this situation by insisting that the F-35 would be a suitable direct replacement for the A-10. This is to say nothing of the Air Force’s repeated attempts to retire some or all of the Warthog fleet, or otherwise cripple their capabilities to force that decision , in spite of an almost equal number of Congressional stipulations that specifically bar it from doing so. The service went so far as to suppress an official short documentary film about the Warthog’s contributions to the U.S. campaign against the Taliban and other insurgents and terrorists in Afghanistan. You can finally watch the video in its final form below thanks only to a Freedom of Information Act request. That decision came after now-retired Air Force Major General James Post caused a massive public outcry by telling his subordinates that it was tantamount to treason to contact legislators and voice support for the A-10s. Shortly after that, the Air Force released a highly manipulated data set to exclusively to USA Today in an attempt to falsely present the Warthogs as a liability to troops on the ground, another example of the service actively doctoring information to discredit the popular aircraft. “The Congressionally approved plan includes a schedule for tests and funding for elaborate tactical test ranges with combat-realistic, hard-to-find targets defended by carefully simulated missile and gun defenses, and appropriate ground-control teams for the close-support portion of the test scenarios,” POGO’s Grazier wrote. “Rather than telling us whether or not the F-35 can actually provide the kind of close support our ground forces need to survive and prevail, this grossly inadequate test has been designed to mislead.” With all this in mind, it will be especially interesting to see how the Air Force responds to these revelations and what information it decides to provide to the public now that the fly off has become public knowledge whether they like it or not.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 1, 2018",Russia Executes Mock Special Operations Raid On Remote Island Off Finland,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the solidarity of NATO is tested due to rising tensions between some of its member states and the Trump administration, and just days before a highly anticipated, and in some cases highly maligned, meeting between Trump and Putin in Finland, Russia has executed a mock raid on a strategic island it controls in the Baltic Sea. Gogland Island sits smack-dab in the center of Gulf of Finland, which is bordered by Russia to the east, Finland to the north, and Estonia to the south. The eight square mile island is considered a ‘border area’ by Moscow and foreigners can only travel there with special permits. It has long been a military stronghold and is dotted with abandoned military infrastructure from the Cold War. The island is known for its rugged and varied terrain, but these days, besides a communications tower, some lighthouses, a shipwreck, and a small fishing village, there isn’t much there. Its standing population is measured in the dozens of people at any given time, although all this could change during a conflict. Google Maps When it comes to the region surrounding the island, suffice it to say that it has become a major hotspot in the last four years following Russia’s seizure of Crimea and a far more aggressive foreign policy in general. Since then, the Baltic Sea has seen everything from a nuclear ballistic submarine wade through its waters to near constant large-scale military exercises. Just recently, BALTOPS , one of region’s largest combined arms drills, wrapped up—a NATO and U.S.-centric training event, like many others, that Russia generally despises. But Russia also executes its own drills and makes its presence abundantly clear to U.S. and allied aircraft and ships operating in the region. Its exercises include lightning-fast large-scale military buildups along its western borders and electronic warfare tactics that can blot out GPS and even attacks on individual phones of NATO soldiers. Mock attacks by Russian aircraft on critical monitoring outposts have also become common. But yesterday’s unprecedented display of Russian special operations capabilities was uniquely ominous as it is likely how a war would begin in the region—with commandos infiltrating the edges of its neighbor’s territories and blowing up or otherwise disabling key early warning stations, communications relays, and other critical infrastructure ahead of a larger military push. This is often referred to as ‘poking out the eyes of the enemy.’ And that is precisely what Russian commandoes simulated during the operation. A Western Military District press release states : Servicemen of the Special Military Unit of the Western Military District for the first time parachuted from an altitude of 2500 meters to an unprepared site on the island of Gogland in the Gulf of Finland. The difficulty of landing on the coast of the island was the unpreparedness of the site and the choppy wind that is characteristic of all the islands of the Gulf of Finland. The special forces left the side of the helicopter Mi-8AMTSH at an altitude of 2,5 thousand meters in 3 kilometers from the island. With a drop to enter the landing site, the paratroopers used satellite navigation equipment. After landing, the scouts disguised the parachutes and advanced into the interior of the island. Having completed the tasks of deblocking and destroying the objects in the form of targets and targets determined by the training task, the reconnaissance group searched and equipped the landing site for the helicopter. Despite the existence of an operational helipad on the island, the training plan provided for the evacuation of the reconnaissance group from an unequipped area. Over the shoulders of each scout who took part in the event on combat training, not less than a hundred jumps with parachutes of various types. Airborne infiltration and helicopter extraction is one way to get in and out after a raid on an island like Gogland, but the use of midget submarines that can operate in the littoral maelstrom that dominates the edges of the Baltic Sea offer a much more covert and survivable means of special operations transportation. https://youtube.com/watch?v=5XDb1ctc_ac This is no secret to many living in the region as massive sub hunts reminiscent of the Cold War have become major headline grabbers, even internationally. Concern over infiltration of Russian operatives, not just some initial military operation that is a prelude to a shooting war, is a real concern among Russian’s neighbors that have borders on the Baltic Sea. Russian frogman packing an APS underwater rifle. , Russia MoD The NATO summit will run through the 12th of July and President Trump’s meeting with Putin in Helsinki, just 60 miles from Gogland Island, is slated for July 16th.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a new blow to the German military , the country’s Navy has admitted that nearly half of its replenishment-at-sea capable tankers are out of commission. These types of ships are essential for independent, sustained naval operations far from Germany’s own bases and could also have an impact on NATO allies who might rely on the Germans to help support combined surface task forces during a potential crisis in and around Europe or beyond. On July 9, 2018, Jane’s 360 reported that German Navy Chief Vice Admiral Andreas Krause had acknowledged that both of the German Navy’s Rhön -class tankers , also known as the Type 704A, were pier side and in need for heavy maintenance. There is no clear schedule for when the ships will be ready for duty again. The service also has three Berlin -class , or Type 702, combat support ships that can refuel other large surface vessels at sea, but which also have multi-purpose capabilities. “We cannot make up for the unavailability of the tankers,” Krause said, according to Jane’s 360. “The navy has become too small.” The state of the Rhön , and her sister ship Spessart , comes more than six months after the German Navy was forced to admit that none of its six Type 212 submarines were operational . U-36 was supposed to return to service in May 2018, but it is unclear if the boat’s maintenance period remained on schedule. U-31 is also slated to be back on active duty sometime in 2018. The German Navy’s Rhön -class tanker Spessart ., USN At the same time, the service is still struggling to move ahead with its troubled Type 125 Baden-Wurttemberg -class frigate program after making the unprecedented decision to reject the lead example and send it back to the shipbuilder, Blohm+Voss, in December 2017.  You can read more about this curious and convoluted project in detail here . According to Jane’s 360, the German Navy is now planning to conduct a major overhaul of Spessart ’s single marine diesel engine to determine the source of that ship’s persistent engine problems. The exact reason why Rhön is not operational is unclear, reportedly being related to unspecified “wear and tear.” The two vessels are increasingly dated, having been in German service since 1977. Kröger Yard, now part of the shipbuilding firm Lürssen , had previously built the ships, which have a displacement of just over 14,000 tons, as commercial bulk acid carriers, according to Combat Fleets of the World . What was then the West German Navy subsequently bought them second-hand from a shipping company based in the West African country of Liberia and converted them into tankers, but they remain unarmed. Since then, both ships have been an important part of Germany’s naval capabilities, though. Following the end of the Cold War, the Rhön -class vessels have made routine deployments as part of both NATO and European Union naval task forces. Most notably, they have supported counter-terrorism and counter-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden on more than one occasion. Spessart prepares to replenish the U.S. Navy’s Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Vicksburg during a NATO exercise in 2015., USN In March 2009, Spessart came under attack by pirates, who apparently mistook the ship for a commercial tanker as it was sailing near Somalia as part of the European Union’s Operation Atalanta . The on board security detail was able to repel the assault with their small arms. The other ships in the task force, as well as the U.S. Navy’s amphibious assault ship USS Boxer , subsequently chased the fleeing skiff and detained the attackers . As regular members of the Standing NATO Maritime Groups , which are on call in case of a contingency, the ships also make routine appearances at the alliances exercise around Europe. Vice Admiral Krause noted that Spessart was due to join Standing NATO Maritime Group One , but that under the present circumstances, Germany would not be able to honor its obligations. The German Navy cannot send one of the Berlin -class ships, either, since they are all presently committed to the European Union’s Operation Sophia , or preparing to deploy in support of that mission, which is focused on interdicting human trafficking in the Mediterranean Sea. These larger and more powerful vessels, which have a displacement of around 20,000 tons, are well suited to this task given their ability to provide support to other ships in their assigned task forces, as well as shelter any migrants and refugees in need of rescue. Each one can accommodate a modular hospital that includes 45 beds and a four-patient intensive care unit, along with laboratory and other supporting facilities. “This is another example of how urgent the modernization and financing of the navy is,” Krause said. Earlier in 2018, the Germany Navy reportedly announced plans to have the Rhön -class replaced with new, unspecified ships by 2025. These could be additional Berlin -class ships, as the Germans had initially planned to build as many as six of those types before trimming back the order. The German Navy’s combat support ship Berlin ., Ein Dahmer via Wikimedia The Germans won’t be able to wait much longer to begin the process of getting replacements for the Rhön -class ships if they hope to keep to this schedule. It took nearly three years for shipbuilder Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft to deliver Bonn , the third of Germany’s Berlin -class ships, a design it already has experience with. At that point, it hadn’t built one of these ships in nearly a decade. Already five years on from Bonn ’s commissioning, any loss of experience and production capacity could easily slow down the process for building more of these ships. It is possible that German officials could look to speed up the process by acquiring another already in production military design or by choosing to convert another commercial type. Until those ships arrive, though, the German Navy will have to make due, or not as the case may be, with Rhön and Spessart . If the service cannot figure out a way to get them back on duty soon and improve their availability rates in general, it could find itself severely limited in its ability to conduct any significant long-range naval operations. As noted, this could have a cascading impact on multi-national NATO and European Union missions that rely on German support. Spessart sails in the middle of an unknown U.S. Navy ship and the Italian Maestrale -class frigate Aliseo , while refueling both ships during a NATO exercise . , USN “Our operational area in the Somali Basin may be compared in size to the United States, distances to cover are significant,” Then-Rear-Admiral Philippe Coindreau, a French officer then in charge of European Union Naval Forces off Somalia, said in 2010 after visiting Spessart . “Tankers are therefore [a] valuable asset, enabling warships to last longer at sea.” If Germany cannot take part in these types of naval missions in the near term, it could also reduce the country’s standing in international blocs and reduce the likelihood that other countries will see it as a viable partner when planning future operations. Germany, along with other NATO allies, has already come under especially harsh criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump and his administration have repeatedly decried small defense budgets and limited military capabilities in a number of the alliances member states. In response, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has more than once raised the prospect of Western European nations no longer being able to rely on the United States. She has already been pushing for increased spending on Germany’s military as a whole since 2014. “It’s no longer the case that the United States will simply just protect us,” Merkel said in a May 2018 speech . “Rather, Europe needs to take its fate into its own hands. That’s the task for the future.” Spessart sailing in the Adriatic Sea in 2015., USN Those plans could find themselves further delayed due to an ongoing political crisis in Germany that could slow down any efforts to put those policy prescriptions into action. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, along with her allies in the Christian Social Union (CSU), had such a poor showing in Germany’s September 2017 federal elections that the country went six months without a formal government in place. “The turnaround for the better has begun,” Hans-Peter Bartels, who is the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces in Germany, had said in December 2017 . “The basic decisions have been made, but it will take years again for that to happen.” Unfortunately, after more than four decades of service, the Rhön -class ships are clearly close to the end of their useful service life, if they haven’t passed that date already. Germany will have to move quickly to avoid ending up with a pronounced and potentially lengthy gap in having enough ships to adequately perform this vital mission.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 15, 2019",U.S. Secretary of State Rides in Gun-Toting “Embassy Air” Helicopter In Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has made his first visit to Afghanistan since officially becoming America’s top diplomat. Underscoring the still dangerous state of security in the country’s capital despite 17 years of U.S.-backed efforts to try and improve the situation, he did what any other State Department staffer would do upon arriving in the country, he took a very quick ride in an armed CH-46 helicopter to avoid having to drive the two miles from Kabul’s airport to the U.S. Embassy. Pompeo’s arrival on July 9, 2018, was itself unannounced, another common security procedure in a country where Taliban militants and other terrorists can and do still have the ability to bombard Hamid Karzai International Airport. According to a report by CBS News’ “60 Minutes” in January 2018, U.S. diplomatic and other civilian government personnel remain banned from using any form of ground transportation, even armored vehicles , to get safely within the blast walls and other defenses that surround the American Embassy proper. “The strategy sends a clear message to the Taliban that they cannot wait us out,” Pompeo said during a shared press conference with Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani. Armored vehicles did take the Secretary of State from the Embassy to the Presidential Palace, a trip that is only about a mile long. At the same time, the helicopter rides to and from the Embassy make it equally clear that those insurgents and other hostile actors aren’t likely to abandon their cause any time soon. The service, which State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs’ Office of Aviation, better known as the State Department Air Wing, provides, has become so formalized it is literally called Embassy Air. It operates like a real airline with scheduled departures and arrivals that run five to six days a week, carrying as many as 150 people to and from the Embassy and other locations in the country every day. In the 2017 Fiscal Year, the CH-46 helicopters, which private military company DynCorp operates and maintains, flew a total of 32,000 scheduled flights, as well as 3,500 “special missions,” which would include activities such as moving the Secretary of State around during his visits, according to an official Department of State’s Office of the Inspector General review. You can read more about Embassy Air Program in Afghanistan, as well as in Iraq, here . State’s Air Wing also operates a number of other fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters in Afghanistan to support various Department of State missions, including counter-drug efforts . The helicopters often carry mounted weapons, as was the case during Pompeo’s trip from the airport. An apparently unarmed Embassy Air CH-46., US Army It’s not clear, however, whether the machine guns are an indication of a new and especially high state of security within Kabul’s central heavily fortified “Green Zone” or if contractors only install them for certain missions. In “60 Minutes” in January 2018, one can see smaller Bell Huey II helicopters in the background and it was not clear whether they were flying escort missions. All of the CH-46s, which formerly served with the U.S. Marine Corps , have mounts for one 7.62mm M240D machine gun in windows on either side of the main cabin. All of the helicopters also have missile warning sensors and dispensers to fire flares to throw off heat-seeking man-portable shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. The video below shows DynCorp contractors firing the mounted M240D machine guns on an Embassy Air CH-46 in 2015. Armed or not, the flights aren’t cheap, either. At present, each one-way trip costs the U.S. government $1,350. In the 2019 Fiscal Year, this “ticket” price is set to rise to $2,250, according to a report by Bloomberg . In May 2018, John Sopko, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a U.S. government watchdog, pointed out that this would make the two-mile journey more expensive than flying round-trip in economy class on Emirates to and from Dulles Airport outside of Washington, D.C. to Kabul. To be fair, avoiding the ground route, no matter how short, also limits the chances that innocent bystanders could get killed in an attack on an American convoy. Reports indicate that this may actually be just as big an issue as any risk to U.S. government personnel. Roadside bombs and suicide attacks on Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored trucks, in particular, are more likely to seriously injure anyone unfortunate enough to be standing nearby, or even some distance away depending on the size of the blast, than the occupants themselves. Though the Taliban and other militants would be at fault, the U.S. government still apparently tries to reduce civilian casualties by flying over many dangerous areas instead. Of course, the idea that there is such a significant risk of attacks at all in the heavily defended airport and Green Zone which contains Afghanistan’s Presidential Palace, the U.S. Embassy, other foreign embassies, and a smattering of other important offices, still says a lot about the overall security situation in the country. Embassy Air is hardly the only example, either. In December 2017, the U.S. military announced that it would be assisting in the formation of an all-new Green Zone Police in Kabul due to the apparent inability of the existing uniformed police to maintain law and order. The contract documents regarding the hiring of private firms to help with training this force belie how precarious the situation is in spite of the better part of two decades that the United States and its allies have spent helping to try and rebuild the country. “Anarchistic groups who desire to derail Afghanistan’s current rebuilding, stabilizing, progressive efforts often target Kabul for violent and sensational attacks,” one document stated. “The President Afghanistan (POA) [Ghani] in concert with his senior security advisors, has determined the current physical security structure within Kabul to be insufficient to meet the requisite security threshold.” According to the documentation, the Green Zone Police will be similar in size to the Atlanta, Georgia Police Department , but will be primarily responsible for security over an area covering less than two square miles. This appears to be part of a larger plan to dramatically expand the Green Zone’s boundaries that began in 2017, which could potentially eliminate the need for the costly helicopter rides, but will require the additional police presence on the ground. Risks also extend to U.S. personnel throughout Afghanistan, even in areas nominally under government control. On July 7, 2018, an Afghan security forces member, or an individual posing as one, murdered a soldier from the U.S. Army’s 3rd Infantry Division, who was helping provide security for the service’s new 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade in Afghanistan, in an apparent insider attack . This came around a week after a positive and unprecedented ceasefire between the Taliban and the government in Kabul, which led to Taliban fighters openly cavorting with civilians in the streets of populated centers , came to an end on June 30, 2018. Both sides, as well as the NATO-led coalition supporting Afghanistan’s government, have now gone back to open fighting. It is the “Taliban’s turn to give a positive response,” President Ghani said in a public statement ordering his troops to resume operations. “I am ready to extend the ceasefire anytime when the Taliban are ready.” Until there is a major and lasting improvement to the security situation throughout the country, though, U.S. military and other government personnel will continue to have to use services such as Embassy Air to best protect themselves from insurgent and terrorist attacks.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 20, 2018",Wondering About Those Wedge-Shaped Fighter Jets Over Tucson? Here’s Your Answer!,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have received a bunch of messages over the last 72 hours from people living in Tucson, Arizona who were trying to figure out the origin of the unfamiliar charcoal and white jets that have been roaring their way around the skies over Davis Monthan AFB. Their delta-wing shape clearly sparked the interest of local residents even though the community is well acquainted with tactical aircraft roaming around their airspace. The answer to this little mystery is that these aircraft are Israeli-built Kfir C10 fighters belonging to the Colombian Air Force. So why is the Colombian Air Force operating in Arizona? They are there to prepare for Red Flag , the USAF’s premier large-scale air combat exercise that takes place roughly three times a year over southern Nevada . In order to get the most out of this highly complex and challenging flying, foreign air arms often bed down at one of the USAF’s master air bases that has very convenient access to expansive training ranges so that they can sharpen their skills before the curtain lifts on the ‘big show’ at Nellis AFB in Las Vegas. These work-ups can also include pilots getting accustomed to new upgrades on their aircraft that will be put to the test during the big international exercise. A Colombian Air Force Kfir C.10 taxis on the apron at Davis Monthan AFB after arriving on July 5th. , USAF Colombian Air Force personnel arrive at Davis Monthan AFB on July 5th aboard a KC-767 Taner Transport. Like the Kfirs, the KC-767 is also an Israeli product and is converted from a second-hand 767 airframe. , USAF Colombia has also sent Super Tucano light attack planes to Davis Monthan AFB in the past to take part in large close air support exercises. But those drills don’t compare in scale to what Kfir pilots will face during the upcoming Red Flag. This isn’t the Colombian Air Force’s first time at Red Flag, they brought a half dozen Kfirs and a KC-767 tanker-transport to the exercise in 2012, which drew a lot of attention from military aviation aficionados and photographers. The Kfir (‘Lion Cub’) is an incredibly interesting aircraft as it is basically a knock-off of the 1960s vintage Mirage III/V with a few alterations. The biggest of which is its General Electric J79 turbojet engine—the same powerful type that powered the F-4 Phantom—that took the place of the French SNECMA Atar turbojet. Israel once had a force of Kfirs on hand in its own arsenal and the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps even flew a handful of earlier models loaned by Israel as part of the dissimilar adversary training program back in the 1980s . Most famously, the Kfir starred as the bad guys’ jets in the awesomely campy ’80s air combat action flick Iron Eagle. VMFAT-401 Kfirs in formation circa 1988., USN Kfirs left the IAF’s front-line inventory by late 1990s, but Israeli’s potent defense and aerospace industry saw it as a relatively simple, cost-effective, yet high-performance platform that could provide 4th generation fighter-like capabilities at a fraction of the cost. As such, the Kfir was outfitted with a modern pulse-doppler radar set, new cockpit displays and pilot interfaces, the ability to carry smarter weapons and electronic warfare pods, among other enhancements, and exported to a number of countries. One of which was Colombia. In fact, Colombia was a Kfir operator before the type was drastically upgraded, having acquired examples in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but those were basically daytime intermediate-weight fighters until the upgrade process began. So Colombia has been operating the Kfir for nearly 30 years in one form or another. Kfir C.10 on the ramp at Nellis in 2012. Note the notoriously capable ELTA EL/L-8222 Jamming Pod on the wing-root station. Colombia has 21 Kfirs in its inventory. , USAF Today’s C.10 C60 standard Kfir is a far cry from where the jet began. They are multi-role fighters with beyond-visual-range capability via the Derby missile—also supplied by Israel—and capable of aerial refueling and operations in almost all atmospheric conditions. They feature a modern cockpit, helmet mounted display, digital radar warning receiver, and an open-architecture avionics suite similar to that of a Block 50 F-16. They can employ LITENING targeting pods and precision-guided munitions. At the heart of the upgrade is the highly adaptable Elta Systems EL/M-2032 radar which supposedly now features an AESA antenna. Clearly, the Colombians are excited to bring the new capabilities this latest upgrade provides to the international air combat stage that is Red Flag. Although they may not feature the raw performance or payload of their more complex 4th generation counterparts, they are still nimble, and in an era where the sensors a fighter carries have become more important than the kinematic performance of the platform they are attached to, Columbia’s Kfirs offer big capability on a modest budget. It’s also worth noting that about a half a dozen Kfirs, often referred by its DoD ‘F-21’ designation, have been flying in the states for nearly two decades as part of the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company’s (ATAC) commercial adversary support aircraft fleet. In fact, they have been the highest-performance private aggressors in continuous service, but that is about to change, which you can read all about here. ATAC F-21/C2 Kfirs on the ramp at Point Mugu along with their Hawker Hunter stablemates. , Tyler Rogoway/Author ATAC’s jets are not anywhere near as advanced as Colombia’s and lack a radar of any type. But what can be seen as another variant of the Kfir, the Atlas Cheetah, which was built for the South African Air Force with the help of Israeli defense contractors, are more advanced and include radars. A dozen of those jets are now destined for ATAC’s competitor, Draken International and will be upgraded before entering into service. So the Kfir family of jets will become a more familiar sight over the U.S. soon. As for when the Colombian Kfirs will move from Davis Monthan AFB to Nellis AFB for Red Flag, that should occur in about ten days or so as the exercise is slated to kick-off on July 23rd and will run through August 8th. In the meantime, the citizens of Tucson can look up and enjoy the “Lion Cub’s” roar.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel has reportedly denied that it hosted a delegation from the United Arab Emirates to discuss issues related to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . Reports of the meeting had been another indication of steadily improving ties between the two countries and the UAE’s continued interest in buying the stealthy jets. On July 8, 2018, The Jerusalem Post reported that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had denied the gathering with Emiratis, a country that Israel does not have official diplomatic ties with, took place at all. i24NEWS had been first to report on the meet up on July 4, 2018, which reportedly also included U.S. nationals. All of this came more than a month after the Israeli Air Force disclosed that it had flown its F-35I Adirs, which means “mighty,” on actual combat operations , becoming the first country to do so, ever. It is worth noting that both the initial i24NEWS story and the subsequent denial via The Jerusalem Post had very limited details. The Post did not say who within the IDF specifically had contradicted the claims or if they had done so on the record. There was no official quote provided. At the same time, i24NEWS ’ anonymous sources had not said when or where the meeting with UAE and American individuals had occurred, or whether the latter group included members of the U.S. government, from F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin, or other independent organizations. And though secondary reports indicated that Emiratis visited the IAF’s Nevatim Air Base , the original story simply notes that this facility is home to 140 Squadron, also known as the Golden Eagle Squadron , which operates all 12 of the Adirs that Israel has at present. The Israelis plan to take delivery of at least 50 F-35Is, but this number could eventually grow to 75 aircraft . One of the IAF’s 140 Squadron’s F-35I Adirs., IAF Without knowing the specifics, it is entirely possible that the IDF made clear that it had not let Emirati officials into Nevatim rather denying it had met with them outright. It is possible that the two parties did meet to discuss the F-35’s capabilities and Israel’s experiences, or at least share just as much about those topics as the Israeli officials want to disclose, at another location. A similarly limited overview briefing about the Adirs could have been part of a larger meeting or set of meetings between the IAF and the UAE Air Force personnel, as well. It is not uncommon for military forces around the world to offer information sessions about their various capabilities to distinguished visitors . And even if the Joint Strike Fighter was never an official agenda item, it seems hard to imagine that any gathering between the two countries’ air forces would not have touched on Israel’s combat employment of its F-35Is and the UAE’s long-standing interest in buying Joint Strike Fighters. Similarly, depending on exactly when the engagement took place, it might be easy to explain it as having been ostensibly related to the Greek Air Force’s annual Iniohos exercise rather than the F-35. Israel and the UAE, along with Greece, Cyprus, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States, all took part in Iniohos 2018 , which occurred in March 2018. Representatives from the Israeli, Emirati, and U.S. air forces could have decided to meet before or afterward to either coordinate their plans or discuss lessons learned. It’s worth noting that Israel kept its own participation in the event relatively low key this year for unknown reasons, with much of the official media not even showing the IAF’s contributions. The IAF did scale back plans to attend an exercise in the United States the next month due to apparent operational demands over Syria , but Israeli personnel still attended that drill and there was no attempt to downplay their involvement. In addition, Israel and the UAE both took part in the 2017 iteration of the Greek exercise, so there is no reason why the public pairing should have been an issue. But whether or not the two countries did hold a meeting specifically about the F-35, there has been a steady stream of recent news suggesting that senior Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have been discreetly meeting with their UAE counterparts. In March 2018, the Israeli leader met with the UAE’s Ambassador to the U.S. Yousef al Otaiba, according to the Associated Press . An official Hellenic (Greek) Air Force image showing participants in Iniohos 2018. The UAE contingent is second from the left. Israel’s personnel and aircraft are notably absent., HAF The increasingly close relationship dates back to at least 2015 and centers on Israel’s opposition to the international deal over Iran’s controversial nuclear program. Israeli officials reportedly began looking to increase their contacts with Arab countries, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who were also opposed to Iran’s expanding influence in the Middle East and elsewhere, even in the absence of formal diplomatic relations. In May 2018, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump withdrew support from the Iran Deal, but it doesn’t seem to have changed Israel’s policies toward the Emirates. The question of Iran looms large over the UAE’s interest in the F-35, too. Emirati Joint Strike Fighters would give the country an important tool to deter any overt Iranian military action in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere in the Middle East. If a crisis were to break out, the jets would offer an additional means of responding to Iran’s moves, especially the threat of its growing ballistic missile capabilities . The jets could use their sensors to gather important electronic intelligence on Iran’s capabilities, especially its air defense networks , while just flying in the Persian Gulf on training missions or normal patrols. And the ties with Israel have already had an impact on the UAE’s efforts to join the Joint Strike Fighter program, further helped along by Trump’s outspoken support for Israel and his stated desire to increase American arms sales abroad . Previous U.S. administrations had blocked the Emiratis from purchasing F-35s in no small part because of concerns that this would negate Israel’s so-called “ qualitative military edge ” in the region against any potential opponents, something the United States endeavors to preserve as a matter of national policy. The “UAE is not going to go and fight any of the United States’ allies, we’re going to fight in the same line, we’re going to defeat the same enemy,” UAE Air Force Staff Major General Pilot Abdullah Al Hashmi, who is Assistant Undersecretary for Support Services, in the country’s Ministry of Defense, told Defense & Aerospace Report on the sidelines of the Dubai Air Show in November 2017. “I don’t think we are a threat to Israel nor do we think Israel is a threat on UAE.” He added that allowing the UAE to buy the F-35 made good strategic sense for the United States for these same reasons. The comments also came amid reports at that time that the U.S. government was getting closer to relaxing its opposition to the Emiratis joining the Joint Strike Fighter program and that Israel could be increasingly inclined to accept the arrangement. “The Trump team has agreed to consider the request,” an unnamed retired Pentagon official told Defense News in November 2017. “It’s not a ‘yes’ yet, but I’m pretty sure it’s going to happen once the dust settles.” The “dust” clouding the issue is a still ongoing dispute between the UAE, as well as Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, and Qatar, over the latter country’s ties with Iran . This political spat, which has proven especially difficult to bring to an end, could be among the last hurdles the Emiratis have to clear before getting a chance to buy F-35s. A pair of Israeli F-35s., IAF The War Zone has noted before that it already seemed likely that expansive export controls could have eased Israeli concerns about further F-35 sales. Most importantly, the U.S. government had an unprecedented ability to limit, if not entirely curtail , foreign Joint Strike Fighter operations by blocking access to the critical cloud-based Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) support network, something it appears to be threatening to do to Turkey over a separate political dispute . So, even if Israel and the UAE didn’t meet to discuss the F-35 specifically, or even at all in this particular instance, it seems clear that the two countries are growing increasingly close together, especially in terms of military ties. If the Emiratis do finally get a chance to buy Joint Strike Fighters, it is very possible that they might eventually find themselves flying alongside Israeli jets, at least in future exercises in third-party countries.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 18, 2019",Draken Begins Assembly Of First Mirage F1M Destined For Advanced Aggressor Duty,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s private air forces for hire continue to rapidly expand to meet looming demand for contracted adversary support services. Draken International has emerged as the behemoth in the marketplace and has acquired 22 Dassault Mirage F1s from Spain to be the backbone of its advanced, radar-equipped, supersonic aggressor fleet. The first of these has arrived at the company’s Lakeland, Florida facility and is now undergoing assembly. Photos of the unpacking process popped up on Draken’s Facebook page, with the F1’s svelte frame being shipped on cradles inside of long wooden crates. Draken is working with South African defense contractor Paramount Aerospace to regenerate the Mirages, along with a dozen Atlas Cheetahs the company bought to satisfy demand for increasingly advanced adversary support. Draken states the following in press release : Paramount Aerospace specializes in the modernization of fixed-wing platforms including leading the previous modernization of the Mirage F1M while still in Spanish Air Force military service.  Paramount possesses extensive capabilities on the Mirage F1 with full airframe and engine overhaul capability, as well as the ability to upgrade and modernize avionics and mission systems. “We are looking forward to working with one of the few companies in the world that possess the extensive depth of F1 experience and knowledge that Paramount brings to the table. We are especially confident given Paramount’s experience modernizing the same Mirage F1M jets we now own when they were in prior Spanish Air Force service,” said Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International. … Paramount Group acquired the entire South African Mirage F1 fleet, along with spares, simulators, training aids and other related material. The Mirage F1 represents an ideal solution for low-cost Super Sonic Fighter capability, and Paramount offers a complete air-power package, with full training and technical support for the aircraft. Paramount also operates a fighter aircraft pilot training Academy in South Africa, the only one of its kind on the African continent. Ivor Ichikowitz, Group Chairman of Paramount Group said, “We are extremely excited by the partnership with Draken International and the establishment of long-term relationships in support of the US Air Force. There are very strong synergies between our organizations in meeting the ever-increasing demand for the effective utilization of legacy aircraft in adversary training. Our collaboration with Draken underlines the importance of strategic partnerships for providing flexible, scalable and affordable solutions for the US Air Force.” Draken International The F1s and Cheetahs will join Draken’s blossoming fleet of nearly 150 airframes, which includes A-4 Skyhawks, L159 Honeybadgers , L-39 Albatrosses, MB339s, and other support aircraft. The company also owns dozens of MiG-21s, although they don’t seem to be a part of its regular operations. An Atlas Cheetah blasts by USS Forest Sherman in Table Bay back in 2007. , USN The big advantage the F1s and Cheetahs will bring to the fight isn’t necessarily agility, but supersonic speed and a modern radar that can approximate the capabilities of a fourth-generation enemy fighter but in a more efficient manner. They will be upgraded with new avionics and wiring to handle a host of new stores, such as electronic warfare pods, as well. I predicted the coming explosion of contractor adversary support services nearly a decade ago and have closely watched those predictions become a reality in recent years, which is very exciting. Contractors can bring a lot to the table beyond just saving money and being a more elastic resource for unique training needs. The experience of their pilot cadre alone is an added benefit and asset that goes along with their services. They also allow for more rapid innovation in what is a very costly space, which can end up resulting in higher quality training for combat pilots and more of it. Just better-matching assets up for the mission at hand will save vast amounts of precious airframe hours and cost. For instance, you don’t need an F-15 to provide a subsonic target just for another F-15 pilot to practice radar intercepts, but that is how the U.S. military has trained for decades. Just as I said years ago, in a dawning era that will be dominated by stealth fighters that are notoriously expensive to run and acquire, doing so simply isn’t a fiscal option, plus it’s simply wasteful. Dedicated adversary squadrons are also costly to sustain and are often vulnerable to budget cuts . In addition, they don’t have nearly enough capacity to maintain fleet readiness and this will only get worse as modern fighters require more aerial targets to challenge their advanced weapons, sensor fusion, and stealth capabilities. And Draken and ATAC have already been augmenting USAF and U.S. Navy aggressor squadrons for years. So they aren’t a replacement for them, but are a major helping hand that will be increasingly critical to their mission of providing challenging ‘red-air’ scenarios. With Draken continuing to scoop up major contracts with the USAF that will include operating locations all across the United States and beyond, they will need every one of these airframes. And considering the company’s major competitor—among an increasing number of others —the now Textron-owned Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), is receiving no less than 63 Mirage F1s from France, the type’s very unique silhouette is going to suddenly become a fairly common sight in the skies over the United States. There is no doubt about it, the Mirage F1 is a beautiful flying machine that looks fast even while flying slow., KGyST/Wikicommons The F1 packs a unique set of features that make it a very attractive platform to satisfy the U.S. military’s needs for a contracted 4th generation threat replication aircraft. It was built fairly simple with a strong focus on durability and austere operations. It is relatively fuel-efficient engine for its vintage, it can easily fly at supersonic speeds, it has good endurance, and it has a nice big radar aperture in which a variety of radar sets can be installed. It is also supportable both by the OEM and groups like Paramount Aerospace. Finally, considering 720 F1s were built, there isn’t exactly a shortage of spare parts either. F1Ms while still flying in Spanish colors. , Chris Lofting/Wikimedia In essence, the F1 is both simple enough and complex enough to meet the mission goals while still being efficient and cost-effective. It is also a fairly straight-forward aircraft to fly and doesn’t suffer from some of the limitations and unique handling characteristics of a strict delta-wing designs like the Mirage III/Kfir/Cheetah. So within a number of months, the U.S. will go from having no flyable F1s to dozens, and U.S. military pilots and radar controllers will have a whole new threat to deal with.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 10, 2018",Israel Posts Pic Of CH-53 Yasur Helicopter With Unknown Roll-On Electronic Warfare Suite,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israeli Air Force’s fleet of around two dozen CH-53 Yasur helicopters is among its most important. They can carry out a number of missions, including long-range heavy assault and deep-penetration insertion and extraction of special operations teams. But maybe their most important mission is that of combat search and rescue (CSAR). Considering the regular headlines alone, which include IAF strikes over hostile territory and clandestine operations far from its borders, the Yasurs and their crews can be called upon to go about their work in very high-risk combat environments. A clue to how this is accomplished may have been just unveiled by the IAF in the form of a photo of a CH-53 Yasur with what appears to be an electronic warfare array setup in its doorway. The photo, which was posted by the IAF’s official Twitter account reads: “The most significant things are hidden” – this is the IAF’s EW (Electronic Warfare) Operators’ motto. After receiving his EW Operator badge last week, Pvt. A’ tells the IAF Site about his enlistment and training in this personal column:” It then links to this story on the IAF’s webpage. The photo shows what appears to be a roll-on, roll-off electronic warfare system of some type situated behind the doorframe of the CH-53’s starboard door. There seems to be a pair of horn antennas or cooling vents protruding from the panel, as well as some other flat panels or access ports. It’s also possible that this is the backside of an electronic warfare and command and control console fitted inside the Yasar’s cabin and its emitters are located elsewhere, but that seems unlikely. Yonatan Zalk/IAF It’s not clear exactly what the function of this system is but electronic warfare is the IAF’s most critical support capability as it has helped its aircraft to regularly penetrate defended airspace over the decades with very minimal losses. The IAF’s combat fleet is outfitted with advanced electronic warfare systems that are indigenous to Israel and the country’s self-escort jamming pods are notoriously capable and exported around the globe . They are even used by American aggressors to better challenge fleet pilots during air combat war games . Software that can penetrate an enemy’s air defense network directly and confuse, shutdown, or misdirect its sensors and control infrastructure, often referred to as Suter technology, is thought to have been used by the IAF since at least the bombing of Syria’s nuclear reactor back in 2007. Today, cyber attacks can also be used to provide windows in enemy defenses through which Israeli aircraft can sneak through. Carmel Horowitz/IAF Considering Yasur helicopters, which are based on the CH-53D airframe, are low and slow flying and are aerial refueling capable, they have to be able to survive with minimal support during forward-thrusting operations. With this in mind, giving them the best electronic warfare capability available is highly logical. Jamming enemy radar systems, like those on point-defense SAM systems and self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery, is a critical capability. Just knowing where the threats are is also important, as they can be evaded via ‘on the fly’ route alterations. Carmel Horowitz/IAF Yet Israel’s CH-53s are less adorned with visible modifications than U.S. special operations helicopters or even aging CH-53E Super Stallions of the Marine Corps in some regards. Roll-on, roll-off systems like this could explain this discrepancy, allowing the IAF to tailor the aircraft’s configuration depending on the mission and use multiple helicopters with different capabilities uploaded onto them as part of a combined force when necessary. Modular electronic warfare systems are becoming much more common and the USMC is also pushing its own bolt-on/roll-on electronic warfare suites to its rotary-wing fleet. Guy Ashash/IAF The Yasur fleet has gone through another upgrade, dubbed Yasur 2025, which will allow it to remain relevant throughout the next decade. This upgrade included a deep airframe and powerplant overhaul and enhancements to the helicopter’s communications system, which includes satellite connectivity, updated data-links, and Elbit Systems’ Helicom networking architecture along with the touchscreen display interfaces to operate it. Helicom provides seamless information flow between helicopters, acting as something akin to a local area network. Yonatan Zalk/IAF The aircraft’s navigation system was also enhanced and it now features a laser obstacle ranging system and a hover stabilization system. A number of unspecified defensive systems upgrades were also part of the package. Currently, Israel is considering the CH-53K King Stallion and a variant of the CH-47F Chinook as a replacement. But until then, Israel’s Yasurs will continue to carry out some of the IAF’s most challenging missions, and this modular electronic warfare suite, or others like it, is likely a key to allowing them to do just that.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-2 Spirit looks just as futuristic today as it did when it was unveiled to the public three decades ago . It is my favorite aircraft to photograph and I am still amazed at how dramatically it can ‘morph’ in appearance depending on the lighting and angle of view. But there is one image I recently found that may be the most unique of the stealth bomber. If you follow me on Twitter, you know the flying-wing bomber’s ability to ‘change shape’ in front of the camera lens is a bit of an obsession of mine. The B-2 can look downright alien as well, and even like the subject of a popular science-fiction adventure story from the 1980s. Yet this photo, taken by Michael L. Abramson in 1999, is totally unique. It has a real techno-thriller aura and a sense of mystery. It also paints a deep contrast between man and machine. It seems to make clear that the pilots are just visitors within the B-2’s seemingly otherworldly realm. The 35mm texture also adds to the atmosphere of the image. Michael L.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is, without a doubt, a crisis impacting the U.S. military’s diverse aviation communities for a host of reasons, but, no matter what the Pentagon and the different services do, they won’t ever be able to eliminate crashes and other mishaps entirely. Accidents do happen and when it comes to military aircraft they can be very costly, even if it’s just a can of Red Bull bursting all over a flight console. No, seriously, this is exactly what happened to the crew of an MC-12W Liberty intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, serial number 10-006450, on June 5, 2017. The aircraft was assigned to a unit within Air Force Special Operations Command and was flying what was likely a training mission out of Hurlburt Field in Florida. A US Air Force MC-12W., Bill Word The War Zone obtained a heavily redacted summary of the incident via the Freedom of Information Act after spotting a basic description of the mishap in Military Times’ online crash database . This is how the report describes the incident: On 5 Jun 2017, the Mishap Crew (MC) was enroute to their assigned airspace when the Mishap Copilot (MCP, Person #1) retrieved a 16oz can of Red Bull from his backpack. While still holding the unopened can, the can ruptured spilling fluid onto the center console. While the MCP used his shirt to absorb what he could, the Mishap Pilot (MP) noticed a faint odor. He subsequently shut down the mission system power, which alleviated the odor. The crew discussed their options and decided to RTB [return to base]. There’s no indication that the crew, which included a private contractor, was ever physically in danger during the mishap. The aftermath might have earned them some sort disciplinary action, but Air Force censors redacted the investigating officers’ findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Unfortunately, there were no picture attached to the report, either. What we do know is how much the incident cost the service – $113,675. That’s more than $7,000 of damage for each ounce of Red Bull that “Person #1” spilled in the cockpit. A look inside the cockpit on a US Air Force C-12-series aircraft. The configuration is similar to that of an MC-12W., USAF This is what the Air Force had to spend to have maintenance personnel remove 13 specific electronic “line replaceable units,” or LRUs, for inspection and install replacements in their place. These self-contained components could include displays, switchboards, computer processors, and other systems. It was also enough to ensure the service had to report what happened as a Class C mishap , which is any incident that causes between $50,000 and $499,999 in damages, leaves someone with a non-fatal injury requiring more than a day or specific work shift to recover, or both. With this in mind, it seems safe to say that the Air Force has since recommended aircrews be more careful with their drinks in the future and leave the stunts to professionals .

We weren’t alone in this thinking. The parallels with the armored command center and lab vehicle from Universal Soldier immediately came up in the conversation. There was also ARK II, a television show from the 1970s that fits the bill quite well: Surely there are many others. And as always, there seems to be a GI Joe toy that predicted everything, including this hulking contraption: Amazon.com Beyond the pop-culture parallels, there’s still the question of what on earth does this big ass Benz do?

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday I wrote a post about Saudi Arabia’s somewhat mysterious armored semis that looked like they belonged in a 1980s action movie or a GI Joe playset more than on the battlefield. We had some information that pointed toward them being some sort of mobile medical unit, but now we have definitive proof thanks to our Twitter contact @Franmatiasbueno. The vehicles are indeed mobile battlefield medical facilities and they are designed in such a way that they can be linked in tandem to provide shade from the hot desert sun and accessibility. Judging by the pictures below, Saudi Arabia has quite a few of them and they have likely been used operationally in the conflict against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Obviously, there is also a humanitarian mission for such a fleet as well. Military-Medicine.com describes Saudi Arabia’s Armed Forces Medical Services General Directorate (AFMSGD) and their role when it comes to field medicine: “The AFMSGD has been instructed by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and His Highness the Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and Aviation, Inspector-General to provide integrated medical service in all specialties and levels. The role of field medicine in the AFMSGD is to provide field medical care nationally and internationally in peace or war by mobilizing hospitals that are equipped with the latest medical preparations and a highly qualified medical staff trained to work in the field. The field hospitals, participate on national events to serve the nation and the citizens and to acquire the skills and training required for the employees involved. In addition, they participate effectively in humanitarian and relief campaigns of the brother and friendly states affected by wars or natural disasters.” The point about supporting the massive international pilgrimage to Mecca on a yearly basis does make The Kingdom’s emphasis on retaining a high capacity of mobile medicine capability more logical. We still don’t know what exact abilities these specific vehicles have, but one would think they could provide extreme care considering their ability to be deployed close to the front lines. Being linked together may point to the possibility that they could be set up to perform different functions so that they can collectively provide a fuller spectrum of care. Just being able to triage patients in an air-conditioned space is critical considering The Kingdom’s climate. We will keep you updated once we find out more about them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 31, 2018",Northrop Grumman Wants In On Japan’s Stealth Fighter Project,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman has reportedly held talks with Japanese officials about joining that country’s F-3 stealth fighter project . At the same time, Japan is also seeking offers from Boeing and BAE Systems as it searches for a foreign partner or partners to help speed the program along . Reuters was first to reveal that Northrop Grumman was actively eyeing a spot in the Japanese program on July 6, 2018. Japan has been looking to develop its own fifth generation fighter, possibly with outside help, for more than a decade after the U.S. government blocked foreign sales of Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor . “Northrop is interested,” an unnamed source told Reuters. The Virginia-headquartered defense contractor has already held meetings with Japanese officials to outline the types of technology it could contribute to the F-3 program, but has not made a proposal based around a particular aircraft type. The last time the firm publicly developed a manned stealth fighter was in the 1980s when it pitted its YF-23 Black Widow , which built upon its previous experience in low observable designs in the XST , Tacit Blue , and B-2 programs , against the F-22 in the U.S. Air Force’s Advanced Tactical Fighter competition. Though the Raptor won that contract, the company has since gone on to develop a number of other manned and unmanned stealth aircraft designs , including the B-21 bomber , and is understood to be heavily involved in such work in the classified realm . Northrop Grumman’s YF-23 Black Widow., USAF In addition, Northrop Grumman works as a sub-contractor to Lockheed Martin on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, building center fuselage sections for those jets. Earlier in July 2018, it began full-rate production of those components, expecting to build approximately 20 of them every month. Japan is also already a member of the F-35 project and Japanese firm Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is performing the final assembly of those jets in the country. Still, any Northrop Grumman offer is likely to be immediately in steep competition with pitches from Lockheed Martin, which have already included a concept that reportedly includes design features from both the F-22 and the F-35. The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor also already has experience working with Japan on an earlier fourth generation fighter project, the F-2 . A Japanese F-2 fighter jet., USAF A Japanese partnership with either company could leverage existing technology to keep development costs – pegged at around $40 billion – as low as possible, as well as provide a vehicle for important technology transfer to domestic companies. So, though Japan is eager to court foreign partners for the F-3 program, it has made clear that domestic industrial cooperation will still be a core part of the effort. According to Reuters, Japanese officials have made it clear that the final aircraft will include avionics and mission systems, a radar, communications gear, navigation equipment, and even engines from the country’s IHI Corporation conglomerate. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will have to be involved in a significant portion of the physical production of the aircraft, too. In 2016, this company put its own stealth fighter demonstrator, the X-2 , into the air for the first time. And according to Reuters, the F-3 competition might not be limited to just Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Japan is still hoping to hear back from Boeing and British defense giant BAE systems. Japanese officials have worked closely with Boeing in the past on domestic production of the F-15J Eagle . The company’s last attempt to build a manned fighter was with the X-32 stealth design , which notably lost out to what became the F-35. In 2017, Japan and the United Kingdom also agreed to work together to develop a new, long-range air-to-air missile , derived from the advanced Meteor design , which will be an important weapon for any existing and future Japanese fighter jets. BAE Systems is part of MBDA, the European consortium that produces that Meteor, and will likely lead the shared effort on the British side. But despite the flurry of activity, Japanese officials have yet to publicly outline a clear plan for when the development of the F-3 will even begin. Previous schedules had the project beginning right now , which our own Tyler Rogoway had previously noted was highly optimistic . And the desire to bring in a foreign partner might actually lead to the need for additional time in the schedule to secure the appropriate export approvals and smooth over any political squabbles that could occur as a result. Japan has already experienced these issues in its failed attempts to purchase F-22s and the F-2 program. The latter aircraft is essentially a late model F-16 Viper , but is around three times more expensive per plane. With no plans to export the plane, which the United States could easily have blocked to prevent competition with the Viper anyway, Japan had few avenues to try and drive those unit costs down. Any stealth fighter it builds that ends up full of American technology could face many of the same hurdles in securing any export sales, despite Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s close relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, left, shakes hands with US President Donald Trump., Kyodo via AP Though Trump would likely be inclined to approve Abe’s deals with U.S. companies for Japan’s own use, the president has been especially eager to sell allies and partners American-made weapon systems . This could conflict with the Japanese government’s increasing efforts to become an international arms supplier in its own right, especially since any readily exportable F-3 could easily find itself in direct competition with the F-35. There is an entire tier of countries that could be very interested in an aircraft with Joint Strike Fighter DNA or similar capabilities, but without the need to join Lockheed Martin’s international program . This might make an offer from BAE Systems, or another European competitor, attractive to Japan. France and Germany, for example, are working together on their own stealth fighter project , which will reportedly be “ITAR-free,” a reference to removing any components that would face export restrictions under the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations rules . Earlier in July 2018, Dirk Hoke, chief executive of the Airbus Defense & Space division working on this Future Combat Air Systems (FCAS) project, called for cooperation across Europe in the project. He argued that there was not enough room in the international fighter jet market for European aircraft companies to continue making competing designs. “To look at the current scenario and to develop two or more solutions for the market is not sustainable,” he said. “It will bring [European industry] to the second league – we will not compete if we fragment the market further.” Hoke also specifically said that BAE Systems could join the program at a later date. He also showed a video with a prospective tailless sixth generation fighter concept for the Franco-German program. Separately, the United Kingdom and Sweden are reportedly in talks about partnering on a new fighter jet program. Japan could seek to leverage any of these cooperative European efforts for its own F-3. The Japanese stealth fighter project will also be up against competing priorities within the countries own defense budget, though that might not be as much of an issue as it has been in the past. Abe’s government has sought to significantly increase Japan’s military spending and even amend the country’s pacifist constitution to allow for more flexibility in this regard. It’s hard to see fifth generation fighters as ever being a low priority, either. Japan faces a standing threat of armed conflict with North Korea and the physical proximity of the two countries would quickly put Japanese jets in range of that country’s largely antiquated, but steadily improving and simply dense air defense network. This reality has already prompted the country to begin developing a number of air-launched , stand-off weapons to help its existing jets still hold North Korean targets at threat, and do so quickly, in any future crisis on the Korean Peninsula. A Japanese F-2 fighter jet carries a XASM-3 prototype supersonic anti-ship cruise missile., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries At the same time, Japan has been facing increasing challenges from both China and Russia over a number of territorial disputes . Japanese jets routinely scramble to intercept Chinese and Russian planes near the contested Senkaku and Kuril Islands chains. To meet these and other security demands, Japan is still hopeful it can get an F-3 stealth fighter into service by the mid-2030s, according to Reuters. Given the historically time consuming and complex processes associated with fifth generation fighter jet projects, Japanese officials will have to settle on how they want to proceed soon if they want to meet that goal, even with any help from outside firms.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Our friends over at the always great Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook page posted shots from @stuffinmyairspace of 144th Fighter Wing F-15Cs executing a flyover of Dodger Stadium on July 4th. If you look closely, the lead jet’s boarding ladder is deployed, which is not a normal or good situation. If the apparatus were to break off it could smash into the jet, or worse, be sucked down its left side air intake. It’s not clear at this time exactly how the incident occurred or why the flight continued with the flyby with jet in that configuration. We also don’t know what speed the ladder is rated for, but one would think it isn’t speed rated at all. If it is, maybe the pilot just decided to keep their airspeed below its maximum number and to continue on with the mission. It’s doubtful that the ladder was just left in a down position. If the jets flew from their home base in Fresno or their secondary operating location at March Air Reserve Base, standard boarding ladders would have been used, not the built-in one seen here that is usually used while operating from remote locations without dedicated ground support. It’s possible the pilots worked out of an even closer airport and used the ladders, but there is no way that everyone in the flight failed to notice the deployed ladder before executing the flyover. We are reaching out to the 144th Fighter Wing public affairs for comment and we will let you know what we hear back. Update: 2:44pm PST— According to our friend @aircraftspots this was GRIFN01 flight and they operated out of JFTB Los Alamitos, so they were at a remote airfield. In other words, it is quite possible the ladder was used for boarding. Update: 3:27pm PST— We just talked to Colonel Victor Sikora, the 144nd Operations Group commander. He explained that the issue didn’t make itself known until the jets were on the move and the ladder only popped out once they were airborne. Apparently, the Eagle’s ladder has been rated up to a ‘high speed’ and has no adverse impact on the F-15’s handling characteristics within its tested envelope. Considering the flyover speed is 300 knots, it was in no way a safety factor and the mission was able to continue. All this was decided after a specific checklist was performed and the flight had a good handle on the situation. So there you have it, a bit of an unexpected and rare Eagle configuration perhaps, but it wasn’t a danger and everyone still got to see the quartet of F-15s roar overhead the stadium on America’s 242nd birthday. Author’s note: A huge thanks to the 144th Fighter Wing public affairs team. They were so fast in getting back to us, and had the Colonel ready to explain it in full to us.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2018",China Looks To Replace Its J-15 Carrier Fighter Jets Amid Reports Of Crashes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China is reportedly working on a replacement for the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s J-15 carrier-based fighter jet. This news comes amid revelations that the aircraft are increasingly accident prone and the Chinese already need to significantly expand their carrier aviation fleets to keep pace with plans to build new flattops . The South China Morning Post confirmed that China’s Navy, also known as the PLAN, was searching for a new carrier fighter on July 4, 2018. Though Chinese officials say that a new type is in development, there was no information on whether this would be a variant of an existing aircraft, either produced domestically or acquired abroad, or a clean-sheet design, or when it might enter service. Lieutenant General Zhang Honghe, deputy head of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, or PLAAF, acknowledged the project was in progress, according to the South China Morning Post , but declined to give any specifics. The existing J-15 is a derivative of the Soviet-era Su-33 Flanker-D and first flew in 2009. The Su-33’s basic design, however, traces back to the 1980s. The J-15 forms the core of the carrier air wing on board China’s first aircraft carrier, the Type 001 Liaoning , which itself entered service in 2012. The PLAN’s first domestically produced carrier , known presently simply as the Type 001A, started its sea trials in May 2018. A third “Type 002” ship is reportedly under construction and China has plans for at least four carriers in the coming years, each one of which will need an air wing. That’s not counting any additional aircraft it might need to create a steady pipeline of pilots to go along with those jets. While there are no official details about what the J-15’s successor will look like, there are a number of possibilities. One option would be to simply improve upon the existing aircraft. In addition to the single-seat fighters, Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has made a limited number of J-15S trainers, which may now serve as testbeds for further improved designs. In May 2018, pictures emerged of a what some have referred to as a J-15D or J-17, a two-seat variant with what appeared to be electronic warfare jamming pods on the wingtips. This could be an important addition to Chinese carrier air wings, regardless of the main type of aircraft it is flying. In a similar vein, the PLAN could look to acquire a navalized variant of the more modern J-16 , which China reportedly derived in part from the more modern Su-30MKK Flanker-G , or a version of that latter jet straight from Russia. The PLAAF operates both Su-30MKKs and J-16s already from land bases. It also began receiving even more advanced Su-35 Flanker-Es from Russia in January 2018. Still, the PLAN’s experiences with the J-15 could make them disinclined to go with another Flanker derivative. If nothing else, these aircraft are heavy, with an empty weight of 38,600 pounds. This makes them one of the heaviest carrier-borne fighter jets, ever. A PLAAF Su-30MKK Flanker-G., Dmitriy Pichugin via Wikimedia On top of that, the Liaoning and the future Type 001A are both Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) types that use ski-jumps to help the aircraft get airborne. Even so, the planes have to fly with reduced weapons and fuel loads to be light enough to get off the deck safely. In addition, “the J-15 is a problematic aircraft – its unstable flight control system was the key factor behind the two fatal accidents two years ago,” an unnamed Chinese military source told the South China Morning Post . The individual was referring to a pair of crashes in April 2016, including one mishap in which the pilot, Zhang Chao, died . The other pilot, Cao Xianjian, survived , but suffered serious injuries. “But the aviation experts at first refused to acknowledge that the J-15 has design problems,” another one of the South China Morning Post’s sources said. “They only agreed there were problems after Cao encountered the same trouble.” The incidents left the J-15s grounded for three months. The South China Morning Post reported that the relatively small fleet of jets – Shenyang only ever produced approximately 20 in total – has seen at least four crashes, even though state authorities have only admitted two so far. The incidents in 2016 came as the PLAN pushed to declare the Liaoning combat ready . In August 2017, the engine on another one of the fighters caught fire after an apparent bird strike , but this did not prompt a fleet-wide grounding. Nine J-15s, which could be nearly half the total number ever produced, on board the Liaoning. , Imaginechina via AP Images It’s not clear if the reported flight control system issues would necessarily persist with the more advanced Su-30MKK or J-16, either. It is worth noting, however, that in 2010, the Russians themselves began purchasing the lighter MiG-29K Fulcrum as the replacements for their own aging Su-33s on their carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov . The Indian Navy also went this route for their STOBAR carrier INS Vikramaditya , though they are reportedly less than pleased with the performance of these aircraft, as well. Among the factors that played into that decision was the outdated avionics on the Su-33s. It is possible that the PLAN could acquire a number of MiG-29Ks, or variants thereof, at least as an interim option. It could then decide to either craft a copy of this type or develop a new domestic carrier fighter for future carriers. It might be difficult for the Chinese to clone the Fulcrum, or at least do so quickly, as they have never operated the type. https://youtube.com/watch?v=M0itsOUS4aU A small purchase of an existing type, or one that would require minimum development , might make even more sense since the Type 002 carrier, as well as other future Chinese flattops, will reportedly have a Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration. This will significantly change the weight and performance requirements for the planes flying off those ships, which will open up new possibilities for what kind of aircraft they can accommodate and could change the calculus for the PLAN as it outlines the structure of their air wings. It could also provide the additional time necessary to complete development of a fifth generation carrier fighter design. Speculation has persisted for some time that Shenyang could be developing its FC-31 medium-weight stealth jet (also referred to as the J-31) as a carrier fighter. The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the country’s state-run aviation conglomerate , has said it could have a production-ready model by 2019 . The FC-31 prototype as it existed in 2014. One prototype has since received significant updates ., AP However, AVIC has long insisted that the aircraft is primarily for export and that it is looking for a foreign buyer to help finance the completion of the plane’s development. With two prototypes of the design already, the latest of which is substantially more advanced than the first, a derivative of FC-31 could easily turn out to be an attractive option for the PLAN. If Shenyang could develop a version that is suitable for STOBAR operations, as well, it could also complement or replace any fighter jets China buys in the meantime for the Liaoning and the future Type 001A carrier. There is also the distinct possibility that the PLAN is looking to supplement these manned aircraft with stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) on the Type 002 and any further CATOBAR carriers, too. Whatever courses of action China chooses, it will have to make those decisions sooner rather than later, if it hasn’t already. The PLAN is expanding at an aggressive rate and is expecting to commission its third carrier by 2023 . Those ships won’t be particularly useful without any aircraft to go on them. And, to be fair, the loss of four aircraft is significant, but it isn’t a major surprise. To be fair to China, carrier aviation operations are extremely complex and challenging and require significant training and regular drills to maintain competency. The U.S. Navy has experienced its own share of mishaps , and the Russians dumped two jets in the water during its sole carrier’s most recent cruise. China’s aircraft carrier aviation program is still so young, and there is so much to learn in general. China has gone on a propaganda blitz that seems aimed, at least in part, in presenting a positive picture of things as they stand now. Earlier in 2018, it awarded Zhang, the pilot who died, the title of “best party member,” a significant accolade. State-run CCTV also aired a special on Cao, who will be among the People’s Liberation Army’s representatives at the Communist Party’s congress in October 2018, another major honor. Cao and his comrades are probably hopeful that this high profile attention will translate into getting newer, more capable planes and quickly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 16, 2018",The British Army Hoped This Rifle Could’ve Helped Halt The American Revolution,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Since the United States has now been an independent country for more than 230 years, it might be hard for many Americans to remember that the success of the colonial uprising was hardly assured due to a host of political and military factors. The Revolutionary War, as is the case with most conflicts , was a proving ground of sorts of new technology, with the colonists and their allies notably using naval mines , and even an experimental submarine , to upend Britain’s near complete naval dominance. On land, though, one British Army officer was demonstrating a then state-of-the-art rifle in an attempt to help sway the course of the conflict in the other direction and may have even had General George Washington directly in his sights at one point. By the time the Second Continental Congress issued the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, Patrick Ferguson had already fought against the Holy Roman Empire in Europe during the Seven Years’ War and served more time in the British Army in the British Empire’s West Indies colonies . In 1772, the Scotsman had returned to the British Isles where he subsequently took part in then relatively unusual light infantry training and began work on what would become Ferguson’s Ordnance Rifle . Through much of the 18th Century and into the 19th Century, the British Army relied heavily on the Land Pattern Musket , or variants and derivatives thereof. Nicknamed the “Brown Bess” for still unclear reasons, the gun was typical of its time. A muzzle-loading flintlock musket , it shot a .75 caliber round ball and had an effective range of between 50 and 100 yards. During the Revolutionary War, American forces used similar muzzling loading muskets, including captured British guns, as well as muzzling-loading rifles, such as the Kentucky Rifle . With the Brown Bess, a well-trained soldier could manually load the powder charge and projectiles, ram them in place, set the priming compound under the flint, and then fire at a rate of between three and four shots per minute. Underscoring how lengthy and regimented the process was in the British Army, in 1764, Great Britain put out an official manual of arms for all military services that laid out 35 separate drills, many with multiple “motions,” for proper use of the muskets in combat and on the parade ground. A standard Land Pattern Musket or “Brown Bess.”, Antique Military Rifles via Wikimedia Ferguson proposed an alternative gun that troops would be able to load at the breach end and do so much more rapidly than before. It would be rifled for greater accuracy at range compared to the smooth-bore musket, too. To be fair, Ferguson was hardly the first to come up with the idea of a breech loading flintlock firearm or a mechanism that allowed for rapid fire. The design of Ferguson’s Ordnance Rifle lifts many key design features from a sporting gun a Frenchman named Isaac de la Chaumette had developed decades earlier. Part of an advertisement or manual for Ferguson’s Ordnance Rifle via National Park Service But Ferguson’s rifle was a significant improvement over that earlier design. Instead of having to tediously unscrew the action, thanks to a more efficient series of grooves, the shooter only had to swing the trigger guard one full revolution to crank open up a cavity at the breech. Then they could drop the projectile into place along with the powder charge. Closing the mechanism would force the powder charge into place and expel any excess in the process. The rest of the firing sequence was just like a typical flintlock rifle. You can watch the full sequence in the video below, which features a reproduction Ferguson rifle. In addition, since the user wouldn’t have to prop the gun up in some way to tip the powder and ball into the muzzle, they could employ the rifle from a prone position. This could have allowed sharpshooters to better conceal themselves behind cover or while lying down in dense foliage or tall grass, something that snipers today probably take for granted. In an initial demonstration for the British War Office and Board of Ordnance, Ferguson himself and 10 other trained soldiers were reportedly able to show a single rifle could put 15 balls on a target at 200 yards in just five minutes. This was as fast as shooting with the Brown Bess, but much more precise. The belief was that an infantry unit trained to effectively use the weapon could improve their rate of fire significantly. The video below shows how fast it might have been possible for an especially well-trained soldier to operate the standard Brown Bess. Despite support from British officials, Ferguson almost immediately found himself up against a host of obstacles in trying to get his rifle into widespread use. For one, the weapon had been developed with a not insignificant emphasis on enabling light infantry tactics that the British Army remained largely opposed to in basic concept. To make up for the relative speed of fire and the limited range and accuracy of weapons such as the Brown Bess, at the time, the British Army and its contemporaries typically employed heavy or “line” infantry units standing in rows with limited maneuverability to maximize their firepower. Light infantry or “skirmishers,” would operate in smaller, more flexible elements – again relative for the time and not at all comparable to modern infantry tactics – either ahead of this line or along its flanks, operating in groups as small as a pair of soldiers and firing at will instead of using massed, officer-directed volleys. In the years leading up to the Revolutionary War, the British had typically hired mercenaries or otherwise recruited irregulars, including colonial auxiliaries, to fill the role of light infantry. The British Army had an institutional aversion to the concept and routinely disbanded the units as soon as it no longer needed them. The demands of the Seven Years’ War, and its French and Indian War side-show in North America, led to actual British troops filling the ranks of some of these formations. Historians credit Brigadier General Lord George Howe with finally beginning to break the British Army’s hostility toward light infantry when he formally proposed the creation of a full regiment trained in tactics similar to the ones he had observed among his French and Native American opponents. French forces killed Howe in 1758 near Lake George in what is now New York State. A painting depicting France’s Louis-Joseph de Montcalm celebrating with his troops after the victory over the British, including forces under the command of Lord George Howe, at the Battle of Carillon during the French and Indian War. Seen behind him is an irregular wearing a coonskin cap, but the work does not show any of the significant numbers of Native Americans who fought for both sides during the battle., Henry Alexander Ogden/Public Domain Ferguson, who trained in light infantry operations under Howe’s brother William, was a clear advocate for more flexibility on the battlefield and guns to go with it. And with some senior elements within the British Army taking an increasingly positive view of light infantry, as well as sharpshooters, he was able to quickly secure a contract, albeit for just 300 guns, and received a patent for the breech-loading mechanism in December 1776. The far bigger issue was cost and complexity of manufacture. The British Army would’ve needed tens of thousands of Fergusons to replace the Land Pattern Musket and its cousins completely. The new rifles were four times more expensive than the Brown Bess and with just four gunsmiths building them, the guns were only reaching troops at a rate of less than 16 per month. In 1777, King George III finally ordered that Ferguson simply establish an Experimental Rifle Corps attached to General William Howe’s forces in the North American colonies. Even then, this unit of 100 men struggled to obtain the appropriate number of rifles, with some of them using other guns alongside them, reducing the overall effectiveness of the concept. The experimental formation took part in the massive Battle of Brandywine in September 1777, which occurred in present day Pennsylvania and lasted for approximately 11 hours, making the longest single-day engagement of the Revolutionary War. British troops backed by Hessian mercenaries inflicted heavy casualties on the colonial forces, including those under the command of George Washington. A painting depicting Continental Army forces at the Battle of Brandywine., Howard Pyle via the Brandywine Museum In what is likely an apocryphal story, Ferguson himself may have had the American commander in the sights of his own rifle, a shot that could have had serious ramifications for the conflict. As the story goes, he declined to shoot an enemy officer standing next to another individual in a hussar uniform since the individual’s back was turned. The suggestion was that this could have been Washington next to Count Casimir Pulaski , a Pole who had become a senior officer in the Continental Army and was also at the battle. Whatever the truth of the matter, Ferguson was himself wounded in the engagement. Apparently, without a vocal advocate to extend the test of his experimental unit, the British Army disbanded it and put the rifles into storage in New York. After returning to duty, Ferguson went on to command local loyalist irregular forces in the Carolinas and led a counter-insurgency campaign – an underappreciated component of the Revolutionary War as it occurred beyond the well known battlefields – in the region. He died in the Battle of Kings Mountain in what is today South Carolina after reportedly refusing to surrender to pro-independence American forces. An 1863 engraving depicting then Major Patrick Ferguson getting shot off his horse during the Battle of Kings Mountain. This wound was apparently not fatal and he died in a subsequent skirmish as pro-independence forces attempted to capture him., via the Anne S. K. Brown Collection at Brown University It’s not clear what happened to his rifles after the United States finally won its independence in 1783. There is some evidence that Ferguson may have found a way to get the guns out of storage in New York and delivered to his militias in the Carolinas. In something of a final irony, the North Carolina Militia reportedly sent forces into battle against the British armed with those same Fergusons during the War of 1812 , which cemented America’s status as an independent country. Even though the British only made approximately 200 Ferguson rifles in total ever, these apparently remained in some level of limited service in North America through the American Civil War. The bulk of the original rifles now in museums and other collections were seized by Union Troops. The rifles apparently had about as much impact on the outcome of that conflict as they did during the Revolutionary War. However, being the first breech-loading rifle to see real combat service officially with a standing military force, they did set the stage for future developments, both in regards to firearms and more mobile infantry tactics. And as we celebrate the Fourth of July, we can be additionally grateful that the British did not find a way to exploit the full potential of Ferguson’s Ordnance Rifle and that the man himself missed the opportunity to potentially have shot George Washington in the back.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 31, 2018","No, China Hasn’t Built A Laser Assault Rifle That Can ‘Carbonize’ People","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amid a number of reports that its military forces are employing laser weapons to blind American pilots flying in East Africa and the South China Sea , a Chinese state-run research organization says it has developed yet another man-portable “non-lethal” design. However, researchers have also made wildly implausible claims that this “laser assault rifle” will actually be a disorienting dazzler , a pain ray , and a lethal gun that can turn people into smoking piles of ash straight out of a science fiction movie, all in one compact package. Earlier in July 2018, the South China Morning Post detailed the apparent capabilities of the ZKZM-500 laser weapon, which reportedly weighs less than seven pounds, has a maximum range of approximately half a mile, generates a 15 millimeter-wide beam, and costs around $15,000. The Xi’an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says it has already built and tested a prototype of the weapon. Though Xi’an has described it as a laser that causes temporary blindness, anyone hit with the beam will experience pain “beyond endurance” and it will be able to “burn through clothes in a split second,” unnamed researchers reportedly told the South China Morning Post . “Nobody will know where the attack came from. It will look like an accident,” one of them added. The prospective roles for such a system would range from law enforcement tasks, such as dispersing crowds and defusing hostage situations, to military applications, such as covertly destroying valuable targets, including fuel storage tanks and radar dishes, or even killing a specific individual. One of China’s many existing hand-held laser weapons, which troops and security personnel could use to disrupt optics on hostile aircraft or vehicles or temporarily blind enemy personnel., Chinese Internet If what Xi’an is claiming is true, the weapon would represent a revolutionary leap in both laser research and military technology. Existing directed energy weapons able to destroy hostile targets , or even generate a painful less-than-lethal energy beam, require significant power sources and bulky infrastructure that have made them too big for any single person to reasonably carry. These lasers and particle beams often have to focus their rays on a particular target for an extended period of time to achieve the desired effect, as well. The team at Xi’an claims that the ZKZM-500 needs only a standard lithium-ion battery to provide power for more than 1,000 two-second bursts, which will be enough to create the desired effects. “This is no longer science fiction,” Wang Zhimin, an associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Research Centre for Laser Physics and Technology, told the South China Morning Post . “They are already a fact of life.” But Wang isn’t involved in the ZKZM-500 project in any way. In addition, it’s not clear if he was responding to questions from the Hong Kong-based newspaper regarding that weapon specifically or the increasing miniaturization of powerful electronic systems in general. None of this is to say that the Chinese government isn’t investing heavily in advanced technologies with already impressive results. The country is making very visible strides in the fields of hypersonic weapons , electromagnetic railguns , low observable manned and unmanned aircraft designs , artificial-intelligence driven drone swarm technology , and more .

This weapon’s size, configuration, and reported capabilities better reflect the general, world-wide state of this technology., via South China Morning Post In each one of these cases, though, the resulting products have largely reflected other existing, if particularly advanced developments.

China’s stealthy jets and drones reflect general trends in the development of such aircraft worldwide, too. The computer-generated image of the ZKZM-500 that Xi’an has released looks similar in most respects to more than a half-dozen other man-portable laser dazzlers that the Chinese military and other security forces have been experimenting with for years. Just in June 2018, the Chengdu Hengan Police Equipment Manufacturing Company released its own laser “machine gun” that emits rapid pulses, but without any claims that it does more than just disorient individuals. A promotional image showing the Chengdu Hengan Police Equipment Manufacturing Company’s new laser “machine gun.”, Chengdu Hengan Police Equipment Manufacturing Company via South China Morning Post One of the older types, the WJG-2002, also has a size and shape reminiscent of the country’s standard, bullet-shooting QBZ-95 assault rifle . This is likely to both make it easier for troops to carry and to make it less likely for enemy forces to quickly isolate an individual carrying the system and focus their fire on them. The Chinese have never before claimed that these weapons are laser rifles capable of “carbonizing” opponents or seriously disfiguring them, as the researchers implied to the South China Morning Post . With an international law banning any such system that deliberately causes permanent blindness, China has actually been especially careful to insist that these weapons are non-lethal and have no lasting effects on humans. A soldier aims a WJG-2002., via China Military Online Even if the ZKZM-500 does what the scientists at Xi’an say it does in test environments, there’s no guarantee that this would work, or do so consistently, in a real combat or riot control scenario. Directed energy weapons all suffer from the reality that their beams diffuse at longer ranges and are easily weakened by dust and other particulate matter in the air, which makes them less powerful and accurate against targets at even moderate distances. The United States has been hard at work on various less-than-lethal directed energy weapons for so-called “active denial” purposes to help disperse mobs and rioters. Microwave “ pain rays ” and high-powered “ audio spotlights ,” among other technologies , have already proven controversial specifically because of the potential inconsistency of the effects, which many worry could lead to lasting injuries . The video below shows a public test of the U.S. military’s Active Denial System, a microwave less-than-lethal directed energy weapon. While Chinese authorities might not be as concerned about inadvertently harming someone , they are undoubtedly interested in weapons that do what they’re supposed to do reliability. You don’t want to hit someone with a laser set to “stun” and have them burst into flames. The weapon would also need to be able to generate sufficient power to create a useful effect at longer ranges without burning up itself. “To make this work, you need a serious battery pack, some even more serious capacitors, optics that can take all this without turning back into sand at these energy densities, and rugged enough that you can treat this like military hardware,” Phil Broughton, who works on radiation safety at the University of California at Berkeley and holds a certification from the Board of Laser Safety, told C4ISRNET . “This is a ‘best case scenario operation only’ weapon if there ever was one.” Broughton also noted that if the weapon is as small as Xi’an claims it is and has the capabilities the institute says it does, if it were to fail, it could be just as hazardous to the operator as any potential opponent. But it’s also not clear whether the researchers, or any other arm of the Chinese government, are even really claiming that the ZKZM-500 can achieve these effects in its present, officially “non-lethal” form or whether those capabilities are potential goals for future developments. According to the South China Morning Post , the Public Service Platform for National Civil-Military Integration, a website that exists to foster cooperation between the military and commercial sectors, hosted a document with additional information about the weapon. Its contents sound very much like a wishlist of potential effects. Chinese’s People’s Armed Police behind a mobile barricade in Urumqi, the capital of the restive Xinjiang province, in 2013. , AP Photo/Kyodo News The weapon could help disperse illegal protests by igniting banners, causing unbearable pain, or even setting people on fire so that they lose “the rhythms of their speech and powers of persuasion,” the review reportedly suggests. In a hostage situation, you could try to fire a laser beam through a window from a safe position to try and set the criminals alight. In addition, the paper said the unnamed researchers at Xi’an acknowledged themselves that a single two-second burst from the weapon wouldn’t be enough to create any lasting damage or kill someone. The clear implication here is that the laser could cut through a person “like a surgical knife,” but only if they were content to stand in one particular spot for a protracted period of time. That’s not to say that the ZKZM-500 might not indicate that the Chinese military or internal security forces are very interested in developing some sort of more multi-purpose or combat-capable laser rifle. What the researchers at Xi’an seem to have created at the moment is a new hand-held laser dazzler that might be able to do more damage if the user can hold it on target for an extended period of time, though. And depending on just how useful the ZKZM-500 is in reality, we could soon see it in action in China’s Xinjiang province, which the country has already been increasingly clamping down on dissent and unrest among the Turkic Islamic Uighur minority group at near-dystopian levels . From what we know about the laser’s likely capabilities, it seems to fit in well with the Chinese government’s draconian security presence in this region. It could also offer another means of discreetly harassing American and other foreign military forces in areas, such as the South China Sea , where China is looking to expand its influence and outright control. Thankfully, a future in which Chinese troops are carrying “laser assault rifles” that can realistically burn through targets, human or otherwise, from a half a mile away still seems to be a ways away.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran is now claiming that the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration Ready Reserve Force’s roll-on, roll-off cargo ship that removed Syria’s declared chemical weapons stock is now deploying chemical weapons to the Persian Gulf. Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi, a spokesman for the General Staff of the Iranian military, said that MV Cape Ray was escorted into the Persian Gulf by a U.S. destroyer and that it is now anchored in the region and carrying chemical agents. The general claims that the ship was present in Syria and Iraq when American forces retaliated in response chemical weapons use and that the Iranian government will disclose information about the ship’s manifest and its mission in the near future, stating : “Records of the US Cape Ray ship show that it has been in areas like Iraq and Syria where the Americans have launched war under the pretext of fight against chemical weapons use… After sustaining repeated failures in different fronts against the resistance, the Americans have now resorted to dangerous methods to continue presence in Iraq and Syria to justify their illegitimate presence in the region.” Over a five-month period back in 2014, Cape Ray was outfitted to handle the removal and destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles. It was the first time such an operation was executed aboard a vessel and its crew garnered high praise for quickly accomplishing the complex and dangerous mission. A tech works on the Field Deployable Hydrolysis System aboard Cape Ray prior to heading to Syria for its chemical weapons disposal tasking., USN Some 600 tons of chemical agents were destroyed by the ship and its complement over a matter of weeks, far faster than originally predicted. In recent days the vessel has been in the Persian Gulf and just last week it took part in a logistics exercise in Kuwait. We don’t know for absolute certain if the ship is sailing with a chemical weapons destruction outfit like it had in 2014 or not, but the idea that it is carrying an illicit stockpile of WMDs to use for false flag operations is ridiculous. The whole narrative Iran is pushing here is opportunistic and seemingly completely unfounded. Yes, the ship worked to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile four years ago, and yes it travels between the Mediterranean and the Missile East like so many American naval vessels do. Yet going from there to claiming it’s a conveyor of clandestine chemical weapons to be used for covert operations in order to start military conflicts is bonkers, even for Iran. In fact, there aren’t any indications that the ship is even outfitted with a chemical weapons destruction capability anymore. Remember, this is primarily a cargo ship that took on the chemical weapons disposal mission temporarily due to availability and platform compatibility. Recent pictures from exercise Nautical Horizon show it unloading vehicles and supplies onto a barge. Its top deck is stripped of the missionized canisters that were installed on it during its time as a chemical weapons disposal platform, as well. In other words, it looks like it’s back to roll-on, roll-off cargo duty for the Cape Ray . USN The relationship between Washington, D.C. and Tehran has spun deeper into the abyss as of late after the Trump administration unilaterally pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement. So it’s not too much of a surprise to see rhetoric increase in severity, but the veracity of this claim is especially suspect. We’ll have to wait and see what ‘evidence’ Tehran puts forward to support its accusations. It will most likely be circumstantial and based on loose connections between the ship’s position and handpicked events if anything is presented at all.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with the Department of Energyâ€™s National Nuclear Security Administration, has completed the first end-to-end qualification flight tests of the new B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb on the B-2 bomber. This milestone comes amid continued concerns about the weaponâ€™s cost , including the recent announcement that the Pentagonâ€™s top internal watchdog has started its own audit of the program. On June 29, 2018, the National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, revealed the two successful test flights in an official press release. A B-2A Spirit stealth bomber from the Air Forceâ€™s 419th Test and Evaluation Squadron, situated at Edwards Air Force Base in California, had dropped the weapons, which did not carry live nuclear warheads, on the Tonopah Test Range on June 9, 2018. â€œThese qualification flight tests demonstrate the B61-12 design meets system requirements and illustrate the continued progress of the B61-12 life extension program to meet national security requirementsâ€ U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Michael Lutton, NNSAâ€™s Principal Assistant Deputy Administrator for Military Application, said in a statement. â€œThe achievement is also a testament to the dedication of our workforce and the enduring partnership between NNSA and the U.S. Air Force.â€ The â€œend-to-endâ€ tests were meant to demonstrate the ability of crews in the air and on the ground to go through the same procedures and sequence of actions with the new bombs that they would during an actual mission. The first test drop of the complete B61-12 â€œshape,â€ simply to help validate its basic performance, had occurred in 2015 . A B61-12 test “shape” on an F-15E Strike Eagle during an earlier test flight., DOD The B61-12, also known as the B61 Mod 12, is a cooperative effort between the Air Force and NNSA. The former is responsible for procuring the Boeing-designed GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS)-directed tail kit, while the latter has been developing the bombâ€™s main assembly and integrating the actual nuclear warhead on live weapons. In addition to the moving fins on the tail kit, the bombs also use rockets in the main body to spin-stabilize it in flight and improve its accuracy. The bombâ€™s exact capabilities remain highly classified. Existing reports indicate that each one will have a warhead with a maximum yield of approximately 50 kilotons. It seems almost certain that the B61-12 will have what is known as a â€œdial-a-yieldâ€ capability, which can limit the extent of the nuclear reaction inside the warhead and, as a result, the explosive force of the detonation. between 2003 (first chart) and 2014 (second chart) @nukestrat shifted to ""yes"" for ENDS on B61-4. Ping @AtomicAnalyst for when installed? pic.twitter.com/Ospr7TgLDS — Martin â€œDoomsdayâ€ Pfeiffer ğŸ³ï¸â€ğŸŒˆ (@NuclearAnthro) June 14, 2017 The remaining existing versions of the B61 versions, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature , have this functionality to differing degrees, according to publicly available information. Personnel can reportedly set some of them to yields as low as 0.3 kilotons, which is exponentially less powerful than the bombs the United States dropped on Japan in 1945. The need for this feature will be essential since the U.S. military expects the B61-12 to replace all existing versions â€“ B61-3, -4, -7, and -11 â€“ in the active stockpile. At present, the goal is for the new bombs, which the U.S. military and the Department of Energy have been developing since at least 2011, to begin entering service in 2020. An older B61 bomb “shape” in a museum., Dave Bezaire via Flickr The full stockpile of approximately 400 bombs is supposed to be combat ready by 2025. The B-2A, along with various dual-purpose combat jets, such as the F-16C/D Viper and F-15E Strike Eagle, will be able to carry these weapons. The Air Force plans to integrate the B61-12 on the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and B-21 Raider bomber in the future, too. To adequately supplant the B61-11 bunker buster variant, the new bombs will also need features that allow it to strike at deeply buried targets. It remains unclear how this would necessarily work since NNSA is remanufacturing older B61-4 bombs to serve as the basis for the new weapons and these lack any sort of specialized, penetrating capabilities. A chart showing how NNSA plans to remanufacture older B61 bombs into the new B61-12. Of particular note, the new variant will have the same warhead and other major internal components as the existing B61-4., Hans Kristensen/FAS In 2014, former U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz, while speaking at an event at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, D.C., suggested that the guidance package on the B61-12 would make it easier to focus the blast onto a hardened target deep underground. It is possible that the Pentagon has decided that the new bombâ€™s dial-a-yield feature, combined with the tail kit, offer both sufficient yield and accuracy to obviate the need for a dedicated bunker buster. Before developing the B61-11, the U.S. military had relied on larger weapons to achieve the desired effects and had also explored simply using the older B83-1 instead. The U.S. military has made it clear that it will still need both of those weapons until the B61-12 enters service. â€œThe B83-1 and B61-11 gravity bombs can hold at risk a variety of protected targets,â€ according to the latest Nuclear Posture Review , which the Pentagon published in February 2018. â€œAs a result, both will be retained in the stockpile, at least until there is sufficient confidence in the B61-12 gravity bomb that will be available in 2020.â€ But while the U.S. military insists that the B61-12 offers superior capabilities compared to the existing bombs and will allow it to consolidate its inventory of B61 bombs, the project has proven to be time-consuming and very costly. On June 28, 2018, a day before NNSA announced the successful test flights, the Department of Defenseâ€™s Office of Inspector General announced it was reviewing the price and management of the tail kit portion of the program. A B83 bomb “shape.”, DOD â€œOur objective is to determine whether the Air Force is developing the B61-12 Tail Kit Assembly within cost, schedule, and performance requirements,â€ the office said in an associated press release. â€œWe will consider suggestions from management on additional or revised objectives.â€ This is hardly the first time a U.S. government agency has taken a look into the program, either. In May 2018, the Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, released its own review of the project. â€œThe program substantially met best practices for ensuring the estimate was comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible,â€ that report said in its executive summary. But while â€œGAO is making no new recommendations but discusses a prior recommendation that NNSA document and justify decisions regarding independent cost estimates,â€ the assessment added. GAO noted that two offices within NNSA itself â€“ the one in charge of the B61-12 project and another one independent of that effort â€“ had come up with two differing cost estimates for the program. The congressional investigators had come to their own conclusions about the final price point, too. â€œGAO recommended in a January 2018 report that NNSA document and justify such decisions, in part because GAOâ€™s prior work has shown that independent cost estimates historically are higher than programsâ€™ cost estimates because the team conducting the independent estimate is more objective and less prone to accept optimistic assumptions,â€ the May 2018 report said. â€œIn response to the January 2018 report, NNSA agreed to establish a protocol to document management decisions on significant variances between program and independent cost estimates, but it has not yet provided evidence that it has done so.â€ Providing an accurate scope of the costs for both the bomb and the tail kit, which are managed and therefore budgeted for separately, has been a major source of controversy from the beginning. Just between 2011 and 2012, NNSAâ€™s estimate of the programâ€™s price tag grew from $4 billion to $10 billion , which did not include the cost of the tail kit and various other ancillary components. This prompted criticism both within sectors of the U.S. government and among advocacy groups. In 2012, the non-profit Ploughshares Fund , among others , noted that this revised cost split among the 400 700-pound nuclear bombs meant that each one would literally be worth more than its weight in gold . At the current price of gold at the time of writing, each one of the B61-12s could actually be worth nearly twice as much per pound. A graphic showing the impressive consolidation in the total types of nuclear weapons the United States has in service since the 1950s. The number and type of gravity bombs in the stockpile especially have dropped significantly. , NNSA The announcement of the successful test flights seem to be, at least in part, an effort to show the B61-12 program is moving forward and doing so on schedule. GAOâ€™s May 2018 report specifically calls out â€œrisksâ€ with the â€œaggressive flight test schedule for bomb delivery aircraftâ€ as a continued area for potential cost growth and schedule delays. A significant increase in cost could magnify existing criticisms, as well as questions about whether or not B61s of any kind still have a place in the U.S. militaryâ€™s over-arching nuclear modernization plans . The Nuclear Posture Review argues that the gravity bombs, despite their low-yield settings, do nothing to deter potential opponents, primarily Russia, from engaging in a limited nuclear confrontation. Though this basic premise is highly debatable , under this logic, the utility of the gravity bombs becomes particularly questionable. The U.S. military has deemed the B-52H bomber too vulnerable to deliver nuclear gravity bombs in a future conflict and is rapidly approaching that conclusion, right or wrong , with regards to dual-use combat jets.Â The video below shows a B-52 launching an AGM-86B nuclear capable air-launched cruise missile, the only nuclear weapon it is presently qualified to carry. A number of NATO countries presently host stockpiles of older B61s, which they could use on their own aircraft during a crisis. However, concerns about the survivability of older fourth generation multi-role fighter jets in a future high-end conflict and technical limitations have raised concerns about whether any members of the alliance will be able to effectively employ the bombs if they do not decide to buy F-35s.Â As of 2014, the U.S. government had admitted that existing nuclear-qualified F-16 Viper and Panavia Tornado jets in use with various NATO members could be able to carry the B61-12, but would not have the necessary systems to “talk” to its guidance package, effectively limiting it to being a “dumb” bomb, according to the Federation of American Scientists . On top of that, the burden sharing agreement could simply collapse if participating alliance members have to retire those aircraft in the near future without having qualified any new jets to carry the weapons at all. In addition, the U.S. Air Force is developing a new nuclear-capable cruise missile for both B-2 and the B-52 bombers, which could further reduce the need for nuclear gravity bombs. Of course, itâ€™s important to note that the B-2, or the future B-21 stealth bomber, will be able to carry more B61-12s and therefore be able to strike more individual targets in a single sortie. The bombers, as well as any smaller jets carrying the bombs, would also have significantly greater flexibility to shift targets or abort their strikes entirely, even very late in the mission, compared to missile-armed planes or sea- or ground-launched cruise or ballistic missiles . Whether or not this, taken together with the increasingly complicated issue of how the bombs fit into NATOâ€™s plans and how they fit with the rest of the U.S. government’s planned nuclear buildup , justifies the cost is still up for debate . An official diagram showing a test loadout of a Tornado combat jet to determine whether or not it could simply carry the B61-12 bomb, Germany and Italy both presently employ this aircraft as nuclear-capable delivery platforms using American B61s., Sandia National Laboratories Given how expensive the B61-12 program has turned out to be already, it’s worth asking if the U.S. military missed out on an opportunity to develop an alternative delivery system instead. For example, a shorter-range nuclear-capable cruise missile with low-observable features, such a variant of the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), which recently gained a significant amount of public attention after its use in U.S.-led strikes against Syrian chemical weapons sites, might have offered an entirely new set of capabilities to the mix. A stealthy, stand-off weapon could also have helped keep older, fourth-generation combat jets more viable as delivery platforms in the face of increasing capable air defense threats at least in the near term.Â There is also a separate concern about whether the improved capabilities of the B61-12 will make it more “ usable ” and, in turn, increase the possibility of a nuclear conflict. It is always important to note that the United States does not have a â€œno first useâ€ policy, which means it reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in retaliation for non-nuclear actions in certain circumstances, something we at the War Zone have explored in detail in the past . “This is a certain qualitative leap, if earlier the US had free-fall bombs, this bomb is guided, it has much more accuracy,” retired Russian General Viktor Yesin, who had served as head of Russia’s Strategic Rocket Forces, told Russia’s Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper, according to an interview it published on July 2, 2018 in response to news of the latest tests. Yesin specifically cited reports that the B61-12 could release less radioactive fallout and therefore reduce the immediate death and destruction from its employment, as the basis for his concerns that this “high-precision nuclear bomb” could lower the threshold for its use. In the meantime, however, the Air Force and NNSA appear to be pushing ahead with the B61-12 program in order to meet their goal of having the first bombs completed in 2020. How many weapons ultimately enter service and which aircraft will be able to carry them in some future contingency remains to be seen.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 1, 2018",Azerbaijani Reporter Gets Way Too Close To Low Flying Hind Attack Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There’s a certain type of filming style that has come out of Russia in which a host or reporter covering a military topic is filmed with all types of action going on around them as they stoically deliver their copy. It has a hint of Top Gear and a hint of Michael Bay , but it is definitely a unique style. Apparently, this production method is popular in Azerbaijan, too. Certainly, we know the country has a flair for packaging its defense capabilities creatively on video , but in this case, the host may have gotten a bit more than she bargained for in an attempt to frame the perfect shot. Yet amazingly, she never flinched, even as a Hind attack helicopter gets too close for comfort as it rips by. https://youtube.com/watch?v=80PuPQDppUs Helicopters pack their own mini-hurricanes and that’s especially true for powerful and heavy attack helicopters. Even one taxiing very close by can attempt to blow you over and they spray pebbles and debris in every direction. For instance, one time, an Apache taxied by just as I was crouching along a taxiway and a pebble broke the front protective element of a Canon ‘L’ lens on my camera. So you can imagine what it would do to an unprotected eye. But when a helo is flying very low and maneuvering you have rotors and a tail rotor quickly shifting angles to worry about, as well. One nick from either of those and you are probably done for. There’s also an airframe that weighs many thousands of pounds and is packed full of gas and even high-explosives to contend with as well. With all of this in mind, this probably wasn’t the safest video shoot, but the camera does lie a bit when it comes to distance due to depth of field compression, making things look a little closer than they actually were. Still, it was way too close. Azerbaijan has roughly a dozen and a half Mi-35Ms in active service. It is a modern export variant of the Mi-24 Hind and is capable of night attack operations. 24 of the type were ordered from Russia around 2010 with a number of them being rebuilt Mi-24s. A smaller number of less capable Mi-24s also serve in the country’s air arm. Although Azerbaijan’s Mi-24/Mi-35 fleet, along with about a dozen Su-25 Frogfoots, are the most capable close air support platforms in the country’s inventory, their Mi-17 Hip cadre that is roughly three times the size of the Hind force can also provide this functionality, albeit to a lesser degree.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 6, 2017",King Of Jordan Wields Unique Firearms During Son’s Birthday Shooting Drill,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. King Abdullah II of Jordan portrays himself very much as a warrior monarch and has a deep background in special operations and helicopter flying. To this day, the 56-year-old ruler of the Hashemite Kingdom does regular drills with commandos from the country’s sprawling special operations apparatus and sometimes we get to see him in action. Such was the case this week when a video appeared online showing the King and the Crown Prince of Jordan practicing close-quarter combat (CQC) VIP protection drills , with the king wielding some unique firepower. Queen Rania Al Abdullah posted the video of father and son on Facebook to celebrate her son’s 24th Birthday. The caption reads: “Happy birthday Al Hussein, we grow more proud of you every day… I see so much of His Majesty in you, including your shared love for the military – Taken during the conclusion of a recent round of live-fire training exercises.” The Crown Prince is a Lieutenant in the Jordan’s Armed Forces and has followed his dad’s footsteps when it comes to mastering special operations skills and the art of flying helicopters. Just last month he made his first solo rotary-wing flight, which resulted in a ‘Gatorade bucket’ celebratory treatment: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Al Hussein bin Abdullah II (@alhusseinjo) In the video, father and son can be seen jumping out of a Crown Victoria and moving through a live-fire course together. The video appears to be shot at the sprawling King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center, also referred to by the acronym KASOTC. The facility is the crown jewel in Jordan’s special operations crown and was built with the goal of putting the country at the center of the special operations world. You can read all about it in this past feature of mine . View this post on Instagram A post shared by Al Hussein bin Abdullah II (@alhusseinjo) During the pair’s advance through the course, it’s noticeable that the King’s weaponry is unique. His primary weapon is a Sig-Sauer MCX short-barreled rifle, an increasingly popular weapon that is among the most svelte and ergonomic AR-15 derivates available. It also features a gas piston configuration that is widely viewed as more robust and reliable than Eugene Stoner’s original direct impingement design. The King can also be seen using a 60 round Surefire magazine. This entire setup seems to have become his go-to loadout. Upon review of older videos, the same weapon appears multiple times and seems to be unique to the King and not standard issue. Abdullah’s sidearm is even more unique. First off it’s a single-action 1911, which is still favored by a number of special operators and elite police units. At first glance, I thought it was maybe a Wilson Combat custom or other high-end 1911, but when I tasked Twitter with finding out exactly what it was, the answer ended up being quite interesting. Video Screencap The pistol is a 1911 derivative called the JTK-1911 built by Jordanian Armament and Weapon Systems, or JAWS for short. JAWS has made a number of pistols in the past, including the single-action/double-action Viper , but not a 1911. Apparently, the JTK-1911 comes in at least two calibers, traditional .45 ACP and 9mm, and a number of configurations were presented at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) in Tampa , Florida last month, including the one with what appears to be a built-in compensator being used by King Abdullah. As you can see, this commander-length pistol has a bunch of features that have become common on the 1911 market, including a rail, low-profile fiber-optic sights, flared mag well, and a skeletonized hammer. But the small compensator is somewhat unique though. It also comes in a government size model and a compact model, albeit without the compensator. The move for JAWS to enter into a very crowded 1911 market is somewhat odd. Military and law enforcement units aren’t adopting the type in increasing numbers these days, with modern polymer-framed designs becoming far more popular . But still, having the king of your country and one of the most well known special operators in the world using your pistol during intensive training is quite the endorsement. We also don’t know how big a stake King Abdullah has in the pistol, as it could be something of a passion project for him in itself. Probably the biggest question is does Jordan plan on trying to export their 1911 line to the United States for sales in the domestic market. The 1911 remains a highly popular pistol type for American citizens and has a cult-like following among pro and amateur shooters alike. If that’s the case, this is great advertising. In the end, the King gets to use the weapons he wants, and those include a royal flight of S-70 helicopters he flies around in. So high-end compact rifles and special pistols built locally aren’t that big of a deal. But the question remains, is the JTK-1911 really fit for a king? We just don’t know at this point, but making a ‘better 1911’ is a big lift considering the off-the-shelf competition that already exists. Above all else, it’s interesting to see the Crown Prince following directly in his father’s footsteps. King Abdullah II was just a decade older than his son is today when he took over for his father King Hussein . Prince Hussein bin Abdullah has become a more visible player in the Jordanian Monarchy as of late, with him personally heading up the welcoming party for Prince William during his recent visit to Jordan. As you can see, both have a big interest in soccer and both are military men and helicopter pilots, although Prince William has more than a decade of experience on the young prince. Jordan faces some very serious security and economic challenges and is experiencing increased unrest among its populous. At the same time, the country, which does not benefit from large oil reserves like many of its neighbors, is seen as a pragmatic example of peaceful existence in the tumultuous Middle East. With decades of instability in Iraq to its east and the quagmire that is the Syrian civil war to its north, Jordan survives in a very tough neighborhood, and that isn’t likely to change anytime soon. You have to hand it to him, King Abdullah is a ‘lead from the front’ kind of guy who successfully acts as an honest broker for peace and stability while in a suit and a warrior monarch ready to defend his country while in fatigues. Jordan is an ally of the U.S. and Israel , and even though both countries have helped with military aid , Jordan could and should get more attention and support . The Jordanian government—and its security apparatus—have its issues but it remains a shining light in a very dark land. In the future, the warrior Crown Prince, like his father, will be tasked with keeping that light lit, and that will be no easy task.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 20, 2018",New Stealth Tanker Model Is Touted By Air Force Research Lab At Aviation Conference,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The need for more survivable tankers is becoming a pressing issue in the dawning age of anti-access and area-denial warfare. America has built the backbone of its air combat force around fuel-thirsty fighters that are addicted to tanker gas. In potential future conflicts, having existing airliner-based tankers approach within 500 or so miles of enemy targets will likely entail immense risk. Outfitting tankers with situational awareness-enhancing avionics and sensors, electronic warfare systems, and even kinetic-kill defensive systems and high-power lasers are ways to approach this problem. But shooting down incoming missiles as they approach with exotic close-in defenses or avoiding enemy threats altogether by running from them are hardly attractive solutions to this problem. Another more robust way is to field a stealthy tanker that can move far closer to target sets with 5th generation fighters and stealthy drones in tow. Such an aircraft could also benefit from the aforementioned systems as well, including kinetic-kill interceptors , making it even more survivable. You are unlikely to find a more thorough case for fielding such an aircraft than the one we published in 2017, which you can read here . Fast forward to over a year later and now the Air Force Research Lab is showing off a model of a somewhat familiar stealthy tanker-transport design without any real explanation. The model, which looks like a variation of Lockheed’s ‘Speed Agile’ concept, titled “Advanced Aerial Refueling” was noticed by Aviation Week’s Guy Norris in the Air Force Research Lab’s area at the 2018 AIAA Aviation forum that took place in Atlanta this week. According to Guy, this model also included a flying-wing UCAV being refueled off its boom. A year ago, another stealthy tanker-transport model was displayed by Lockheed at a similar trade show and forum. Clearly, models don’t necessarily mean anything definitive , but the appearance of this model now does point to an ongoing interest in the stealth tanker concept if not some kind of program to develop one. In a recent interview with leadership players within the USAF’s tanker community, one officer alluded to a more survivable tanker capability that may be on the horizon. That entire expose will be published on Monday, but I thought this was an interesting statement that I didn’t notice at the time of the interview, but will be following up on. And of course, a stealthy tanker transport could have more applications than just pumping gas closer to enemy territory than a traditional airliner-based alternative. We have heard some chatter that the USAF and Special Operations Command may have finally joined forces to develop a stealthy tanker-transport. Special Operations Command still relies on low-level penetration tactics to insert special operations teams deep into enemy territory, at least as far as we know. Beyond the stealthy Black Hawks used on the Bin Laden raid, which have limited range and still relied on low-level flying to accomplish their mission, along with reports of enhanced stealth helicopter designs that have followed, there is no other platform that can insert operators onto land over contested airspace. A stealthy transport that flies at jet speeds could provide such a capability. We detail all this in our big stealth tanker article , and it’s not as if the special operations community hasn’t been pining for such an aircraft for decades. Rumors regarding multiple black projects aimed at obtaining such a capability have existed over the decades, including one code-named ‘Senior Citizen’ that was supposed to provide a stealthy, short takeoff and landing transport, at least in an experimental capacity. Another initiative named Special Operations Forces Aircraft, or SOFTA, also was at least deeply studied in the late 1980s with Burt Rutan participating in the program . Since then, the Osprey has become operational and does provide an aircraft capable of VTOL operation and low-level penetration. But something that can provide a higher-flying and stealthy alternative that is capable of delivering larger payloads over longer ranges remains highly relevant. In fact, our own Joseph Trevithick wrote the following about a quiet 2009 initiative to field a stealthy special operations plane: By 2009, the Air Force’s commando headquarters had started looking at acquiring a stealthy transport plane to make infiltrating hostile areas a safer proposition. Dubbed “Project IX,” the proposed plane would have filled multiple “gaps and shortfalls” in existing aircraft such as the Combat Talon, according to the Air Force. … While the flying branch didn’t have a specific design in mind, it did have very clear requirements for what would be a brand-new plane. The aircraft’s primary missions would be sneaking commandos into defended territory, bringing them supplies if necessary and then getting them out safely — just like the MC-130H does. Crews would be able to do so regardless of the time of day, the temperature or the weather. The plane would even function under chemical, biological or nuclear attack. Most importantly, the new plane would take advantage of “low-observable” technology — in other words, it would be stealthy. A radar-evading shape would be central to the design. Like the Air Force’s upcoming B-21 bomber, the project would require the utmost secrecy. “There are lessons learned and precedents for such responsibility regarding other specialized aircraft (F-117, B-2, F-22, etc.),” the report explains. “Project IX will take full advantage of them.” Not surprisingly, the aircraft would get top-of-the-line communications equipment, powerful radars and video cameras and other special gear. The proposed crew of three — pilot, co-pilot and loadmaster — might grow in order to fly spy missions. A graphic in the report features nondescript black silhouettes to depict the Project IX planes in their larger context. No other art is present in the declassified portions of the document., USAF via FOIA The secret aircraft would also be loaded with electronic warfare gear to help it survive in the most intensive anti-access environments. This program seemed to go dark around the turn of the decade, but considering the Pentagon’s experience leveraging stealth technology during the raid against Bin Laden in Pakistan and the looming threat from peer competitors, it would be hard to believe that the idea just melted away fully. But regardless of what exactly is in the works and what remains just a concept, the USAF is becoming ever more focused on their tanker vulnerability problem . And that affliction will only get worse as enemy anti-access capabilities extend their reach and as the qualitative advantage that the U.S. has overwhelmingly enjoyed continues to erode . Since the U.S. will not invest in longer-ranged tactical air power, and especially in unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs)—at least not on a grand scale —the only other option will be to harden traditional tanker’s own defenses or build a tanker in such a way that can deny the enemy the ability to target and successfully engage it. We have reached out to the Air Force Research Laboratory yesterday for comment about the model and the stealth tanker initiative as a whole and are still waiting to hear back.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 22, 2018",The USMC’s F/A-18 Hornets Are Getting New Jamming-Resistant GPS Gear,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy, on behalf of the Marine Corps, is looking to add jam-resistant GPS antennas to more than a hundred of the latter service’s F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets . Given the increasingly real threat of a potential opponent, such as Russia or China , cutting off American forces from the navigation system, this could be an especially important upgrade for the aging jets, which the Marines expect to fly for at least another decade. On June 27, 2018, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced it was looking for defense contractors who could install the equipment on 120 F/A-18C/D aircraft in a notice on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps . If the project moves ahead as scheduled, the Navy hopes all of the modifications will be complete by September 2022. This is the same timeframe in which NAVAIR expects to upgrade the radars on some of the Marine jets, as well. NAVAIR is interested in an upgrade that would consist of antennas that are “equivalent or similar” to BAE Systems’ AS-4654/A Conformal Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (C-CRPA) and the Raytheon AS-4616/A Advanced Digital Antenna Production (ADAP) Antenna Electronics (AE). The Navy began installing the C-CRPA on top of the existing ADAP system on its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers in 2017. The C-CRPA is actually a unit containing seven distinct elements, which sits flush in the fuselage to reduce drag. Combined with the ADAP equipment, the system improves the ability of the aircraft to receive GPS signals despite any jamming and other electromagnetic interference. The plane’s GPS receiver itself remains unmodified. A US Marine Corps F/A-18C Hornet., USMC Though the NAVAIR notice refers the Marine F/A-18C/D aircraft, it appears the plan is to add the anti-jam capability to all 120 aircraft in the service’s active duty squadrons. This includes a number of even older A++ models, which first entered service in the 1980s, according to the Marine Corps’ official 2018 Aviation Plan. The service has another approximately 60 F/A-18A-D aircraft assigned to reserve and training units. There is no indication from the NAVAIR notice that these planes would be part of this particular upgrade plan. There is also a possibility that the Navy might intend to add some or all of these new antennas into the F/A-18A-D aircraft it is planning to retire and send to the Marine Corps in the coming years. The Navy announced that plan in March 2018 and hopes to have completed the transfers by the end of 2020, which would be almost two years ahead of when NAVAIR expects to have all the anti-jam equipment installed in the Marine jets. The updates will be important for whichever specific jets end up receiving them since the Marines expect to be flying so-called “Legacy Hornets” through at least 2030. The hope is by then there will be enough stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to take their place. A US Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighter flies in formation with a pair of the service’s F/A-18D Hornets., DOD Developmental and production issues with the F-35 have forced the Marines to push back the date for finally retiring the F/A-18A-Ds more than once . This is in many ways a self-manufactured situation since the service decided it transition straight from Hornets to Joint Strike Fighters without purchasing any other fighter jets, such as the Super Hornet, in the interim. So, in the meantime, the Marines’ Legacy Hornets will have to soldier on in the face of steadily increasing threats, including GPS jamming. And just in the last year, the need to operate in a potentially GPS-degraded environment has gone from a future concern to a very real issue . In August 2017, there were reports that Russian GPS spoofing was impeding naval traffic in the Black Sea . Two months later, there it appeared that Russian GPS jamming as part of the massive Zapad military maneuvers had caused disruptions in navigation services across Scandinavia . These developments have since morphed into more serious reports of unknown actors in Syria, likely Russia or Syrian government forces it supports, engaging in overtly hostile activity. In April 2018, there was a flurry of news regarding attempts to knock out the GPS links on some American drones flying over Syrian territory and threats to those or other electronic systems onboard AC-130 gunships operating in the region. Russia’s 1RL257E Krasukha-4 mobile electronic warfare system, one of many different such systems the Russian military has at its disposal., Vitaly Kuzmin “Right now in Syria, we’re in the most aggressive EW [electronic warfare] environment on the planet from our adversaries,” U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, said at the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Foundation’s 2018 GEOINT Symposium. “They’re testing us every day, knocking our communications down, disabling our AC-130s, etcetera.” Also in April 2018, there were reports that Chinese forces were actively engaged in similar tactics to dissuade or otherwise limit the ability of American forces to fly over the South China Sea . There has been evidence dating back to 2013 that China been interested in doing this as part of a broader anti-access strategy to prevent foreign militaries, especially the United States, from operating in the hotly contested region. This is the reality Marine aviators will increasingly find themselves in. The service’s Hornets already contribute, from bases on land and as part of U.S. Navy Carrier Air Wings, to operations in Iraq and Syria and in the Pacific . They could be called upon to deploy elsewhere, including in and around Europe , in a crisis, too. Without the added resistance to hostile GPS jamming, those aircraft could find themselves unable to adequately perform their assigned missions. For Carrier Air Wings especially, this could present a significant interoperability problem given that the Navy’s F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs already have the upgraded antennas. That service stopped flying its own Legacy Hornets off carrier decks in April 2018. A US Navy F/A-18C Hornet from the “Blue Blasters” of Strike Fighter Squadron Three Four (VFA-34), which became the last of the service’s units to fly Legacy Hornets from carriers operationally in April 2018., USN It’s very possible that other countries might be interested in adding the upgrades to their own Legacy Hornets, too. In particular, Finland, which has grown closer to Western Europe and NATO to the ire of Russia , and Australia, which faces the same potential threats from China in the Pacific, could see the anti-jamming equipment as equally essential for their jets. Australia might have retired its Legacy Hornets by the time these upgrades become widely available, though. Canada , Spain, Malaysia, and Switzerland also operate older F/A-18s and the former two countries are NATO members, as well. Any of those other Legacy Hornet operators could decide to add the improved antennas to a larger upgrade package. This could include a broader service life extension update, as well as a new “glass” cockpit and other improved missions systems , such as a new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and an improved electronic warfare suite. An AESA radar by itself would significantly improve the aircraft’s ability to detect and engage hostile aircraft more precisely and at longer ranges, something the Marines have already realized when it comes to their jets. This would also allow them to take advantage of increasingly longer-ranged air-to-air missiles. Of course, for the Marines, the lack of anti-jamming equipment, or any other updated mission system, might not be the biggest problem. The availability rate of the service’s F/A-18A-Ds continues to be exceptionally poor. Marines work on a Hornet onboard the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt in 2015., USN In February 2017, it emerged that nearly three-quarters of all Marine Legacy Hornets weren’t even airworthy at any one time on average. Just to get there , the service had raided the Bone Yard at Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and a museum for critical parts and even entire replacement aircraft. As of Jan. 1, 2018, the Marines had 100 out of approximately 270 aircraft “out of reporting” for heavy maintenance alone, according to their own annual Aviation Plan. Hopefully, the new anti-jam antennas, along with the other upgrades the Marine Corps is looking to add to its Legacy Hornets already and its plans to get entire newer jets from the Navy, reflect a larger push to revitalize the service’s increasingly neglected F/A-18 community. By the end of 2022, the Marines may be flying a ‘Super’ Legacy Hornet that is the most capable of its type to date.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 6, 2018",Air Force Says It Might Have The Data It Needs From Its Light Attack Experiment After All,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has suspended its light attack experiment , also known as OA-X, indefinitely following the fatal crash of an A-29 Super Tucano aircraft taking part in the project near Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. The service now says it could have enough data to end the evaluations early, but this only raises renewed questions about why this round of tests was necessary in the first place . The OA-X tests have been on hold since the mishap on June 22, 2018, which killed U.S. Naval Reserve aviator Lieutenant Christopher Casey Short. This second phase of the project began on May 7, 2018, and followed an initial round of tests that occurred at Holloman in August 2017. Embracer and Sierra Nevada Corporation’s A-29 and Textron’s AT-6C Wolverine are the only two aircraft the Air Force is evaluating at this time, though this might change in the future. “The experiment team is currently reviewing the data collected from the current phase of experimentation, as well as last year’s experiment activities, to determine the way ahead,” a U.S. Air Force spokesperson told FlightGlobal on June 28, 2018. “The forecast for return to flight operations for the experiment is still to be determined.” Earlier that same day, U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, which is in charge of the OA-X effort, made similar comments at a defense writers group breakfast. He also declined to offer any additional details about the accident, which remains under investigation. Gen. Holmes, commander of Air Combat Command, confirms that @usairforce ’s light attack experiment has been “suspended” after last week’s A-29 crash. He won’t say when/whether the experiment will resume. USAF is “working through” whether they got the data they need. @ACC_Commander — Lara Seligman (@laraseligman) June 28, 2018 The second part of the OA-X project was supposed to wrap up in July 2018. We don’t know how many specific test points the A-29 and AT-6C still had to cover in this phase. The Air Force has said it could award a contract as early as some time in 2019 for a light attack aircraft based at least in part on the outcome of the experiment. It remains unclear whether the service intends to pick from the two types it is evaluating now or start an all-new competition open to any company using requirements it has developed during the OA-X tests. However, as we at The War Zone have noted repeatedly , there are many questions about how committed the Air Force is to OA-X or the idea of acquiring a light attack aircraft in general. Since 2007, various branches of the U.S. military have evaluated the A-29, the AT-6C, or both aircraft in the light attack role on no less than six separate occasions , including the 2017 tests at Holloman. It remains hard to understand how there was not enough existing information about the two aircraft and their capabilities both inside the Air Force itself and from its sister services after more than a decade of experimentation with the aircraft. On top of that, the service already flies A-29s in order to train foreign pilots on the type and it operates an unarmed version of the T-6 in a basic training capacity. https://youtube.com/watch?v=DEkFquTDsPI Yet, after the Air Force concluded that first round of OA-X flights, it insisted that it still needed to collect additional data on the capabilities of the two planes. At the same time, the serviced canceled plans for an actual combat field test that could have occurred in Iraq. In 2015, U.S. Special Operations Command sent a pair of heavily modified OV-10G Bronco light attack aircraft to fly real-world missions in that country as part of a previous project that led in part to OA-X. “Rather than do a combat demonstration, we have decided to work closely with industry to experiment with maintenance, data networking and sensors with the two most promising light attack aircraft – the AT-6 Wolverine and the A-29 Super Tucano,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in February 2018. “This will let us gather the data needed for a rapid procurement.” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, in black under the umbrella, during the first round of OA-X tests in 2017., USAF If the Air Force goes ahead and shuts the second phase of OA-X down without completing the full slate of tests, but then proceeds with a plan to purchase any number of light attack aircraft, it can only call into question the necessity of this extended evaluation in the first place. If the service puts its supposed light attack ambitions on hold entirely, it would reinforce existing evidence that it was, at best, ambivalent about the concept from the beginning. The third possibility is that the tests resume at some point in the future, which could delay the entire project. To be fair, the Air Force has been increasingly supportive of the project. They are also facing growing pressure from OA-X’s supporters in Congress, who added millions of dollars into the Fiscal Year 2017 defense budget for light attack aircraft and are looking to put even more money into the spending package for the next fiscal cycle. “We’re certainly very sad about the loss of Lieutenant Chris Short, a great aviator that was dedicated to trying to find out what the answers were about [if] can we use this airplane in some circumstances to free up out more sophisticated fighters,” Holmes added at the roundtable on June 28, 2018. “Whenever you’re trying something new, there are risks of trying  something new and working through it, and without knowing exactly what  happened, and certainly without trying to insinuate exactly what  happened – aviation’s not necessarily risky, but it’s unforgiving.” U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command., USAF But for all their public pronouncements, the service continues to largely deflect from answering questions about how many aircraft it might buy , when they might enter service , and what role it sees light attack aircraft playing in its future force structure broadly. The major risk in not having these questions answered sooner rather than later is that any aircraft the Air Force does end up buying might end up without a clear mission and subsequently orphaned within the service. This happened to the C-27J Spartan light airlifter, which quickly ended up horse traded to other military branches and U.S. government agencies. Instead, the Air Force has focused heavily on plans to make any future program a multi-national effort with smaller American allies and partners who could make good use of a relatively simpler combat aircraft. This logic is both questionable and confusing since the U.S. military has already facilitated the delivery of dozens of A-29s , as well as various other light attack aircraft , to various countries. How the Air Force ultimately decides to proceed in the aftermath of the June 2018 crash at Holloman might finally force the service to fully explain its plan to procure a fleet of light attack aircraft and any associated timeline for doing so. We will definitely keep a close eye on how this situation continues to develop. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Procurement"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It never ceases to amaze just how extensive the research and testing infrastructure is that supports America’s vast military-industrial machine. From radar cross-section measurement facilities that look right out of science fiction, to secret and not so secret testing airfields, to huge anechoic chambers , to a submarine test center on an Idaho lake , these facilities and many more like them, turn weapons dreams into battlefield reality. When it comes to testing missile and missile countermeasure technology, which encompasses critical capabilities essential to national security, validating such systems’ effectiveness under many circumstances is essential. Everything from full-scale aerial targets (FSATs) to a massive soundstage-like structure that simulates missile seeker endgame performance in slow motion, exist for this purpose. And now we know of yet another elaborate testing facility related to anti-air missiles and countermeasures, one that sends helicopters careening between mountaintops along a wire as missiles attack from multiple directions. Dubbed the Aerial Cable Range, this facility is part of the sprawling White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) located in New Mexico. Managed by Lockheed Martin, the unique installation allows for simulated attacks on helicopters by anti-aircraft missile systems and other projectiles, but mainly the site is used for man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) testing and testing of countermeasure systems that aim to repulse attacks from such weapons. WSMR/US ARMY The Army describes the ACR as such: The Aerial Cable Range (ACR) is a Tri-Service facility and has conducted tests for all armed forces. NATO customers have also been accommodated to service their needs. The facility provides a wide variety of testing which includes: Missile firings, Red and Blue types of Surface to Air (SAM) and Air to Air (ATA) Signature measurements (IR, UV, and Radar) Submunition Drops Antenna Development Ground fire characterization Aircraft characterization Electronic Warfare Countermeasure tests The ACR target can be stationary or dynamic. Dynamic gravity rolls of targets up to 120 knots and rocket-boosted rolls up to 240 knots can be accommodated. The ACR can position targets anywhere along the cable and have the targets rotated in 5 degree increments for different aspects. Depending on the target weight and size, targets can be lifted from ground level to a maximum of 1000 feet AGL. Onboard video links, timing, GPS, remote control via Labview, modems, and wireless LANS can be accommodated. The ACR is capable of high repeatability of test scenarios, target velocity, position, and control. Multiple launches are possible, as well as dual firings with any desired time separation. The ACR main features are: its 2.5 inch Kevlar able with 500,000 lbs breaking strength, 15,500 ft horizontal span and 2,500 ft vertical rop, operating tensions from less than 20,000 to 150,000 lbs, and 20,000 lb lift capability. There are no alternatives to this type of high-risk testing. The ACR provides flexible, devoted, and economic test services. AFMC A Department of Defense article gives an even broader view of what the facility is capable of and its mission: The range tests warning systems that alert military pilots to inbound enemy missiles. It consists of a synthetic cable three miles long, 2.5 inches thick, stretched between two mountain peaks; test platforms and targets that move along the cable; a control system to put the target in the right place at the right time, and a computer to collect and analyze data. Controllers can present moving or static targets. “The major advantages of this system are that it provides low-cost testing, precise data and quick turnaround times between tests,” facility manager George Huffman said. The alternative, he said, is overwater testing with drones. “But drones can test only one system, one time, and that’s expensive, whereas we can conduct 200 to 300 tests a year and use the target platform over and over again, at a cost of about $11,000 per day.” Lockheed spent $30 million to build the range, first used in 1994. Huffman said it saves DoD $80 million to $90 million a year over more expensive testing methods. Aerial cable targets typically are no-longer-used Apache and other model helicopters the range receives for the cost of shipping from the aerospace vehicle excess storage area at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz. Weapons testers place experimental warning systems on the helicopter body, which are wired to computers in a carrier that attaches the helicopter to the aerial cable. Once all the experiments are on board the target platform, operators activate the cable system, which works like a ski lift, slowly moving the platform up toward 8,460-foot Jin Peak. Fixed and mobile instruments prepare to capture data from the target from positions on the mountainside, in the valley and aboard the target. Testers can fire missiles from any of 10 sites a kilometer apart, stretching down the length of the mountain valley. When everyone is ready, operators in the range control center send a signal to the cable-borne computer to launch the target and to missile launchers to fire away. Moving at speeds up to 250 knots, the cable propels the target forward until it reaches the predetermined juncture between target and missile. The missile impacts — and target debris drops to the desert floor. Within 30 minutes, crews recover the debris, keeping the fragile desert environment clean, while already the computers churn out data, and the cable is ready for the next experiments. “Everything about this system is extremely simple,” site manager Howard Waldie said. “It allows us to easily integrate projects, and tests can be accurately and easily repeated as often as necessary. AFMC With the MANPADS threat having exploded over the last two decades, this facility is more important now than ever. Additionally, these days it is not just about countering shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles with traditional decoy flares. BOL-IR expendables and especially directed-energy (laser) countermeasure systems have provided a more dynamic counter to even the most modern MANPADS. AFMC But all these systems have to be tested both inside and outside of a lab—you can read much more about that testing here —and the Aerial Cable Range allows the latter to happen with economic efficiency and without putting lives in danger. A whole new set of missile countermeasures are on the horizon that could bring a ton of work to the Aerial Cable Range. These include high-power laser defenses and even short-range kinetic kill systems . The range supports testing not just aimed at defending allied helicopters from missile attacks but also at how to better kill enemy helicopters and low-flying aircraft. The FIM-92 Stinger remains America’s MANPADS of choice and close-in point air defense is becoming a major priority for the Army and Marines due to the rise of small but deadly drones and the increased possibility of peer-state warfare without the benefit of assured air superiority. The Stinger has been upgraded over the years and operator training is now done in elaborate domed simulators to help ensure proper application during actual combat. But America’s potential enemies are also fielding advanced countermeasure systems, such as Russia’s President-S system which is now popping up on Russian helicopters operating in Syria and on export variants. Even Russia’s newest fighter, the Su-57, is equipped with a laser countermeasure system, the first of its kind for a fighter jet. With all this in mind, building a better missile that can’t be fooled by the latest expendable countermeasures and directed energy light beams is absolutely essential. Being able to launch these missiles during testing at surrogate airframes equipped with advanced countermeasure systems and seeing how the missiles react is critical to keeping them relevant and effective on the modern battlefield. The ACR provides this unique capability. So there you have it, White Sands Missile Range’s Aerial Cable Range, another obscure but essential testing facility in America’s massive weapons research and development infrastructure portfolio.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",U.S. Special Operators Want Propaganda Leaflets That Talk And Might Even Listen Back,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a far-off conflict zone, a U.S. military plane flies overhead, releasing leaflets imploring militants to abandon their cause and warning civilians to avoid certain areas that may come under attack. Individuals below catch the notes and turn them over in their hands when, suddenly, the sheets begin to speak to them. This may sound like the opening scene in a near-future, sci-fi war movie, but it’s an actual project that U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has been working on, according to a report from Defense One . They’ve even developed a prototype and are hoping to find a company who can improve on the design and have a product ready for a combat evaluation as soon as the end of 2018. The speaking leaflet is reportedly about the width of four typical sheets of paper that you’d find in your printer. Inside there are the electronics and speaker necessary to store and playback the message, along with solar-powered photovoltaic batteries. SOCOM won’t say whether it’s using graphene or some other advanced material, but the entire arrangement remains flexible and the goal is for the final product to be “printable” just like any other piece of paper. This would allow U.S. military psychological warfare specialists to quickly add traditional textual and graphical messages to a 4-by-6-inch writeable surface on the outside to go along with the recorded speech. This is the kind of leaflets that the U.S. military is dropping now., CENTCOM via The Washington Post There are a number of immediate benefits to this concept, the most important of which is getting around the issue of illiteracy in the target population. Text on a leaflet is worthless if the intended audience can’t read it. This is hardly a new issue. While the U.S. military has leaned heavily on planes dropping leaflets to quickly and cheaply spread propaganda or other informational messages across a desired area for decades, studies have repeatedly questioned how many people are actually reading them. In the past, American forces have gone so far as to drop notes that instruct individuals to tune into specific frequencies for propaganda radio broadcasts. A leaflet that U.S. forces dropped over Iraq in 2003, with a translated version on the left, listing radio frequencies broadcasting informational messages., DOD Graphical themes don’t always get the message across properly, either. In September 2017, the U.S. military had to publicly apologize for one leaflet it dropped in Afghanistan, which superimposed the Shahada , the profession of faith in Islam, in Arabic on a dog. Many Muslims see this animal as unclean and saw the combination of symbolism, which was meant to be a jab at the Taliban, who use the Shahada as their flag, as highly offensive. Audio messages can be a good alternative to printed leaflets, but it has historically been even harder to focus them in the right places. Aircraft with huge speakers are probably the most effective means of doing so in a way that people on the ground can’t ignore, but those planes also have to fly low- and slow-enough to broadcast clearly, making them vulnerable to hostile forces on the ground. Dropping cassettes, CDs, or other media, means an individual has to find an appropriate device to play the messages on. The aforementioned notes to tune into U.S.-government run radio stations also require some form of receiver. During the Vietnam War, the United States dropped physical radios into North Vietnam, but found out that locals, wary of state security forces finding them with a foreign luxury item, turned them in for rewards instead. A talking piece of paper doesn’t need a player and an individual who is amenable to the message can more readily conceal it from their comrades if necessary. If it’s pliable enough, the U.S. military might even be able to load them up into existing leaflet bombs , in addition to the other delivery method of simply pushing boxes out of the back of a plane or helicopter. Of course, there’s no guarantee a recorded message would be any more sensitive to cultural considerations than a paper leaflet. So, the U.S. military would still need to work hard to ensure that the content isn’t offensive. The United States is painfully aware that any propaganda message can be a double-edged sword if it comes off wrong. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, we’ve actually obtained a list of approved “themes” for leaflets and other broadcasts in Iraq and Syria as part of the American-backed campaign against ISIS terrorists, also known as ISIL and by their Arabic acronym Daesh. Censors completely redacted the section on “themes to avoid,” which is nearly twice as long. This is how we’re trying to sway individuals away from supporting ISIS in Iraq and Syria., CENTCOM via FOIA Depending on how small, loud, and innocuous the final product is, the U.S. government might also be able to employ it to conduct more active psychological warfare against small groups of terrorists or militants or even specific individuals. If they went unseen, the talking notes could play disconcerting sounds, bizarre messages, or other audio to unsettle or confuse opponents. They might, in turn, begin to question their own sanity or suspect some form of divine intervention. This was the exact goal behind the “ Screeming Meemies ,” a “psychoacoustic weapon” the U.S. Air Force tested during the Vietnam War. However, the service never conducted any field trials or operational missions with the large, air-dropped speaker boxes. The guts of an experimental “Screeming Meemie” psychological weapon., USAF via FOIA The system could have an intelligence gathering potential in the future, as well. According to Defense One, SOCOM is already working on a version that listens back, ostensibly to try and gain feedback about the effectiveness of the messages. But depending on the range of the transmitter and the capabilities of its microphone, this setup might allow U.S. military forces to discreetly listen in on enemy conversations. Combined with an unmanned aircraft, especially a small or low-observable type , American psychological warfare personnel could potentially insert these systems deep into otherwise denied areas, as well. This is something that might already be happening with conventional leaflets. In October 2016, Donald Cattell, a vice president at General Atomics, said that his company’s stealthy Avenger drone had dropped leaflets over Syria on at least one occasion. In 2017, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) also revealed that either Navy or Marine personnel, likely special operators in either case, had used the much smaller, shorter-range RQ-20 Puma to release paper messages in unspecified conflict zones. An official briefing slide from 2017 describing the various missions that RQ-20 Puma drones had conducted operationally., NAVAIR But turning the talking paper project from an experiment into an actual operational tool will be easier said than done. “One of the downsides of making something new… the first-time articles and prototypes are expensive,” Ryan Brown, a SOCOM acquisition official, told Defense One. Cost is a factor in almost any military program, but when it comes to leaflets, the issue is implicitly magnified exponentially. You’re not dropping one or two of the notes at a time. You may be releasing hundreds of thousands at a time to increase the chances that they’ll reach the intended audience. A single PDU-5/B leaflet dispenser can carry approximately up to 60,000 leaflets, depending on their size. For SOCOM’s project to be viable, it will have to find a company that can manufacture the flexible speaker systems in these quantities, but at a reasonable cost. Even if the unit price is just $1, a fully-loaded PDU-5/B would suddenly cost around as much a small guided missile, such as Javelin . PDU-5/B leaflet bombs under the wing of a B-52 bomber during a test., USAF Even if the system proves much more effective in encourage enemy fighters to desert or swaying civilians to be more supportive of America’s interests, the U.S. military might be hesitant to employ such a costly system with any regularity. This could easily push the talking paper into more niche roles, such as the aforementioned psychological manipulation and spying missions. Another possibility is that U.S. forces could mix regular leaflets with a small number of the more advanced systems together to try and keep costs low. One speaking sheet might be loud enough that a small group of people could listen at once. Whatever happens, it seems unlikely that the U.S. military will stop using existing paper messages any time soon. But finding a way to easily add audio to those missives could significantly improve their effectiveness.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 20, 2018",Last Night We Heard What It Sounds Like Just Before A B-52 Begins The End Of The World,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Late last night, a nuclear bomber exercise was underway off both of America’s seaboards. B-52Hs , B-2As , and E-6Bs headed out into the darkness to practice the apocalypse—a highly necessary training event in an era of great power competition (using the Pentagon’s own terminology). The exercise also acts as a glaring reminder to America’s enemies that its bombers are ready and able to deliver thermonuclear warheads around the globe. One of these flights, aptly titled DOOM 61, was orbiting out over the Pacific Ocean, off the Oregon and Washington coast. A radio and Boeing aircraft enthusiast was listening and recording its unencrypted communications, which included the read-back of a long alphanumeric Emergency Action Message code. You can listen to this audio here and linked in the tweet below. Emergency Action Messages, or EAMs for short, are a cornerstone of America’s nuclear command and control architecture. They direct nuclear forces to initiate pre-planned major and limited attack options. In popular culture, you may remember EAMs when they served as a major plot piece in the 1990s submarine blockbuster Crimson Tide. Probably the best display of these types of communications was in the awesome docu-film First Strike from the late 1970s You can fast forward to 5:30 and play from there, but the whole thing is really a must watch: EAMs can be broadcast via a number of radio bands. E-6B Mercury and E-4B Nightwatch strategic command and control aircraft have a battery of communications systems to connect with their nuclear forces, including everything from secure microwave satellite links to reeling out their miles long very-low-frequency antennas and cranking the aircraft into a pylon turn to align them vertically. This is a common method for contacting submarines deep below the waves. EAMs, and how they are conveyed, is all just part of the immense support infrastructure that has been built up at the cost of trillions of dollars since the advent of nuclear weapons. Elements of this massive apparatus range from elite underground bunkers for continuity of government operations , to making sure the best communications technology is available in the air , on the ground , at sea, and in space to reliably carry out a nuclear attack order should it ever come. A B-52H crew in action., USAF Without a proven and well exercised strategic command and control infrastructure in place, even a sprawling nuclear deterrent holds little value. In other words, in order for that deterrent to work, enemies need to know that the command and control infrastructure that controls the arsenal is totally reliable and can act with sudden efficiency . Hence the display of force and the radio transmissions from last evening. And this wasn’t that large of a drill, we have certainly seen far larger ones in recent months. But considering a single B-52H can let loose 20 nuclear-tipped AGM-86B cruise missiles, the size of the airborne force versus its destructive power is really a relative concept that’s tough to get your head around. If a real nuclear attack order had been given to an armed B-52 what would come next is a fairly straightforward process. Canadian news outlet CBC detailed exactly this in an interesting piece on the BUFF: “If the B-52 crews are ever sent on a mission with atomic weapons aboard and told that “This is not a drill…,” the final step before nuclear annihilation is disconcertingly simple. One switch unlocks a nuclear missile, a button releases it. However, there are fail-safes. In addition to the rare step of arming a plane with nuclear weapons in the first place, special codes must be loaded before the aircraft leaves the ground. Once the target is in sight, every crew member onboard must press a “consent” button. If just one person doesn’t, the weapon won’t be launched.” And that, my friends, is how the B-52 can end the world as we know it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",U.S. Special Operators Eye Adding Suicide Drones To Their Stealthy Speedboats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Special Operations Command is interested in adding loitering munitions to some of the U.S. Navy’s stealthy special operations boats . The new weapons could give American special operators a new tool to strike at specific individuals and other relatively small, but important targets , in both low- and high-end conflicts, without necessarily having to actually go ashore. The Pentagon’s top special operations headquarters validated the requirement for what is formally called the Maritime Precision Engagement (MPE) program in March 2018, according to a briefing from the Special Operations Command’s Program Executive Office-Maritime given at the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference ( SOFIC ) in May 2018. The Navy is now conducting feasibility studies to see what it might take to add a loitering munitions capability to the Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) and Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH) boats specifically. “MPE is a family of standoff, loitering, man-in-the-loop weapon systems deployed on combatant craft,” according to the presentation. “[It is] capable of targeting individuals, groups, vehicles, high-value targets, and small oceangoing craft with low collateral damage.” The full MPE program will work to develop the necessary modifications to the boats, launch system, and the munitions themselves. The U.S. Navy SEALs almost exclusively use CCMs and CCHs, as well as smaller Combatant Craft Assaults (CCA), primarily to sneak ashore to conduct various missions and then exfiltrate the area afterward. You can read about them all in more detail in this past War Zone feature . A U.S. Navy CCM., USN The May 2018 briefing did not include any specific details about what kind of performance or other attributes Special Operations Command or the Navy are looking for in the new weapons they want to add to these boats. A sort of hybrid between a missile and a drone, a loitering munition is typically supposed to operate over a particular area while essentially conducting a surveillance and reconnaissance mission, but with the added ability to directly engage the enemy once it locates them. Since operators are flying these loitering munitions as they would any other drone, they get to see what it sees right up until it hits the target. One of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command’s CCHs. There are only two of these craft in service with a third under construction., USN This feature, known as a man-in-the-loop guidance system, improves accuracy by allowing the user to take control and shift the point of aim to better effect the target or account for the opponent’s movement at the very end of the weapon’s flight path. It also provides an option to abort the strike right at the last moment to avoid hitting incident civilians or if the target is no longer reachable. The briefing slide from the 2018 SOFIC gathering shows pictures of two notional weapons, Rafael’s Spike NLOS and the member of the UVision Hero family . The former missile is not generally considered a loitering munition since it doesn’t have an ability to flying around the battlefield for an extended amount of time, but it does have a man-in-the-loop capability. Both of these firms are based in Israel, which isn’t surprising as that country pioneered the use of both loitering munitions and man-in-the-loop targeting. An overview of the MPE program that Special Operations Command’s Program Executive Office-Maritime present at the 2018 SOFIC gathering., SOCOM The Hero, however, which UVision has brought to the U.S. market with the help of American defense contractor Raytheon , is very much a loitering design. The full series includes a range of capabilities from man-portable versions, such as the six and a half pound Hero-30 with its 30-minute endurance, to the more than 275-pound Hero-1250, which the company says is suitable for striking larger, strategic targets more than 120 miles away. The MPE programs’ focus on smaller targets, both on land and at sea, suggest that what Special Operations Command and the Navy have in mind and may be closer to the Hero-30 end of the spectrum. The weapons, along with their launch and fire control systems, will also have to fit onboard the relatively small, approximately 60-foot long CCMs or the significantly more advanced CCHs, which are only around 12 feet longer . https://youtube.com/watch?v=7ww1ZLN4ClI Any defense contractor will almost certainly have to integrate their launcher in such a way as to preserve as many of the boats’ low-observable characteristics as possible, too. This could require retractable turrets or small, flush-mounted vertical launching systems. UVision offers self-contained launch systems for the various Hero models that might work in a vertical launch configuration. But the Hero series is just one of a growing number of systems that could meet the MPE program’s requirements, whatever they turn out to be in the end. Though Spike NLOS isn’t a loitering munition, Rafael recently unveiled the Spike Firefly , which combines guidance and other components from the existing missile family with a vertical takeoff and landing drone. The system can reportedly fly for around 15 minutes, which Rafael says translated to an approximate range of nearly a mile across open ground, according to Jane’s 360 . The weapon can only travel about a third of that distance if it has to maneuver through complex urban environments, though. This might not offer the kind of stand-off range Special Operations Command and the Navy are looking for, but could serve as the basis for a more capable, extended range version in the future. American firm AeroVironment’s Switchblade , also known as the Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS), has similarly limited endurance, but flies much faster across open terrain, allowing it to hit targets out to a maximum range of six miles. AeroVironment is now offering a portable, six-round launcher for Switchblade that would be easy to install on either the CCM or CCH, or even carry aboard the even smaller CCA, and would give those boats the ability to rapidly strike multiple targets. With the weapon already in service with U.S. special operations forces, this could make it an even more attractive option, at least in the near term. There are many more readily available systems, too. Israel Aerospace Industries offers both the quad-copter Rotem and the more plane-like Green Dragon , either of which would be small enough to fit onboard the special operations boats. Raytheon could potentially turn its own low-cost, disposable Coyote drone into a loitering munition, as well. Special Operations Command and the Navy also make it clear that the MPE program will look to identify a family of weapons, which could include a number of different systems to engage different types of targets at different ranges under different conditions. In addition, Navy budget documents from 2017 indicate that the Naval Special Warfare community is interested in a system that it could employ from out at sea, but also potentially dismount from a boat and use on land. “A fielded MPE capability will address two operational gaps: precision strike from a small surface craft within a contested environment; and a land-based, organic stand-off weapon launched from a light, tactical vehicle with considerable range, precision, terminal control, and loiter capability,” the service’s budget request for the 2018 fiscal year explains. “Such capabilities would counter multiple documented threats associated with both peer adversaries and VEOs [violent extremist organizations, such as terrorist groups].” Regardless of what specific weapon or weapons Special Operations Command and the Navy eventually settle on, loitering munitions could significantly expand the capabilities of the CCM and CCH boats against both conventional opponents and non-state actors. With their stealthy features, the craft could sneak relatively close to shore and engage a wide variety of targets with these weapons, either from the sea or after inserting special operators with man-portable systems ashore. The most obvious scenario is special operators moving into an area to locate, monitor, and then strike at particular terrorist or small group of militants at the best possible opportunity. This would be especially valuable when operating in and around countries, such as Somalia and Yemen , which have large littoral borders. Coupled with a mobile sea base, such as Special Operations Command’s secretive M/V Ocean Trader , special operators in craft armed with loitering munitions could conduct missions for an extended period of time relatively close to the target area. At the same time, they would be avoiding the risks associated with sending in personnel on or over land and possibly having to establish temporary or semi-permanent facilities nearby. The special operations mothership M/V Ocean Trader with CCAs visible in some of the launch and recovery bays along the side., David Kozdron Compared to manned or unmanned aircraft flying from tertiary sites potentially hundreds of miles away , these assets would be able to respond in a much more flexible manner to new intelligence or other changes in the battlespace. Depending on the exact capabilities of the chosen loitering munition, the boats and their crews could also have the ability to conduct follow-up strikes much more rapidly if the first one was unsuccessful. At sea, the loitering munitions would be just as useful against small, hostile watercraft that could transporting small groups of terrorists or militants or smuggling weapons and other equipment to them. Combatant craft can support interdiction operations and the weapons might offer a means of stopping or even destroying boats attempting to escape a boarding party , too. Many of these capabilities could be just as valuable in a high-end conflict scenario, either in a confined littoral space, such as the Baltic Sea or Black Sea , or with forces distributed across a wider area with expansive waterways, such as the Pacific and the South China Sea in particular. In either of those situations, special operators could find themselves called upon to conduct reconnaissance of potential beachheads and other coastal areas ahead of larger operations. A CCM with a remotely-operated gun on the bow. , SOCOM The boats might also put teams ashore to hunt for high-value targets, such as enemy anti-aircraft and anti-ship defenses , radars and other long-range sensors , mobile ballistic missile launchers , and stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction . Those raiding parties would be able strike at targets further inland from the safety of a relative stand-off distance, which could also give them more time to get out of the area undetected. A loitering munition launched from the inserting boat or by the team once they hit the shore would also just provide an important and immediate if limited close air support capability for special operators who might be conducting missions far detached from traditional air support. The ability to engage small watercraft could help the boats defend themselves, or larger supporting ships, against hostile naval forces or unmanned boats . Another view of one of the CCHs, which SOCOM says is already capable of limited interdiction missions in its present form. , USN There is a distinct possibility that the Navy and other services may be interested in the MPE program for their own regular forces, as well. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps are both interested in acquiring loitering munitions to support conventional operations. Larger, joint purchases would help spread out any cost and logistical burdens. The Army, Marines, and Special Operations Command have already teamed up to procure other weapon systems in the past. The exact requirements Special Operations Command and the Navy had in mind for the MPE program will likely continue to evolve in the near future. But whatever loitering munitions they settle on in the end will likely turn the already capable stealthy special operations boats into deadly and discreet strike platforms.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 21, 2019",Marine KC-130Js Are Getting A Much More Potent Bolt-On Weapons And Sensor Kit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy, on behalf of the U.S. Marines, recently completed a five-week long series of live-fire tests involving a KC-130J Hercules aircraft equipped with the latest version of the Harvest Hawk armament kit . The full, upgraded package will include the ability to fire new weapons, improved sensors, an electronic warfare capability, and other changes that will make the systems easier to operate, cheaper to maintain, and more readily able to accept additional updates in the future. Earlier in June 2018, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced that a crew from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Zero (VX-20) had completed the experiments, which included strikes against stationary and moving test targets, at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California. The Marines first announced plans to upgrade the Harvest Hawk system back in 2016 and the Navy says the upgraded arrangement, which it is now calling Harvest Hawk Plus, or HH+, will begin entering service in the first half of 2019. “The upgrade allows the Harvest Hawk to use newer missile variants,” Greg Kuntz, a NAVAIR spokesperson, said in an Email to The War Zone. “The system also delivers a more ergonomic and maintainable mission operator pallet, improved video and imaging, and greater targeting capabilities.” The Navy paired the tests with a routine iteration of the Marine Corps’ Weapons Tactics Instructor (WTI) course at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in neighboring Arizona. WTI’s are capstone exercises for Marine aviators that push them to show their mastery of combat aviation, tactics application, and battle planning. Adding the HH+ aircraft to the mix would have provided a perfect opportunity for those Marines to observe and offer feedback about the aircraft’s new capabilities. A Marine KC-130J with the existing Harvest Hawk system., Lockheed Martin The Marines are already well familiar with the existing Harvest Hawk kit, which they began testing in 2009 and saw its first combat to Afghanistan in 2010. The service also employed the aircraft in Iraq. Its primary weapons on those deployments since then have been the AGM-114P2 and P2A Hellfire II and AGM-176 Griffin precision-guided missiles, as well as the GBU-44/B Viper Strike glide bomb. The HH+ kit will allow Marine crews to fire the improved AGM-114P4 and P4A missiles . The new variants include an Inertial Measuring Unit , which improves the missile’s ability to maneuver. This will make the weapon more precise and better able to engage moving enemies. Hellfires under the wing of a Marine Corps KC-130J with the existing Harvest Hawk kit., USMC The P4s otherwise have the same anti-armor warhead, which features a tandem charge to help defeat explosive-reactive armor , as the older P2s. The P2A and P4A subvariants both have an additional fragmentation sleeve around the main explosive payload that sprays shrapnel when the missile explodes to make it more effective against soft targets and enemy personnel. The Marine Corps eventually plans to replace the Hellfires entirely with the new Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM). In June 2018, the U.S. Army, which is leading this program, gave Lockheed Martin the green light to start low-rate initial production of the missiles. These weapons combine various components from the AGM-114R variant , similar in many respects to the P versions, with a new multi-mode guidance package that includes millimeter wave radar and semi-active laser homing functionality. The JAGMs will be compatible with any existing launcher that can fire Hellfire II missiles. The Army expects the new missiles will enter full-rate production in 2019. A diagram showing the components that the JAGM missiles leverage from the existing AGM-114R., US Army In the meantime, NAVAIR says it is working on increasing the total number of Hellfires the Harvest Hawk aircraft can carry as part of a separate effort from the HH+ upgrade. Aircraft with the existing version of the system can only carry four AGM-114Ps at a time, severely limiting the total number of targets the crew can engage with those weapons. There is the possibility that HH+ could leverage weapons the Air Force has developed for its AC-130s, such as the new multi-mode GBU-69/B glide bomb , in the future, as well. The existing Harvest Hawk system already shares the same standardized common launch tube architecture for employing Griffin and Viper Strike with the AC-130W Stinger II and AC-130J Ghostrider gunships. Though we asked, NAVAIR’s public affairs office wasn’t immediately sure about when or even if Harvest Hawk KC-130Js might receive a side-firing 30mm cannon. The Marine Corps said that this would be one of the weapon systems when it first announced the program in 2009, but they subsequently delayed adding that capability indefinitely. The U.S. Air Force has had its own difficulties in adding similar weapons onto its AC-130Ws and AC-130Js, which you can read about more in detail here and here . But the HH+ kit will add electronic warfare capabilities in the form of the AN/ALQ-231(V)1 Intrepid Tiger II pod . The (V)1 version of the system is focused primarily on scrambling enemy communications and can do so selectively, but it also has the ability to listen in on those transmissions. This same equipment can jam the frequencies associated with many types of common remotely- trigged improvised explosive devices and can do so semi-autonomously using pre-programmed parameters. The system is also configured in a way that is designed to readily accept new and improved capabilities over time. The Marines have already fielded a (V)3 version on UH-1Y helicopters that can attack a broader range of radio bands and has improved direction-finding capabilities. There are plans to add in radar jamming functionality in a future Intrepid Tiger II “ Block X ” upgrade. Official briefing slides showing the state of the Intrepid Tiger program as of August 2017., USMC The upgraded Harvest Hawks will also replace their Lockheed Martin’s AN/AAQ-30 Target Sight System , a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras, along with a laser designator, with an L3 Wescam MX-20 . NAVAIR says this will give crews on HH+ equipped aircraft better image quality and improved targeting capabilities. More importantly, the turret will go under the aircraft’s nose, similar to how Air Force has configured its MC-130 special operations transports and dedicated AC-130 gunships. At present, the Harvest Hawk aircraft carry the sensor turret in a modified drop tank under the right wing. Depending on the aircraft’s flight profile, this could limit its field of view. It also just takes up space that could be full of fuel in the tank. The Marines eventually plan to install the MX-20 turrets on all of their KC-130Js to give crews on those aircraft improved situational awareness in general. This will also make it easier to rapidly move Harvest Hawk kits from one airframe to another. The HH+ kit features various additional updates that make it simpler to operate and uses an improved fire control system that fits onto an upgraded palletized platform that can roll on and off an aircraft faster. The Marine Corps’ goal with Harvest Hawk from the beginning was to offer an additional, relatively low-cost precision strike and close air support capability that could loiter over the battlefield for a protracted period of time in a low-threat environment. When not necessary, the KC-130Js could go back to their normal cargo-carrying and aerial refueling jobs. The modified fuel tank carrying the AN/AAQ-30 Target Sight System that is part of the existing Harvest Hawk system., USMC All told, the new upgraded Harvest Hawk kits look set to give Marines important additional capabilities and improve its overall flexibility. At present, there are only ten aircraft, out of a total fleet of nearly 80 KC-130Js, able to employ the existing setup across the Marine Corps. Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron Two Five Two (VMGR-252), part of the East Coast-based 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, and VMGR-352, on the West Coast with 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, each have five KC-130Js that can carry the armament package. At the same time, simply having the ability to install the systems on more aircraft if necessary will not guarantee there are personnel properly trained to employ those capabilities. VMGR-252 and -352 are the only units that prepare KC-130J crews to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and close air support and strike missions using the Harvest Hawk system. Adding these skill sets to the training regime more broadly could impact the readiness and availability of the service’s KC-130J fleet by increasing the non-combat workload for the crews and their ground support infrastructure. These are hardly new issues, as our own Tyler Rogoway noted in 2016, writing : “Still, there may be some issues with the USMC’s ambitions for their historically less than glamorous transport and utility aircraft. The money will have to come from somewhere to see this plan through. Considering the abysmal reality of Marine Air these days, upgrading non-traditional air support platforms like this is a double-edged sword. Adding new platforms that are capable of providing basic close air support and surveillance through an upgrade takes the pressure off of those same tired traditional attack platforms. On the other hand, these upgrades take away dollars that could go into maintaining and upgrading the overworked aircraft that already possess similar (and sometimes vastly superior) capabilities. “The other issue is that crews can only train for so many missions in a certain amount of flight time allotted. Either the USMC needs to up the flight hours for aircrews and increase simulator availability or other existing mission sets may suffer. Although technology may be able to help facilitate close air support more seamlessly in the future, delivering weapons in close proximity to friendly forces is not a side job. It takes training, lots of training, and confidence to execute the mission reliably. This is a challenge that will have to be confronted if the Corps intends to get the best out of their investment in these types of non-traditional upgrades.” The cost factor is likely less of a problem now than it might have been when the HH+ upgrade program began, though. President Donald Trump and his administration have requested larger defense budgets than in years prior and they are promising to increase defense spending even more in the future. On the other hand, aviation maintenance and manpower issues have only become more pronounced since then . The Marine Corps could be especially reticent to truly expand the Harvest Hawk mission at a time when it, and the U.S. military as a whole , is experiencing significant issues keeping aircraft flyable and personnel properly trained in general. Mission markings on the side of Harvest Hawk KC-130J from VMGR-252 in Afghanistan in 2011 showing Hellfire and Griffin strikes., USMC Adding to those broader issues, the vast majority of Marine Corps and Navy C-130T and KC-130T aircraft remain grounded following a deadly crash in 2017. Only 10 of the 43 total T model aircraft were flyable as of April 2018, with the rest awaiting critical upgrades to their propeller systems. The loss of this capability can only have increased the demand on the Marine’s KC-130Js to perform their more traditional missions. But with nearly a decade of experience with Harvest Hawk and having deployed it in actual combat missions on multiple occasions, the Marines clearly see it as worth the cost and effort to maintain and expand this unique capability.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin’s legendary Skunk Works advanced design bureau is in the midst of celebrating its 75th anniversary and has been revealing various heretofore unseen prototypes and information to mark the occasion. The firm has been particularly keen to stress how good it is at rapid prototyping, recently using a tongue-in-cheek principle to help explain how they’re continually able to get new aircraft flying so quickly. On June 25, 2018, in a presentation at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’ (AIAA) annual Aviation Forum in Atlanta, Georgia, representatives from Skunk Works showed a chart derived from one of Norm Augustine’s “laws” next to a list of some of their most famous aircraft and how long it took them to put it in the air for the first time. Norman Augustine served in senior civilian roles in the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army and was the first president of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, which came into being in 1995 when Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta. “The last 10 percent of performance generates one-third of the cost and two-thirds of the problems” is the 15th of 52 laws that he first published in 1984. These were based on his experience both as an industry executive and a senior military official. Though Augustine put it into writing more than four decades after what we now know as Skunk Works came into being, the aphorism almost perfectly encapsulates the reality that it and Kelly Johnson, its legendary first chief engineer, sought to change. The briefing slide in the presentation at the AIAA gathering was itself titled “Skunk Works Golden Rule: Get to a Prototype.” According to the chart, the “skunking” to avoid as many potential pitfalls as possible starts with around 20 percent left to go on the project, but what that necessarily entails isn’t entirely clear. The goal is clearly to do everything possible to avoid getting bogged down in Augustine’s figurative final “10 percent” of the process and get as much as you can get done and finalized up front. It can only require more time and effort to make significant changes and additions to an aircraft as time goes on and as an underlying design becomes firmer. This has only become truer as military aircraft have continued to become more complex over time in general. Still, right from its beginnings in 1943, the Skunk Works has been able to meet the deadlines despite complicated demands, truncated timetables, and limited resources. At that time, what was still the War Department, gave Lockheed and Johnson just six months to come up with a working fighter jet prototype that could hit 600 miles per hour. Kelly Johnson sits in the cockpit of an F-104 Starfighter., Lockheed Martin In something that seems perfect for a Hollywood biopic, Johnson took nearly 30 engineers and other 30 mechanics and set up shop in a circus tent next to a plastics factory spewing vile fumes. He had little choice since Lockheed’s actual facilities and the bulk of its personnel were all occupied building existing aircraft for the war effort. The smell at the site is credited with being the basis for the Skunk Works name . In the comic strip Li’l Abner , the “Skonk Works” makes oil from the ground up dead skunks for some unknown purpose. The parallels led to the Lockheed group calling its own workspace the Skonk Works, which then became the Skunk Works. The organization’s mascot to this day is a cartoon skunk and the logo is an easy way to identify its projects. The smell didn’t prevent Johnson’s team from building the first generation XP-80 fighter jet and having it take its first flight in just five months. Though too late to see service in World War II, the aircraft was an important development and led directly to the T-33 Shooting Star trainer and the F-94 Starfire radar-equipped interceptor. It only took three and four months respectively for those aircraft to go from the drawing board to their first flight. Skunk Works was essentially inventing “rapid prototyping” before anyone had even coined that phrase. And in something of a precursor to Augustine’s Laws, Johnson established three ground rules for his team to help keep them on track. A P-80 Shooting Star., USAF These were “It’s more important to listen than to talk; second, even a timely wrong decision is better than no decision; and third, don’t halfheartedly wound problems–kill them dead,” according to a story on his management style by Fast Company . On top of all of that, he insisted that no one work on anything they didn’t believe in. These principles eventually evolved into 14 rules , which Lockheed Martin still has on their website . They’re less humorous than Augustine’s maxims, but they’re no less important. “There must be a minimum number of reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly,” Johnson wrote. “There must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and committed but also projected costs to the conclusion of the program.” Whether they sound like truisms or not, it was an underlying philosophy that famously allowed Lockheed to go from a concept for a high-altitude spy plane to flying prototype of the U-2 spy plane in just eight months. This remains one of the shortest and most efficient projects in Skunk Works history. A U-2C spy plane., USAF It took less than three years to get to the first flight of the much more complicated supersonic A-12 , the predecessor to the SR-71 spy plane and less time than that to craft the Have Blue stealth demonstrator aircraft. With its growing knowledge base and experience with quickly prototyping designs, Skunk Works was able to get the first F-117 Nighthawk stealth jet into the air in the same time it had taken them to develop the famous C-130 airlifter . It took almost 50 months for the YF-22 and X-35 prototype stealth fighters, the latter of which led to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, to see their first flight. This might seem like a dramatic increase compared to how long things took with the F-117, but it’s impressive nonetheless when one considers that these schedules are still less than twice what it took to craft the Nighthawk and the resulting aircraft were significantly more complex. A pair of F-117 Nighthawks., USAF Skunk Works has only continued to improve its rapid manufacturing and prototyping capabilities since then. The most obvious of these projects was the experimental X-55A Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft (ACCA), which was part of a dedicated U.S. Air Force program to explore the benefits of building aircraft using large sections made out of composite materials. It took just 20 months for Skunk Works to get the X-55A flying and organization pioneered a number of composite manufacturing techniques to get there. You can read more about that project in detail here . But perhaps where Skunk Works has shown off the most in this regard is in its unmanned aircraft projects. It only took 18 months for the P-175 Polecat demonstrator drone to ready for its first flight. This almost certainly helped along by the development of the recently revealed X-44A , which itself was in part an effort to further advance Lockheed Martin’s existing rapid production methods. We don’t know how long that drone , or the secretive RQ-170 Sentinel that came after Polecat, took to get to its first flight. The X-44A with a very prominent “Skunk Works” logo, photographed earlier in 2018., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com It also helps explain the defense contractor’s confidence in deciding not to produce a physical prototype of its proposed design for the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray drone tanker program unless it actually wins the competition. Skunk Works has used the X-44A as a testbed for visual cueing systems it would include on its future MQ-25, creating a direct link between one rapid prototyping effort and another prospective one. But there’s little doubt that the design group is continuing to build on this experience , as well as that from other projects in the classified realm that we still don’t know about yet. Having turned rapid prototyping and manufacturing into a science, Skunk Works can use that advantage, as well as existing design knowledge, to help keep development timelines for new aircraft as short as they can even when dealing with systems of ever-increasing complexity. A rare shot of an RQ-170 in a special testing configuration., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com If nothing else, Lockheed Martin’s advanced design teams are clearly eager to continue finding ways around Norm Augustine’s 15th law. But there are significant questions about whether or not these rapid prototyping mechanisms translates into positive gains when a particular aircraft goes from the prototype stage to series production. By that point, it’s out of Skunk Works’ hands. Rushing to have 80 percent of an aircraft’s design done and a prototype flying as quickly as possible might be good for smaller programs the Skunk Works will ‘own’ throughout its life cycle, and for capturing larger development contracts, at least initially, but it doesn’t really change Augustine’s Law about growing complexities and resulting costs in the final stages of the project. And this is true especially for larger production programs the Skunk Works ‘passes off’ to a large degree after winning the initial contract. Lockheed Martin itself only needs to look at how successful it was in getting the X-35 flying and how long it is still taking to solve a host of subsequent challenges in the production version of the jet. Also, keep in the mind that the X-35 flew nearly two decades ago and the F-35’s first flight was well over a decade ago. F-35 Joint Strike Fighters under construction., Lockheed Martin To be fair, much of the fault there lies in the concept known as “ concurrency ,” in which the U.S. military agreed to buy a large number of aircraft under the premise that the larger orders up front would drive down production costs. Problems identified during the development phase would then get fixed on existing planes during depots maintenance and get inserted into jets on the production line “concurrently.” The entire plan has turned out to be inherently flawed, as many warned from the beginning, and has not only not delivered on the supposed cost savings, but led to substantial delays and overruns. Of course, the whole idea violated one of Kelly Johnson’s three core principles—that problems with a design shouldn’t be allowed to fester under the idea that they’ll get fixed later on. As such, Skunk Works, and Lockheed Martin as a whole, might want to be mindful of another one of Augustine’s Laws, which comes right after the one they chose to cite in their presentation. “In the year 2054, the entire defense budget will purchase just one aircraft,” the former Lockheed Martin executive quipped in Law 16. “This aircraft will have to be shared by the Air Force and Navy 3-1/2 days each per week except for leap year, when it will be made available to the Marines for the extra day.” Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As a follow-up to our recent report detailing a bizarre encounter between a Piper Saratoga and a mysterious object over Long Island, New York, we have interviewed one of the aircraft’s crew to get their first-hand account of the incident. The event occurred on May 26th, 2018, at around 1pm local time and we posted the full air traffic control audio that originally sparked our investigation in our original report, which you can download it here as well . In the recording, the pilot doesn’t offer a description of what they are seeing to controllers aside from saying at one time that it had ‘lights on it’ and countering the controller’s sentiment to assume it was a drone. The Piper Saratoga with the registration N161MA was cruising at 6,000 feet and the atmospheric conditions were partly cloudy with very little winds and warm temperatures at the time of the incident. In my interview with one of the Piper’s crew, the object was described as a very bright orange to magenta colored round object that appeared in front of the aircraft. There was no discernable structure or any other colored lights on it. The illumination was steady. The range was hard to tell for the crew because of the strange nature of the glowing object, but it didn’t seem that far directly ahead of the Piper’s path and was in front of a cloud. The encounter lasted a couple of minutes and after a course change was requested the orb of light seemed to dim and then disappear inside a cloud. The pilot in command did file a report as requested by air traffic control and they haven’t heard anything from the FAA regarding its investigation since. When asked if they knew of any other aircraft in the area that reported seeing the anomaly, they did not know of any additional accounts. I asked if it looked like a landing light on an airliner and they said that it was larger and brighter and different as they see landing lights on aircraft of all types constantly in the congested airspace around New York and the greater Northeast. It was broad daylight and the fact that they couldn’t make out a plane attached to the bright light also added to their curiosity. Here is a good video showing what it looks like flying in a similar Piper Saratoga just for reference. This is NOT a video of the same aircraft or its aircrew involved in the incident: Upon reviewing ADS-B data from Flightaware24.com of N161MA’s flight path around the time of the event, we didn’t see any traffic that was heading directly towards the aircraft at a similar altitude that would begin to explain the sighting, although it is crowded airspace and the software is not perfectly accurate. We filed a Freedom of Information Act Request before posting our original report last week, as in the past, hopefully we will learn much more about the FAA’s investigation into the matter from the FAA’s response to our request. But for now, the case remains an unsolved mystery even to those who witnessed it first-hand.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 14, 2018",Australia Seals Deal To Buy MQ-4C Drones As Military Competition In the Pacific Heats Up,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Australia has officially announced that it is buying at least six MQ-4C Triton long-range maritime surveillance drones from Northrop Grumman, making it the first foreign customer for the type. The unmanned aircraft will significantly expand the country’s ability to monitor its extensive interests in the Pacific region and keep watch on potential opponents, such as China , as well as add to already deepening defense ties with the United States . The Australian government and the Virginia-headquartered defense contractor both unveiled the deal, worth nearly $7 billion AUD, on June 26, 2018. In a 2016 Defense White Paper, Australian authorities had originally outlined plans to buy seven of the drones and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s government said that it could possibly pick up this additional example in the future, according to The Sydney Morning Herald . “Australia has one of the largest sea zones in the world over which it has rights to use marine resources, also known as an Economic Exclusion Zone,” Doug Shaffer, Northrop Grumman’s Vice President of Triton Programs said in an official press release . “As a flexible platform, Triton can serve in missions as varied as maritime domain awareness, target acquisition, fisheries protection, oil field monitoring and humanitarian relief.” The Royal Australian Air Force plans to operate its MQ-4Cs primarily from RAAF Base Edinburgh in the south of the country, which also hosts the service’s P-8A Poseidon manned maritime surveillance planes. With a maximum, unrefueled range of more than 8,000 miles, the unmanned aircraft could fly all the way north to the South China Sea or south to Antarctica from that base. A US Navy MQ-4C Triton., USN RAAF Base Tindal in the country’s Northern Territory will also get infrastructure updates to support Triton operations. This base is less than 2,000 miles to the hotly contested South China Sea, where the Chinese military is rapidly expanding its presence on a series of man-made outposts that are increasing well defended with anti-aircraft and anti-ship weapons. Positioning the drones there could give Australian forces the ability to conduct long, persistent surveillance missions in that region. And with the Triton’s long-range capabilities, Australia could simply use them to persistently monitor their own maritime boundaries and EEZs, as Northrop Grumman’s Shaffer noted. Australian authorities have increasingly had to find ways to stop illegal Chinese fishing in their waters and have also been in the throes of a controversial migrant crisis for years. This map gives a good idea of the area an MQ-4C can cover from various locations. This range circle all the way to the right is centered on the US island of Guam., USN The MQ-4C is a derivative of the RQ-4 Global Hawk that has significant upgrades to make it better suited to persistent, over-water maritime surveillance missions. The drones have a more robust fuselage and wings, features to prevent ice build up on the wings and air intake to the engine, and improved resistance to lightning strikes, which gives them a better ability to swoop down from high altitude to more closely investigate objects of interest. Triton’s combination of an active electronically scanned radar with surface search and synthetic aperture modes, a sensor turret containing electro-optical and infrared video cameras, and electronic support measures give it a wide array of different tools to locate and track potentially hostile ships. It also has a receiver that monitors signals the Automatic Identification System , or AIS, a marine transponder system that both navies and shipping companies use for vessel monitoring and to avoid collisions and other accidents at sea, which the drones can employ to monitor maritime traffic across a broad area. An overview of the Triton’s features., Northrop Grumman But the MQ-4Cs could also have a very important combat support role during any crisis in Pacific Region that Australia might find itself in the midst of, such as a potential skirmish over China’s aforementioned advances in the South China Sea. Able to fly above 50,000 feet, the drones could use their multi-function radar to scan for potential threats along a shoreline or even peer deep into enemy territory while staying outside of the range at least some of their air defenses. The electronic support measures package, the same system found on the U.S. Navy’s EP-3E Aries II spy planes, can geolocate and categorize hostile emitters, especially radars. This would allow the unmanned aircraft to help build a so-called “ electronic order of battle ” of an opponent’s air defense capability. American MQ-4Cs could get additional signals intelligence equipment in the future to expand their ability to monitor different types of electronic emissions and snoop on enemy communications chatter and it’s not hard to see those systems become available to the Australians in the future, as well. The drones will also be able to share that information with other manned aircraft, especially Australia’s existing Poseidons, and ships. From the beginning , the U.S. Navy planned to pair these two aircraft together itself. The manned-unmanned team could easily cover more ground faster and the MQ-4Cs could help narrow search areas so the P-8As could better focus their attention. “The Triton will complement the surveillance role of the P-8A Poseidon aircraft through sustained operations at long ranges as well as being able to undertake a range of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tasks,” Australian Prime Minister Turnbull said in a statement about the drone purchase. “Together these aircraft will significantly enhance our anti-submarine warfare and maritime strike capability, as well as our search and rescue capability.” This graphic shows the US Navy’s broad concept of operations involving the MQ-4C, including sharing information with other aircraft, ships, and sites on land, as well as allies and partners., USN That point about anti-submarine capabilities will only become increasingly important as time goes on as countries throughout the Pacific , including Australia itself , look to bolster their undersea capabilities. China, in particular, is working to significantly expand the size of its submarine fleets and add both new nuclear-powered and advanced diesel-electric types to its already large inventory . The MQ-4Cs will also be able to provide targeting information to manned aircraft and ships. This will extend the ability of those assets to strike opponents at sea and on land beyond the range of their own organic sensor suites. In addition, the Tritons can do much of its flying and perform many of its surveillance tasks semi-autonomously, operating along pre-planned routes and identifying and categorizing potential targets by itself before passing that information to manned aircraft or analysts back at its home base for elsewhere for further exploitation. The semi-autonomous capabilities could also help the drones survive better in the event an opponent attempts to jam them or they just otherwise lose connectivity with operators on the ground. There have already been reports that Chinese forces may be launching electronic warfare attacks on manned and unmanned U.S. military aircraft flying over the South China Sea. The drones might also be less vulnerable to blinding lasers that China’s forces have reportedly begun using in the region as well, though these non-kinetic weapons could disrupt the Triton’s cameras. One of many Chinese military hand-held laser weapons, ostensibly to give its troops the ability to blind enemy sensors and optics on aircraft and ground vehicles., Chinese Internet And with both MQ-4Cs and P-8As, the RAAF will be even better suited to working together with the United States during any future contingency. The two countries have already been building upon already substantial defense ties in recent years in the face of growing Chinese military and quasi-military activities across the Pacific. “Australia’s alliance with the US is our most important defense relationship, underpinned by strong co-operation in defense industry and capability development,” Australian Prime Minister Turnbull said in his statement. “This co-operative program will strengthen our ability to develop advanced capability and conduct joint military operations.” On June 25, 2018, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) also quietly announced that the order was part of a Memorandum of Understanding , or MOU, outlining an active partnership in Triton operations. It also gives Australia an increased role in defining future requirements and design changes for the drones. “Our team is eager to partner with Australia and enhance our ability to improve Australian and U.S. capabilities in that region,” U.S. Navy Captain Dan Mackin, head of NAVAIR’s PMA-262, the Persistent Maritime Unmanned Aircraft Systems office, said in a statement. “This MOU allows for enhanced partnership with our Australian counterparts and will allow us to work side by side in further developing the Triton program.” An Australian P-8A Poseidon. , RAAF The U.S. Navy expects to reach initial operational capability with the MQ-4C in 2021, but it plans to send the first two operational drones to Guam by the end of 2018. In June 2018, the service formally inducted the Tritons into service in a ceremony at Naval Air Station Point Mugu in California, which is home to Unmanned Patrol Squadron One Nine (VUP-19). The U.S. Air Force already routinely deploys RQ-4 Global Hawks, the basis for the Tritons, to the island , but as noted, those unmanned aircraft are not as well suited to maritime patrols. From Guam, American Tritons will be able to monitor marine traffic in the South China Sea and in the vicinity of North Korea , among other areas of the Pacific and it is possible they could fly from RAAF bases, or even together with Australia’s drones, to further expand their ability to operate in the region. And depending on how the arrangement goes, it might prompt other countries to renew their interest in Triton or give it a look in the first place, too. Unfortunately, the high costs associated with the drones might still be a deal breaker and have upended many potential deals already. India, which also operates P-8I Poseidons, had considered joining the MQ-4C program back in 2011 . It has since become more interested in the lower-flying maritime patrol version of General Atomics’ MQ-9 Reaper , which it refers to variously as the Type Certifiable Predator B, MQ-9B, and SkyGuardian. In July 2018, General Atomics plans to demonstrate its drone’s overwater capabilities by flying it across the Atlantic to take part in the Royal International Air Tattoo in the United Kingdom. But General Atomics’ design still lacks the high-altitude capabilities that the much larger Triton offers. https://youtube.com/watch?v=KK9bB034isk Japan has also received U.S. government approval to buy the RQ-4 and adding MQ-4Cs to its inventory would make sense given its own extensive maritime interests. At the same time, the Japanese government has yet to finalize the Global Hawk deal and there are reports that the purchase price and high operating costs could scuttle the purchase . General Atomics also recently demonstrated Sky Guardian in the country, but as a tool for the country’s scientific research organizations . South Korea is another potential customer for the Triton that has already been working toward buying Global Hawks and just recently decided to purchase P-8As , as well. Despite debates in the country over the RQ-4s costs, the South Korean Air Force is now slated to get the first of these drones by the end of 2018 . Whether or not any other countries decide to follow Australia’s lead, the RAAF looks set to gain an important and significant new capability. The Australian government expects to take delivery for the first MQ-4C in 2023 and have the entire fleet of six fully operational and scouring the Pacific by the end of 2025.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 5, 2019",Army Lays Out Plans For Pilot-Optional ‘Knife Fighter’ Attack Reconnaissance Rotorcraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army wants to have two different optionally-manned “attack reconnaissance” aircraft prototypes – almost certainly advanced helicopter or tilt-rotor designs – ready for a competitive fly-off by 2022. Part of the service’s larger Future Vertical Lift program, the rotorcraft could help fill the gap left when it prematurely retired the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior , offer a possible replacement for some AH-64 Apache gunships and MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones, and may offer some of the capabilities that were supposed to come along with the abortive RAH-66 Comanche stealth helicopter . On June 22, 2018, the U.S. Army Futures Command released a draft solicitation for the proposed Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Competitive Prototype, or FARA CP, project, on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps . As it stands now, the service wants to pick two finalists in 2020 and have the prototypes make their first flight in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which begins on Oct. 1, 2022. The Army is looking for feedback on its initial plan by July 18, 2018, and the final version could feature a different timeline. “The Army currently lacks the ability to conduct armed reconnaissance, light attack, and security with improved stand-off and lethal and non-lethal capabilities with a platform sized to hide in radar clutter and for the urban canyons of mega cities ,” the draft contracting document says. “To close this gap, the Army envisions an optionally manned, next generation rotorcraft with attributes of reduced cognitive workload, increased operational tempo … through ultra-reliable designs and extended maintenance free periods, and advanced teaming and autonomous capabilities.” The solicitation goes on to say that the Army envisions a “knife fighter” that will maximize performance in as small of a package as is reasonable. The aircraft will feature systems that can be rapidly upgraded, expanded upon, or replaced thanks a standardized software interface. This is something the service is pursuing as part of other efforts to make it easier and cheaper to update systems on aircraft and ground vehicles in the future. US Army AH-64 Apaches, the service’s primary attack reconnaissance aircraft at present., US Army Depending on how the Army implements this systems architecture, it could help support the aircraft’s autonomous capabilities, as well. The U.S. military as a whole has become steadily more interested in using artificial intelligence and machine learning to help make things easier for manned crews in aircraft and vehicles, especially by helping to filter through increasingly large amounts of sensor data and other information . These systems could also suggest the most optimal courses of action in a particular situation, such as most effective flight route to a destination or the best vector to attack a specific target. Those same features will help enable the aircraft’s ability to work with other unmanned aerial vehicles and potentially fly without a manned crew itself. Manned-unmanned teaming in particular, such as the ability to seamlessly share information with drones or even issue commands to those unmanned aircraft, is a key requirement of the FARA CP program. The Army has already been actively testing the ability of its existing manned helicopters to work together with pilotless planes, such as the MQ-1C . The “tethered” drones could scout ahead, effectively increasing the area a single manned rotorcraft could reconnoiter at once. It could also help reduce the risk to the crew by sending the unmanned aircraft ahead to scout for possible hazards first. A pilotless craft could also potentially carry electronic warfare jammers or kinetic weapons, such as small guided missiles or glide bombs , to attack those targets and clear a path for the manned helicopters to follow through. This is to say nothing of the weapons and other systems the final FARA design will carry itself. A US Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone., US Army The draft solicitation heavily alludes to this concept of operations. “This platform will be the center piece of the integrated air defense system … breeching [sic; breaching] team,” it says. And though it’s not mentioned spherically in the document, the Army has made it clear the electronic warfare, and electronic attack specifically, is very important to the FARA concept in the past. “We want [these aircraft] to be able to spoof those radars, jam those radars, hunt those radars and kill those radars,” U.S. Army Brigadier General Walter Rugen, the deputy commander of the Army’s 7th Infantry Division and head of the service’s Future Vertical Lift Cross Functional Team (CFT), said at the Association of the United States Army’s Global Force Symposium in March 2018 . So far there has been no mention of any stealth features for the FARA, which were a major part of the RAH-66 program. The new concept shares much of the same expected mission profile as the Comanche and the Army could reveal that this is a requirement for its new project later on. The Army announced plans for eight CFTs within Futures Command to explore potential new technologies in different functional areas in 2017. The other seven teams are working on issues related to Long Range Precision Fires ; Next Generation Combat Vehicle ; Network Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence; Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing; Air and Missile Defense ; Soldier Lethality ; and the Synthetic Training Environment. During his presentation at the Global Force Symposium, Rugen, who previously commanded the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade, which is forward deployed in South Korea, used the exact phrase “urban canyons of mega cities.”  His rhetorical fingerprints are unsurprisingly clear elsewhere in the draft solicitation. Then-U.S. Army Colonel Walter Rugen, third from the right, meets with South Korean officials, in 2014. , US Army What the draft solicitation doesn’t say is exactly what type of aircraft the Army necessarily has in mind to meet its needs. This seems almost certainly intended to help solicit the widest possible range of options to begin with. “I have been very, very impressed with some of the PowerPoint briefs I have seen,” Brigadier General Rugen said in March 2018. “But I will tell you our soldiers can’t fly PowerPoint, our soldiers can’t fight with PowerPoint, so we are going to challenge industry to work closely with us to develop the Future Vertical Lift that we need for our soldiers in the future.” A number of potentially applicable aircraft and concepts do exist already. Bell is test flying its V-280 Valor tilt-rotor , which is a competitor for the FVL program’s medium transport requirement, which you can read about in more detail in this recent War Zone feature . The company is also developing a tilt-rotor drone, the V-247 Valiant , and underlying technology from both designs could serve as the basis for a FARA competitor. A team consisting of Boeing and Sikorsky is also pitching an advanced compound helicopter, the SB>1 Defiant , as an alternative option in that role and has shown a concept for a gunship derived from that design.  Separately, Sikorsky, which is now part of Lockheed Martin, recently resumed flight testing of its S-97 Raider compound helicopter demonstrator, which it has shown in a potential light attack configuration in the past. Lockheed Martin has also been working on an unmanned, vertical take-off and landing capable logistics aircraft called the Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES). The defense contractor might be able to leverage that design, which it is developing in cooperation with helicopter firm Piasecki Aircraft, into a manned system to meet the Army’s FARA requirements. AVX , a smaller aviation company, has also been looking to pitch its own designs to the Army as part of the larger FVL program. The firm had previously proposed an upgrade for the service’s OH-58D aircraft that would have replaced the tail rotor with a twin fan assembly for enhanced maneuverability and overall performance. The last of the companies that have been actively involved in the Future Vertical Lift effort so far is Karem Aircraft. The firm is proposing its own tilt-rotor concept with versions sized appropriately for transport and light attack and reconnaissance roles. Of all of these designs, the S-97 seems the best suited to the FARA requirements as they exist now and Sikorsky had planned from the outset for the aircraft to be capable of autonomous, unmanned operation in the future. In addition, it has already been flying since 2015 and followed the highly successful X-2 demonstrator that first flew in 2008 giving it, or a more purpose-built attack reconnaissance derivative, the benefit of that existing flight test experience. A second prototype is now entering the flight test program as well. Concept art of Karem’s attack reconnaissance tilt-rotor aircraft., Karem Aircraft Still, the Army makes it clear they’re looking for two competing designs. So this leaves room for any of the other challengers to catch the service’s eye in the coming years as they push forward toward a flying prototype of their aircraft. But it’s also not clear which of these designs the Army might be most inclined to choose since the service itself doesn’t seem to have a clear understanding yet of the aircraft’s role. Though at first glance the FARA concept might seem to be a replacement for the Kiowa Warriors that it still needs , the Army also employs AH-64s in the “ attack reconnaissance ” role. Older Sikorsky art showing an entire family of S-97-based helicopters. The SB>1 has largely supplanted plans for the larger versions, but the “RQ-97 Autonomous Recon Attack” concept seems almost perfectly tailored to the Army’s FARA requirements., Sikorsky It’s unlikely to be a true replacement for either of these helicopters, at least at first, though. Far from being a widely available asset, the Army says it initially expects whatever aircraft it selects for the FARA program to be a so-called “Echelon Above Division” asset, akin to the service’s specialized fixed-wing intelligence gathering aircraft . https://youtube.com/watch?v=qDGAaHA3QkM What this means is these rotorcraft would not necessarily be acting in support of infantry or armored formations directly and could only be available in very limited numbers for higher priority missions in a certain portion of the battlespace. This would actually seem to fit very much with the Army’s concept of employing the FARA as a system to help penetrate into denied areas rather providing routine support to troops on the ground. It is very possible that the Army envisions using its new attack reconnaissance aircraft to help breach through and neutralize enemy air defenses in order to prepare the battlespace for more traditional helicopters and other aircraft that would otherwise be too vulnerable. Future high-end conflicts against near-peer opponents with a robust IADS network will definitely limit the ability of the service’s existing helicopters to provide any support, which is something that Brigadier General Rugen acknowledged in March 2018. A briefing slide from 2015 showing the different “echelons” of command and how the Army’s aviation and intelligence gathering assets, as well as those from other services, fit into that rubric. “Combat aviation,” such as AH-64s and OH-58s, are at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) level and below. The Army expects FARA to sit in the category marked here as “tactical,” above the Division level, with aircraft such as the RC-12X and the various MC-12s., US Army “Aviation has been an asymmetric advantage for our Army and the joint force since Vietnam and LZ [Landing Zone] X-Ray,” he said, referring to the famous battle in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965, which has been the subject of numerous books and films including the movie We Were Soldiers . “We are not giving that up just because the air domain is tough.” The Army does say that it could eventually purchase up to 500 aircraft in the end, in two batches of 100 examples and a third batch of 300 aircraft, but there’s no clear indication of when it might expect to receive those aircraft. With more than 700 AH-64s spread across active, reserve, and National Guard units, this plan would not allow for a one-for-one replacement. The Army already needs to make up for the previous loss of around 340 OH-58Ds, too. Furthermore, the Army’s rationale for retiring the OH-58Ds without a direct replacement was that it had become too expensive and complicated to operate that fleet in addition to its other, more predominant helicopter types. The FARA would add a new and relatively small fleet of advanced rotorcraft that will likely be more costly to operate compared to the service’s traditional helicopters. The Army’s OH-58F prototype. The service had planned to upgrade its OH-58Ds to this configuration before deciding to retire the entire fleet instead. , US Army This may not be an issue now, given President Donald Trump’s push to continue expanding the defense budget. There’s no guarantee that will still be the case in 2022, which will be near the end of Trump’s possible second term, or under the administration of the next president. The Army could be forced to sacrifice other initiatives to preserve this particular project, or FVL as a whole, or scale back its rotorcraft ambitions to support any number of other advanced projects it is pursuing already . At the same time, the implication is clear that something like FARA is essential to the service being able to continue providing aviation support of any kind in higher-risk scenarios. The Army says that if everything goes to plan, it could reach initial operational capability with whatever aircraft it selects in 2028. The service does expect to complete a system requirements review by the end of 2019, nearly a decade beforehand, which could help clear up the service’s actual plans for the FARA program.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Currently, the most advanced F-15 Eagles on the planet belong to the Royal Saudi Air Force which has a decades-long history with the type. In its latest iteration, known as the F-15SA , the mighty Strike Eagle has been vastly upgraded. One of the type’s most prominent new features is the activation of the Eagle’s long-dormant outer-wing stores stations number one and nine. This was made possible with the help of the F-15SA’s new fly-by-wire flight control system. With this upgrade, the Eagle can fly with a wide array of new weapons configurations, including being able to turn into an air-to-air ‘missile truck’ of sorts. This unique loadout was captured in amazing fashion by aviation photographer Christopher McGreevy as a pair of F-15SA’s blasted through Star Wars Canyon on June 12, 2018. McGreevy’s photos are stunning and show a pair of F-15SA’s used for testing out of Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, rocketing through the crevasse , one totally clean and the other featuring its current max air-to-air loadout of 12 AIM-120 AMRAAMs. This is four more than any other Eagle has been able to carry in the past. The missiles loaded onto the test F-15SA were inert training rounds, but there is nothing keeping live versions off the jet. A pair of drop tanks, LANTIRN navigation pod, Tiger Eyes IRST , and Sniper targeting pod round-out the test jet’s configuration.

This mission, in particular, was also a fini-flight—a crewman’s last flight—for a USAF test pilot that had been working on the F-15SA program. The overall gray jet was piloted by a Boeing test pilot. As for the F-15’s air-to-air missile carrying capabilities, a dozen AIM-120s is very impressive, but with the addition of new launcher-racks called the Advanced Missile and Bomb Ejection Rack (AMBER) that number could end up nearly doubling for the F-15SA and its successors to a whopping 22 missiles in total . Even older F-15 models could be able to lug 16 air-to-air missiles around under the proposed 2040C configuration , which doubles their current missile carrying capabilities. You can read about how such an ability could be used in future combat scenarios here , here , and here . https://youtube.com/watch?v=xGY2JBuSCU0 The next Eagle iteration will be the F-15QA which is destined to Saudi Arabia’s less than loving neighbor Qatar. The F-15QA will be even more advanced than the F-15SA and will include new large-screen cockpit displays, a low-profile HUD, and an entirely new internal wing structure among other enhancements. 36 of the jets are on order with an option for another 36 in hand. Even though an upgrade program continues on multiple fronts for USAF F-15C/D Eagles , their future is now more in doubt than ever, but the service’s F-15Es are sure to serve long into the future. They are currently receiving new radars and soon they will get one of the most advanced electronic warfare suites on the planet. But even with these enhancements, they won’t compare to the Eagles currently being fielded to Arab states, and it looks very likely that Israel will be putting in an order for similar jets in the very near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2018",Potential New Crisis Between Israel And Syria Looms As Assad Pushes Toward Israeli Border,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of Israel’s Patriot surface-to-air missile systems attempted to shoot down an intruding drone near the country’s border with Syria, a sign that tensions are still high weeks after a major Israeli skirmish with Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in the area. The incident also underscores the complexities and potential pitfalls with an apparent Russian-brokered deal that would see Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad regain control of the region in exchange for moving Iran’s forces away from the boundary. On June 24, 2018, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that they had detected an unmanned aerial vehicle in Syria flying toward the border and fired the Patriot missile at it in response. They also acknowledged that there was no indication that they had shot the drone down and that the pilotless plane appeared to retreat to safety. “The IDF’s aerial defense system identified the threat in advance before it crossed into Israeli territory,” according to an official Tweet. “The IDF will not allow the State of Israel’s aerial sovereignty to be violated and will operate to prevent any attempts to harm its civilians.” This isn’t the first time Israeli forces have engaged drones along its border with Syria. In September 2017 , Israel reported downing an unmanned aircraft belonging to the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah flying over the disputed Golan Heights. Two months later , an Israeli Patriot blew apart one of the Syrian regime’s unmanned aerial vehicles in the same general area. In February 2018, an Israeli AH-64 Apache gunship shot down an Iranian drone that was reportedly carrying weapons and was on its way to attack targets in Israel . This incident touched off a sequence of events that left one of Israel’s F-16I Sufa multi-role combat jets destroyed and an unknown F-15 type damaged. But this latest altercation comes nearly two months after a much more serious exchange between Israel and Iran. On May 10, 2018, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, or forces under its control, fired a number of rockets across the Syrian border toward Israeli villages. The IDF aircraft and ground forces quickly took action, destroying dozens of targets in Syria linked to the regime in Tehran, as well as elements of Assad’s air defenses that attempted to shoot down Israeli jets. So, while this latest IDF decision to try and shoot down a potentially hostile drone turned out to be relatively uneventful, it’s clear that it could have quickly escalated into a more serious and dangerous situation. It also points to the increased potential for clashes as Assad works to reassert his regime’s authority, with Russian assistance, in southern Syria, right up to the Israeli border. Earlier in June 2018 , Syrian government forces and other elements aligned with Assad began a renewed offensive to retake Daraa, which is situated less than 10 miles from the Jordanian border and less than 30 miles southeast of the Golan. The strategic city and its suburbs have been important hubs for Syrian rebels fighting the government in Damascus, including groups that had received assistance from the United States and its allies. In July 2017, the United States, Russia, and Jordan agreed to establish a so-called “ de-escalation zone ” in southern Syria, with the goal of implementing a de facto ceasefire between Assad and rebel groups in the area. The Syrian regime, however, was never formally a party to that agreement and, along with its Iranian allies, has continued operations in the region in spite of the deal. “We … caution the Syrian regime against any actions that risk broadening the conflict or jeopardize the ceasefire,” top State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement regarding the issue on May 25, 2018. “Russia is duly responsible as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to use its diplomatic and military advantage over the Assad regime to stop attacks and compel the Assad regime to cease further military offensives.” Syrian government forces south of the capital Damascus in May 2018., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik via AP Russian forces have now violated the arrangement themselves by supporting Syrian advances with their characteristically brutal and indiscriminate air strikes. The U.S. government’s warning, which included a threat that it could act to enforce the de-confliction zone in some way, appears to have had no real impact on their decision-making process. And that may be entirely by design. “You should not base your decisions on the assumption or expectation of a military intervention by us,” the U.S. government reportedly said in a letter to Free Syrian Army rebel factions that Reuters obtained on June 23, 2018. “We in the United States government understand the difficult conditions you are facing and still advise the Russians and the Syrian regime not to undertake a military measure that violates the zone.” Free Syrian Army rebels fire an improvised rocket launcher at Assad’s forces in 2015., Ameer Alhalbi/NurPhoto/Sipa via AP This followed earlier reports that suggested that Israel and Russia had come to an agreement that would see Assad retake areas all the way to the Golan in exchange for moving Iranian and Iranian-support forces at least 35 miles from the border. Neither Israeli nor Russian officials confirmed the arrangement, but the IDF did confirm that it had established communications to “de-conflict” its operations with the Russians. “We do not coordinate [with Russia],” a senior Israeli military officer told The Times of Israel . “It’s about de-confliction and security measures, so they don’t harm us and we don’t harm them.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting in May 2018., Ramil Sitdikov/Sputnik via AP The United States’ decision to effectively abandon Syrian rebel groups would suggest that President Donald Trump and his administration had decided to acquiesce to the Russian-Israeli bargain, even if only unofficially. It’s not clear whether or not Jordan – a major U.S. ally and counter-terrorism partner in the Middle East and beyond – has been party to any of these negotiations on the future of southern Syria, which also impacts its shared border. That the U.S. government could have decided to at least step aside in the face of an Israeli-Russian agreement is hardly surprising. Trump himself has personally criticized American support for Syrian rebel groups on numerous occasions, has called for the United States to withdraw from operations in the country, and is an outspoken supporter of Israel , notably making the controversial decision to move the U.S. Embassy in that country into the hotly contested city of Jerusalem. Separately, in northern Syria, the United States has been similarly ironing out a deal with Turkey that has sidelined American-backed Kurdish forces in the strategic city of Manbij , despite the fact that those groups were essential in driving out ISIS terrorists from the region and keeping them on the run. The recent drone incident near Israel, however, highlights how complex and potentially fragile any arrangement in southern Syria might turn out to be, even in the near term. Most importantly, officials in Moscow do not speak in any way for Iran and they could find it difficult to make good on any deals to remove Iranian forces from the border area. Israeli self-propelled howitzers near the border with Syria in May 2018., Ilia Yefimovich/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images And though Russia seems eager to drive a wedge between Assad and his Iranian partners, the Kremlin has shown itself either unwilling or unable to entirely control the regime in Damascus. Russian President Vladimir Putin has very clear designs on expanding Russian influence in Syria , the Middle East as a whole , and elsewhere , and is pursuing policies that support those interests above any others. At the same time, Israel and Assad remain effectively at war, as well, with the final status of the Golan Heights being a particular point of contention. Israeli forces seized control of the region during the 1973 Yom Kippur War , but withdrew from a buffer area as part of a U.N.-backed deal in 1974 . The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force ( UNDOF ) had maintained forces in the area to monitor the ceasefire agreement, but those elements came under attack from ISIS terrorists in 2014 and abandoned a number of posts. Assad has attempted on multiple occasions to use the situation as an excuse to take back control of portions of the U.N.-maintained demilitarized zone. In April 2018 , Israel complained to the United Nations that Syrian forces had moved tanks, artillery, and other heavy weapons into the buffer area in violation of the ceasefire. On June 24, 2018, there were reports that Assad’s troops had taken control of an UNDOF observation post and had begun expanding its facility to supporter a larger government presence. Israel’s Kan News released video showing activity at the site in its televised report, seen below. “[Israel is] aware of what is taking place, and views the infrastructure work at the post as a serious and flagrant violation of the separation-of-forces agreement,” the IDF said in a statement . “[UNDOF is responsible] for monitoring and acting against military forces in the buffer zone, and [the IDF] is determined to prevent military consolidation in the area.” The implication here is that Israeli forces could strike Assad’s troops in and around the Golan if they don’t withdraw. That, in turn, could upend any agreement the Russians facilitated regarding Syrian forces operating in the general area. If that deal falters, Israel could easily find itself facing a complicated mix of Syrian, Russian, and Iranian forces along the shared boundary. Israel, as well as the United States, might also find they have few willing partners left in the region to oppose those forces, having ostensibly cast them aside in this attempt to get Iran off the border. As always when it comes to the conflict in and around Syria , there is a significant potential for any subsequent crisis to rapidly escalate into a larger conflagration. Assad could seek to play his Russian and Iranian benefactors off of each other while at the same time attempting to reassert himself in southern Syria to include parts of the Golan. Syrian President Bashar Al Assad during a meeting with Putin in May 2018., Mikhael Klimentyev/Sputnik via AP Israel is unlikely to find that any more acceptable than Iranian forces massed along their border in Syria and could decide to take unilateral action if the United Nations proves incapable of forcing Assad to temper his ambitions. Regardless of the outcome, the regime in Damascus would be hard pressed to ever completely deny Iran and Iranian-backed militias the freedom to at least harass Israeli, which serves its own interests. And with Trump still looking to extricate the United States from Syria broadly , it’s not clear how or if the U.S. government might seek to intervene in any potential crisis. As already noted, the U.S. military’s existing partners in southern Syria already feel spurned and might decide to pursue their own agendas with backing from where ever they can find it . That reality could create yet another layer of complexity in the region in general. All told, the Syrian push toward Daraa could fundamentally change the political and military landscape along the border with Israel. That its air defenses are still shooting at potentially hostile drones shows that whatever deals Israel may have made with Russia, or anyone else the region, may not necessarily be as long-lasting and robust as they hoped.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 24, 2019",The Presidential Motorcade Has A New Mysterious And Sinister Looking Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Presidential Motorcade, like Air Force One, is a symbol of American might and the center of great attention, both positive and negative, wherever it hits the streets. Two years ago we published the definitive guide to this rolling armada, and although vehicle model types get updated on a rotating basis and a new antenna appears here or there, it has largely stayed the same. At least until this week, when a new, intimidating looking vehicle showed up at the tail-end of the high profile procession. The mysterious new vehicle in question is hardier looking than its peers, with a Ford F350 Super Duty six-door conversion truck acting as a base platform. But the hulking customized truck isn’t what’s likely to grab people’s attention the most. It’s the big, gloss black, bubble-like enclosure on top of the vehicle that’s most conspicuous. You can see this new truck speeding to keep up with the motorcade as the column hauls its way towards to Capitol yesterday: https://youtube.com/watch?v=F8CDp_VI4ks Luckily, White House bureau chief for Dallas Morning News, Todd Gillman, was able to snap a close-up pic of the truck when President Trump was at Trump International Hotel, and you can see how the vehicle is nearly impossible to miss. Steve’s tweet started an interesting thread of speculation as to what this vehicle is for and what the dome does on top of it. Everything from 360 high-resolution imaging systems to lasers were mentioned. And quite honestly, most of the suggestions were not so far-fetched. Solid-state lasers and the systems used to target them are going to become a necessity in the years to come when it comes to VVIP protection, something I have been talking about for years . Combined with electronic countermeasures, these systems will be essential when it comes to protecting high-valued targets from hobby-like drone attacks. Spherical continuous imaging systems paired with facial recognition software is like the wide-area aerial surveillance of the land domain and it’s going to be an emerging capability in the future. Albeit, in this case, taking up a rear position while wielding such a system doesn’t make much sense. The answer as to this new vehicle’s purpose seems to be fairly clear to me, but it’s much less exotic than the aforementioned suggestions. There are a number of companies that offer six door conversions for trucks. They aren’t cheap, but adding extra space for equipment techs, as well as extra hardware, is probably a highly valued for this mission., stretchmytruck.com It looks like the White House Communications Agency and the Secret Service have received a new and much improved “Roadrunner.” Roadrunner has one of the most critical jobs in the entire motorcade, keeping the President and their entire support apparatus connected to the outside world while barreling through concrete canyons and crowded highways. As such, it also has a critical command and control function to play. In decades past, this capability mainly included secure voice communications and coordination services for key personnel, but today it is far more complicated than that, with the internet and streaming services being a critical tool for everyone to have at their fingertips. With this in mind, Roadrunner is constantly on the run developmentally speaking. It has to adapt to changing times and technologies—incorporating new systems while decommissioning old ones—all the while still maintaining constant and reliable service for the President’s daily travels. It is a very complicated and high stakes proposition, to say the least. In my The Fascinating Anatomy Of The Presidential Motorcade feature, I described Roadrunner as such: “Roadrunner, also known as the Mobile Command and Control Vehicle, is one of the most conspicuous vehicles in Motorcade. A beefed-up Suburban, it houses a large satellite communications array and posts an antenna farm along its roof-line. This vehicle keeps the President and White House officials securely connected to the world, providing encrypted voice, internet and video communications via the Pentagon’s constellation of hardened communications satellites. This vehicle may also be able to handle communications for nuclear arms release. Roadrunner also helps facilitate secure communications within the Motorcade itself. Think of it as a big rolling data encryption center, wifi hotspot, radio repeater and doomsday communications control center.” So beyond providing what is akin to a highly-secure rolling router and making sure the President can order a nuclear strike from The Beast at any given time, the White House Communications Agency and the Secret Service have to work directly with the USAF and USMC to keep all of the President’s aircraft up to the latest standard as well. In fact, Air Force One just went through a similar satellite communications upgrade that brings far higher bandwidth and networking capabilities to the flying White House. This upgrade was part of a move to migrate away from the old Milstar , Satellite Communications System Phase III, and some UHF satellite communications networks and onto Advanced Extremely High-Frequency network and the Global Wideband network , both of which are becoming the DoD’s go-to space-based communications gateways. It’s not hard to imagine that the newest and baddest of the Roadrunner family brings the same communications advances to the ground-mobile environment. Similar White House communications and command and control capability improvements have been underway in recent years, including what by almost all accounts was the construction of a new emergency operations bunker under the White House lawn off the West Wing. On-the-move satcoms are pretty amazing to watch in action without their domes. They can take a beating and still keep aligned with satellites above: These large, vehicular based ‘on-the-move’ satcom systems are not necessarily new either. Derived from maritime systems, other federal government agencies, the military, and state governments also field similar systems. For instance, Nevada’s Division of Emergency Management fields a small fleet of vehicles equipped with large satcom systems mounted on Chevy Suburbans that are capable of everything from receiving and sending television broadcasts, to providing internet networking, and phone service at remote locales. The U.S. military has been fielding similar capabilities for nearly a decade but has made seamless on-the-move networking a top priority in recent years. Nevada State Government In the past, Roadrunner was seen fitted with a GV2432 UHF satcom antenna , and more recently, a larger, cake-shaped array, along with other aerials. So it’s not hard to imagine that this new, albeit more noticeable system offers a huge leap in capacity. The photo taken by Steve Herman of the new vehicle also shows a UHF satellite communications antenna attached to the roof mounting system. A previous Roadrunner on the move. This vehicle is a far more pedestrian affair compared to the new souped-up truck. , Paul Carter Our best guess is that this new configuration is something akin to an adaptation of the General Dynamics Next Generation Point of Presence (POP) enhancement to the Warfighter Information Net-Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 2 system . This system provides high capacity, hardened, secure, on-the-move satellite connectivity, and local area networking. The system is the backbone of the U.S. Army’s tactical communications roadmap and you can read all about it in detail here , with the POP vehicle’s most prominent feature being a Ku/Ka band satellite antenna system. General Dynamics General Dynamics The Presidential Motorcade’s newest member is likely to get some special media attention in the coming months as it heads away from Washington, D.C. on missions to places where the motorcade is far from a normal sight. In the meantime, it’s good to know that the President, their staff, and the Secret Service, has the ability to communicate better than ever before while on-the-move.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Friday, June 22nd, 2018, an A-29 Super Tucano light attack plane crashed on the Red Rio Bombing and Gunnery Range located north of Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. The USAF’s second phase of the Light Attack Experiment was set to officially begin later that day at Holloman, in which the AT-6 and A-29 would demonstrate their capabilities. The A-29 crashed before the maneuvers began and we heard one of its two crew escaped the incident with minor injuries, with no further information being released about the second flyer’s condition. Sadly, we now have confirmation that the second crewman died as a result of the mishap. The pilot was identified by the U.S. Navy as Lt. Christopher Casey Short from Canandaigua, New York. In an official statement, Col. Houston Cantwell, commander of Holloman’s 49th Wing, said: “There’s no way to describe the shock of this loss and the sadness we feel for his family. He did pioneering work in aviation that will help shape American air power for years to come. We’re thankful to have known him and grateful for his devotion to duty.” Short’s Facebook page has pictures of him flying F/A-18s and a number of photos of VFC-12 “Fighting Omars” aggressor Hornets, which belong to the Navy Reserve. Often times Navy Reserve pilots work for contractors in a flying role, which would make sense in this case although we have no definitive information at this point of this being the case. Regardless, this is a terrible loss to the Sierra Nevada Corporation/Embraer and Navy families to which Short belonged to. The accident is under investigation and we don’t even know the nature of mishap at this time. The A-29 is a proven light attack platform that serves in often harsh conditions for a number of operators around the globe. The USAF flies the aircraft to training foreign students, namely those of the Afghan Air Force. One USAF A-29 crash did occur in 2017 that involved an A-29 losing power , resulting in both pilots ejecting. Nobody died in that incident. The crash is certain to loom large over the USAF’s Light Attack Experiment and a struggling initiative to field either the A-29 or the AT-6 to Air Force combat squadrons. The USMC is also looking to procure a similar aircraft but for somewhat different purposes. In fact, at this time we don’t even know if the second flight demonstration phase of the program will continue at Holloman AFB in the coming week. We will keep you informed as new info becomes available, but in the meantime, our deepest condolences go out to the Lieutenant’s family, friends, squadron mates, and co-workers.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 20, 2018",DARPA’s Amazing Reconfigurable Wheel Tracks Go From Wheel To Track In Two Seconds Flat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s one of the biggest trade-offs in mechanized warfare—the efficiency of a wheel or the go-anywhere capability of the track. Wheels are far more adept at speeding over roads and semi-improved surfaces, while tracks own the sand, mud, and snow, as well as crumbling urban surfaces, mediums that can leave even the hardiest wheeled vehicles in a world of hurt. DARPA, along with their partners at Carnegie Mellon University’s National Robotics Engineering Center, have come up with an amazing solution to this problem—a transformer of sorts that can go from wheel to track in two seconds flat. The Reconfigurable Wheel Tracks initiative has emerged under the Ground X-Vehicle Technologies (GXV-T) program ran by the Pentagon’s famed ‘bleeding-edge’ research and development agency. GXV-T covers a number of technologies and applications, and DARPA describes the program’s aims as “improving mobility, survivability, safety, and effectiveness of future combat vehicles without piling on armor.” According to DARPA , the overall program has the following structure: GXV-T’s technical goals include the following improvements relative to today’s armored fighting vehicles: Reduce vehicle size and weight by 50 percent Reduce onboard crew needed to operate vehicle by 50 percent Increase vehicle speed by 100 percent Access 95 percent of terrain Reduce signatures that enable adversaries to detect and engage vehicles The GXV-T program seeks to develop advanced technologies in the following four technical areas: Radically Enhanced Mobility—Ability to traverse diverse off-road terrain, including slopes and various elevations. Capabilities of interest include revolutionary wheel/track and suspension technologies that would enable greater terrain access and faster travel both on- and off-road compared to existing ground vehicles. Survivability through Agility—Autonomously avoid incoming threats without harming occupants through technologies that enable, for example, agile motion and active repositioning of armor. Capabilities of interest include vertical and horizontal movement of armor to defeat incoming threats in real time. Crew Augmentation—Improved physical and electronically assisted situational awareness for crew and passengers; semi-autonomous driver assistance and automation of key crew functions similar to capabilities found in modern commercial airplane cockpits. Capabilities of interest include high-resolution, 360-degree visualization of data from multiple onboard sensors and technologies to support closed-cockpit vehicle operations. Signature Management—Reduction of detectable signatures, including visible, infrared (IR), acoustic and electromagnetic (EM). Capabilities of interest include improved ways to avoid detection and engagement by adversaries. Phase two of the program’s contract winners recently demonstrated what they have been working on, and this is where Carnegie Mellon’s Reconfigurable Wheel Tracks first appeared. Check them out in action at time index 2:20 in the video below: This incredibly innovative and futuristic system is part of Radically Enhanced Mobility portion of the GXV-T program. DARPA describes it and the tracks in a press release , stating: Radically Enhanced Mobility: GXV-T envisions future combat vehicles that could traverse up to 95 percent of off-road terrain, including slopes and various elevations. Capabilities include revolutionary wheel-to-track and suspension technologies that would enable access and faster travel both on- and off-road, compared to existing ground vehicles. Reconfigurable Wheel-Track (RWT): Wheels permit fast travel on hard surfaces while tracks perform better on soft surfaces. A team from Carnegie Mellon University National Robotics Engineering Center (CMU NREC) demonstrated shape-shifting wheel-track mechanisms that transition from a round wheel to a triangular track and back again while the vehicle is on the move, for instant improvements to tactical mobility and maneuverability on diverse terrains. Such a capability could be downright revolutionary if it were to make it to an operational state. But just because it works for a technological demonstration, doesn’t mean it is anywhere near being ready for combat operations. Cost, complexity, and durability are all key questions that would have to be answered if the system were to make it into production. But even if those hurdles remain somewhat steep, such a capability could be worth the headaches they may cause in an operational state for certain users. The USMC in particular, which focuses on executing transitional fights from the beach to inland locales , could make great use of this technology on Humvees and Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs). Even larger armored personnel carriers could leverage a form of the technology. Equipping scout/reconnaissance and special operations vehicles with such a system also makes some sense as they may venture where road conditions are unknown, and with little fire support for protection. Being able to morph between wheels and tracks at an instant, and thus offering high-speed and rugged terrain access flexibility, could literally mean the difference between life and death. USMC JLTV fitted with chains for snow operations. , Oshkosh Defense There are also huge applications in the civilian market for this type of concept. Law enforcement, search and rescue, and emergency and disaster response teams could use this capability to plow through terrain that is inaccessible to wheeled vehicles, while still being able to retain a high-speed road capability as well. This could drastically reduce the timeframe for critical mobility operations and for the recovery of wounded personnel. Even farmers could make great use out of the concept. The thought of such a system becoming a reality, even in just a developmental state, is pretty amazing. This was the stuff of our far-fetched science fiction dreams just years ago. It will be very interesting to see where this technology goes, but it is likely headed somewhere beyond an experiment because the capability is just too sweet not to pursue on a grander level.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 27, 2018",Army Plans To Double Guided Artillery Rocket’s Range By Putting Control Fins On Its Tail,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has begun flight tests of a new variant of its 227mm guided artillery rocket that could eventually hit targets out to a maximum range of more than 85 miles. The new design will significantly increase the capability of the service’s tracked and truck-mounted launchers and comes amid a surge of artillery developments intended to help American troops defeat potential near-peer opponents, such as Russia, in a major conflict. Earlier in June 2018, the Army’s Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) disclosed the successful test at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, which had occurred months earlier. During this experiment, the rocket hit a target around 70 miles away, but the goal is to extend that range by at least another 15 miles. “The flight test couldn’t have gone better,” Brett Wilks, the head of the Tail Controlled Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (TC-GMLRS) project at AMRDEC, said afterward. “We collected massive amounts of in-flight data on sub-component performance and environment conditions that will be very useful to the entire MLRS Family of Munitions.” As its name would imply, the improved rocket design has its flight control surfaces in the tail. The existing Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System ( GMLRS ) rocket has its control section in the nose, which the Army has found limit the maximum range of the weapon. GMLRS, which has a maximum range of around 43 miles, first entered production in 2003. The Army, along with the Marines, who also employ the weapon, has since been working on a joint project to extend its range. With the fins on the tail, the new version of the rocket can be much more aerodynamic, helping it to fly further. It’s not clear whether TC-GMLRS will feature an improved motor, as well. The weapon does require a new guidance package to account for the change in position of the control fins. The improved rockets still use a GPS/INS guidance system to steer them to their targets, limiting them to engaging static targets. In the future, the Army could potentially consider adding in a laser-guidance package , especially since there is now free space in the nose. This could allow troops on the ground, as well as manned or unmanned aircraft, to cue the weapons to engage moving targets, but could again impact its overall range. So far, it appears that the design with the tail-mounted control surfaces is just as accurate as the existing type. In the March 2018 flight test, the prototype TC-GMLRS rocket, which did not have a live warhead in it at the time, plowed almost straight down into the ground within two meters of the designated target. Members of the Army’s TC-GMLRS team stand next to the hole the prototype weapon left at White Sands Missile Range right next to the marker indicating the intended impact point., US Army AMRDEC employed an M270 tracked launcher to conduct the experiment, but the rocket will work with the truck-mounted M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), as well. The added range significantly expands the total target area that both systems can cover, making them more flexible, even in smaller numbers, and able to rapidly refocus from providing fire support in one area to another without necessarily having to relocate. For HIMARS, the improved rockets could be especially important when combined with the system’s existing mobility and air-portability. The Army, as well as the Marines, trains to rapidly deploy these truck-mounted launchers via U.S. Air Force cargo planes and quickly get them into action to support distributed and expeditionary operations . The added range would only expand the number of potential locations where aircraft could drop the vehicles off. It could also reduce the total time it might take to get the launchers into position, which could be particularly important for engaging time-sensitive or otherwise fleeing targets before they can relocate. In May 2018, the Army used HIMARS to level a building in Afghanistan where approximately 50 Taliban leaders were meeting. This highlighted the value of the existing system as a way to rapidly respond to actionable intelligence, as well as requests for fire support from troops. TC-GMLRS could give the Army and Marines a better tool to strike deeper into hostile territory to rain death and destruction down on enemy forces well behind the front lines, especially at forward bases and other assembly areas. The extra range also means American artillery units can provide fire support with less of a threat of immediate counterattack from hostile forces. The Army says this latter point was a particularly important factor in the development of the longer-range 227mm rocket. The service says it has identified nearly 70 foreign rocket artillery systems – including those in the hands of non-state actors – that have a range that is the same or greater than that of GMLRS. Potential opponents, such as Russia and China, are also developing guidance kits for these systems that could make them even more effective. Russian rocket artillery has been a major factor in keeping Ukrainian forces from retaking positions from separatists and could help them control constrained environments in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea regions during any future crisis. China could use these weapons, combined with its longer-range anti-ship cruise missiles and air defense systems, to further dominate areas it controls in the Pacific, especially in the South China Sea . Smaller nation-states and non-state groups, such as Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah , increasingly have access to powerful rocket artillery systems. This means that TC-GMLRS will be an important weapon in any limited conflict, too. In addition to supporting operations in Afghanistan, HIMARS has proven to be invaluable in the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria just with the existing GMLRS rockets. “We’ve got to push the maximum range of all systems under development for close, deep and strategic, and we have got to outgun the enemy,” U.S. Army General Robert Brown, head of U.S. Army Pacific Command, declared at panel discussion at the Association of the U.S. Army’s Global Force Symposium in March 2018 , the same month as the TC-GMLRS test. “We don’t do that right now; it’s a huge gap. … We need cannons that fire as far as rockets today. We need rockets that fire as far as today’s missiles, and we need missiles out to 499 kilometers [approximately 310 miles].” Depending on how many components the TC-GMLRS shares with the existing rockets, it could be one of the more cost-effective initiatives the Army is pursuing. The service is also looking into a variety of other artillery weapons , including ramjet-powered shells for its howitzers, new short-range quasi-ballistic missiles , and even ground-based railguns . The TC-GMLRS rocket right after launch during the initial flight test in March 2018., US Army And in addition to the Army and Marines, the improved rockets are likely to be of interest to other U.S. allies and partners who operate both the tracked M270 and wheeled M142 already. This could help spread the cost burden of procuring batches of new, tail-controlled rockets in the future. It’s not clear when the TC-GMRLS might be ready for production for any customer. though. The service hasn’t said when the second flight test, which will see the weapon fly to its maximum range of around 86 miles, will occur. The Army is clearly making significant strides in the project, which looks set to make its rocket artillery units, and their cousins in the Marine Corps, even deadlier than they are already.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 20, 2018","The Air Force Wants Its B-52s To Carry Mysterious 20,000lb Weapons Under Their Wings","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking into purchasing new pylons for its B-52H bombers that could allow them to carry multiple 20,000-pound class weapons under each wing. This would allow the aircraft to carry almost any bomb or missile the service has in inventory now and could be a prelude to integrating new weapons, such as air-launched hypersonic cruise missiles , onto the planes in the future. On June 21, 2018, the Air Force Materiel Command revealed it was interested in acquiring what it calls the Heavy Release Capability (HRC) pylons as part of the B-52 Heavy Weapon Release Pylon Program in a notice on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps. The formal request for information says the service wants to get to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, which involves work on an actual prototype system and would last approximately 72 months, as quickly as possible. The HRC equipment would replace the existing Improved Common Pylon (ICP) that the B-52Hs use today. The ICP, in combination with the Heavy Stores Adapter Beam (HSAB) multiple ejector rack, can only accommodate weapons up to the 5,000-pound class. “When it [the ICP] was introduced, there wasn’t a requirement nor did anyone foresee a need to carry weapons heavier than 5,000 pounds,” Air Force Materiel Command said in its request for information. The “pylon will require an internal multi-hook type release mechanism capable of carrying multiple weapons in the 5,000 pound to 20,000 pound weight class.” An Air Force technician secures GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMS) on a B-52’s underwing pylon., USAF The notice says the pylon itself can’t weight more 5,000 pounds. It also refers to “current heavy weapons exceeding 5,000 pounds,” but does not specify any system in particular. So the question quickly becomes, what weapon or weapons does the Air Force expect the B-52 to carry using the more capable HRC pylons? None of the bomber’s typical load outs include weapons even close to the existing 5,000-pound limitation. The nuclear-armed AGM-86B Air Launched Cruise Missile and its conventional derivatives are both less than 3,500 pounds. It is unlikely that the future Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) will be significantly heavier. Even the B-52-launched X-51 Waverider hypersonic demonstrator vehicle had an empty weight of approximately 4,000 pounds. An X-51 Waverider under the wing of a B-52 attached to the Heavy Stores Adapter Beam on the existing Improved Common Pylon., USAF The last time B-52s were called upon to carry a weapon in a weight class between 5,000 and 20,000 pounds, was during the 1960s and 70s when the Air Force called upon the bombers to deliver the 10,000-pound class AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. The abortive AGM-48 Skybolt that was supposed to replace those weapons had a similar weight. Since the Air Force specifically says the requirement for the HRC pylon is based on a “current” weapon, one immediate possibility is that the Air Force is interested in giving the aircraft the ability to carry the massive GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), also known as the “Mother of All Bombs.” This huge air-bursting weapon offers a devastating capability against exposed targets over a wide area. It also particularly effective at destroying caves and tunnel complexes with its blast wave, which can suck the air of individuals’ lungs and cause massive internal injuries from the overpressure in a confined space. A B-52G carries a pair of AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles., USAF Unfortunately, the MOAB is also too big to fit inside the B-52’s internal bomb bay. At present, Air Force Special Operations Command MC-130 special operations transport aircraft are the only planes that can employ this 20,000-pound class air-bursting weapon and typically only carry one at a time on a pallet inside their cargo bay. The Air Force would need to modify the GBU-43/B to be work with any underwing rack. A B-52 carrying multiple MOABs would offer a dramatically increased capability and could fly higher and further than the smaller MC-130s. This could give the Air Force more flexibility in employing the weapon and the potential to do so in higher-risk scenarios. In April 2017, the service dropped the first GBU-43/B ever over Afghanistan , an entirely permissive airspace environment. Otherwise, there are few other obvious weapon systems that would require the HRC pylons. The bombers can already carry the GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), which is designed to burrow deep into hardened facilities far underground, internally, but has only done so in testing. The Air Force envisions employing these bombs almost exclusively for strikes against targets deep in denied areas where the B-52 would be unable to survive. As such, the service says the only platform set up to carry the MOPs on actual operations is the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber . The GBU-57/B is in the 30,000-pound weight class, which would make it too heavy for even the new HRC pylon anyway. A B-52 bomber drops a GBU-57/B MOP during a test., USAF It is also worth noting that the Air Force and NASA have also employed B-52s with specialized underwing pylons and stores racks to test a variety of large experimental air vehicles and rockets. It is possible that the firms who have supplied that equipment in the past could adapt one of those designs to carry whatever weapons the Air Force has in mind for HRC-equipped bombers. The remaining possibility is that the B-52s need the HRC pylons to support a potentially still-classified weapon system that is either in development or has reached some level of limited operational capability. Even if the bombers were simply supposed to act as the testbed for a new bomb or missile in the 5,000- to 20,000-pound weight class, the Air Force would need to ensure it has the capability to do so now. A NASA B-52 takes off carrying the X-43A hypersonic research vehicle on a specialized underwing mount during a test in 2001., NASA We know that in April 2018, the Air Force handed Lockheed Martin a contract worth nearly $1 billion for development of an air-breathing, air-launched hypersonic cruise missile. The service has also been working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on the separate Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) program. Other services, in cooperation with the Defense Department’s secretive Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), are pursuing other hypersonic weapons, as well. A recent hack of a still unknown U.S. defense contractor led to the exposure of additional details about the Navy’s still-classified Sea Dragon hypersonic submarine-launched anti-ship cruise missile program. An official briefing slide from 2017 outlining US Air FOrce work on hypersonic weapons, include the HAWC., USAF The Pentagon has been supporting that project directly by way of the SCO through funding set aside for “advanced innovative technologies.” The same section in the annual defense budget includes other classified efforts that could require the HRC pylons. These include “Alternate Strike,” which seeks to reconfigure existing weapons for use on different launch platforms to expand their flexibility, and “Breaker,” a long-range weapon for both ground- and air-launched applications. Another effort, called Strike-X “leverages existing long-range strike capabilities and develops alternative Concepts of Employment (CONEMP) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) to deliver near-term innovative long-range strike capabilities to Combatant Commanders.” We at The War Zone have already presented compelling evidence that Sea Dragon could be an outgrowth of apparently defunct Revolutionary Approach To Time-critical Long Range Strike program, or RATTLRS . This Navy-led project sought to develop a cruise missile with a high supersonic speed that sea or air platforms could employ. A mockup of the RATTLRS missile., ONR via f-16.net Lockheed Martin was heavily involved in that program, as well, and had produced full-size mockups of the proposed weapon that evoked the size and shape of their Cold War-era D-21 drone . The D-21 was an 11,000-pound unmanned reconnaissance platform that was originally paired with an M-21 mothership derived from the A-12 spy plane . Difficulties in that arrangement led Lockheed to develop a system that allowed B-52s to launch the drones. The bombers would be a good option to carry any RATTLRS-derived weapon, as well. A B-52 carrying a pair of D-21 drones., USAF In March 2018, Lockheed Martin notably brought out an old model of the RATTLRS missile to the Air Force Association’s annual Air War Symposium, but without any real explanation as to why. It is possible that this could have been an effort to showcase the firm’s existing experience leading into the hypersonic cruise missile project, too. The RATTLRS project also focused heavily on the anti-ship role, which might be a future capability of any hypersonic cruise missile-armed B-52 in the future. Late in the Cold War, the Air Force configured a number of B-52G as ship-killers carrying AGM-84 Harpoon missiles. Given increasing concerns about the growing naval capabilities among potential near peer-opponents, such as Russia and China , the Air Force has been working on restoring the anti-ship capabilities of both B-52 and B-1 bombers. On June 21, 2018, the service announced it the 28th Bomb Wing and its B-1s at Ellsworth Air Force Base would be the first to return to this role armed with AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). Lastly, the larger “weapons” the Air Force might be looking to integrate onto the B-52s using the new pylons may actually be air-launched unmanned combat air vehicles. The Air Force Research Laboratory has been working on a number of conceptual armed, lower cost drones as part of the Low Cost Attritable Strike ( LCAS ) and Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology ( LCAAT ) programs. A B-52 would be a perfect platform to carry those drones closer to the target area, effectively extending their range and potentially helping them penetrate deeper into denied areas. It might even be able to recover them at the end of a mission, a concept the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is also working on as part of its Gremlins drone swarm program . A briefing slide from 2017 that gives an overview of Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program., USAF But adding any such long-range, super-fast strike weapon, or other type of advanced underwing store, to the B-52’s inventory would help keep those aircraft viable during higher-end conflicts in the decades to come. The Air Force is separately looking to re-engine the bombers to make them more cost-effective to fly through at least 2040. Without an improved stand-off capability, the bombers will still find themselves only increasingly vulnerable to hostile fighters , advanced enemy air defenses , and associated long-range sensors . The HRC pylons could help the Air Force turn the B-52s into flying hypersonic missile trucks that would offer increased flexibility during a crisis. In 2016, the service had raised the possibility of expanding the bomber’s ability to carrying smaller conventional bombs and missiles, turning it into an “ arsenal ship ” that could orbit over or near the battlefield providing support across a wide area. The new weapons racks would be well in line with this concept and would expand the available weapons the aircraft could carry in that role. And combined with a high-supersonic or hypersonic cruise missile, the planes could have the ability to rapidly engage critical time-sensitive targets, including pop-up air defenses, mobile nuclear-capable ballistic missile launchers and other advanced weapons, and even senior elements of an enemy’s regime , while operating safely at the edge of an opponent’s integrated air defense network. Of course, even if the bombers just end up being able to carry multiple MOABs into a limited conflict zone, such as Afghanistan, it would be a fearsome capability. Given the Air Force’s aggressive planned schedule to develop the HRC pylons, we may not have to wait long to see what the service actually has in store next for the venerable B-52s.

Last night I was sent a gem of a video from one of our readers that is not only fascinating and entertaining but also topical. Top Gun has grown into a unique social phenomenon, but with the sequel finally being shot, its place in America’s consciousness is reaching all new heights. So this ‘behind the scenes’ video shot by the USS Enterprise’s media shop while the film was in production aboard the carrier is really a time capsule of footage worth watching. At the time, Top Gun the film didn’t even exist in the Navy’s lexicon and its actors, including Tom Cruise, Anthony Edwards, and Tim Robbins were still somewhat fresh faces on the silver screen. Tony Scott, who also sat for the interview, wasn’t a huge name in Hollywood just yet either. And as you can see for yourself, there was a lot of Maverick and Goose in Cruise and Edwards even before the final cut hit theaters. When asked what it was like arriving on a carrier at sea for the first time, Anthony Edwards quipped “I had an erection.” You can hear Cruise respond “oh my god…” It might as well have been an exchange between the two from the movie. The video also includes some behind-the-scenes footage shot on the carrier. You can imagine the buzz around the ship about the movie being filmed on its deck and in its passageways, yet most sailors wouldn’t ever get a glimpse of the production or its stars. It’s amazing to think that even over three decades since Top Gun hit theaters we are still finding out more about its production. I have done multiple stories on this alone, including giving a behind-the-scenes view of the making of the film by an actual Topgun instructor that was working at the school at the time—David “Bio” Baranek—who wrote the must-read book Topgun Days . The Navy’s Fighter Weapons School was still somewhat obscure at the time, at least to the public, but after the film was released that all changed dramatically. You can read all about being a Topgun instructor during the era and taming the Tomcat in these past tell-all features ( here , here , here , and here ). History is now repeating itself as the hype machine for Top Gun 2 spins up .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Canada’s meandering CF-18 Hornet replacement saga continues to roll forward at a glacial pace. But the groundwork is being laid for a grand fighter competition that could be worth as much as $15B and will conclude in the coming decade. As a reflection of the spiraling relationship between the Trump and Trudeau administrations, not to mention the growing trade dispute between the longtime allies and neighbors, Canada may deeply inhibit the chances of the F-35 and F/A-18E/F winning the vaunted contract. Reuters reports that a plan is being discussed that would penalize candidate fighter manufacturers from countries that have inflicted economic damage on Canada. At least at this point in time, such a move would obviously target the U.S. and its entrants into the contest, both of which are thought to be favorites to win within many defense and aerospace circles. As a result, European competitors EF2000, Rafale, and Gripen-E, would gain a newfound advantage over their American counterparts. Norwegian MOD Clearly, this could be an action by Trudeau to remind the Trump administration that it will act in its own way if tariffs are raised on various products and an agreement on reforming NAFTA is not reached. The final decision to inject this type of penalty into the fighter tender is to come expected sometime next year when the competition’s rules and requirements are set in stone, so there is still time to reverse the decision even if it gets made in the near term. AP After another major trade dispute, albeit one that was aerospace related, derailed Ottawa’s plan to purchase Super Hornets as an interim measure, Canada turned to Australia and its second-hand F/A-18A/B Hornets to help bolster the RCAF’s tired legacy Hornet force. Originally, 18 of those planes were eyed for purchase and eventual operations with RCAF after receiving life-extension and still undefined capability enhancing upgrades . Now that number has been pushed up to 25. The additional airframes will end up being used for spare parts and for training and testing purposes. The cost of the exact deal and what it all includes beyond the airframes themselves is still unknown but the Ottawa Citizen states that $500M (Canadian) has been put aside for the entire program. This is a significant amount of money for an initiative that primarily includes just 18 flyable Hornets that were manufactured in the 1980s. Australian F/A-18A., AP The U.S. still has to approve the transfer of the used Hornets from Australia to Canada, which was expected to be a non-issue, although it is now possible that the Trump administration could use it as a fulcrum in the ongoing trade dispute with their neighbors to the north. But doing so could shatter defense industrial and military-to-military ties between the U.S. and Canada, which include cornerstone military cooperation programs like NORAD. On the other hand, if everything goes as plan, the jets will start arriving in Canada in the first half of 2019. Currently, the RCAF has roughly 76 Hornets in service, the last of which is slated to fly till 2032. The next generation fighter program looks to purchase 88 airframes in total.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 21, 2018",U.S. Intel Says China To Have Railgun-Armed Ships By 2025,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In January 2018 , pictures appeared on social media of the Haiyang Shan , one of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Type 072III-class landing ships, packing an experimental electromagnetic railgun in a huge turret on its bow. Now, the U.S. Intelligence Community reportedly believes this weapon, or one similar to it, will be operational onboard one of China’s warships by 2025. CNBC was first to report on the U.S. intelligence analysis of the Chinese program on June 21, 2018. In March 2018, China’s state-run media had confirmed that the Haiyang Shan was conducting at-sea tests of the weapon, which had already gone through thousands of tests on land, but offered few specific details about its capabilities. China’s interest in electromagnetic weapons dates back at least to the 1980s , but it has been claiming to have made especially significant strides in recent years . The official U.S. review reportedly says the Chinese electromagnetic cannon can hit targets nearly 125 miles away and fires projectiles at more than seven times the speed of sound. If accurate, this would mean the weapon would be able to strike targets out to its maximum range in a timeframe best measured in seconds. This is significantly further than the maximum range of any modern naval guns and way faster than even advanced anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles . It also means that it is capable of lobbing projectiles faster than the U.S. Navy’s own prototype design, which has yet to go to sea. A low-quality image of the Haiyang Shan, with its experimental railgun under wraps, in January 2018., Chinese Internet It’s the kind of potentially game-changing capability that has made the idea of a practical railgun attractive for navies and ground forces around the world for decades. Chinese ships with these weapons would be able to engage targets across a much broader area, potentially increasing the vectors of attack an enemy force at sea or on land might have to worry about and disrupting their plans. The ships would also be more flexible and better able to quickly shift their attention to emerging threats and fleeting targets. In theory, electromagnetic guns are especially well suited to that latter category of time-sensitive strikes, since they are so hard to defend against, striking with almost no warning and giving an opponent little chance to move critical assets or evacuate from key sites. Given the high speed of the projectiles they fire, the weapons could potentially take on other roles in the future, too. The U.S. Navy has envisioned its ships using railguns to shoot down manned and unmanned aircraft and incoming cruise and ballistic missiles. An official US Navy graphic showing the possible missions for the service’s future electromagnetic railguns and traditional weapons firing a similar, hyper-velocity projectile., USN According to CNBC’s report, the rounds that the Chinese have been using cost approximately between $25,000 and $50,000 each. This would make them more expensive than standard naval gun shells, but cheaper than projectiles with GPS or other guidance packages that would work in those same weapons. No cannon firing typical ammunition of any kind would be able to match the railgun’s range though and this price point is significantly cheaper than any sub- or supersonic sea-launched cruise missile . It’s also cheaper than the present price of the Navy’s experimental Hyper Velocity Projectile, or HVP, which has a unit cost of around $86,000 . That service, together with the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, is hoping to use this round to get speeds of at least Mach 3 out of existing naval guns and ground-based howitzers. The maximum range of those weapons combined with the new ammunition still wouldn’t be anywhere near that of an actual railgun. A look at the potential capabilities of the HVP combined with various existing guns compared to the speed and range an actual railgun offers., USN The possibility that China will be fielding operational, railgun-armed ships within the next decade could push the Navy to redouble its own efforts to develop an electromagnetic weapon. At present, the service doesn’t expect to conduct its own at sea test until 2019 at the earliest. “China’s hypersonic weapons development outpaces ours … we’re falling behind,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, then head of the top U.S. military command in the Pacific, told members of Congress in February 2018. “We need to continue to pursue that and in a most aggressive way to ensure that we have the capabilities to both defend against China’s hypersonic weapons and to develop our own offensive hypersonic weapons.” The CNBC report does not say what ship or ships the Chinese plan to install the railgun on operationally. Historically, the limiting factors for railguns have been the immense power they require. In turn, this requires additional space to house the elaborate electrical infrastructure and the equipment necessary to keep everything, including the weapon itself, cool during sustained firing. The experimental turret on the Haiyang Shan is already significantly bigger than any other large caliber gun mounts in the Chinese fleet. The huge turret housing the prototype railgun on the Haiyang Shan. , Chinese Internet The range the railgun offers might allow China to consider deploying it operationally on an amphibious warfare vessel, such as the Type 072III, or even a logistics ship . A striking distance of more than 120 miles could put them out of range of most immediate counterattacks and they could also operate within the safety of a larger surface task force. Of course, The U.S. Navy, among others , is in the process of developing a hypersonic sea-launched anti-ship missile, called Sea Dragon , which would be able to quickly respond to the threat posed by a railgun equipped ship. If China has truly developed a practical naval railgun, they could look to install additional examples, or derivatives thereof, in land-based mounts, as well. The U.S. Army is similarly developing its own electromagnetic cannon to support ground operations in a way it simply cannot do with traditional artillery and missile systems . If the Chinese were to deploy these weapons on their various man-made outposts in the South China Sea , it would only further limit the ability of a potential opponent to operate in that region. If the system were at all mobile or air transportable it could be even more flexible in a ground-based role. Whatever concepts of operation the Chinese might be considering, what is clear is that the country is rapidly expanding both the size and capability of its naval forces. The electromagnetic railgun project is itself tangential to reports of work on an electromagnetic aircraft catapult system that China could install in its next domestically produced aircraft carrier. On June 20, 2018, new computer generated imagery emerged online that showed a future carrier in a catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) configuration. China’s two existing aircraft carriers both have a short take-off but arrested recovery (STOBAR) setup that features a large ski jump at the bow. The expansion of the People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN, goes far beyond flattops, though. China is building surface ships, submarines, and other craft at a prodigious rate. Our own Tyler Rogoway recently examined this build-up, writing : “The fact that China has been able to realize such a massive expansion of its naval forces, both in terms of quality and quantity, prompts the big question: what will the  PLAN look like in another decade? This haunting concern is one of the largest driving factors behind the U.S. Navy’s 355 ship fleet ambitions, which are going to be a major challenge to realize without a dramatic restructuring of its procurement priorities , existing fleet sustainment practices , and facilities management . “With the Pentagon’s shift to ‘great power competition’ under Secretary Mattis, and with China now America’s top technological peer competitor , its ever-strengthening Navy is sure to cast a long shadow on the DoD’s list of priorities. But if things continue to go as they are, and with a catapult equipped Chinese aircraft carrier , and possibly a nuclear one as well , on the horizon, the days of America’s outright supremacy on and below the high-seas may be coming to an end.” If the PLAN’s fleets actually include any significant number of railgun-equipped ships by 2025, as the U.S. intelligence assessment warns, it is even more likely that the era of near total United States naval supremacy in any prospective conflict, especially in Pacific Region, will have come to a close.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 19, 2018","Turkey’s F-35 Rollout Ceremony Got Pretty, Pretty, Weird","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Rollout events for major new combat aircraft are often flashy, overwrought affairs to begin with, but the Lockheed Martin event to celebrate the delivery of Turkey’s first completed F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was particularly over the top, featuring traditional music and song together with a dancer who performed at one point while wearing a pair massive leather wings that looked like something out of Leonardo Da Vinci’s notebooks . What this sometimes surreal celebration didn’t have was any direct reference to the very serious and steadily escalating political spat between the U.S. and Turkish governments that threatens to upend the stealth fighter deliveries over the latter country’s purchase of Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. Lockheed Martin hosted the ceremony on June 21, 2018, at its plant in Fort Worth, Texas that builds the F-35. In the near future, the Turkish Air Force will fly its two initial F-35As to Luke Air Force Base in Arizona to begin training alongside the U.S. Air Force and other international Joint Strike Fighter partners. Turkey has been actively involved in the F-35 program from the beginning and plans to purchase more than 100 of the jets in total, making it one of the largest customers to date. Turkish defense contractors are also involved in the production of certain components of the aircraft and are slated to provide maintenance support to other European customers in the future. “As you are all well aware, Turkey is located at the geostrategic and cultural crossroads between the East and the West,” Turkish Major General Reha Ufuk Er said during the event. “On the other hand, it’s geographic location and proximity to the conflict areas significantly increases the security challenges it faces. All of these factors necessitate that Turkey has robust capabilities to ensure her contribution to regional and global security environment.” Standing in front of the jet on the stage, the officer added that the F-35 was a “great asset” to help Turkey achieve its own security goals, as well as increasing the capabilities of the NATO alliance. It’s also worth noting that the aircraft was flanked by a 2,000-pound class bomb with the HGK GPS/INS guidance kit and a Stand Off Missile (SOM) air-launched cruise missile, two Turkish-made weapons the country plans to eventually integrate onto its version of the plane. “Turkey has allocated a significant amount of financial sources to this partnership and has provided an enormous contribution to the program from the very beginning,” Serdar Demirel, the Deputy head of Turkey’s Undersecretariat for Defense Industries, added separately. “As Turkey continues to serve global and peace and security as a reliable and committed NATO ally, the deployment of F-35s will help the protection of our security and territorial integrity of our country for future generations.” There’s no doubt that the F-35 would give the Turkish Air Force a significant boost in capability. But neither individual directly mentioned U.S. lawmakers were looking to find ways to block the transfer of the jets to Turkey over its S-400 purchase, as well as its arrest of a U.S. citizen in 2017, a saga you can read more about in detail here .  Demirel’s comments did seem to indirectly touch on the growing crisis by pointing out just how much Turkey is directly intertwined in the program. You can watch the full rollout ceremony below. The dance routine begins at around 33:30 in the video’s runtime. “I would like to say that, starting from the AA-1 [the first U.S. Air Force F-35A ], the first F-35 aircraft, there’s a part which is produced by the Turkish industry on every aircraft flying now,” he pointedly declared. “So, we are very proud that we are the [sic; a] partner of this program and we own this weapon system.” While Turkey definitely owns the jets themselves, it remains unclear if American legislators can find a way to block future deliveries or will succeed in cutting the Turkish government off from the aircraft’s central cloud-based computer network, logistics chain, training support, and other services that could effectively ground the planes or otherwise limit their functionality. Secretary of Defense James Mattis is reportedly in favor of resolving the issues as fast as possible to ensure the Turkish Air Force can get its Joint Strike Fighters and operate them without any issues, but so far Congress remains staunchly opposed to the idea. We will be keeping a close eye on the situation as it continues to develop, but it’s possible that Turkey’s F-35s could end up being as airworthy as the dancer on stage in Fort Worth.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The German Air Force Wants To Know If Its Eurofighters Can Carry U.S. Nuclear Bombs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. German officials have reportedly asked their American counterparts about whether it would be possible to turn the Eurofighter Typhoon into a nuclear strike aircraft. The answer to this question could have serious ramifications on Germany’s effort to replace its aging Panavia Tornado combat jets, which are certified to carry U.S. B61 nuclear bombs during a crisis as part of an inter-NATO agreement, and reinforces previous reports that the European fighter jet is the German Air Force’s preferred option . In April 2018, the German Federal Ministry of Defense sent a formal letter to U.S. officials asking about whether it would be feasible to configure Typhoons for the nuclear mission, how expensive it would be, and how long the process might take, according to Reuters . The German Air Force’s ability to fly nuclear strikes has become an increasingly important issue even though the country is not a nuclear power itself. During the Cold War, Germany, as well as other NATO allies, agreed to host American nuclear bombs with the understanding that their aircraft could be called upon to employ them if a major conflict with the Soviet Union broke out. After the Cold War, this arrangement has persisted and the Germans continue to keep an unspecified number of B61 bombs at Büchel Air Base near the borders with Belgium and Luxembourg. The problem is that the only German aircraft that can carry these weapons are the Tornados, which are in desperate need of replacement. A German Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon armed with a conventional bomb during a training exercise., Bundeswehr Availability rates for the Cold War-era swing wing jets have dramatically dropped in recent years. In 2015, state broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported that only 30 of the approximately 85 remaining aircraft were airworthy at any one time. The aircraft also lack cockpits that will work with night vision goggles, which limits the jet’s ability to perform missions at night . In March 2018, German magazine Der Spiegel also obtained a report calling into question the security of the Tornado’s data links. “This could in the worst case mean that the demand for an encrypted communication system for the Tornado weapons system can’t be achieved,” the document stated according to the report. “That means the Tornado weapons system may not take part in NATO missions.” The German Air Force disputed the story, saying that all of the Tornados set aside to support the alliance’s requirements had the equipment necessary to perform their missions. Regardless, the service has made no effort to hide the importance of replacing the jets. A German Air Force Tornado combat jet., Bundeswehr The Germans will need to certify whatever aircraft replaces the Tornado as a nuclear-capable platform in order to continue performing the mission. In addition to Eurofighter, the Germans are considering an unspecified variant of Boeing’s F-15 Eagle or that company’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , and Lockheed Martin’s stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . The process to make sure any of those planes could carry the B61 would likely include ensuring they could safely drop the bombs at all, as well as developing appropriate mission systems and software to enable this capability under various different attack parameters. In addition, engineers would have to find ways to install the necessary systems and linkages so that the pilot can arm the weapon in flight. Each one of the bombs has a so-called “ Permissive Action Link ,” or PAL, that prevents the warhead from functioning until an individual puts in a specific code. You can read more about these safety features and other components of the bombs in this past feature . B61 nuclear bombs or training shapes., DOD The U.S. military has not certified any variants of the Joint Strike Fighter to carry the B61, but Air Force is in the process of doing so with regards to the F-35A. The aircraft types that Boeing is offering are the only ones in the running that have already gone through this process. But the German Air Force’s top preference is reportedly the Eurofighter. Germany already has nearly 130 of the jets in service and recently began adding a robust air-to-ground capability to some of them. The video below shows German Air Force Eurofighters training to employ precision-guided bombs as part of validating the aircraft’s new air-to-ground role in 2017. “A possible purchase of the Eurofighter would ensure the retention of military aircraft expertise in Germany and Europe, and value creation in our own country,” Germany’s Deputy Defense Minister Ralf Brauksiepe told the Green Party’s Tobias Lindner in a letter earlier in 2018, according to Reuters . “The weapons system has already been introduced to the Bundeswehr [the German Armed Forces] and is being successfully used.” Replacing the Tornados with Eurofighters does make good sense , something we at The War Zone have noted in the past. As I wrote in December 2017 : “Eurofighter, a consortium that includes portions of Airbus Defense in Germany and Spain, BAE Systems in the United Kingdom, and Leonardo in Italy, manage the development and production of the fighter jets. A major sale to the Luftwaffe could be worth billions to the group and help keep the production line running and its employees at work, an important domestic consideration for the Germans. On Dec. 11, 2017, Qatar signed a deal for 24 of its own Eurofighters, making it the ninth country to buy the type. This alone could mean significantly lower training and maintenance costs, not to mention saving on large infrastructure needs, compared to acquiring an entirely new type of aircraft, and especially one with high secondary cost demands like the F-35. It also could make it easier for the Luftwaffe to quickly absorb the new aircraft into its inventory. Existing Typhoon variants are already compatible with the targeting and reconnaissance pods the Luftwaffe uses on the Tornado, as well as many of its weapons. Saab has already tested the Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile on one of the fourth generation fighter jets, as well, giving it a relatively long-range standoff attack capability.” There is a growing concern, however, that the Eurofighter won’t be survivable enough to perform the nuclear mission in the future. One source told Reuters that the United States would consider this factor in its response about whether it would certify the jets to carry the B61s. The implication is that the fifth generation F-35 could be the only realistic option . But German authorities reportedly forced the German Air Force’s previous head, Lieutenant General Karl Müllner, into retirement over his support for the F-35 option, though it’s not clear whether that was over his preference for the jet itself or his public comments on the matter. It is important to note that the United States has been working to make sure the forthcoming improved B61-12 bombs will be compatible with existing NATO platforms, including Tornado, since 2015 . Eurofighter, as well as Boeing, also both insist that their aircraft would be able to carry out nuclear strikes in any high-threat environment in cooperation with electronic warfare aircraft and other supporting assets . NATO members regularly train to do just this as part of what is known as Support of Nuclear Operations With Conventional Air Tactics, or SNOWCAT . An official diagram showing the loadout for a Tornado during tests to determine its suitability to carry the B61-12 bomb., Sandia National Laboratories At the same time, Germany and the rest of the alliance are increasingly worried about Russia’s steadily more aggressive foreign policy . This has included veiled and outright threats against member states and non-NATO partners in Europe. Earlier in June 2018 , Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova implied that increased U.S. military presence in Norway was an implicit threat toward her country. The Kremlin has also deployed advanced air defenses and other weapons systems, including the S-400 surface-to-air missile system and Iskander nuclear-capable short-range ballistic missiles, along NATO’s eastern flanks and within its Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea. The latter position means that Russian weapons already have the range to engage aircraft flying over Germany proper. Lieutenant General Müllner and other supporters of buying the F-35 had argued that this reality made a stealthy fifth-generation aircraft a necessity. Germany has joined with France to develop a new low-observable combat jet for both countries. The Joint Strike Fighter program and other stealth fighter development efforts elsewhere make it clear that this process will be long and potentially exorbitantly expensive. There’s no guarantee that it will produce a working design any time soon, if at all. For all of its very real issues , the F-35 is in production now . A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., Lockheed Martin If the German Air Force does decide to replace the Tornados with more Typhoons, it could take up to a decade to certify the latter type for the nuclear mission, according to Reuters. It’s not clear when that process might begin, but Germany wants to have all of the older Tornado jets out of service by 2030. This means there is a distinct potential for a gap in capability to occur between when the replacement aircraft arrive and when they’re deemed nuclear capable. Domestic and international politics are almost certain to have an impact on the final decision, too. Germany itself is in the midst of a political crisis that traces back the last federal elections in September 2017. A poor showing for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) part, as well as its allies in the Christian Social Union (CSU), led to six months of deliberations on the future of their bloc. This was the longest the country had been without a government since the end of World War II. Any further upheaval could impact attempts to increase the country’s defense spending overall and to address systematic readiness issues plaguing the German Armed Forces as a whole. Perhaps more importantly, German relations with the United States have plummeted amid a largely personal feud between Merkel and President Donald Trump. Richard Grenell, the new U.S. Ambassador to Germany and a Trump appointee, has suggested he could engage with opposition parties looking to unseat the CDU-CSU alliance. In May 2018, Merkel reiterated comments she had made in 2017 that it was increasingly clear Germany could not rely on the United States for protection. Trump, with arms crossed, listens to Merkel, among other world leaders and officials at the G7 summit in Canada in June 2018., Jesco Denzel/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images “It’s no longer the case that the United States will simply just protect us,” Merkel said in the 2018 speech, which also lauded French President Emmanuel Macron who was on hand to receive an award. “Rather, Europe needs to take its fate into its own hands. That’s the task for the future.” This could make the idea of buying any type of American aircraft increasingly politically untenable. It could also potentially raise new questions about whether Germany should be hosting American nuclear weapons in the first place, which is a controversial issue that left-leaning political parties in the country typically oppose on principle . In the meantime, the Tornados are only getting older and are steadily less capable of performing any missions, nuclear or otherwise. As such, Germany and the United States will have to come to some agreement on certifying any future planes soon if the German Air Force intends to continue having a nuclear role at all.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","It’s Official, Contractor-Owned MQ-9 Reaper Drones Will Watch Over Marines in Afghanistan","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has awarded General Atomics a contract worth more than $39.5 million to fly its own MQ-9 Reaper drones to keep watch over a U.S. Marine task force in Afghanistan, a possible plan The War Zone Was first to report on in January 2018. The deal comes as the Marines are sending personnel to train with the U.S. Air Force on operating these same drones as the former service moves ahead in developing its own large, multi-purpose unmanned aircraft . The Pentagon announced the Navy had followed through on its initial proposal in its daily contracting announcement on June 19, 2018. According to that notice, the arrangement involves work in Yuma, Arizona, home to a Marine Corps Air Station, and Poway, California, where General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. has its headquarters, as well as in Afghanistan. Per the original information, contractors will both fly the Reapers remotely and maintain them in-country. We don’t know how many drones in total will be involved in the operations. Documents the Naval Air Systems Command released in January 2018 said that it was looking to establish a single “orbit” to monitor one particular area at a time for at least 16 hours a day, seven days a week. General Atomics may be called upon to provide a 24-hour “surge” of coverage. The contractors will perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions only and will not fly armed aircraft. An Air Force tug tows an MQ-9 in Afghanistan. The General Atomics’ owned and operated Reapers won’t be armed and will only fly surveillance missions., USAF If the orbit is modeled on the Air Force’s standard MQ-9 “combat air patrol,” General Atomics could have to provide at least four Reapers. This arrangement keeps one drone on station at all times. At any one time, an unmanned aircraft is heading out to relieve the one in position, while a third one returns to refuel. The extra drone means personnel can take one out of rotation for routine maintenance and also offers a potential reserve in case something prevents any of the other three from performing their mission. All of this will be in direct support of the Marine’s Task Force Southwest . This element is advising and assisting Afghan troops in the notorious Helmand province and in neighboring Nimroz province, both of which are situated along the border with Pakistan. General Atomics’ crews will almost certainly fly the actual surveillance missions from the United States, most likely from ground control stations at Yuma, while contractors on the ground will be responsible for landings and takeoffs using line-of-sight data links. The U.S. military refers to this as “ remote-split ” operations. The Navy’s initial plans also stated that the Reapers would have to come equipped with an imaging radar system and a multi-spectral camera system. General Atomics’ offers its own Lynx multi-mode radar as an option on the drones and each one comes standard with a sensor turret under the nose containing both electro-optical and infrared cameras, a combination that would meet the service’s requirements. A sample of the imagery that the Lynx radar can produce in its synthetic aperture mode., General Atomics This is hardly the first time the U.S. military has employed contractor-operated surveillance aircraft in Afghanistan. Still, the contract does speak to the resurgence of American operations there, especially in the air. The kind of persistent surveillance that the MQ-9s can offer has been historically important for denying the Taliban and other insurgent elements the ability to move about with impunity, particularly at night . This, in turn, has been essential in keeping these militants from making significant gains. As of January 2018, the Air Force already had three squadrons worth of Reapers at Kandahar Airfield, the largest single deployed contingent of MQ-9s anywhere, ever. Since the beginning of 2017, the total number of American air strikes in Afghanistan have also steadily begun to increase , a product of President Donald Trump’s new strategy for the region. These numbers had previously dropped off after President Barack Obama announced an end to major combat operations in the country in December 2014. US Air Force and Royal Air Force MQ-9 Reapers at Kandahar Airfield., USAF But for the Marines, having the Reapers overhead is also an indication of the service’s own ambitions to acquire drones that would greatly exceed the capabilities of the MQ-9. At present, its dedicated drone units operate smaller, catapult-launched types, such as the RQ-7 Shadow and RQ-21 Blackjack . The Corps is actively in the process of defining the exact requirements for what it is calling the Marine Air Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System Expeditionary, or MUX . This will be a vertical takeoff and landing capable unmanned aircraft capable of performing a number of different roles, including airborne early warning, intelligence gathering, and potentially strike missions. You can read more about that program and what we know about it so far here . An official graphic showing some of the possible missions the Marines are looking at for their future MUX drones., USMC Before that happens, the Marines in Helmand will now be able to get a firsthand look at what it’s like to work with larger unmanned aircraft that are organic to their chain of command in a real-world setting. It is almost certain that this experience will help inform the continued development of the MUX drones and the service’s concepts of operation for employing them. It could also provide an opportunity to discover additional requirements for those unmanned aircraft that might not have otherwise become apparent. The Marines are already looking to make use of the Reaper platform as a training tool in other ways. At present, the service sends personnel to train how to fly unmanned aircraft with members of the Air Force at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, but none of those individuals go through courses to operate larger so-called “ Group 5 ” types, such as the MQ-9. “We’re asking the Air Force, and they’ve approved, to send some of our crews through the finished training so they can fly Reapers,” U.S. Marine Corps Colonel James Frey, head of the Aviation Expeditionary Enablers Branch within the service’s top headquarters for aviation issues, told USNI News earlier in June 2018. This “is good because you build that base to have folks that eventually will be into MUX, so they’re used to having a Group 5 type things, so we’re not pulling everybody from fixed-wing and rotary-wing platforms.” A US Marine Corps RQ-21 Blackjack sits on its catapult., USMC However, the Marine Corps doesn’t expect to reach initial operational capability with any variant of MUX until at least 2028 and that’s if the program goes according to schedule without any delays or other developmental hiccups. The service also has no official near-term plans to acquire its own Reapers or even any of the still air-worthy MQ-1 Predators that the Air Force recently retired . “Every Marine wants a Reaper in his hip pocket, and it’s just not the way the world operates,” Frey told USNI news. But “we’re not ready to cut anything right yet to get [MQ-9s], so this is a natural transition,” he added about the increased training cooperation with the Air Force. The same goes for working with contractors flying their own Reapers in Afghanistan and it’s possible we may see more such deals supporting Marines in Afghanistan or elsewhere in the future. These efforts will continue to be important stepping stones until the service actually receives its first MUX drones.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 1, 2018",Sweden’s Notorious Little Carrier Killing Sub Just Got Some Major Upgrades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. HSwMS Gotland was built by SAAB-Kockums commissioned over two decades ago. The diesel-electric submarine outfitted with Stirling engine-based air-independent propulsion quickly changed the course of submarine warfare. Now, after an extensive mid-life refit, the famous subsurface stalker is about to begin sea trials and much more is riding on them than just validating a refit. Gotland was modernized in such a way that key technologies that are central to the upcoming A26 class, which aims to replace the Gotland class eventually, were woven into the project. So yeah, what was a proven, efficient, and very deadly submarine is now even more so. You can read all about the Gotland and its innovations in this feature I penned back in 2014 , but the submarine’s fame within defense circles came from its time working as a leased aggressor sub for the U.S. Navy in the mid-2000s. I previously wrote: “By the mid 2000s, other countries were starting to field or develop AIP capable diesel-electric submarines, including Russia and especially China. Since the US Navy had retired its last diesel-electric (non-AIP) attack submarine in 1990, the USS Blueback (now a local resident here at Oregon’s Museum of Science & Industry) there was no indigenous force to practice hunting down diesel-electric subs, let alone ones with advanced AIP capabilities. Thus the U.S. Navy went to Sweden hat in hand in hopes of leasing one of their ninja-like Gotland Class boats and its crew for a year. The Swedish sub would be playing the adversary to America’s massive constellation of anti-submarine surface combatants, helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, and especially nuclear submarines. The Swedes granted this request and the Gotland was shipped to San Diego aboard a mobile drydock. By mid-summer of 2005, the Gotland arrived in San Diego and war games immediately commenced. Apparently, the Navy got more than they were bargaining for when it came to finding and engaging the stealthy little sub. The Gotland virtually “sunk” many US nuclear fast attack subs, destroyers, frigates, cruisers and even made it into the ‘red zone’ beyond the last ring of anti-submarine defenses within a carrier strike group. Although it was rumored she got many simulated shots off on various U.S. super-carriers, one large-scale training exercise in particular with the then brand new USS Ronald Reagan ended with the little sub making multiple attack runs on the super-carrier, before slithering away without ever being detected. One contact of mine within the anti-submarine community said that the Gotland was the single biggest eye opener of their career. The Swedish sub was “so silent it literally did not exist to our sensors.” Apparently, its crew knew exactly how to employ her strengths to devastating effects as that same contact described the sub as “a vastly demoralizing capability that changed the priorities within the surface and sub-surface warfare communities.” Once the first year of the lease ran out, the Navy quickly arranged another year on the contract to sort through tactics to deal with this proliferating yet unassuming and deadly threat. It wasn’t until mid-2007 that the Gotland finally loaded up on its mobile drydock and headed back to its home on the Baltic Sea. Fast forward the better part of a decade and AIP submarines, some more advanced than the Gotland Class, are prowling the seas and littorals around the globe. Seeing as these boats cost millions, instead of billions of dollars, they are potentially a fairly cheap way of shattering shipping in key global waterways, or even stalking coastlines for soft targets such as ships in port, not to mention having the potential of taking on some of the most capable anti-submarine forces in the world.” Gotland arriving in San Diego in her transport dock in 2005. , USN Just in the four years since I published the piece on the Gotland and its time playing bad guy for America’s Navy, AIP technology has evolved dramatically. Today, diesel-electric submarines with AIP capability are approaching the size of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines, and are able to transit long distances to reach remote patrol stations with minimal support. Some of these boats are even executing nuclear second-strike deterrent patrols or will be in the near future. Once largely experimental forms of AIP have also matured, including fuel cell-based systems. Maybe most promising of all are those based on lithium-ion batteries alone, as seen in the potentially revolutionary Japanese Soryu class. Yet the Gotland’s Stirling engine-derived AIP technology remains highly efficient, cost-effective, and reliable. It’s been steadily improved upon over the decades and is now in its third major iteration. A new variation of the Stirling-engine system was part of the Gotland’s upgrade package, which necessitated the submarine being cut in half. According to SAAB , the refit included: Submarine is cut open in the mid-tank section, adding a new section including seawater cooling, fresh water cooling, water chiller units. Improved capabilities; Stirling AIP MkIII, Masts, Sensors, Communication, Special Ops. New rules and regulations: IMO, Security, Crew Comfort. End-of-life and obsolescence issues: Combat and Ship’s Management Systems. Experience-based improvement. In particular, the ship’s combat systems, sonar, and mast were all replaced with the newest technology. Just moving from an optical periscope to a digital one is a huge upgrade for most submarines operating around the globe, so we aren’t talking about a freshening up here, but really a new submarine. And of course, this is the shadowy world of submarine warfare, in which the boat’s best capabilities would not be discussed in detail. This includes its ability to spy on potential adversaries, execute special operations insertions and extractions, and lay mines even in very shallow waters, something the Gotland class was designed specifically to do. Not only will Gotland’s new capabilities be highly prized by the Swedish Navy, especially considering the rise of Russia’s naval capabilities and activities on the Baltic Sea, but they will pave the way for the upcoming A26 class. SAAB The A26 program, which is more important now than ever, aims to produce the first two boats for just under $1B each, with follow-on units dropping substantially in price. Aside from some of the innovations that were installed on Gotland during its refit, the A26 will incorporate even quieter running technologies, a very stealthy sail, the ability to withstand greater shock loads, the ability to easily launch and recover large underwater unmanned vehicles, along with a host of other improvements. Beyond the Swedish Navy’s needs, major aspects of the A26 design will be adopted by a Saab-Damen consortium in hopes of fulfilling the Netherland’s Walrus class submarine replacement program. Different configurations of the A26 design also include vertical launch tubes for a dozen cruise missiles and hull plugs for enhanced special operations capabilities. A relaunching ceremony for Gotland is scheduled to occur on June 20th. Her sister ship Uppland will also be going through the modification process which takes about a year to complete. The entire program cost roughly $250M for both boats, which is a bargain considering the increase in capability. The third ship in the Gotland class, HSwMS Halland , remains active and it isn’t clear at this time if or when it will receive a similar mid-life treatment, although there was supposedly an option in the refit contract to proceed with the third boat at a fixed price. Now, only if the U.S. Navy would jump onboard the A26 program, or a similar endeavor, and field a force of forward-deployed AIP capable boats. With production scale, the seagoing force could potentially buy three plus AIP equipped boats for the same price of a single Virginia class nuclear fast attack submarine.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s B-1B Bone bomber fleet has returned to flying operations after ending up grounded after a harrowing in-flight emergency exposed a fault with the aircraft’s ejection seats. However, the service says that some risks may remain and that there might still be parts in need of replacement. The inciting incident occurred on May 1, 2018, when a B-1B bomber from the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base declared one of its engines had caught fire during a training exercise and needed to make an emergency landing. It has since emerged that the aircraft was in a particularly perilous state at the time, but thankfully the aircraft landed safely and no one was injured. A full, formal investigation into the mishap is still ongoing. But on June 7, 2018, Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all of the service’s combat-coded bombers, halted flight operations after discovering an issue with the plane’s Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES) II ejection seats. The exact nature of the problem remains unclear, but the command ended the so-called “stand down” on June 19, 2018. “We have high confidence that the fleet’s egress systems are capable and the fleet is ready to return to normal flight operations,” U.S. Air Force Major General Thomas Bussiere, the head of the 8th Air Force, which specifically manages the service’s bomber squadrons, said in a statement . What this doesn’t apparently mean is that problem or problems are necessarily fixed on every B-1. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NvqB5kqhQEw In response to an Email from The War Zone, a spokesperson for Air Force Global Strike Command explained that the assessments of the Bone’s entire egress systems, including the ejection seat and hatches on top of the fuselage that blow open before it rockets an individual away from the plane, are ongoing. In addition, the units under the command will continue to replace components on the bombers as necessary. “The safety stand down across the B-1 bomber fleet allowed time for the command to conduct component-level testing and determine potential risks,” the public affairs officer wrote. “The results of these tests, combined with redundancies in the egress system, provided sufficient data and high confidence to return to normal flight operations.” Earlier in June 2018, 2nd Lieutenant Kali Gradishar, a spokesperson for the 7th Bomb Wing, confirmed to Military.com that there was a physical fault with the ejection seats in some, but not all B-1 aircraft. At that time, the officer could not say when all of the aircraft in need of replacement parts would receive them. “It is known that not all B-1s are affected by the ejection seat system components, though it is still being determined which specific aircraft are affected,” she said. “Also, while parts do exist to fix the system, an inventory is in the process to determine the specific types and number of parts needed to fix all affected aircraft.” A B-1B bomber., USAF In the meantime, Bone crews may still be flying with known and unknown problems with the ejection seats. On June 19, 2018, the same day that the grounding ended, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson revealed new official details about just how serious the incident had actually been at a gathering in Washington, D.C. “They are out training, and the indicator lights goes off. They have a fire in the wing. This is not a good thing,” she said. “They go through their checklists on everything you are supposed to do if you’ve got indication of a fire. … The next thing on the checklist is to eject from the airplane.” Wilson explained that ejection procedure for the B-1 involves each crew member ejecting one at a time, in sequence, so they don’t hit each other on the way out. The Offensive Weapon Systems officer’s seat failed to function, though, leaving them stuck in the aircraft. “The airman who’s sitting on an eject seat where he’s pulled the fire pins ― and sits there for the next 25 minutes. Wondering whether ― it’s like pulling out the pin on a grenade and holding it as you come in to land,” the Air Force’s top civilian continued. “And not knowing whether the next piece of turbulence is going to cause you to launch.” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., USAF “The courage it took and the valor represented by that aircraft commander who decided, ‘We are going to try for all of us to make it, rather than sacrifice the one guy who can’t get out,’” she added. “Those are the men and women who choose to wear the uniform of the United States Air Force.” It’s unclear what would have happened to the bomber itself if the ejection sequence had occurred as planned. Presumably, the crew, in coordination with personnel on the ground, had identified a relatively safe area for the plane to come crashing down. Regardless, Wilson’s comments make it clear that the problem with the ejection system is no minor issue, especially in combination with other in-flight emergencies. On June 1, 2018, just days before the grounding went into effect, another B-1 had to return to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii shortly after taking off due to an unspecified problem. Though in-flight emergencies are not necessarily rare, this is a reminder of the risks U.S. military aviators face to begin with. At the same time, B-1s have been flying combat missions over Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan . During those flights, crews might find themselves with even fewer good available options if a fire breaks out in one of the engines or something else serious occurs. B-1B pilots go over their preflight checklist before a mission., USAF “Combat is an inherently risky business, but the Air Force works hard to minimize the risks its Airmen face,” the Air Force Global Strike Command spokesperson said in their Email. “Ensuring our aircrew can fly, train and stay proficient is important to minimizing risk in combat. The Air Force strives to mitigate risks to the aircrew while allowing them to continue vital training.” It’s definitely a complicated balancing act and one that is even more complex given a recent surge in aviation mishaps across the U.S. military. More than two dozen aviators have already died in 2018, which puts it on pace to be a particularly deadly year for accidents. We can only hope that the Air Force will finish making the necessary changes to the egress system on the B-1Bs as soon as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 25, 2018",The USMC Is Buying New Amphibious Vehicles That Can’t Swim Faster Than What They Have Now,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.K.-headquartered BAE Systems, in cooperation with Italy’s Iveco, has secured a deal to build new amphibious armored vehicles for the Marine Corps that could be worth more than $1 billion. But the wheeled design isn’t any faster than that the service’s Cold War-era tracked Assault Amphibious Vehicle family in the water and there are serious questions about whether it offers enough other improvements to avoid having to buy a third type in the near future. The Marines announced they picked the BAE-Iveco team’s SuperAV vehicle as the winning design for what is formally known as the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) 1.1 program on June 19, 2018. American defense contractor SAIC and Singapore’s ST Kinetics had also been competing for the contract with the latter firm’s Terrex design. The initial $198 million contract covers low-rate production of 30 vehicles with deliveries ending in 2019. The Marine Corps could exercise options to expand that to cover full-rate production of a total fleet of more than 200 vehicles, which it would receive over an as yet undefined period afterward. The service’s 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion will get the first SuperAVs in 2020 and Marines hopes to achieve full operational capability with the type in 2023, according to an official release . It is not clear whether this latter date reflects when 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion will be fully able to use the new vehicles or if this is when the service hopes to have a larger fleet deployed across various units. Even if the Corps pursues the larger order, it will not be able to replace its nearly 900 Assault Amphibious Vehicles (AAV), which includes various subvariants for specialized roles, on a one-for-one basis with the ACV 1.1s. BAE and Iveco’s ACV 1.1, the SuperAV., BAE Systems But “the ACV provides a mobile capability that mechanizes the force to maintain tempo with the remainder of the [Marine Air-Ground Task Force]; specifically the M1A1 tank,” U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Kirk Mullins, the officer in charge of the ACV 1.1 program, said in a statement to coincide with the contract announcement. “It isn’t maintenance intensive because of its increased reliability, and it also provides greater protection against threats we encounter on the battlefield.” The 8×8 SuperAV has a weight of around 20 tons depending on its configuration and can hit top speeds of up to 65 miles an hour on improved roads, which makes it significantly faster than the AAV on land. The two vehicles have similar speeds – both less than 10 miles per hour – in the water and the old tracked design may actually turn out to be marginally faster. One of the US Marine Corps’ existing AAV amphibious tracked vehicles., USMC The ACV 1.1 will be able to carry a full squad of 13 Marines, which was an important selling point over Terrex, but this is almost half the capacity of one AAV. The vehicle does offer superior protection against mines and roadside bombs over the tracked vehicles thanks to a V-shaped underbody that deflects the blast away from the hull and a suspended, flexible seating system that better absorbs the shock. The steel armored body is supposed to shield the crew and passengers against small arms fire and shrapnel, but add-on armor kits and active protection systems could offer addition defenses against rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank guided missiles. The Marine Corps is still deciding exactly what weaponry it will install on the ACVs, as well. An Iveco SuperAV with a turret feature a large automatic cannon, anti-tank guided missiles, and additional sensors. The US Marines are presently looking into what weapons it might want to add onto its ACVs., Iveco Iveco originally designed the SuperAV in the late 2000s, but only Italy and Brazil had previously purchased variants of the type. In 2010, the Italian Army selected it to replace the LVT-7-series amphibious tracked vehicles in its Lagunari Regiment . In 1984, the Marines changed their name of their LVT-7s to AAVs after the first of many upgrade programs. For the U.S. Marines, the new ACV 1.1s are supposed to be the first step in ending a saga that began in 2012 when it canceled the ambitious Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program. That project sought to develop a new tracked design that would have used water jets to propel it up to nearly 30 miles per hour as it sped from amphibious assault ships to the beachhead. The impetus for this was to give Marines the ability to launch from ships further offshore to better protect those vessels from shore-based anti-ship cruise missiles , naval mines closer to the beachhead, and other threats . Potential near-peer opponents , as well as smaller nation-states and non-state actors , have steadily improved their capabilities in these regards, increasing the possible risks to an amphibious force in the future. Unfortunately, the EFV proved to be especially complex and expensive, with a unit price over $20 million – more than double the cost of a new M1 Abrams tank at the time. At the same time, it was increasingly clear that the AAVs, which first entered service in the 1970s and had already received various performance and protection upgrades to try and extend their useful life, were in need of replacement. Less than stellar performance in Iraq in 2003 had then given way to increasingly regular and often deadly accidents, including fires and instances where the vehicles sunk , trapping their occupants. Marines load whats left of an AAV onto a truck in Iraq in 2003., USMC ACV 1.1 was supposed to offer at least an interim solution to these issues. It was also supposed to save money by focusing on existing, in-production designs and purchasing the base vehicle first and then incrementally adding additional systems as necessary. “In order to be a step ahead of our adversaries in the future, the Marine Corps needed to find a modern vehicle at an affordable price range that provided significant capability enhancement and performance over the AAV,” Colonel Mullins said. “The path has been navigated to date with one primary goal in mind: ensuring that we field the best capability to our Marines as quickly as possible at an affordable price,” John Garner, the Program Executive Officer for Land Systems at Marine Corps Systems Command told reporters separately on June 19, 2018. It’s not clear that the SuperAV is the most cost-effective option, though. Each one has a price tag of at least $4 million and it’s not clear what weapons, defensive systems, or other equipment that figure includes. In 2015, SAIC began upgrading the existing AAVs again to improve their performance and survivability . The complete package costs around $1.65 million per vehicle and is expected to keep them ready for service through at least 2030. There’s no guarantee that the ACV 1.1 will retain its performance advantages over the AAVs as it will almost certainly end up burdened by additional defensive systems and other equipment. Wheeled vehicles also traditionally have mixed performance on softer ground, such as sandy beaches, to begin with. The U.S. Army has already experienced similar issues over the years with its Stryker 8×8 wheeled vehicles as they have received additional weapons and armor. Extra weight and bulk could limit the ACV 1.1’s ability to maneuver in dense urban areas and cross gaps using existing civilian bridges once they get ashore, too. Any added systems, especially remote weapon stations or manned turrets, could also impact the total number of Marines each ACV 1.1 can carry at a time. In addition, the Corps says it is only now investigating a “ lethality upgrade ” as part of the ACV 1.2 increment, but the limitations of the base SuperAV chassis will now be a primary factor in determining any future weaponry requirements. Furthermore, unlike the AAVs, which shares engine and chassis components with the Army’s Bradleys , the ACV 1.1s have no clear commonality with any existing systems. This could make them more difficult and expensive to operate and sustain in the long term. More importantly, the need for a higher speed vehicle more capable of operating in the open ocean to allow amphibious ships to stage further away from enemy defenses hasn’t gone away. That concerns that led to the EFV program have only become more pronounced, especially given China’s continued militarization of the South China Sea and deployment of longer-range anti-ship and anti-aircraft systems on its man-made outposts in that region. Earlier in June 2018, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels reportedly brushed off an attempted amphibious landing in Yemen involving United Arab Emirates forces, as well. This only underscores the reality that even non-state actors will be increasingly capable of challenging this type of operation in the future, too. The video below shows Houthi rebels in Yemen attacking the ex-U.S. Navy High Speed Vessel Swift with anti-ship missiles in 2016. https://youtube.com/watch?v=b0Rx1MyFpgQ “We have to find a solution to getting Marines to shore, from over the horizon, at something greater than seven knots [8 miles per hour],” Deputy Marine Corps Commandant Lieutenant General Brian Beaudreault told Breaking Defense in October 2017. “We must find a high-water-speed vehicle on the surface. We must.” The Marines are still hoping to eventually acquire a “Phase 2” ACV that would meet this need, but there is no indication of when such a vehicle might be available. The service has already outlined a backup plan to simply buy more ACVs to replace existing AAVs as part of an ACV 1.3 increment . What it’s left with at the moment is a wheeled vehicle that is faster and has better underbody protection than the older tracked types, but is also slower in the water, has a far more limited payload capacity, and a significantly higher price tag. And since the Marines do not plan to purchase enough ACVs to replace all of the AAVs at present, the two vehicles will be expected to work together for the foreseeable future anyway. All told, it appears that the ACV 1.1s could be an important supplement to or substitute for the AAVs in certain situations, but whether they’ll ever be able to actually replace the existing vehicles completely remains to be seen.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On May 26th, 2018, at 12:59pm local time, a Piper PA-32R Saratoga (N161MA) was flying over Huntington, Long Island during a trip between Minute Man Airfield in Massachusetts and Old Bridge Airport in New Jersey when the pilot encountered a strange object directly in front of his aircraft. He called air traffic controllers stating “I have an object in front of me, I don’t know what it is.” The controller replies “You mean like a drone or something?” The pilot responds: “I don’t know if it’s a drone… It’s bigger than a drone.” The controller responds “Ummmm, I don’t show anything on radar.” The controller then asks if the object is at his same altitude, the pilot responds in the affirmative. Then the controller asks if the pilot needs to make a turn to avoid the object and the pilot requests a slight change in direction. The controller then queries the pilot to report what he thinks the mysterious craft is as soon as he can. A PA-32R similar to N161MA, Wiltshirespotter/Wikicommons The pilot responds that he has no idea what it is and it has since gone behind a cloud. “Definitely something was there” the pilot states.

The pilot quips “this is the first time I’m getting a phone number that I’m not in trouble!.” The controller laughs and affirms to him he is not in trouble. He then passes him the number and says they will be awaiting his call. The Piper stayed at about 6,000 feet during the cruise portion of its flight.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Star Wars Canyon, also referred to as the Jedi Transition or Rainbow Canyon , is a mecca for aviation photographers, providing a beautiful location to watch military aircraft pull off intense maneuvers and sometimes even catch a glimpse of something particularly rare . But few aircraft look as at home zipping through the rugged terrain as the Air Force’s A-10 Warthog ground attack planes. In 2017, the team at Mantegani Photos grabbed a great video a pilot training for the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Demonstration Flight Team showing off just how maneuverable the aircraft is in low altitude flight, putting the Warthog just about as close as physically possible to the canyon wall during one particularly spectacular pass. Mantegani’s video includes footage from both Nov. 9 and 13, 2017 and shows the A-10 flying through the Canyon’s “Sidewinder” low-level route. All sorts of fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft use the area for training, which includes various low- and high-altitude routes and restricted operating areas. But the Warthogs gets low as it goes zooming by and it gets closer to the canyon wall at around 0:53 in the video’s runtime than anything we have seen before . Its dramatic vertical exit from the canyon is also eyewatering . But we have to remember that shadows on hills and the camera’s depth of field compression may make the pass look a bit more dramatic than it actually was. But still, it certainly looks close. Regardless, there isn’t any reason to think that the maneuver was actually unnecessarily dangerous or risky, as the Warthog is a unique beast. https://youtube.com/watch?v=cHpmmgrMmEQ The A-10s Star Wars Canyon display emphasizes just how ideally suited the aircraft is for operating in the very low-level flying environment. Its flight characteristics at low altitude are unmatched by any other jet combat aircraft in the Air Force’s inventory. On top of that, the A-10 community has cultivated unique expertise in low-level flight over more than four decades. Warthog pilots, or “Hawg Drivers,” are untouched among their Air Force cousins when it comes to getting right down in the thick of things at tree, or in this case rock level. The pilot in the A-10 Demonstration Flight Team , which includes nine other supporting individuals on the ground is especially experience. The Air Force officially re-established this small organization in 2018 to perform at air shows and other events, pushing the A-10 to its max for cheering crowds. In 2012 and 2017, A-10s had been part of Heritage Flights, which also include a small demonstration of the aircraft’s skills. It’s the special combination of pilots and planes , supported by dedicated crews on the ground , that makes the A-10s so indispensable for close air support missions to this day, despite decades of Air Force attempts to retire the Warthogs for good. It’s also fostered a greater sense of comradery between these aviators and troops on the ground that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the service. “If you were to say that there’s a grunt in the sky, it’d be a Hog pilot,” U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Joseph Hauser, a Joint Tactical Air Controller, or JTAC, said in 2015 for an official video presentation on operations in Afghanistan. JTACs work closely with ground forces to call in air strikes and close air support. An A-10 rolls over after refueling in mid-air, exposing a soot-covered underbelly from firing its massive 30mm cannon , another indication of the jet’s hard work supporting troops on the ground. , USAF The Air Force is still keen to replace the Warthogs with the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, but members of Congress have demanded a “fly-off” between the two aircraft to determine if the latter can adequately perform the close air support role. But “I wouldn’t call it a fly-off; it’s a comparison testing of the A-10 and the F-35,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter told Military.com in March 2018, suggesting that the two aircraft might not have to demonstrate their ability to fly the same exact kinds of maneuvers. Unfortunately, despite accolades and love from Army soldiers and Marines on the ground, the sun may be starting to set on the A-10. Dozens of the jets are in danger of ending up grounded and might never return to service . Unless the Air Force decides to buy a new, more modern dedicated ground attack plane , it seems unlikely that we’ll ever see another Air Force jet anywhere near as at home down in the mud with the grunts as the Warthogs are now.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 13, 2018",New A-10 Wing Kits Won’t Arrive For At Least Four Years And That’s Bad News For The Warthog,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has detailed its plans for buy as many as 112 sets of new wings for the service’s remaining, so-called “thin wing” A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft. Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee the service will purchase that many replacement spans and, under the present schedule, the first of these vital kits won’t be ready for years, which could push dozens of the planes into retirement . Correction: See details at the bottom of this story. On May 25, 2018, the Air Force released the official request for proposals for what it is now calling the A-10 Thunderbolt Advanced-Wing Continuation Kit, or ATTACK program. This refers to the aircraft’s official name , Thunderbolt II. As it stands now, the service is expecting a year-long contracting period followed by at least five years of orders. There are two possible optional ordering periods, as well. The “indefinite quantity” contract would be for a minimum of four sets of wings. If the Air Force decided to pursue all of its options, the maximum order would be for 112 spans, plus 15 spare kits. But most shockingly, the notice specifically says that actual deliveries would only start four years after the last of the first five ordering periods. The contractor responsible for the program would only have to deliver the first four low rate initial production kits by 2029. [Correction: This is incorrect. The earliest date at which the wing kits would arrive is some time in 2022] An A-10 in Afghanistan in January 2018., USAF After that, the Air Force would then decide whether or not to pursue full-rate production at a maximum of four wing sets per month. The service says the minimum threshold is for a contractor to deliver three kits every month. At these rates, it would take between two and three years to produce 112 new wings. Of course, the issue is that the more than 100 “thin wing” Warthogs, approximately a third of the total fleet of more than 280 aircraft, need the new spans now . Re-winging the planes has already become a saga since the Air Force ended the first such upgrade program early, which left dozens of the ground attackers without the new “thick wings” that would keep them safe to fly into the 2040s . The Air Force has already had to resort to an unspecified “ collaborative approach ” to prevent wing-related groundings in the 2018 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, 2018. As of May 2018, the service had not retired an A-10 in any configuration to the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona since 2015, according to an official inventory it releases every month. There will almost certainly be groundings, though. In April 2018, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jerry Harris, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans, Programs, and Requirements, told legislators that he was only confident that his service could prevent any groundings occurring after 2025. Technicians inspect an A-10’s wing., USAF With the first new wings are only set to start arriving four years after that, though, it raises the question of how this could be the case. There is a distinct possibility that Harris is so confident in that timeline because, by then, all of the thin-wing A-10s will be stuck on the tarmac or in the Bone Yard. This would be largely in line with the Air Force’s plan to increase the size of the six active duty and Air Force reserve component A-10 squadrons while shutting down the three remaining units. The implication here is that at least 80 Warthogs would be headed for permanent retirement. If this were to happen, the Air Force, which has long been opposed to the A-10s at an institutional level , would have no desire or need to re-wing all of the thin-wing aircraft. In January 2018, it emerged that Todd Mathes, the A-10 Program Element Manager for Air Combat Command, the Air Force’s top warfighting command, had reportedly made it clear to his subordinates that full program was “not going to happen.” And even if it did, there is no guarantee there would be funding available for all 112 wing kits. As of 2018 , Congress has approved more than $100 million in the 2018 fiscal year for the re-wing effort, but this only pays for four pairs of wings – the minimum low-rate production the Air Force has identified – along with rebooting the production line to make more. The Air Force’s latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year includes a little more than $79 million for an unspecified number of wings. An A-10 undergoing heavy maintenance at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base., USAF However, according to official questions and answers the Air Force released along with the request for proposals, one prospective contractor noted that this would not cover the maximum purchase order. The service, referring to itself as “the Government,” insisted that its goal was to buy all 112 spans, but noted that there was no guarantee. “Additional funding is unknown past [fiscal year 2018] based on Government budgeting cycle,” the response explained. “If additional funding becomes available, the Government would consider a more aggressive schedule and higher quantity orders.” It’s a tall order for any company to tool up to produce these replacement wings at all, especially since the Air Force is the only service in the world to operate the A-10. Those same firms are likely to face a hard decision about whether to compete knowing that the service can’t guarantee purchases beyond the first four kits. It could also impact the contractor’s actual preparations to meet the production goal of at least four pairs of wings every month. Any delays in awarding the contract or moving from low-rate to full-rate production will only exacerbate the need to ground A-10s without the replacement wings as they hit their maximum safe allowable flight hours. Contractors remove a wing from an A-10 in storage at the Bone Yard at Davis Monthan Air Force Base., USAF I have noted in the past how all of these intertwined timelines could have broad effects, writing : This could have a cascading impact on pilot and ground crew proficiency with the Warthogs. In turn, the Air Force might feel it has a stronger case for retiring those particular planes for good and either converting the three squadrons to fly other aircraft or distributing the personnel to other units. If that were to happen, any impetus for  completing the re-wing effort would evaporate entirely and Mathes would  be right to say that it’s “not going to happen.” Congress,  however, is unlikely to agree with this course of action. Legislators have repeatedly blocked the Air Force’s attempts to retire the A-10 absent an adequate replacement and have so far dismissed the service’s assertion that the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter can take over the Warthog’s missions, instead ordering a fly-off between the two aircraft that could begin later in 2018. At a certain point, opposition from lawmakers might not matter,  though. Congress can block the Air Force from retiring any A-10s forever, but it won’t be able to make jets without the new wings any more airworthy with just the stroke of a pen. Legislators who support keeping the Warthogs on active duty for the foreseeable future appear to face a no-win situation of either agreeing to trimming the fleet or compelling the Air Force to maintain units with aircraft that are increasingly unflyable as the service suffers a growing shortage of pilots . There is significant evidence suggesting that this has been the service’s plan all along in delaying A-10 upgrades in general. Even if the Air Force can stick to its stated re-winging timeline, this scenario only seems increasingly inevitable. It is plainly unreasonable to believe that the Air Force’s priorities will remain the same in the decade between ordering the first wing sets and taking delivery of them. [Correction: this time frame will only be approximately four years long] Most notably, the service is still planning to evaluate the performance of the A-10 against that the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in the close air support role. A pair of A-10s from the Michigan Air National Guard’s 107th Fighter Squadron, including one in a special heritage paint scheme that calls back to the unit’s service during World War II., ANG It is unlikely that the battle for the A-10 is over entirely and the aircraft’s supporters in Congress are sure to push for the Air Force to maintain at least some of the aircraft for the foreseeable future as they have repeatedly in the past . And in the last 18 months, the service’s senior leadership has made a number of very public overtures of support for the Warthog, but they have all come along with major caveats. “In the [2019] program that we’re working, we also buy more wings, and so we move forward to address the wings of the A-10,” U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, said at a talk at the Brookings Institution in January 2018. “As far as exactly how many of the 280 or so A-10s that we have that we’ll maintain forever, I’m not sure.” Having a fleet of 200 A-10s or fewer could give new weight to the service’s long-standing desire to divest the entire fleet, as well. The service has a number of similarly shrinking fleets of various combat aircraft, such as the F-15C Eagle and F-22 Raptor stealth fighter . In turn, these aircraft have become steadily more complicated and expensive to fly and maintain with increasingly limited abilities to contribute to a large end-strength for actual combat operations. The future of the so-called “Golden Eagles” remains particularly uncertain . In offering new details about it how plans to “save” the thin-wing Warthogs, the Air Force seems to be making it increasingly clear that close a third of the total fleet is barreling towards full retirement in the next few years. Correction: The original version of this story inaccurately stated that the first wing kits would only arrive in 2029, approximately a decade after the likely date of the contract award. This was based on a misreading of the contracting documents, which mention “B FB2029” in the specific line items. Though this looks like a date code, it is actually a facility at Hill Air Force Base in Utah where the re-wing project will do its work. In addition, the still curious plan to proceed through four full calendar years of orders before taking delivery of any actual components further confused the timeline. One of the line items in the draft request for proposals showing the “B FB2029” code., USAF The accurate time frame is as follows. The Air Force will a complete year-long contracting period followed by four, year-long ordering periods, for a total of five years. Only after that does the service expect to begin taking delivery of any new wings. We do not know when the contracting period started or when it will end. If the contracting period ends in 2018, then the first wings should arrive in 2022. If the contract award only occurs in 2019, this date would be pushed back to 2023. The full ordering period is supposed to run for four full years, meaning the last kits would arrive in 2026 or 2027. There will also likely be some lag between when the Air Force gets the wing sets and when the upgraded A-10s return to active duty. The ordering and delivery timelines as defined in the draft request for proposals for the ATTACK program., USAF But it is also unclear how the two additional 365 day-long optional ordering periods fit into this timetable. If they delay the start of the delivery periods, then the full program could run through 2028 or 2029 in the end. In addition, the 2022-2023 delivery date would only be for the first four low-rate production kits, with full-rate production at between three to four kits per month coming some time afterward. It also remains unclear how the various figures line up. A contractor fulfilling a maximum order of 112 wing kits and 15 spares at four kits per month would meet that obligation in less than three years.  The only way this could take between five and seven years is if the Air Force does not actually keep to that production schedule. Regardless, The same issues noted above continue to be relevant even with this corrected timeline. Groundings are almost certain to occur before the first wing sets arrive and could have the same cascading impact on the thin-wing A-10 fleet.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Senate Voted To Block Turkey From Getting Its F-35s As Spat Over Russian Missiles Grows,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Senate has added a clause to its version of the annual defense budget bill for the 2019 fiscal year that seeks to block the transfer of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to Turkey. The vote was a response to that country’s purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems and arrest and prosecution of an American citizen, but it won’t come into effect before Turkish authorities take delivery of their first batch of the stealthy jets and both sides appear to be preparing for a broader political crisis. On June 18, 2018, Senators voted 85 to 10 to include the provision targeting Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program into the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Turkish government has been one of six major partner nations in the Joint Strike Fighter project since 2002, is responsible for production of certain components of the jet, is slated to provide maintenance services to other operators in Europe, and has more than 100 of the aircraft on order, making it one of the biggest overall customers. “NATO partners need these F-35s to counter Russian activity,” Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, who co-sponsored the change in the NDAA with North Carolina Republic Thom Tillis, said after the vote . “We would be handing this technology over to the Kremlin if we granted Turkey these planes, and Congress will not stand for it.” The added proviso would block the Pentagon from using any of its funds to enable the transfer of F-35s, or any related technical data or support services, to Turkey, unless Congress gets assurances that certain demands are met. These include making sure secret information about the aircraft stays out of Russian hands and the release of Andrew Brunson, an American evangelical Presbyterian minister who is on trial for espionage and attempting to destabilize the Turkish government. His lawyers say the charges are spurious and politically motivated . In April 2018, Shaheen and Tillis, along with Republic Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, introduced separate legislation along the same lines. A US Air Force F-35A., USAF The Senate and the House of Representatives still have to reconcile their draft versions of the 2019 NDAA before they can send it to President Donald Trump, a process that is likely to take weeks if not months. The House version actually contains a much broader set of limits on arms transfers to Turkey. The only problem is that Lockheed Martin plans to roll out the first Turkish F-35s in a ceremony on June 21, 2019. The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor has insisted there are no changes to its plans over the growing political spat. “The F-35 program traditionally hosts a ceremony to recognize every US and international customers’ first aircraft,” the firm told FlightGlobal earlier in June 2018. “The aircraft will then ferry to Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where Turkish pilots will join the F-35A training pool.” It is this latter arrangement that could actually allow the NDAA’s provision to have an impact. At Luke Air Force Base, Turkey’s F-35s will be reliant on various levels of U.S. military support and subject to its various rules and restriction. Blocking the Pentagon from spending any money to enable Turkish Joint Strike Fighter operations could effectively ground the jets there indefinitely. An Australian F-35A taxis out for a mission at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. The base hosts training for pilots from many Joint Strike Fighter program partner nations., USAF Denying Turkey access to the cloud-based computer network that supports the F-35s, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), could limit the country’s ability to use the jets even further. This would cut Turkish aircraft off from the possibility of receiving any future software updates and other important mission data . Turkey could look to quickly transfer its F-35s to a base on its own territory, but it would still be reliant on ALIS, which serves as the loading point for data packets with flight routes and other mission information before any flight, to have any sort of real combat capability. The network connection could also potentially serve as a vector for the U.S. government to insert more malicious code into the aircraft and actually disable them more permanently.  Only Israel has been able to secure the rights from Lockheed Martin to manipulate the software suite and otherwise operate its jets independent of this cloud-based system. There is an unconfirmed rumor that Secretary of Defense James Mattis has informed his Turkish counterparts that even if they physically take delivery of any F-35s, those jets will never become operational. If true, this would almost certainly be a reference to restrictions on Turkey’s access to ALIS and other vital support for the jets, such as spare parts and assistance with other sustainment issues. The Joint Strike Fighters have already proven to be maintenance heavy and reliability issues continue to hamper the U.S. military’s own ability to operate the jets even with help from Lockheed Martin directly. As such, even if Turkey could find a way around ALIS, its jets would be unlikely to remain airworthy for long without access to U.S.-based supply chains and sustainment services. Of course, even if Turkey was unable to operate the jets, there could still be significant security risks. If Turkish authorities decided that relations with the United States and its other NATO allies had decayed beyond repair, there is the possibility they could turn any F-35s in their possession over to potentially hostile foreign actors for analysis. So far, officials in Ankara have not threatened or otherwise indicated they might consider such an extreme course of action. A member of the US Air Force uses a laptop to access ALIS on an F-35A., USAF The United States and Turkey have been trying to resolve the issue , but have remained largely at an impasse over core issue, which is Turkey’s decision in 2017 to buy Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. This is a saga unto itself that you can read about more here . Turkish authorities insist that this system best meets their long-standing requirements for a more modern, long-range air defense system to replace various Cold War-era gear they still have in service. Other NATO nations, members of the Joint Strike Fighter program who are not part of the alliance, and the United States in particular, are all concerned that the deal could allow Russia to get a hold of secret technical data on the jet’s capabilities. In addition, having the S-400 linked into Turkish defense networks could potentially give Russian technicians access to sensitive information that passes through the cloud-based, multi-national ALIS system. A delegation led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has reportedly tried to finagle a deal by which Turkey can take delivery of the S-400s, but not use them. This could allow President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his administration, which has stood firmly defiant over the issue, to save face, but Turkish authorities have apparently rejected this course of action. “What laws will you [the United States] apply to impose sanctions on the purchase of the S-400?” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in response to the Senate’s vote. “This is a wrong approach; it will lead to a crisis. We have purchased the S-400 and let’s stop talking about this.” A transporter-erector-launcher for the S-400 surface-to-air missile system. , Vitaly Kuzmin But the U.S. government is disinclined to cede its own interests on the issue, especially given that U.S.-Turkish relations have been steadily cooling in general since a portion of Turkey’s military tried to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in 2016. Erdoğan and his support accuse Fethullah Gülen , a former political ally and Islamic cleric who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States, of orchestrating the coup attempt. The U.S. government has refused to extradite him until the Turkish government submits clear evidence of his involvement in the plot, infuriating officials in Ankara. Erdoğan’s increasingly dictatorial administration has also offered to swap Brunson , who had been in Turkey legally for more than 20 years before his arrest, for Gülen. Turkey and the United States also remain locked in a bitter and increasingly dangerous dispute over support for Kurdish rebel factions in Syria, ostensibly to fight ISIS terrorists. Turkish authorities insist that the Syrian groups, known as the People’s Protection Units, who make up the bulk of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, are simply an extension of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party. The U.S. and Turkish governments have both labeled the latter group, also known by the Kurdish acronym PKK, as a terrorist group. The U.S. government, however, disagrees that the organizations in Syria are directly linked with those in Turkey. US special operations forces train Syrian Democratic Forces personnel in Syria in May 2018., US Army In January 2018, Turkish troops backed by Syrian Turkmen militiamen launched an intervention into Northwestern Syria against Kurdish forces. The United States decried the move as distracting from the fight against ISIS, but made no attempt to aid the Kurds in the so-called Afrin canton. More recently, in an apparent attempt to ease tensions with Turkey, the U.S. government has agreed to evacuate Kurdish fighters from the strategic northern city of Manbij. This has been a major demand of the Turkish government and Erdoğan previously threatening to attack American forces if that was necessary to secure the area in order to secure it from the Kurds. It’s unclear how Turkey’s continued refusal to back out of the S-400 deal might impact this new Syrian plan. Congress could potentially seek additional ways to block U.S. military cooperation with Turkish forces in Syria if the dispute continues. For their part, authorities in Ankara have threatened to retaliate by restricting U.S. military access to the air base in Incrilik , which hosts a large number of American personnel and a stockpile of nuclear weapons , as well as a strategic radar base and other sites throughout the country. Turkey has also implied that it could seek additional military cooperation with Russia, such as purchasing the even more advanced S-500 air defense system , if it ends up forced out of the F-35 program. A US Air Force F-15C Eagle takes off from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey., USAF There have also been unconfirmed reports that Turkish officials have inquired about working with the Russians on their Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet . Turkey could also seek the Kremlin’s assistance with its own indigenous TFX stealth fighter program . Either of those options would set Turkey back years from acquiring a fleet of advanced new fighters and it’s not clear if they would ever choose either route. With the Turkish government so heavily invested already in the F-35 and so deeply intertwined in plans for how NATO members will work together to operate the jets, it could be difficult for the United States and its partners to remove it from the Joint Strike Fighter program to begin with. The legal, financial, and logistical complications from such a decision would likely be staggering and take years to resolve. But the two countries seem to be far from reaching a resolution on the increasingly multi-faceted dispute. And though Turkey looks set to get its first F-35s on schedule, it may not be able to take full take advantage of the jets’ capabilities any time soon, if at all. If nothing else, the Turkish pilots who are set to begin training to fly the aircraft at Luke Air Force Base could find themselves in a particularly awkward position for the foreseeable future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 10, 2019",Six Down To Earth Questions We Have About Trump’s Space Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to set up a dedicated Space Force as an independent, sixth branch of the U.S. military. It’s a move that reflects the growing importance of American assets in space to any future operations and the subsequent need to be able to protect them from any kind of threat, but a significant number of questions about how the U.S. military will implement this order remain unanswered. You can read more about the growing importance of space to the U.S. military and the security implications here . You can also find in-depth primer on the push for an independent Space Force here . Trump made the announcement about the potential new service in a meeting of the National Space Council on June 18, 2018. This follows remarks he made at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, situated near San Diego, California, in March 2018, in which he said his administration had plans to establish the Space Force. Here is the core of Trump’s remarks from the National Space Council meeting regarding the future Space Force: “I’m here by directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces. That’s a big statement. We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force — separate but equal.  It is going to be something. So important. General Dunford, if you would carry that assignment out, I would be very greatly honored, also. Where’s General Dunford?  General?  Got it?” U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, the present Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S. military’s top uniformed officer, was at the gathering. “We got it,” he told Trump in response to his question. Since at least July 2017 , the Pentagon has been actively reviewing its options about whether it is prudent to establish a new service, a new functional combatant command along the lines of U.S. Special Operations Command, or some other revised organizational and command structure to address existing and future challenges in space. After Trump’s remarks, the Pentagon’s top spokesperson Dana White implied that the U.S. military would continue to study the issue before implementing anything. But these are the major questions we have when it comes to how the U.S. military would about setting up a Space Force. Can the president actually do this? The most immediate and perhaps most important question is can the president of the United States legally order the U.S. military to create an independent branch without the expressed consent of Congress? Legislators were responsible for establishing the U.S. Air Force in 1947, through the National Security Act, which is the last time the U.S. military added an entirely new service. Even if Trump has the authority to order the Pentagon to form the Space Force, Congress will be the ones to decide how to fund its activities and, in doing so, could mandate specific requirements, such as a specific organizational structure or primary mission. They could also effectively block the new service by refusing to give it any money at all. The Space Force does have vocal advocates in Congress , primarily Mike Rogers, a Republic representative from Alabama, and Jim Cooper, a Democrat representing Tennessee. But it also has opponents, representing opposition from the Pentagon itself , who succeeded in stripping out a provision in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the formal title for the annual defense budget, that would have forced the Pentagon to create the branch already. Instead, lawmakers required the U.S. military to study the issue, which they are doing now. What kind of ‘independent’ service? As it stands now, there are two distinct kinds of independent service in the U.S. military, ones that have their own department within the larger Department of Defense and others that answer to someone else. There are Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Marine Corps exists under the Department of the Navy. The Coast Guard occupies a unique and obtuse arrangement under which it is subordinate to the Department of Homeland Security, but can become part of the Department of the Navy by order of Congress or the President. The arrangement that Representatives Rogers and Cooper proposed in the defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year would have formed the Space Force under the Department of the Air Force. However, after getting pushback from that service, Rogers threatened to propose a new structure that would make the additional branch entirely separate . Either structure would create a new Chief of the Space Force who would sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and act as the primary advocate and subject matter on space issues. But since space-based assets, such as satellite communications and GPS , are so heavily intertwined throughout all of the services, it’s not clear how that individual would be able to make any major decisions and enact policy without direct, constant coordination with the other branches. A mobile antenna that is part of one of the Air Force’s Eagle Vision systems, which forces in the field to rapidly download satellite imagery and other information, even in austere locations., USAF What will its mission be? Though it may seem obvious, deciding on the primary mission of the Space Force is likely to be a significant issue, both inside the United States and internationally. The immediate goal that its advocates have stated is to create a central manager for U.S. military space policy and procurement issues to help streamline the process of establishing priorities and requirements and buying systems to meet those needs. There has been no real discussion so far about whether or not the service will have an implicit or explicit mission to conduct combat activities of any kind in outer space. This is unlikely, at least any time in the near future, to involve something out of a science fiction movie like transport spacecraft carrying “ space marines .” This 1960s concept art of American troops in space suits fighting an unseen enemy on the Moon is exactly the kind of thing a future Space Force won’t be doing., US Army Beyond just the possibility that an opponent could use a ground-based missile to shoot down satellites, there is the increasingly real possibility that unmanned, semi-autonomous or autonomous spacecraft could launch physical attacks on other objects outside the Earth’s atmosphere. International law hasn’t really caught up with this reality, either, especially given that there are satellites in orbit that country’s don’t even acknowledge exist . The video below offers a good primer about the issues the U.S. military is increasingly facing in space. https://youtube.com/watch?v=j-ZBLFhb_lg “It’s really difficult to go ahead and justify how you might attack somebody’s homeland if they’ve taken out a satellite that you don’t even admit exists,” Douglas Loverro, who was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the time, said at a gathering at the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in October 2016 . “Probably people are going to die on the ground where nobody’s going to die in space.” If it even looks as if the United States might be preparing for an active conflict in space by establishing a Space Force, it could prompt other nations to follow suit or accelerate pre-existing efforts . The result could be a further destabilizing space arms race or simply increase the potential for accidents to end up looking like hostile action, which could have disastrous consequences . A photograph showing an apparent Chinese military test of an anti-ballistic missile system, which the US government believes are a cover for anti-satellite weapons developments., via Weibo Who’s budget? The previous question has immense significance when it comes to the defense budget. The Marine Corps’ budget is presently included within the Navy’s budget. If the Space Force ended up as part of the Department of the Air Force, it would likely lead to a similar arrangement. The problem here is that the Space Force’s proponents argue that the Air Force doesn’t make space issues enough of a priority in its budgets, which is the main reason for creating the Space Force at all. Letting that service have the final say over its new cousin’s budget runs the inherent risk of leaving things largely unchanged. In addition to the possibility of inter-service squabbles there over the allocation of funds, the Air Force and Space Force would be in the position of having to argue together for an increased share of the overall budget. This might not be the same issue for the Trump administration as it was for past administrations since the president has pledged to continue expanding spending as a whole. President Trump signs the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act into law in December 2017., DOD Who’s personnel and assets? When the U.S. military created the independent U.S. Air Force in 1947, the U.S. Army Air Forces had been operating largely independently already. There were still significant issues in separating logistics, administrative, and other elements that took years to fully resolve and the two services have repeatedly spared since then over their respective roles and missions. If the U.S. military were to create a new Space Force is would not do so from scratch and it could lead to a bitter fight over who gets to control what units, assets, and other resources. The Air Force has the most to lose in any such arrangement since it operates the bulk of the U.S. military’s existing relevant ground and space-based infrastructure, including satellites and space vehicle launch sites, as well as largely directing the U.S. military’s space policy, via Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). Vice President Mike Pence sits at a workstation during a tour of Schriever Air Force Base, home of the US Air Force’s 50th Space Wing., USAF It is also especially active in the “aerospace” domain, working on spaceplanes such as the secretive X-37B and potentially other space-based capabilities we don’t yet know about. There’s also just the matter of where the Space Force’s units would operate from, which could lead to them sharing or outright taking over certain bases from the Air Force. Moving those functions to other locations could devastate the surrounding economies and impact operations, too. The other branches are likely to be reticent to give up their own space-focused components – U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), Naval Network and Space Operations Command (NNSOC), Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), and U.S. Marine Corps Forces Strategic Command (MARFORSTRAT) – in part or in full. We don’t know how this might impact the activities of U.S. Strategic Command or the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, both of which rely heavily on space-based assets to watch for enemy attacks . There is also still a potential in the future for a space-based layer to the United States’ ballistic missile defense shield that could actively engage incoming threats. The X-37B spaceplane., USAF The proposal that Rogers and Cooper put forward also said that their concept for a Space Force would have no impact on the operation the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the U.S. Intelligence Community’s central satellite intelligence component, or the National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency ( NGA ), the Pentagon’s main map-making division, but it is hard to see how this could be the case. Both of those services work very closely with AFSPC and it would be easy for their missions to overlap with a newly expanded and empowered space-focused service. This past idea for a space military branch also did not specify how this might affect other space-based intelligence activities under the National Security Agency or Central Intelligence Agency . We have already seen the immense difficulties in separating military and intelligence roles and missions when it has come to the creation of an independent U.S. Cyber Command within the Pentagon. The video below shows the Air Force’s Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) early warning satellite constellation in action, which watches for potential hostile missile launches , but also performs an important strategic intelligence-gathering function . Space Force or Space Corps? “The Army has doctrine, the Navy has tradition, and the Air Force is new,” is something an old mentor of mine was particularly fond of saying. It’s a statement that is immediately up for debate, but the last point will be as much of an issue for any Space Force as it has been for the Air Force over the years. The new branch will get the unusual opportunity to choose what doctrine and traditions it carries over from its sister services as it works to establish its own. The most immediate of these questions will be what rank structure to adopt.  Will it be a “Space Force” that draws inspiration from the Army and the Air Force or a “Space Corps” that takes a nod from the Navy and the Marine Corps? Science fiction is particularly fond of treating space-faring forces as “navies” with captains and commanders overseeing “ships” in a “fleet.” There will be similar questions about uniform styles and other symbols. Each existing U.S. military service has distinct styles of both working and dress uniform s to help differentiate the branches and give their members a sense of pride in their particular organization. When it comes to choosing new uniform styles and colors, though, the U.S. military’s own history is already replete with costly debacles . Starship Troopers—Touchstone Pictures While these are hardly the most pressing of questions when it comes to the new branch, it is likely to be an important considering if the service actually comes into existence. Naming conventions , heraldry , and other aspects of the pomp and ceremony that surround the U.S. military are often as hotly debated as actual policy and procurement decisions. Trump and his administration will have to answer these questions, and no doubt many more, if the Space Force is supposed to go from the realm of science fiction to reality.

It’s no secret that the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has been expanding at an amazing pace, but its rapid qualitative growth has become equally impressive in recent years. With its first carrier battle group operational and its shipbuilding apparatus pumping out hulls as if it were on a war footing, the PLAN’s capabilities have gone from a major concern to an outright threat to America and allied naval power in the region. A recently published video, seen below, highlights the state of China’s naval might like nothing before. Part of it was shot during a massive naval parade in the South China Sea last April that was attended by a fatigue-clad President Xi Jinping and other high-ranking officials. The chart below gives at least a basic idea of just how much the Chinese Navy’s surface combatant fleet has expanded in just a decade’s time: When it comes to gross tonnage, China has challenged the output of every navy around the globe, including the U.S. Navy. The chart posted below, which is part of a particularly insightful write-up by the think tank IISS, depicts how China’s shipbuilding continues to accelerate, with a massive shift in output seen over the last decade. IISS The huge increase for 2015-2017 is a bit skewed by the launch of China’s first indigenous carrier, while the 2014 timeframe is also skewed for the U.S. because of the launch of the 100,000-ton displacement supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford. China’s naval vessels are also increasing dramatically in size and complexity , making the ‘tonnage’ they are outputting far more potent than in the past. Below the surface, the threat that the Chinese Navy poses is also becoming more palpable. China’s submarine force has expanded drastically in recent years. Today, the U.S. Navy has 63 submarines and China has 78, roughly speaking. While the U.S. Navy fields and all nuclear submarine force, which The War Zone believes is a terrible choice , China has a mix of nuclear submarines and smaller diesel-electric types. Diesel-electric submarines are far cheaper to build than nuclear counterparts and considering China has a focus on implementing an anti-access/area-denial strategy based around regional defense, these boats, which excel in littoral warfare, are very well suited to the task. Additionally, newer diesel-electric submarines with air-independent propulsion technology (AIP) can be quieter than nuclear submarines and are capable of diving for weeks at a time. In essence, they are a near ideal for which to implement China’s strategy and to be mass produced so that they can counter-balance America and its allies’ submarine capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. The Typ 055 Destroyer is China’s largest and most impressive surface combatant yet and will serve at the heart of future battle groups., Chinese Media The fact that China has been able to realize such a massive expansion of its naval forces, both in terms of quality and quantity, prompts the big question: what will the PLAN look like in another decade? This haunting concern is one of the largest driving factors behind the U.S. Navy’s 355 ship fleet ambitions, which are going to be a major challenge to realize without a dramatic restructuring of its procurement priorities , existing fleet sustainment practices , and facilities management . The Gerald R. Ford is an impressive albeit troubled ship, and with a $12B+ price tag, alternatives to buying supercarriers alone for the Navy’s tactical airpower should be closely examined . This is one of many rationalizations that should be on the table going forward., USN With the Pentagon’s shift to ‘great power competition’ under Secretary Mattis, and with China now America’s top technological peer competitor , its ever-strengthening Navy is sure to cast a long shadow on the DoD’s list of priorities. But if things continue to go as they are, and with a catapult equipped Chinese aircraft carrier , and possibly a nuclear one as well , on the horizon, the days of America’s outright supremacy on and below the high-seas may be coming to an end.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 16, 2018",The Army Wants Longer Barreled Howitzers To Fire Ramjet-Powered And Other Special Shells,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of a broader effort to extend the range of its artillery units, the U.S. Army is working as fast as it can to finish development of a new, longer howitzer barrel that will more double the maximum range of both its towed and self-propelled 155mm guns. The service says that the upgraded weapons will be able to effectively fire new ramjet-powered shells , as well as employ improved rocket-assisted projectiles, both of which it sees as increasingly important weapons for defeating a near-peer opponent, such as Russia , in any potential high-end conflict. According to a report by Warrior Maven earlier in June 2018, the Army has built new prototypes of the XM907 155mm cannon and recently conducted a mobility test of a modified M777A2 towed howitzer with the Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona. The service has been working on the project, which it refers to as the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ECRA) program, since at least 2016 . “When you are talking about doubling the range you need a longer tube and a larger caliber,” an unnamed Army engineer involved in the ECRA project told Warrior Maven. “We are upgrading the breach and metallurgy of the tube, changing the hydraulics to handle increased pressure and using a new ram jet projectile – kind of like a rocket.” The new cannon itself is 1,000 pounds heavier and six feet longer than the existing M205 on the M777A2 and will also be longer than the M284 cannon on the M109A6 and A7 self-propelled howitzers. The M284 has the same barrel length as the M205, but is heavier. One of the prototype M777A2 howitzers with the new XM907 cannon., US Army The upgraded XM907 has a host of new improvements throughout, including the reinforced barrel and breach assemblies, and will feature a new muzzle break on the end of the barrel to better mitigate the shock and recoil from firing more powerful rounds. Norwegian defense contractor Nammo is already in the process of developing the XM1113 rocket-assisted projectile for the Army. Howitzers with the new barrels should be able to fire these extended-range shells at targets more than 40 miles away. They’ll be able to lob existing types of ammunition further than before, as well. A diagram showing the internal structure of the new XM1113 rocket-assisted 155mm projectile., US Army At present, M777s and M109s firing existing rocket-boosted rounds have a maximum range of fewer than 20 miles. The M982 Excalibur GPS-guided projectile is the longest-range option presently available, but can still only reach enemies approximately 25 miles away. The addition of a ramjet-powered artillery shell could push the maximum range of these weapons out to more than 60 miles. The Army has yet to say what specific designs it might be looking at with regards to this type of ammunition, but has made it clear it is very interested in the concept. Earlier in June 2018, Nammo unveiled a mockup of its 155mm Solid Fuel Ramjet projectile at the biennial Eurosatory arms expo in France. However, the company said that it had, so far, received “no set-in-stone firm requirement” for the shell from any possible customer. In 2016, South Korean defense contractor Poongsan revealed its own ramjet artillery shell concept, which had an estimated range of approximately 50 miles. South Africa’s state-owned arms conglomerate Denel pitched yet another type to the Army in the early 2000s under the name ProRam, which could hit targets around 55 miles away. Denel expected the unit price for ProRam to be less than $5000, which would be more expensive than conventional shells, but less pricey than guided artillery rounds. It lacked a guidance package of its own, though, and Nammo’s precision-guided type may turn out to be significantly more expensive. Price will be an important factor in the development of any ramjet-powered shells since artillery units are often called upon to provide a significant volume of fire. If the rounds turn out to be overly expensive, the Army could decide it’s not a practical option for its upgraded howitzers. That being said, the service has already added the GPS-guided Excalibur to the mix of shells available to its units and each one of those costs close to $70,000, which is significantly more than ProRam’s estimated price point. The new cannon barrels may also be better suited to firing hypersonic projectiles. The Army, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy , is looking at ammunition based on existing designs for its experimental railguns as another possible option to extend the range of existing howitzers. There are potential pitfalls in the development of the extended-length cannon barrels themselves, too. The added weight changes the center of gravity of the lightweight M777 and the Army has had to add weights at various points to try and level things out. It’s not clear whether this is an issue for the M109s, but at least early on in the ERCA program, the Army found artillery units had concerns about howitzers with the new barrels just falling over. “The visual prejudice we are up against is that it looks like it may tip over with all that extra cannon,” David Bound, the engineer leading the M777 upgrade effort at the Artillery Concepts and Design Branch of the service’s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center, said in 2016 . An M109A6 self-propelled howitzer., US Army Another issue with the added length is how the barrel flexes and moves during normal movements and transport. If it bends too much and gets warped, it would throw off the weapon’s accuracy or make the howitzer dangerous to use at all. This, again, has been a particularly pronounced issue for the M777. Unlike the Army’s previous towed howitzers, it hitches up to the truck pulling it via a ring on the muzzle break. Adding six extra feet between the prime mover and the howitzers own two wheels only increases concerns about how much the barrel flexing as the vehicle goes driving down what may be bumpy or uneven roads and other pathways. The aforementioned mobility test at Yuma was almost certainly an attempt, at least in part, to determine how realistic these issues might be in practice. This image of a US Marine Corps M777 hitched up to a truck gives a good sense of how much distance there is between the prime mover and the howitzer’s wheels on the existing version of the weapon during transit., USMC In addition, the extended overall length of the howitzers and the added weight will impact how they fit inside aircraft and ships, and how easy it is to sling load the M777 underneath helicopters . These could be particularly acute problems for the U.S. Marine Corps , which is also interested in acquiring the Army’s new barrel for its M777s. But the added range that the combination of longer barrels and new rocket-assisted projectiles offers may help mitigate some of these concerns. And the benefits of adding ramjet-powered shells into the mix could easily be game-changing. An artillery unit with howitzers able to hit targets between 45 and 60 miles away can cover a significantly greater target total area without ever having to relocate its guns. This would make the weapons more flexible in distributed and expeditionary operations and could limit the impact of it being more difficult to transport them. It would also expand the possible locations where Army and Marine elements could establish firebases to begin with during expeditionary or distributed operations while still being in range of the units they’re tasked to support. This could be beneficial in both low- and high-end conflict scenarios where it could be necessary to quickly shift focus from supporting operations in one particular area to another. The need to provide fire missions across a wide front simultaneously or conduct operations far from established supply chains could also limit the overall resources available to start with. The ability of artillery units to respond faster to fire support requests across greater distances would also give them even more capability to attack time-sensitive targets, including enemy mobile ballistic missiles or command and control nodes , before an opponent could relocate those assets or otherwise seek cover. It would similarly give forces on the ground additional options to quickly engage small groups of fighters or even specific individuals before they could flee the area. The boost in range will also be essential to avoiding artillery counter-attacks from potential opponents, such as Russian troops armed with the new 2S33 Msta-SM2 152mm self-propelled howitzer. This weapon reportedly has a range of more than 25 miles and it could be even longer depending on whether it needs rocket-assisted ammunition to reach those target areas. An older Russian 2S19 Msta-S self-propelled howitzer. The 2S33 is an improved version of this design., Vitaly Kuzmin According to Warrior Maven, the Army said that this threat was among the main reasons for fast-tracking the work on the new barrels and long-range ammunition. Many NATO members , as well as other U.S. allies and partners , have already adopted towed and self-propelled guns with longer barrels for the same reasons. For still largely unexplained reasons, the U.S. military has lagged behind in up-gunning its howitzers. Longer-range artillery will be increasingly important in any future large-scale conflict against a near-peer opponent, though. China, among others, is also developing new cannon and rocket artillery systems , as well as conventionally-armed cruise and ballistic missiles with a clear eye toward limiting the ability for enemy forces to operate across wide swaths of the Pacific region, especially in the South China Sea , during a crisis. “We’ve got to push the maximum range of all systems under development for close, deep and strategic, and we have got to outgun the enemy,” U.S. Army General Robert Brown, head of U.S. Army Pacific Command, said during a panel discussion at the Association of the U.S. Army’s Global Force Symposium in March 2018. “We don’t do that right now; it’s a huge gap. … We need cannons that fire as far as rockets today. We need rockets that fire as far as today’s missiles, and we need missiles out to 499 kilometers [approximately 310 miles].” The new cannons for the Army’s 155mm howitzers are a key part of achieving those goals and the service definitely seems intent on getting the upgraded guns, and new ammunition to go along with them, into service as soon as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 10, 2018","This Tiny Missile Smashes Incoming Artillery Rounds, Drones, And Possibly Much More","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has awarded Lockheed Martin a $2.6 million contract to continue development of its Miniature Hit-to-Kill interceptor, or MHTK. The service is interested in using the weapon to help troops on the ground knock down incoming artillery projectiles and small unmanned aerial vehicles , but the tiny missile, or other designs leveraging some portion of its technology, could possibly evolve to take on other roles . The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor announced the deal in a press release on June 13, 2018. The contract also moves the MHTK out of the experimental science and technology phase and into formal development. The Army is pursuing the interceptor as one of the multiple weapons that will work with its truck-mounted Multi-Mission Launcher as part of what is now called the Extended Mission Area Missile (EMAM) program. The launcher and the rest of the complete air defense system, including a networked command and control setup and mobile fire-control radar, are part of the larger and obtusely named Indirect Fire Protection Capability, Increment 2 – Intercept, or IFPC Inc 2-I , effort. “This award brings us one step closer to addressing a top battlefield priority,” Hal Stuart, the Force Protection Program Manager at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, said in a statement. MHTK offers “an effective and cost-efficient solution to defeat rockets, artillery shells, mortars and other airborne targets,” he added, a mission commonly known as Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortars, or C-RAM. Lockheed Martin has been actively working on MHTK since 2012 , developing the system with a combination of internal company funds and contracts from the Army. The company conducted its most recent controlled flight test, involving an interceptor with improved airframe and internal electronics, at the service’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in January 2018. Looking more like a model rocket than an advanced kinetic interceptor, at less than two and a half feet long, approximately one and a half inches in diameter, and a total weight of around five pounds, the missile is small by any definition. For comparison, this is roughly half the physical size of and more than a pound lighter than a short-range FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missile. Lockheed Martin keeps the size of the interceptor down in large part by eliminating the need for a warhead. Instead, the MHTK uses its speed and precision to physically slam into its target and destroy it, hence “hit-to-kill.” The company says the missiles can defeat artillery rockets and shells, mortar bombs, and small drones , the latter of which are becoming an increasingly likely threat to American troops in potential low- and high-end conflicts . The complete system uses a radar on the ground to spot incoming threats and cue the missile toward them. A small active seeker inside the missile then takes over to guide the interceptor into its target. Without a warhead, and associated systems that come along with one, the interceptors themselves are relatively cheap, as well, with Lockheed Martin aiming for a unit cost as low as $16,000 . This is less than half that of a Stinger missile and exponentially cheaper than the price tag on traditional short-range missiles, such as the AIM-9X Sidewinder . The small size also expands the magazine depth of the Army’s Multi-Mission Launcher, since four MHTKs can fit inside each one of its 15 launch cells. This means one launcher alone could conceivably carry a full load of 60 interceptors, which could help the complete system have the necessary volume to have the best chance of defending against a large-scale indirect attack. A cutaway mockup showing how multiple MHTK interceptors can fit inside a single Multi-Mission Launcher cell., Joseph Trevithick The Army also envisions fielding individual Multi-Mission Launchers armed with a mix of different interceptors that could allow them to act as layered, short-range air defense systems all by themselves. The service has already selected the aforementioned AIM-9X for more traditional short-range air defense capability against low-flying aircraft and helicopters. With launchers networked together, each one might not necessarily have to have all the different types of interceptors though, with radars cueing certain ones to the most suitable targets. This could also give the IFPC Inc 2-I systems greater flexibility to engage targets over a wider area, as well as share information back and forth with other, larger air defense systems with more powerful and longer-range sensors. In 2017, the Army demonstrated it could engage small drones with its long-range Patriot surface-to-air missiles if absolutely necessary. MHTK had been competing more directly against a team made up of Raytheon and Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, who had been offering a missile called Sky Hunter . This was effectively a modified version of the Tamir inceptor, which is the weapon at the core of the Israeli Iron Dome defense system. Iron Dome’s primary targets are also rockets and other artillery rounds. The Army has also tested the millimeter wave radar-guided Longbow Hellfire as a possible option for the Multi-Mission Launcher. This could potentially give it a surface-to-surface attack capability, as well. Together, the EMAM program and the Multi-Mission Launcher are both essential parts of the Army’s effort to address an increasingly glaring short-range air defense gap and emerging concerns about swarms of small unmanned aircraft. There’s always the long-standing and continued threat from mortars and larger artillery systems, as well. With renewed concerns about future conflicts with near-peer opponents, such as Russia or China , the U.S. military as a whole has rediscovered a need to defend against possible aerial attacks and find answers to potential opponents’ advanced artillery developments . Small and non-state actors are also becoming ever better equipped in these regards, as well, especially when it comes to smaller, improvised drones . The Army is also looking to add directed energy weapons to various units to disable or destroy certain threats, as well as improve its larger, longer-range air defense capabilities. These, along with MHTK and other systems, could potentially get blended together on the same platform for added flexibility against a wide array of targets. A US Army briefing slide outlining the proposed mix of short-range air defense systems in the near-, mid-, and far-terms, including the Multi-Mission Launcher, directed energy (DE) weapons, and other systems., US Army But MHTK’s size and low price point could potentially make it, or a system derived from it, attractive both within the Army and to other U.S. military services in other formats. One of the more obvious potential applications would be looking into integrating a truncated version of the Multi-Mission Launcher onto armored platforms that can operate closer to the front lines or even smaller vehicles for more limited missions. Depending on how quickly the seeker inside the interceptor activates and can acquire its target, it could have some utility against larger, but still low-flying aircraft, such as gunship helicopters . It might be possible to develop a version that is still smaller, lighter, and cheaper than the FIM-92 Stinger missile that would expand the air defense capabilities available to small units. If this is the case, a man-portable type might be another possibility, with active radar guidance leaving tradition infrared countermeasures useless. US Marines fire a man-portable, shoulder-fired FIM-92 Stinger missile during a training exercise., USMC In the same vein, the interceptors might be a useful supplement to point-defense systems on ships. The compact nature of the system means that it could potentially fit on almost any size of watercraft to offer additional protection against various threats. An air-launched MHTK, or derivative, might offer a close-in option for aircraft against incoming missiles or other projectiles, too. In May 2018, the U.S. Navy announced it was interested in acquiring a “hard-kill” defense system to defend various large and increasingly vulnerable cargo and other combat-support aircraft from incoming missiles. That service, along with the U.S. Marine Corps, has also been investigating potential ways to defend helicopters specifically against rocket-propelled grenades . Northrop Grumman has also already patented its own separate design for just such an active protection system for low-observable aircraft. A series of photographs from a test of Israeli defense contractor Rafael’s prototype hard-kill active protection system for helicopters against a rocket-propelled grenade., Rafael Again, a more advanced version may be able to take on more complex aerial targets at close ranges. A small, short-range missile derived from the MHTK could be an especially valuable option for internal carriage on fifth generation multi-role fighter jets, which otherwise have limited space available for self-defense weapons during strike missions that require them to operate in full stealth mode. Lockheed Martin has already proposed a conceptual small, hit-to-kill air-to-air missile called Cuda for its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to help expand how many targets it might be able to engage defensively while remaining as stealthy as possible. These would still be significantly larger than the MHTK interceptors. Whatever the case, Lockheed Martin and the Army are moving ahead in developing the MHTK for its primary and important role of guarding against incoming indirect attacks and small unmanned aircraft. But hit-to-kill missile technology is clearly a growing field and there is significant potential for designs such as Lockheed Martin’s MHTK to take on a wider variety of missions and offer far less expensive and compact options compared to their existing counterparts.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Pentagon Admits Afghanistan’s New Black Hawks Can’t Match Its Older Russian Choppers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A report from a top U.S. military watchdog has finally acknowledged that the UH-60A+ Black Hawks that the United States is supplying to the Afghan Air Force are less capable and harder to maintain than the Russian-made Mi-17 Hip helicopters they have now. The review raises concerns that this could limit Afghanistan’s ability to conduct operations across the country unless steps are taking to mitigate the loss of capability, something we at The War Zone have long warned could easily be the case . The Pentagon’s own Office of the Inspector General included these frank admissions in a routine, periodic update on U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, nicknamed Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, and assistance to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), which it released in May 2018. The Department of Defense leads this oversight effort, which also includes representatives from the U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development. “The transition [from Mi-17s to UH-60s] presents several challenges that have yet to be fully addressed,” the report says in a section dedicated to the issue. “Black Hawks do not have the lift capacity of Mi-17s.” “They are unable to accommodate some of the larger cargo items the Mi-17s can carry, and in general, it takes almost two Black Hawks to carry the load of a single Mi-17,” the review continues. “Furthermore, unlike Mi-17s, Black Hawks cannot fly at high elevations and, as such, cannot operate in remote regions of Afghanistan where Mi-17s operate.” An Afghan Air Force Mi-17 helicopter., USAF These are relatively damning statements to come out of the Pentagon itself, given that it has pushed for and continually defended the delivery of the Black Hawks to the Afghan Air Force as essential to both the effort to modernize that service and a broader goal of improving the Afghan military’s ability to conduct operations independently of the NATO-led coalition in the country.  The U.S. military eventually hopes to supply a total of nearly 160 UH-60s, including gunship versions with forward-firing weapons, to both the Afghan Air Force and the special operations-dedicated Special Mission Wing (SMW). As of December 2017, the Afghan Air Force had eight UH-60A+ helicopters. The plan is for the service to have 52 of the rotary wing aircraft operational by the end of 2019. The A+ model aircraft have the same engines as the later UH-60L, as well as other minor modifications, but lack the latest updates available on U.S. Army types, such as digital flight management systems. But even so, the Black Hawks are significantly more complex than the Mi-17s, which raises additional maintenance and logistics issues. Afghan ground crews are responsible for 80 percent of the maintenance on the Hips themselves, with the remaining 20 percent being heavy depot maintenance they do not have the facilities to perform in-country. Private contractors provide the bulk of the support, at significant additional cost, for the other aircraft types across the Afghan Air Force and SMW. “The Mi-17 is ‘much more conducive to the education level available in the general Afghan population than the UH-60As’ when it comes to maintenance,” the 9th Air Expeditionary Task Force-Afghanistan (AETF-A), the U.S. Air Force’s top command for operations in Afghanistan, which also oversees advising the Afghan Air Force, said, according to the Pentagon Inspector General’s review. “The expectation is that the AAF will be almost entirely reliant on contractors for Black Hawk maintenance in the near- to mid-term.” And with Mi-17s still being the workhorse of the Afghan Air Force, the U.S. military has faced additional challenges in maintaining that capability while at the same time trying to work toward phasing it out. This has been most pronounced with regards to transitioning qualified pilots and other aircrews to operate Black Hawks. “Even though the Mi-17 is being phased out, 9th AETF-A said the new pilots are needed to replace Mi-17 pilots who migrate to Black Hawks,” the Inspector General report notes. “This raises concerns about the efficiency of training Afghan pilots to fly an airframe that is being phased out, rather than putting new trainees directly into the Black Hawk pipeline.” The same goes for training ground crews to maintain the Russian-made helicopters. The Afghan Air Force sorely needs those personnel to support existing operations. A member of the Afghan Air Force works on a Mi-17 helicopter., USAF The U.S. military has sought to downplay these issues. In a statement to Bloomberg , U.S. Army Army Lieutenant Colonel Kone Faulkner, a Pentagon spokesperson, said that the UH-60s would be able to perform 90 percent of the missions that the Afghan Mi-17s do at present, but did not offer any specifics. It is difficult to imagine how this could be an entirely accurate appraisal of the situation. Though the UH-60 may have the necessary performance to conduct individual missions, those helicopters simply will not be as flexible and rapidly able to move around Afghanistan’s mountainous terrain as the Mi-17s. Members of the U.S. Air Force recently noted publicly in a video seen below that switching from HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters, a variant of the Black Hawk, to the Army’s larger and more powerful CH-47 Chinooks allowed them to fly straight over certain mountains instead of having to go around them. Those same individuals also raised the issue of the smaller helicopters limited payload capacity, especially in the hot-and-high environment in the country. This has been an issue for other types of helicopters the Afghan Air Force operates, as well. “In many cases the UH-60 is as, or more, capable than the Mi-17,” Faulkner insisted to Bloomberg. One version “provides more firepower than the Mi-17 variant, which is limited to rockets only and is less maneuverable,” he noted. This is not entirely accurate. The Hips can and do carry forward-firing 23mm gun pods in addition to unguided rockets. They also have additional machine guns mounted at the forward doors to the main cabin. Regardless, between June and November 2017, helicopters with these weapons conducted nearly 20 percent of all Afghan Air Force air-to-ground fire support missions. And neither the Pentagon’s Inspector General’s report nor Faulkner even touched on why any of this is an issue to begin with. For years, members of Congress had increasingly questioned why the U.S. military was buying Russian-made helicopters instead of offering an American-built platform, an issue that only became more significant after Russia illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimea and ended up under significant U.S. sanctions. Now unable to buy new Hips straight from the manufacturer, the U.S. military has already experienced significant difficulties keeping both the existing Mi-17s going and delivering the new UH-60s, which has required some almost bizarre bureaucratic shuffling. It’s also important to note that the Afghan Air Force has had a long-standing requirement for a total fleet of more than 50 Hips, but it has never been able to reach that target. As of December 2017, the Afghan Air Force had 47 Mi-17s in inventory, but 24 of them were non-mission capable due to maintenance issues. In May 2018, Afghan forces blew up one of these helicopters on the ground after a reported “hard landing” apparently totaled the aircraft , further reducing the available fleet. In one attempt to quickly make up for these shortfalls, which continue amid a worrisome surge in Taliban and other insurgent activity since 2017, the U.S. military actually transferred two Mi-17s to the Afghan Air Force from U.S. Army’s own Company C, 1st Battalion, 223rd Aviation Regiment at Fort Rucker in Alabama. This unit runs a so-called “Non-Standard Rotary Wing” training program that employs these Russian-built helicopters. For those who don't know, Company C, 1st Battalion, 223d Aviation runs a non-standard rotary wing training course at Rucker with these. pic.twitter.com/PhNQG9X3xT — Joseph Trevithick (@FranticGoat) May 2, 2018 At the same time, the U.S. military has been rapidly acquiring the necessary UH-60s by functionally buying them from itself and then making arrangements to send them to Afghanistan. These aircraft have come by way of the Army-run Blackhawk Exchange and Sales Team, or BEST , which works to exchange retired UH-60s of various types with other federal agencies or sell them to allies, partners, and private companies. In effect, the Army “sold” the helicopters to the U.S. military’s Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A), which “purchased” them using funds Congress has set aside in the Pentagon’s budget to support Afghanistan’s military. In February 2018 , the Pentagon asked legislators to allow them to use the money they had “gained” in this transaction to buy new UH-60M helicopters for the Army itself. The reality of what occurred is closer to moving the funding from one line in a spreadsheet to another and handing over dozens of helicopters to the Afghans essentially for free. A retired EH-60A helicopter sits next to other Black Hawks awaiting transfer via the BEST program., US Army Together with the U.S. military’s Inspector General’s review, this can only raise questions about the efficacy and oversight of the overall efforts to modernize the Afghan Air Force. It also prompts concerns about whether or not Afghanistan’s military will suffer a significant loss in capability in the near- or even mid-term, which will require the United States and its partners to remain in the country longer or even take a newly active role in the conflict. Of course, none of this is necessarily new or surprising. As noted, I myself had warned about exactly these issues, writing in September 2017: It’s hard to imagine the Afghan UH-60 fleet will be able to match that level of independent operation any time soon and the transition could throw the relative stability of the “advanced” Mi-17 program into disarray. Captain Salvin told Military Times that the U.S. military plans to provide training more than 60 future UH-60 pilots in both  Afghanistan and the United States, starting between October and  November. But it’s not at all clear where these aviators would come from and Salvin suggested this would be separate for transition training for existing Hip crews. As of July  2017, the Afghan Air Force had 82 Hip pilots in total , including 39 co-pilots and 11 instructors, according to a quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a top U.S. government watchdog. If the U.S. military plans to pull a significant number of Mi-17 pilots and crews off the line for these training courses, it will have to fill in the obvious and immediate gap with American aircraft or contractors,  or otherwise accept that the Afghan military will have a significant shortfall in air mobility capability. SIGAR said in its July 2017  quarterly report that the Hips had flown 50 percent of all Afghan Air  Force missions in the preceding four months despite reportedly having the lowest operational readiness rate of any of the service’s airframes. American officials blamed the low availability on the age of the aircraft, but it seems very likely that this heavy utilization was a  significant factor, as well. There’s also no indication of how long the training programs will last and how long it will be before the Afghans can routinely conduct missions and necessary repairs independent of coalition advisers and contractor support with the UH-60. We do know that it took years for both the Afghan military and police to reach their existing proficiency with the Mi-17, despite it being a significantly simpler aircraft and there being an existing Soviet-trained experience base. I reiterated many of these points when additional information first emerged in December 2017 that suggested these issues were already cropping up. Now it seems all but certain that these factors will have at least some impact on Afghan operations in the coming months. None of this can come as a shock to the U.S. military, either, which saw the release of another scathing Inspector General review of the Afghan Air Force as a whole in January 2018. Perhaps thankfully, Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani has recently implemented a unilateral eight-day ceasefire , which began on June 12, 2018. This includes the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which marks the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, on June 15, 2018. The Taliban responded with its own first-ever ceasefire declaration as a goodwill gesture. This will give the Afghan military at least something of a respite from what has already been a bloody year of fighting . Unfortunately, it won’t be anywhere near enough time for the Afghan Air Force to sort out its helicopter difficulties, which, based on what we know now, could easily continue for years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2019",The Marines Are Still Trying To Figure Out When Their F-35Bs Might Literally Fall Apart,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier in June 2018, anyone driving on the highways near the city of Wichita, Kansas might have caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a UFO on the back of a large flatbed truck. What they were actually looking at is part of the work being done to answer the very important question of just how long an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is supposed to last before it’s no longer airworthy. So far, the U.S. Air Force’s F-35As and U.S. Navy’s F-35Cs look to be as durable as expected, but tests on an example of the U.S. Marine Corps’s F-35B have exposed more serious issues. On June 6, 2018, the F-35 aircraft, an A model, arrived at Wichita State University’s National Institute for Aviation Research, or NIAR , as part of the Joint Strike Fighter program’s durability testing regimen. Manufacturer Lockheed Martin had sent the jet from its Fort Worth plant to the research facility so that specialists could tear it down and inspect its internal structure to determine whether it had adequately withstood earlier tests. At present, the F-35A, B, and C are all supposed to have a lifespan of 8,000 flight hours. “As part of the F-35 program, durability ground test aircraft undergo exhaustive testing to validate the structural integrity of the airframe to withstand a variety of maneuvers it will experience throughout its lifetime,” NIAR said in a statement to the Kansas Department of Transportation . The latter organization also released images and other information about the plane on the back of the truck to allay any possible public concerns. A truck carries an F-35A ground test article to Wichita State University’s National Institute for Aviation Research in June 2018., KDOT This isn’t the first time NIAR has helped analyze the results of structural and durability tests on F-35 aircraft. In August 2017, the facility received an F-35B model for inspection. The institute also performs a wide array of other aviation testing services for the U.S. government and private companies and hosts two additional centers that it operates in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Air Force. Lockheed Martin has built a total of six ground test articles , two of each of the three F-35 variants, to support these experiments and has been actively stress and fatigue testing the airframes since 2009. The company and its subcontractors have used a host of different test stands and other equipment to drop and otherwise simulate typical operations and maneuvers that the aircraft will experience during its expected life cycle. https://youtube.com/watch?v=h6BsCvDgbsc The U.S. military’s central Joint Program Office (JPO) for the Joint Strike Fighter has mandated that testing put each type of jet through testing that simulates the equivalent of three full life cycles , or 24,000 flight hours. This doesn’t mean that each one of the test F-35s will go through that full amount of abuse or that contractors can’t perform normal, expected repairs and preventive maintenance during the experiments. The objective is to simulate typical use, not simply shake the airframes apart. Lockheed Martin only set aside one of each type specifically for ground fatigue testing, as well. The other three aircraft have gotten subjected to different kinds of stress tests, including getting shot at to see how the airframe might hold up in combat. One of the ground test F-35Bs, known as BG-1, after a live-fire experiment., Lockheed Martin The F-35A that arrived at NIAR in June 2018 had just finished the third cycle of tests for that variant. The F-35C was slated to finish its final round of testing in December 2017, but it is unclear if that has occurred and when analysis of the results might begin. “For all variants, this testing led to discoveries requiring repairs and modifications to production designs and retrofits to fielded aircraft,” the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, reported in its most recent annual review of the program, covering the 2017 fiscal year, which ended on September 30, 2017. This is, of course, exactly why the U.S. military conducts these tests in the first place. But while the F-35A and C variants look set to meet the stated durability goals, the Marine Corps’ F-35B has had considerably more trouble . The F-35 JPO suspended durability testing on that variant in February 2017 after one of the two test articles finished the second simulated life cycle, according to DOT&E. “Due to the significant amount of modifications and repairs to bulkheads and other structures, the program declared the F-35B ground test article was no longer representative of the production aircraft, so the JPO deemed it inadequate for further testing,” the Pentagon testing office’s report noted. “The program canceled the testing of the third lifetime with [the F-35B known as] BH-1 and made plans to procure another ground test article, but has not yet done so.” An F-35 undergoing stress testing., BAE Systems It is very likely that the F-35Bs structural woes are, in no small part, due to a massive effort early in the Joint Strike Fighter’s development to cut the weight of that variant in particular. Beginning in 2004, a group of engineers at Lockheed Martin called the STOVL (Short Take Off/Vertical Landing) Weight Attack Team, or SWAT, found ways to shave more than 2,700 pounds off the Marine Corps’ version. They trimmed 1,300 pounds from the A and C types, too. This weight reduction project was critical to advancing the program at the time, but persistent reports of cracks in bulkheads and other components , along with other issues , have raised questions about what got sacrificed to meet those targets. Now, there is a very real concern that the B variant may not meet the 8,000 flight hour target. These jets may have a shorter service life than the other types “even with extensive modifications to strengthen the aircraft,” DOT&E warned. On top of that, these versions are having serious problems with the durability of their wheels specifically. Unlike the F-35As and Cs, the B models have the ability to take off and land vertically, which requires tires that are at the same time durable enough for a conventional landing and soft enough to cushion the jet when it comes straight down. As it stands now, ground crews have to change the tires, on average, after fewer than 10 full-stop conventional landings, which is less than half the target number. Lockheed Martin has reportedly sourced a possible replacement tire design, but will only begin testing it sometime in late 2018, according to a report on the F-35 program that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a congressional watchdog, released earlier in June 2018. A US Air Force maintainer repairs the tire from an F-35A., USAF Ensuring that the jet’s airframe, as well as other ancillary components, last as long as they’re supposed to, is extremely important for both safety and sustainment reasons. Without an accurate understanding of when the planes will literally fall apart, the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marines Corps, as well as foreign operators, could risk putting pilots in the cockpit of aircraft that simply aren’t airworthy. It is also an essential component for long-term planning with regards to sustaining the F-35 fleets since these tests will provide additional data on what components are most likely to fail and when. This, in turn, can help give an early sense of what portions of the airframe might need an overhaul or outright replacement, and how much that might cost, during any service life extension program down the road. The Air Force is already in the process of starting a major life extension project for its F-16C/Ds , as parts of that fleet begin to get near their maximum allowable flight hours. The U.S. Navy is similarly embarking on a similar program to breath additional life into its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets . Having a good understanding of the structural lifespan of the F-35 could be even more important given the inherent complexities associated with any heavy maintenance on the jets due to their stealthy features. Delays and other setbacks for the Joint Strike Fighter Program, which have extended its development time overall, mean that these issues could come to the fore sooner rather than later, too. All three variants of the F-35 flying in formation., USAF On May 30, 2018, the U.S. Navy, which leads the F-35 JPO at present, awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth more than $45 million to, in part, to “support service life extension” work on the developmental test Joint Strike Fighters. The oldest members of this fleet of aircraft, which now numbers more than a dozen in total, have been flying for more than a decade already for testing purposes. An accurate appraisal of how long a lifespan each of the aircraft has will also be increasingly important as the U.S. military looks to move to full-rate production of the aircraft. With more jets coming off the production line, the cost to implement any necessary, but complex structural fixes or improvements will similarly grow. The aforementioned GAO report was highly critical of the Pentagon’s push to move ahead and step up production without having first fixed a host of unspecified serious deficiencies with the aircraft, including six having to do with the “air vehicle” itself. The review noted that the JPO did not have a well-established plan for how and when to integrate any upgrades into existing and future aircraft as part of its Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2) concept, either. A table from the June 2018 GAO report on the F-35 noting that there are six significant “air vehicle” deficiencies, among other issues. , GAO The report also pointed out that the JPO has yet to give a full accounting of the costs associated with bringing jets up to the “final” Block 4 standard and building new ones in this configuration or what those aircraft will actually look like in terms of mission systems and capabilities. Any major changes in the aircraft’s structure or other components could change the stressed on certain portions of the airframe and potentially have an impact on the aircraft’s overall lifespan. It’s worth noting that the JPO determined the existing F-35B ground test article was no longer suitable for tests due to how much the airframe had changed over the course of previous experiments. It did, however, accept the results of the second round of testing. Not knowing the specific conclusions from the existing testing on any of the F-35 variants, it’s hard to judge how significant the impact of the repairs and configuration changes may or may not have on the jets’ life expectancy. With regards to the F-35B, what may happen is that it could simply end up with a shorter official service life than the other two variants. If the actual lifespan is closer to 6,000 flight hours, this would put them on par with the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , which are now slated to get upgrades to extend their lives out to 9,000 hours. The U.S. military will still need to buy another F-35B to be sure, though. As of yet, inspectors have not yet formally certified any of the three versions as having an approximately 8,000 flight hour-long service life. In the meantime, until these important figures get settled, residents of Wichita and the surrounding environs may continue to see F-35s under wraps heading to NIAR so specialists can examine them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 18, 2018","Yes, This Is A Ramjet Powered Artillery Shell And It Could Be A Game Changer","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Norway’s Nammo has unveiled a potentially revolutionary concept for an air-breathing, ramjet-powered, pseudo-missile that any standard 155mm howitzer can fire at targets more than 60 miles away. The U.S. Army has already expressed an interest in just such a projectile, which could also end up in service with the U.S. Marine Corps, and the round might finally offer a way for the U.S. Navy to make use of the cannons on its new, stealthy Zumwalt -class destroyers . The defense contractor revealed a full-size mockup of the design, which it is simply calling the 155mm Solid Fuel Ramjet at present, at the biennial Eurosatory arms expo in the French capital Paris, which began on June 11, 2018. The firm expects to begin live-fire testing of the projectile in 2019 or 2020 and hopes to have the new ammunition in production and in operational service with a military by between 2023 and 2024. “This could be a game-changer for artillery,” Thomas Danbolt, Vice President of Nammo’s Large Caliber Ammunitions division, said in a press release headlined “We are basically launching a missile from a cannon!” on June 12, 2018. “With the exception of a small number of precision guided shells with 50-60 km range [approximately 30 to 40 miles], most artillery systems still fire across the same distances as they did when the M109 was introduced more than 50 years ago.” The U.S. Army’s self-propelled M109 or towed M777 155mm howitzers have maximum ranges of around 12 miles using standard high-explosive shells. Using rocket-assisted ammunition, they can hit targets closer to 20 miles away. Nammo is separately working on an improved, rocket-boosted shell for the service, the XM1113 , which will have a maximum range of approximately 25 miles. By extending the length of the howitzer’s barrel, the Army is hoping to nearly double those ranges. That still won’t be anywhere close to the more than 60-mile maximum range that Nammo says it will be able to get out of its ramjet-powered projectile. According to the Norwegian company, the firing cycle would remain essentially the same for artillery crews, who would fire the projectile like any other shell. But normal shells essentially begin decelerating the moment they leave the cannon. The ramjet round uses the force of launch to get it moving fast enough to start the ramjet motor. A solid fuel source will get the projectile up to a maximum speed of three times the speed of sound and keep it moving at that speed for approximately 50 seconds . This type of motor also reduces drag on the shell itself, since it’s actively pulling the projectile through the air. The firm, which has long built rocket motors for other companies’ missiles, says it is looking into developing its own ramjet missile using the same technology, as well. We don’t know how much volume within the shell has to go toward the ramjet and fuel now rather than explosive or other payloads, which could reduce the punch of the round. However, the solid propellant offers an efficient fuel source and will help keep as much space as possible free within the body. A US Army M109 self-propelled howitzer fires a conventional shell., US Army Pop-out fins and an unspecified guidance system will steer the projectile to its designated target. A GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) arrangement will almost certainly guide the shell, at least at first. A laser- or millimeter wave radar-guidance package could add additional flexibility to the system in the future. These systems could allow the projectile to hit moving targets at long ranges and, in the case of a laser-guided round, with manned or unmanned aircraft or forward-deployed troops on the ground designating the target with a laser or otherwise sharing that information with the artillery unit. At Eurosatory 2018, Nammo’s Danbolt noted that that the ramjet round wouldn’t just extend the maximum range of a single howitzer, but would greatly expand the flexibility of individual artillery units to engage different targets. According to the executive, a six-gun battery would be able to hit anything within an approximately 1,500 square mile circle around their firing position with the new XM1113. The ramjet rounds would exponentially increase that possible target area to more than 12,000 square miles without the howitzers ever having to relocate. What this means is that ground forces could operate far further from those elements while still having vital artillery support on call. Fewer artillery units could also cover a much wider front. Perhaps most importantly, it would allow the howitzers to sit much further removed from the front lines, better protecting them from immediate enemy counter-battery fire and air strikes. There is “no set-in-stone firm requirement” for the ramjet projectile and the project is entirely a private venture on Nammo’s part, Danbolt said at Eurosatory 2018. “So far it is, but that may change.” But the U.S. Army is definitely aware of and interested in the concept. At the Association of the United States Army’s Global Force Symposium in March 2018, U.S. Army Brigadier General Stephen Maranian specifically mentioned ramjet rounds among other potential future artillery concepts. A slide from US Army Brigadier General Stephen Maranian’s briefing at Association of the United States Army’s Global Force Symposium that mentions ramjet artillery rounds as one means to extend the range of existing howitzers., US Army Maranian is in charge of the service’s new “cross functional team,” or CFT, for Long Range Precision Fires, or LRPF, which is in charge of exploring advanced existing and future technologies to improve the range and capability of artillery units. The brigadier general’s team is also looking into railguns , long-range “ superguns ,” and various ground-launched missiles . The U.S. Marine Corps, which will also eventually receive the XM1113 rocket-assisted 155mm shells, is likely to be interested in the ramjet round, which could be especially useful during expeditionary and distributed operations . The significantly increased range would give Marines more options for where to deploy their own M777 howitzers to support friendly forces, especially in the Pacific Region, where relatively small outcroppings of land are often separated by large expanses of water. US Marines fire an M777 howitzer., USMC It might even make it a viable option to fire the guns from the decks of amphibious ships and sea bases , turning those vessels into floating firebases. The Marines have already begun exploring this concept with their truck-mounted High Mobility Rocket Artillery Systems (HIMARS). And in the same vein, Nammo’s ramjet round could be an ideal option for the U.S. Navy to add the presently ammo-less 155mm guns on its Zumwalt -class destroyers . Since the goal seems to be for the new projectile to work with any existing system, it would be a far simpler option than replacing the cannons on the ships with another, entirely different system. In 2016, the Navy decided not to buy the 155mm Long-Range Land Attack Projectile ( LRLAP ) round, given its exorbitant cost of $800,000 per shell. This has since left the Zumwalt ’s guns as effectively dead weight, since existing howitzer ammunition does not have the necessary range to be a useful substitute. The main question then becomes, just how expensive will Nammo’s ramjet round actually be? If its cost grows to anywhere near that of the LRLAP, it could easily turn off any prospective buyers. Still, if any branch of the U.S. military does decide to take the lead on the ramjet project, they could easily look to allies and partners to help share the cost burdens. South Korea, in particular, could be very interested in the new ammunition, which would allow its howitzers to reach further into North Korea during a conflict or let units move further away from the demilitarized zone where fighting would be especially heavy in the event of an actual war. In 2016, South Korean defense contractor Poongsan revealed its own ramjet artillery shell concept, which had an estimated range of nearly 50 miles. According to Jane’s 360 , this design would be slower and would have less fuel for its motor than Nammo’s round. A South Korean M109 self-propelled howitzer fires a shell during an exercise., AP Photo/Yonhap, Lim Byung-shick NATO members in Europe, especially those along the alliance’s eastern flank right up against Russia , might be interested in the ramjet-powered projectiles for similar reasons. In the Baltic Sea region , the shells could allow the small Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, or other allies in those countries or nearby, to better cover all avenues of approach at once even with limited artillery units. Nammo’s Danbolt declared that the ramjet projectile could “completely change” how traditional artillery units operate. With the significant added range, those elements would be able to potentially operate with smaller footprints, better shielded from threats in both low- and high-end conflicts, while covering the same total area. German artillery troops fire a PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer during a NATO exercise., US Army But it’s also not the only concept that companies are pitching to squeeze more range out of existing 155mm howitzers. The Army, in cooperation with the Navy, is separately exploring the possibility of launching inert, hypervelocity projectiles derived from experimental railgun ammunition from standard cannons. These would reach the same speed as the ramjet round, but would still likely have a significantly shorter overall range. There may also a cost question when it comes to wear and tear on the gun barrels. The more rounds you fire at higher speeds through a howitzer, the faster the rifling and overall structural integrity of the system wears down . This reduces overall accuracy and can potentially lead to catastrophic failures. Depending on how fast crews need to fire the ramjet shells to get them to the appropriate speed, and whether or not the round’s motor begins to work inside the barrel, the ammunition could exert a high strain on the howitzer’s barrel and shorten the time before units need to replace them. Improvements to the existing guns could help mitigate these issues and extend barrel life, but would again require additional time and resources. Whatever happens, there’s no denying that the ramjet artillery shell, if it works, will be an impressive feat of engineering and could offer game-changing capabilities for traditional howitzers.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 10, 2018",Fizzled Singapore Summit Showcases North Korea’s Art Of Not Making A Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has been an exciting few days , to say the least, but the historic summit between North Korea and the United States has officially come and gone. With all the imagery and intrigue surrounding the event, it’s now time to evaluate how it all went, including what each party gave and received as part of the top-level diplomatic exchange. What’s abundantly clear is that Trump’s grand nuclear ‘deal’ with North Korea remains a figment of his imagination. The Joint Statement For all that pomp and ceremony, and the once-in-a-lifetime spectacle of a sitting U.S. president meeting with a North Korean leader for the first time ever, the resulting four-point joint statement was vague and extremely limited. It was, in large part, indistinguishable from shared communiqués the two countries put out after meetings in the past. The entire text, which you can read below, is less than 500 words long. In this latest missive, Trump and Kim agreed to improve relations to advance “peace and prosperity,” promote peace on the Korean Peninsula, reaffirm the plan “to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” that North and South Korea agreed to at the summit in Panmunjom in April 2018, and work to recover and repatriate remains of military personnel who were killed in action or died as prisoners of war during the Korean War. With the exception of the last point, the basic tenets espoused here are effectively the same as the ones contained in a 1993 joint statement after a meeting between then-U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci and then-North Korean First Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Kang Sok Ju. Notably, Trump and Kim’s newest statement does not include any specific definition of “a lasting and stable peace regime” or “denuclearization.” As we at The War Zone and many others have repeatedly noted, in particular, the United States and North Korea have wildly different understandings of what denuclearization means both in the near and long terms. There is also no fixed timeline for defining, let alone implementing these plans. The definition of denuclearization has been and is likely to continue to be a major sticking point in any U.S.-North Korea negotiations in the future. The North Koreans have, for decades , understood this to mean the elimination of the prospect of nuclear conflict on the Peninsula, which would entail the withdrawal of the United States from the region and an end to protecting South Korea with its nuclear umbrella. Despite what Trump continues to insist and how senior administration officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have framed it in the past, this pledge in the joint statement does not reflect any change in North Korean policy or any real intent to commit to what has been referred to as “ complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement” of the country’s nuclear arsenal. This declaration is essentially meaningless and definitely does not reflect the Trump Administration’s past promises , even in the days leading up to the summit, about what Kim was willing to concede to in Singapore or its demand that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons as a virtual precondition to talks. The document that was signed remained a mystery for hours, which was not a promising sign., AP “You’re talking about a very complex subject,” Trump said during the press conference after the summit, echoing a change in tone on the issue that’s been building for weeks . “It’s not just like, ‘Oh, gee.  Let’s get rid of the nukes.’  It takes a period of time.” That being said, the new commitment to recover and repatriate war dead is a significant development and one that has many advocates in the United States. In the run up to the Singapore summit, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) sent a letter to Trump urging him to find a way to jumpstart the process, which has been stalled since 2005. The remains of as many as 5,300 American troops may still be in North Korea. “For the families of those who never returned, the passage of time does not heal their wounds,” the VFW’s letter stated. “For them, the days became weeks, and the weeks became months, then years, and now, sadly, decades.” Beyond just offering closure to the families, the search for the remains of American personnel has proven to be a valuable diplomatic tool that is useful for establishing government-to-government contacts and building a certain rapport based on acknowledging the shared magnitude of a conflict. U.S. government engagement with Vietnam on this front contributed significantly to the normalization of relations between the two countries. It is equally important to note that the joint statement makes no reference whatsoever to Kim’s chemical and biological weapons , ballistic missile and space launch vehicle development efforts, cyber attacks , smuggling and other illicit activities , support for international terrorists , domestic human rights abuses , the effective murder of American citizen Otto Warmbier in a North Korean prison, the repeated abduction of South Korean and Japanese citizens , unprovoked attacks on South Korean military forces and civilians , or any of a slew of other serious issues the United States, as well as its allies, holds the regime in Pyongyang responsible for. This is especially notable given Trump’s recent withdrawal from the controversial deal with Iran over its nuclear program, which occurred in no small part because of the Trump Administration’s objections to the narrow focus of that agreement. The Aftermath But whether or not the joint statement is any sort of real and positive step forward, Trump’s statements to the media afterward have been unscripted debacles that have often bizarrely traded American interests and ideals for North Korean talking points. Most importantly, he said he had offered to halt long-standing military exercises with South Korea, though he gave no details about what particular drills would stop and when. “We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should,” Trump said at a press conference in Singapore after the summit wrapped up on June 12, 2018. “Plus, I think it’s very provocative.” AP Trump repeated those comments multiple times during the presser. At one point singling out bomber flights from Guam to the Korean Peninsula specifically as both “expensive” and “provocative.” “I know a lot about airplanes; it’s very expensive,” Trump said. “And I didn’t like it.” It’s fair to say that whether Trump has a working understanding of military aircraft is up for debate . Regardless, the use of the word “provocative” is at the very least odd, as this is exactly how North Korea’s massive propaganda machine frames shared U.S.-South Korean military exercises. And while “war games” may be an accurate colloquial way of describing the various annual and other drills in South Korea, as an official statement from the U.S. government it tactically legitimizes North Korea’s claim that these events are simply dry runs for an invasion. The U.S. military repeatedly denies that the exercises are anything but defensive in nature, serving to enhance readiness and as shows of force to deter North Korean aggression. On top of that, sending bombers near North Korea had become a major point of contention in 2017, with Kim’s regime at one point threatening to shoot them down . In effect, Trump admitted there was little substance to his fiery rhetoric in the past and has potentially opened the United States up to challenges elsewhere over “provocative” military maneuvers. The Russians and the Chinese both routinely complain about American drills and other military activities in Europe and the Pacific Region respectively. And to make matters worse, it appears that Trump’s concessions on this point came without any significant coordination with either South Korea or his own Department of Defense. Both the office of South Korea’s President Moon Jae In – referred to as Blue House – and that country’s Ministry of Defense said they were seeking clarification about the “meaning and intention” and Trump’s remarks. U.S. Forces Korea, the top American military command on the Peninsula, said it had received no orders or other guidance to change its plans or posture. Trump has in the past complained about how much it costs to maintain the U.S. military presence in South Korea and demanded the government in Seoul contribute more to support this arrangement. During the press conference, he reiterated those points, as well as his ultimate desire to withdraw all American troops from the Peninsula, directly contradicting statements from Secretary of Defense James Mattis. “It’s [troop withdrawal] not even a subject of the discussions,” Mattis said on June 11, 2018, according to CNN’s Barbara Starr. “You know, obviously there  are there because of security conditions 10 years ago, five years ago, this year.” The end of large-scale military exercises, and especially the removal of U.S. forces from the Koran Peninsula is a long-standing goal not just of North Korea but also China. Trump countered the immediate questions about whether he was giving up the exercises without getting anything in exchange by pointing to a lack of ballistic missile and nuclear tests. In a Tweet ahead of the summit he had also suggested that North Korea had halted research and development activity in these areas. There are few if any robust indications that the North Koreans have stopped working on developing and expanding their nuclear arsenal and available delivery systems. By Trump’s Pentagon’s own assessment , Kim continues to see these weapons as the guarantors of his regime’s survival and the summit can only reinforce the view that they have catapulted him onto the world stage as a virtual equal of the United States. In addition, there is no clear evidence that North Korea’s demolitions at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site or the dismantlement of certain other facilities will have any meaningful or permanent impact on the country’s advanced weapons programs. Whether or not Punggye-ri remained a viable test site or is now irrevocably closed, the North Koreans likely have the data they need to be relatively confident in their nuclear warhead designs and to support further experimentation through modeling and simulation. Trump specifically claimed credit for having secured the closure of an additional “engine test site” during the course of his negotiations, but experts remain unclear about what he was referring to. Earlier in June 2018, the North Korea-focused open-source intelligence site 38 North reported that the country appeared to be dismantling a missile test stand near Kusong, but this is not an engine test facility. But the president seemed to be sure of what he meant in this regard, saying “We know where it is because of the heat.” This appears to be an indirect reference to the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellite constellation, which serves primarily as an early warning system to detect hostile ballistic missile launches. However, it is sensitive enough to detect other significant heat signatures and the test of a ballistic missile’s rocket motor would certainly be large enough for them to spot. If Trump was referring to the site in Kusong, then either he is either lying about having negotiated that concession during the summit or the North Koreans led him to believe it was a new offer when the dismantlement was already underway. It is also possible that the president was referring to another location that North Korea will demolish sometime in the near future. The American president also pointed to his Administration’s sanctions regime and the release of three Americans that North Korea had held prisoner in May 2018 as additional evidence of valuable concessions in return. North Korea has long been under sanctions and while Trump has overseen a significant expansion in these economic restrictions, it has been difficult to gauge how much of an impact they have had on the regime in Pyongyang. In addition, China has already called for the easing of sanctions in light of the summit as a goodwill gesture . Chinese nationals and companies are among those the United States accuses of being either actively complicit in or otherwise unwilling to stop North Korea skirting existing restrictions and international embargoes AP With respect to prisoner releases, Trump did not mention that the North Koreans had arrested two of those individuals during the first year of his presidency. President Barack Obama also helped secure the liberty of four Americans from the Hermit Kingdom during his tenure without agreeing to meet with Kim or his now deceased father Kim Jong Il. Beyond all this, Trump has also been full of effusive praise for the young dictator that is sure to rankle Americans and their allies, both in East Asia and elsewhere. The president commended Kim on being able to take charge of North Korea at 26 and “run it tough,” and described him as “talented,” “very smart,” and a “worthy negotiator,” all while insisting that this was not somehow giving tacit approval to the regime’s notoriously brutal, systematic suppression of internal dissent, the scope of which has rarely been seen in modern history. Trump doubled down on his positive assessment of Kim in subsequent one-on-one interviews. When pressed by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on how he could say these things or even trust the head of a totalitarian police state, the president simply said “I’m given what I’m given, okay?” This was a dramatic shift in tone from Trump’s open threats of “ fire and fury ” in 2017 and was a theme that ran through other parts of his post-summit press conference. Instead of bringing up the size of America’s nuclear arsenal or otherwise bragging about U.S. military’s capabilities, the president highlighted how devastating a war on the Korean Peninsula would be for all parties involved – something almost every reasonable observer of the situation has pointed out for months . “This is really an honor for me to be doing this because I think, you know, potentially, you could have lost, you know, 30-, 40-, 50 million people,” Trump said. “The city of Seoul, one of the biggest cities in the world, is right next to the border.” The Trump administration even went so far as to commission a bizarre video presentation, which you can watch below, about what could happen if the United States and North Korea improved their relationship that seemed to frame the president and Kim as possible personal friends. This is something Trump has suggested could be the case in the past and repeated shortly before, during, and after the summit. What makes the clip even more curious is that the company the White House credited with producing it says it was not involved at all . Now, it’s fair to say that this is hardly the first time the U.S. government has failed to apply a uniform standard when dealing with world leaders responsible for heinous atrocities. It does, however, come shortly after Trump and his Administration lambasted some of its closest allies during and after a meeting of the leaders of the so-called Group of Seven, or G7. On June 10, 2018, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had “ stabbed us in the back” over trade issues. That same day, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro declared there was a “ special place in hell ” for Trudeau over his public criticisms of Trump’s economic policies. Navarro has since apologized for his comments , but does not appear to be in danger of losing his job. Kudlow is recovering from a heart attack he suffered on June 11, 2018. And for all of the comments about how historic the summit was and the concessions Trump claimed he was able to wrestle from Kim, the president has seemed relatively flippant about the whole matter. When asked about how he could hold Kim accountable for the things he said during the summit if there was no audio recording or formal transcript, he dismissed the matter out of hand. “Well, I don’t have to verify because I have one of the great memories of all time,” Trump declared. “So I don’t have to. Okay? Okay?” And even immediately after signing the statement, he conceded that it was too soon to tell if the meeting had achieved anything meaningful. Trump then added an absurd, yet surprisingly honest and self-aware statement about what the future might hold. “I think he’s — I think — honestly, I think he’s going to do these things.  I may be wrong,” Trump told reporters at the post-statement signing press conference. “I mean, I may stand before you in six months  and say, ‘Hey, I was wrong.’  I don’t know that I’ll ever admit that, but I’ll find some kind of an excuse.” The press corps laughed at this last remark. But it’s really no laughing matter. As for why Trump wanted to leave early instead of trying to push for and hammer out a more detailed or innovative agreement, he told reporters on Air Force One that he’d “rather fly during the night and get back tonight” and “there was nothing more we could’ve done. We had the agreement done.” This is yet another sign that the North Koreans made it clear early on in the summit that nothing ground-breaking was going to come as a result of it, and apparently the White House capitulated. Reality Bites Some will say ‘hey, it’s a start,’ but even that statement is reaching. The North Koreans have only agreed to say the same old thing they have said for decades. Aside from the recovery of American remains, which is a positive but separate win for Trump, nothing tangible has been gained here, let alone any sort of talk or even a roadmap to complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program. Trump says that some sort of a personal relationship between him and Kim will result in success later on—let’s all hope so—but the odds of that actually happening seem extremely small. The same deep rifts on policy remain between the two foes that existed before the summit and, since virtually no progress was made at this grand diplomatic exchange, one in which both parties had so much invested image-wise, it’s hard to imagine that will change now that negotiations will be going back to diplomats sitting at tables for hours on end, with no cameras on hand providing propaganda dividends. Also, how will this relationship survive if North Korea doesn’t actually act quickly to denuclearize? Hanging out with the dictator of North Korea just for the sake of doing so even as he continues on with business as usual seems pretty odd and counterproductive. But even if great change comes to North Korea, the reality is that the potential for this landmark summit – a historic “first” that is now impossible to repeat – was largely squandered due to poor procedural choices and a lack of diplomatic creativity, vision, and gamesmanship on the part of the United States. No one has been more vocal about the need to meet with the North Koreans than us , and we have repeatedly applauded Trump’s willingness to do so. But when it comes to process, there were a number of very strange and critical preliminary decisions—or concessions—made on the part of the United States. These seemed to be especially damaging and odd considering Trump’s self-proclaimed mastery of negotiation skills and the fact that he appeared to be fine walking away from the summit in a major power play just a couple weeks prior to its start date. A moment watched around the globe. , AP First off, it was announced on June 11th that Trump would leave early from the summit, which was supposedly going to be a somewhat open-ended exercise in marathon diplomacy. The reason for leaving wasn’t to pressure the North Koreans to give up more at the negotiating table but ‘because negotiations were proceeding faster than expected.’ Knowing what we know now of what resulted as a part of those negotiations, it seems as if North Korea wasn’t willing to budge and instead of walking out on the summit, the White House took what they could and branded it as some sort of a win, which it wasn’t. The decision to leave earlier also is disappointing as it shows that Trump’s ‘as long as it takes’ negotiating mentality was largely just talk and that he wouldn’t be doing much of the negotiating himself. Instead, it seems that whatever could be put on paper would be largely ready in advance of the principals meeting, with the two leaders largely executing a meet and greet session, not hardcore negotiations. Next, we get to the now famous handshake, where leaders of the two counties came together for the first time in history. American and North Korean flags were arranged side-by-side, which was a startling sight to see in itself. This photo op, one that North Korea had feverishly lusted for above nearly anything else for decades—an ultimate prize of sorts in terms of international optics and internal propaganda— didn’t come at the end of the meeting between Kim and Trump, but at the beginning. This was a monumental misstep or concession on behalf of the White House. That photo was maybe the biggest real-time bargaining chip the U.S. had in its pocket and it was tossed away like it meant nothing. Trump, if he really was going to negotiate with Kim, would and should have used it to improve America’s position. If North Korea left without imagery in hand it would have been a major loss on their investment into the summit. Instead, the leader of the free world stood there, hand-in-hand, flags side-by-side, on equal footing, with the North Korean dictator without getting anything substantial in return. It makes zero sense aside from adding to the evidence that Trump actually negotiated very little with Kim and it was all a social outing more than anything else. Maybe the strangest part of the whole affair was Trump’s constant gushing over Kim and his making huge claims as to the future of the relationship just minutes into the meeting. The endless string of over-the-top platitudes seemed like the same empty automatic rhetoric we see from the President around many world leaders, at first . In this sense, Trump has proven to be a one-trick pony when it comes to one-on-one diplomatic engagements. Kim, on the other hand, said fair less, and what he did say was measured, focused, and broad in context. In essence, Kim appeared to be playing on a totally different level than ‘the master negotiator’ who was handing out accolades like peppermints. Being cordial to Kim is understandable, and South Korea’s Moon did just that in April, but showering him with compliments and making huge claims about the future of the relationship is totally frivolous, ridiculous, and puts the U.S. in a horrible position. Primarily, that level of instant approval dramatically weakens America’s negotiating hand. It also makes us look foolish and like total hypocrites on the world stage. And once again, it piles on the wins for Kim without anything in exchange. Despite his new international rockstar-like status, Kim is a mass murderer. He runs a military dictatorship with the world’s worst human rights record. This appalling reality can be set aside to achieve a solution to a more pressing issue, but there is no need to elevate the man to such a degree publically while you still have no idea how any of this will play out or if his word is even reliable in any way. It’s no secret that President Trump falls in love easily with strongmen and doesn’t seem to really care about their dastardly deeds. But not being able to moderate his flow of accolades, even towards a man like Kim, is a major character flaw the president clearly isn’t capable of overcoming even when it is so counter-intuitive to achiving a set of objectives. Above all else, this summit was a missed opportunity. As we have said for years , it was critical that the U.S. come to the table with a fully fleshed-out, ‘best shot’ international package in hand for a face to face meeting at the highest levels. One that includes major aid and the resources and guarantees from Japan and South Korea, as well as the United States. A deal full of sweet carrots and sour sticks that spells out in clear terms a path forward that will make North Korea a wealthy, stable, and peaceful member of the international community. Putting this in front of Kim and his aides and saying here it is, this is as good as it is ever going to get, take it or leave it, forces Pyongyang, at the very least, to show its true cards. If they dismiss it, they never had any intentions of denuclearizing, and extreme containment or even military action can be justified as a last option if need be. Both sides at the negotiating table where it seems little actual negotiating was done. , Photo by Kevin Lim/THE STRAITS TIMES/Handout/Getty Images None of this legwork occurred leading up to the summit. In fact, the Trump administration wasn’t willing to offer North Korea any aid regardless of what they are willing to do already. Even aid in the form of foodstuffs, like basic grain and rice, to feed the North Korean people, which would be a net positive for the Kim regime and wouldn’t exacerbate the threat posed by North Korea if a deal went south, wasn’t on the table. Instead, the administration says private investment will help North Korea out sometime in the future, maybe . This, of course, is totally speculative and even under ideal circumstances, it would only happen over a very long period of time. In essence, minus possible sanction relief and a decreased fear of attack, the U.S. has given North Korea no incentive whatsoever to give up its nuclear arsenal. Considering the only reason they achieved an equal footing with the U.S. is because of their nuclear program, Kim junking it based on some bizarre video, paper assurances, and the hope that foreign dollars may appear someday would be downright reckless. And considering North Korea is a secluded military state, American investment and an injection of foreign culture is likely seen as downright dangerous to the regime’s very existence. Keep in mind that North Korean culture has no real concept of individual rights. How this reality would pair with large-scale American business operations in the near term is questionable at best and totally laughable at worst. Convincing American companies about the long-term viability of working with North Korea, and therefore worth the investment, could be near impossible, as well. North-South shared economic endeavors, chiefly the Kaesong Industrial Park , remain heavily reliant on a positive political climate and routinely come screeching to a halt in times of heightened tensions. So instead of a comprehensive, best-shot approach to this unprecedented diplomatic opportunity, we got a far less robust exercise that can be best described as “we’ll see what happens.” Not only does this allow North Korea to take the initiative, but it also results in little insight into what their true intentions are, and thus the can gets kicked down the road even further. In essence, the North Koreans duped Trump and company into what they do best, agreeing to more talk, which has been entirely empty historically speaking. Even focusing the aims of the summit on far smaller, but more tangible goals, namely agreeing to a plan for a verifiable freeze of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, not just a vague sentence-long goodwill statement, would have been a far better strategy. By focusing on just one key, albeit less ambitious goal, the U.S. could get a better read on just how realistic getting any meaningful concessions from North Korea is and at least it could possibly result in something truly worthwhile and lasting. Even that would be worth a publicized handshake. Right now we just have Kim’s word that he won’t test any more missiles or warheads, but that is not the same as a verifiable freeze, which would be a serious victory for the summit and could lead to real progress on the greater nuclear issues. And just because Kim isn’t firing off missiles or detonating warheads doesn’t mean his nuclear weapons and delivery system programs aren’t moving ahead full-steam, especially in terms of mass production. Kim mentioned how the meeting was like ‘out of a sci-fi movie’ and he is right. Who would have imagined the U.S. would give up the photo opportunity of a lifetime for next to nothing in return? , Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images The summit also made clear that Trump still has not learned the details of the issues at play when it comes to nuclear disarmament and North Korea. His press conference and repeated referencing to the hollow joint statement language proves that. He thinks that statement, which uses North Korea’s same old language, means the country is ‘de-nuking’ or he is simply lying about it. It’s just embarrassing when anyone who reads a paper or a credible news website knows full well that isn’t the case, but the President Of The United States doesn’t. In the end, Trump looked like a flattering stooge that still to this very day hasn’t done even the basic homework required to begin to understand such a complicated issue, let alone negotiate in regards to it. The spin the administration is putting out regarding this whole adventure is laughable as well as it totally contradicts their previous stance and statements on the issue. The ‘at least we are not at war’ talking point is also a red herring. Although Trump’s maximum pressure campaign, namely the international sanctions that went with it, pressured the North Koreans, it’s debatable if any of it really impacted Pyongyang’s own plans and timelines. Kim clearly achieved what he wanted to with his nuclear and missile programs and showed no signs of stopping until he tested an advanced ICBM and detonated a thermonuclear warhead. At that point, it was North Korea that engaged South Korea in diplomatic warming for the 2018 Olympics and began to drive a wedge between the Blue House and the White House. The completion of Kim’s nuclear deterrent programs proved so effectual that it bought him a one-on-one with the leader of the free world on an equal footing, something only dreamed of by a pre-nuclear North Korea. And they are now in such a strong negotiating position that they basically executed their leader’s big unveiling on the world stage, collected their pictures with the President of The United States, and went home without giving up anything of strategic importance. In fact, they got U.S concessions including the ending of joint military drills in South Korea, which are critical to deterring North Korean aggression and maintaining the ability to be able to ‘fight tonight’ should ROK and U.S. forces be called upon to do so. In essence, the North Koreans played the United States and Trump’s weaknesses like a fiddle. Kim is now a rising star on the world stage, and if the President Of The United States will pose with him for nothing in exchange, why not everyone else? , North Korea State Media via Getty Images If not being at war is the objective, the United States could just not play the North Korean’s games. The U.S. government doesn’t have to embrace them on the world stage and sing the praises of their supreme leader. It could simply opt for containment and continue on. Hey, maybe things will work out! You never know, as we still have no clue what North Korea is actually willing to give up. But it will be very hard to go back to a maximum military pressure campaign now that Trump has admitted that a war on the Peninsula would be unthinkable. His ‘crazy man’ strategy was metaphorically flushed down the toilet during that disjointed presser. It’s also worth noting that apparently, Trump thinks North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat despite the fact that they have an operational nuclear arsenal and ICBM capability and that entire arsenal remains intact with no plan for denuclearization in place. Yet the Iran deal, which had the most intrusive inspection regime in years, removed nearly all fissile material from the country, and was working even by his own defense secretary’s account, wasn’t worth keeping in place. China has been spooked by the possibility of the U.S. becoming closely involved with their junkyard dog of a buffer state in North Korea that they will likely relax sanctions on the country if not end them altogether. Russia is also now involved with North Korea to a much larger degree than before and they very well could back a now internationally acceptable Kim as a counter-balance to U.S. power in the region. If either of these developments come to pass, the sanctions that supposedly tightened the screws on Kim will have little effect. Even a naval blockade would be ineffectual as both countries have long land borders with the reclusive state. So what are we left with? Hope that Kim Jong Un has a vision for his country that doesn’t include nuclear weapons. But considering the fact that those weapons have propelled him and his country to previously unthinkable diplomatic heights and have kept the U.S. at bay, why on earth would he ever give them up? Kim leaving Singapore after what has to be one of the greatest diplomatic wins in history. , Photo by Ministry of Communications and Information Singapore via Getty Images Whatever happens next, it’s abundantly clear that North Korea is now firmly in the driver’s seat. Amazingly, they have set up a situation for themselves in which they have not only neutered the White House’s hard line against them without giving up anything strategic in return, but they have also enticed support from their powerful neighbors like never before and have been legitimized on the world stage in the process. With all of this in mind, if Kim ever writes a book it should be titled “Playing Dotards : The Art Of Not Making A Deal.” Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick North Korea Nuclear Crisis Nuclear Nuclear Proliferation"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 30, 2018",Czech And Israeli Team To Pitch Advanced L-159 Light Attack Jets To The U.S. Military,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Czech plane maker Aero Vodochody and Israel Aerospace Industries, or IAI, have teamed up in an effort to pitch variants of the former firm’s L-159 and L-39NG jets to the U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps as light attack platforms . But there are significant obstacles in the way of these plans, not least of which is that the Air Force’s isn’t accepting new entrants for its light attack experiment, or OA-X , and the two aircraft don’t meet that either service’s existing, stated requirements anyways. The two companies announced their partnership, as well as their specific interesting taking part in the Air Force’s program, in a press release on June 12, 2018. In a call with reporters, Giuseppe Giordo, Aero Vodochody’s President and CEO, said that the team could have an advanced version of the L-159 ready by 2020 and that it could build a U.S.-based production line if it secured a major contract with the U.S. military. The firm hopes that the L-39NG will be ready around the same time and that design will also be an option if it meets the official requirements. “Together with IAI, Aero is ready to offer the USAF a multi-mission aircraft with the best available technology today, with potential for growth tomorrow,” Giordo said in the press release. “Our two non-developmental solutions offer the American Air Force a real choice of low risk, low cost solutions, in aircraft flying with coalition partners today.” He did not offer any specific details about what the new L-159 configuration might entail. In April 2018, however, Aero and IAI revealed plans to develop a new version of the jet with improved avionics and unspecified “other solutions,” which could include additional weapon systems, according to a report by FlightGlobal . A pair of L-159E aircraft belonging to the private American contractor Draken International., Draken International The L-159, also known as the Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA) or Honey Badger , already includes an IAI Elta Systems multi-mode pulse Doppler radar and an optional data link, both of which allow the aircraft to operate in the light attack role. Iraq, the first military customer for the type outside of the Czech Republic, flew nearly 400 attack mission jets between September 2016 and December 2017, according to official statistics . Draken International, a private American company, also flies L-159E types as “red air” adversaries and in other training roles under contract to the U.S. Air Force. Earlier in June 2018, the firm deployed some of its Honey Badgers to Kingsley Field in Oregon to help train Air Force F-15C/D pilots . One of the Iraqi Air Force’s L-159s carrying an unguided bomb ahead of a strike on ISIS terrorists., Iraqi Air Force Separately, in 2014, Aero unveiled plans for the L-39NG, or Next Generation, which it will offer as a new production aircraft and an upgrade package for any of the dozens of countries still flying the highly successful Cold War-era L-39 Albatross . The updated variant will feature a Williams FJ44-4M turbofan in place of the 1960s-era Ivchenko AI-25TL, new avionics, and a host of improvements to the airframe itself, including enlarged fuel tanks in the wing that eliminate the need for wingtip tanks. Existing operators employ the older L-39s as jet trainers and light attack aircraft and Aero says the new aircraft will continue to be able to perform both roles. In 2015, Draken announced that it would work with the Czech manufacturer and Williams to market the NG version in the United States, but it is unclear if the company is involved in the new partnership to pitch aircraft directly to the U.S. military. An artist’s conception of the L-39NG., Aero Vodochody There’s no question that, at least in theory, the L-159 or L-39NG could offer the U.S. military a cost-effective alternative to more advanced combat jets in lower-threat environments and free those larger aircraft up for higher priority missions in those theaters or elsewhere. Combined with a radar with an air-to-ground mode and a sensor turret containing a mix of electro-optical and infrared cameras or an actual targeting pod, the aircraft could easily conduct a variety of missions , including surveillance and reconnaissance, armed overwatch, and close air support. Lightweight precision guided-munitions, especially the 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II, or APKWS II , a laser guided rocket, would only expand the aircraft’s capabilities and increase the total number of targets it could engage during a single mission. Self-defense suites combining sensors to warn the crew of incoming threats coupled with dispensers able to fire decoy flares and chaff could give the aircraft additional protection against man-portable and other short-range air defense systems . Giordo believes these self-protection features make the L-159, in particular, a better choice for the Air Force and Marine Corps compared to armed turboprop planes. The Air Force is presently experimenting with Embraer and SNC’s A-29 Super Tucano and Textron’s AT-6C Wolverine and the Marines have expressed interest in acquiring a similar type of aircraft in the past . The Air Force “cannot afford the risk of flying with turboprops,” he said during the press call. “We do believe that U.S. pilots need to have the best assets in close air support missions.” An Afghan Air Force A-29 carrying laser-guided bombs., USFOR-A The problem is that the service’s requirements for its most recent light attack experiments specifically precluded aircraft such as the L-159 and L-39NG, which do not have the desired ability to operate from unimproved airstrips . The Air Force rejected Textron’s Scorpion light jet , which is larger than either of Aero’s offerings, after the first round of the OA-X project for this reason at least. There is no indication that the Air Force is looking to change its mind on that stipulation or any others that may have prevented Scorpion from advancing to the second round and could apply to the Czech jets. The service may release an official request for proposals, which could lead to a program to purchase a fleet of around 350 aircraft, as early as October 2018 . But the Air Force is undoubtedly eager to avoid the kind of drama that came from loosening up its requirements for the first round of the OA-X experiment. The serviced waived its demands for rough field capability and ejection seats to allow the Scorpion and Air Tractor and L3’s AT-802L Longsword aircraft respectively to join the demonstration. So far, the Marine Corps has not yet announced any formal plans to even begin evaluating a light attack aircraft. Since 2016, the service’s annual aviation plans have outlined a need for one, primarily for training purposes , but have also defined the desired plane specifically as a single-engine turboprop. And Giordo’s insistence that, unlike its turboprop competitors, the L-159 has seen combat in a “real operational war environment” ignores that Iraq is a low-threat environment and that the A-29 has seen combat on multiple continents in the same types of situations. Embraer and SNC are reportedly already working on adding additional self-defense systems to their aircraft to make it more survivable, as well. That’s not to say there’s absolutely no reason for Aero and IAI to bring their latest offerings to the American market and consider establishing U.S.-based production capacity. It remains largely unclear what the Air Force actually wants from its light attack program and the service repeatedly makes reference to foreign participation . Even if the companies fail to secure a U.S. military contract for either jet, establishing any sort of formal presence in the American market could position itself as an attractive option for the United States’ allies and foreign partners to procure via the Foreign Military Sales program or some other military assistance mechanism. The U.S. government has already facilitated the sale of A-29s , as well as armed light utility and agricultural aircraft to countries looking to expand their light attack fleets. An Air Tractor and L3 AT-802L Longsword light attack aircraft, which is a modified crop duster. The U.S. military has facilitated the sale of these aircraft to Kenya ., USAF This appears to be the same logic Bronco USA, a joint venture between South African defense contractor Paramount Group International and American firm Fulcrum Concepts, is following in bringing their Bronco II light attack aircraft to the U.S. market. Bronco USA was also not part of the OA-X competition and made its announcement after the Air Force made clear it would not be considering any more possible entrants. And Aero and IAI will of course still be able to market the L-159 and L-39NG to any other potential customers. In April 2018, Senegal, which does not have any combat jets at present, signed a deal to buy four L-39NGs for use in the light attack role . Based on what we know of the Air Force and Marine Corps light attack requirements, though, the two Czech designs will face a number of hurdles to even be considered, let alone winning an actual contract.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",UAE Naval Vessel Attacked By Houthi Rebels Off Yemeni Coast During Amphibious Operation,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain very scarce, but what we do know is that a naval vessel belonging to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been successfully struck by Houthi Rebels. The ship was operating in the Red Sea off the embattled Yemeni port city of Hodeidah. It is unclear just how extensive the damage to the vessel is, if there are any casualties, and what method of attack was used at this time. The incident occurred as Saudi-led coalition forces were making an amphibious assault near the city, part of an ongoing blitz to clear Houthi rebels from the area that has included past amphibious landings . According to the Houthis , a pair of missiles struck a landing ship as it was conveying equipment and personnel ashore, leading to the retreat of a flotilla of coalition vessels and a search and rescue operation. The coalition has yet to comment on the attack. In the past, Houthi rebels have used both anti-ship cruise missiles and explosive-laden remote-controlled boats of Iranian origin to attack ships transiting the Red Sea. Naval mines are also known to be present in the highly strategic channel near the Mandeb Strait, a tight stretch of water that connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. Google Maps Houthi forces have also used improvised surface-to-air missile systems captured from the Yemeni military to attack Saudi-led coalition aircraft operating over the country. Everything from U.S. Navy destroyers to tanker ships have been attacked by Houthi rebels in the southern Red Sea, with Saudi Arabian naval ships being struck a number of times. But the first wave of this relatively high-tech assault by irregular Houthi forces occurred back on October 2nd, 2016 when the high-speed logistics catamaran HSV-2 Swift was destroyed by an anti-ship missile. The vessel belonged to the UAE at the time but had previously served with the United States Navy as an experimental testing vessel. HSV-2’s burnt-out carcass was eventually towed to Greece for salvage. The potential loss of another UAE ship would be a major development in the Yemeni civil war that has now dragged on for over three years . It also would be the first successful strike on a coalition ship since Donald Trump pulled out of the Iranian nuclear deal and is now looking to counter Iran’s extra-territorial military excursions in the region with heavier-handed measures.

The site’s cameras look across the Puget Sound at Whidbey Island from Skunk Bay and one of them takes time-lapses of the undeniably picturesque setting. Just before 4am on Sunday, June 10th, that camera caught what at first glance looks like the impossible—a rocket launch that seems to be emanating from or near Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. The photo looks downright impressive as the streak of light appears from behind low, broken cloud cover and rises towards the heavens. Adding to the picture’s intrigue, what looks awfully similar to a large rocket can be seen at the end of the light trail in an extreme crop of the image. But how is that even remotely possible? The Naval Air Station, which I have been all over on numerous occasions, has no rocket operations of any kind. Furthermore, there aren’t any launch facilities in the region that could even begin to explain this photo. The closest thing to something like that would be the Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) based not too far away at Bangor Trident Base/Naval Submarine Base Bangor, but those apocalyptic machines don’t launch missiles in the Puget Sound even for testing. We contacted the owner of Skunkbayweather.com and they were very forthcoming with information and were happy to answer detailed questions regarding the photo as part of our investigation. They sent us the link to the entire timelapse which you can watch here , and went over the specific angle and field of view that the camera catches, as well as the camera type and its settings: “It is a Canon T3 Rebel set up as a webcam. Images are captured about every 40-45 seconds.  3.5/20 second exposure/ 1600iso. I only run it on clear nights or when there could be severe weather.” The positioning of the camera is roughly shown in the chart below, which is from Skunkbayweather.com, discusses the webcams functions and positions. The site’s owner told The War Zone : “This was actually taken with “Cam4″, which is a little wider angle than Cam2 and pointing in the same direction.” Skunkbayweather.com There were absolutely no indications that the owner of the site was trying to scam anyone or perpetuating a hoax. They seemed just as puzzled as anyone as to the picture’s origins and are seeking a good explanation for it. With this information in hand, we reached out the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island to see if there were any aircraft operations around the time of the photo. Not surprisingly, there weren’t. The public affairs officer went to air operations directly to confirm this for us. We then reached out to Seattle Center’s public relations representative and they checked into it and said the FAA had no idea what it was and had no anomalies on radar or strange reports that morning that would explain the image. I happen to be experienced with complex time-lapse photography. It’s worth noting that this type of photography can result in the appearance of distorted time and space in multiple ways. You are looking at a two-dimensional image of a complex 3D event, under unique lighting and environmental circumstances. What looks like a rocket being traced by its own exhaust plume as it rises into the heaves can actually be an object on a flat or even a descending profile coming towards you, or even an object moving away. Long distances traced by light can appear short and vice-versa, depending on the depth of the light being traced. The fact that the exposure lasts seconds, not fractions of a second, can also complicate making an accurate initial interpretation, but that information can also be beneficial when trying to decipher a mysterious image like this one. One of the reasons we inquired for specific details about any air operations at NAS Whidbey Island at the time, including low approach or terminal operations of transient aircraft, is that we thought the image could be a fighter taking off from NASWI in afterburner and executing a high-performance climb. These dramatic maneuvers are common at some fast jet bases. But in this case, the early morning timing made such an explanation a long shot, as well as the lack of complaints that would have resulted in such a thunderous racket at 4am local time. Next, we pulled up Flightradar24’s tracking of aircraft in the vicinity of Skunk Bay around the time the photo was shot. You can see a video of those movements below. Note that time is UTC, not local. The Alaska Airlines jet (ASA94) descending from the northwest would have been out of the frame of the camera, although at first, it looked like a possible explanation as either the aircraft’s lights or its contrail could have possibly caused the illusion. Then we noticed an air ambulance helicopter—an EC-135T2+ registered as N952AL belonging to Air Methods —flying right in the vicinity of the Skunk Bay when the image in question was captured. A gorgeous shot of N952AL in action over the Pacific Northwest., Airlift Northwest Facebook Page You will notice that there is an error with the tracking of the low flying helicopter that makes it freeze on the screen momentarily and Flightradar24 even notes this automatically. Then the chopper seems to dash across the channel at unbelievable high speed. This is an anomaly with the tracking, and in reality, the helicopter made its way across the channel at normal speed (around 115 knots at 2,000 feet) right around the time the photo was snapped and exactly where the streak is shown. With this revelation in mind, the explanation of what you are seeing in the image is the helicopter moving away from the camera towards NAS Whidbey Island, just as it was tracked in the moments after the photo was taken. There is about a minute and a half time difference between the flight data and the time index on the photo. It’s likely one of the clocks was slightly off in reference to the data being displayed and we know the helicopter speed data is not fully accurate due to the tracking anomaly anyway. N952AL, just like N954AL shown here, flies under the Airlift Northwest banner, moving patients around the Pacific Northwest. , Airlift Northwest Facebook Page When the image is interpreted in that fashion, you can see how the aircraft began being traced by the long exposure starting near the camera and moving away. As a result, it was also much closer to the camera, lower in altitude, and covered far less distance in the short 20-second exposure than a rocket blasting into the heavens far off in the distance would. At 115 knots the helicopter would have covered roughly 3,900 feet. The cloud it disappeared into would also be far closer to the camera when interpreting the image in this way. And all this actually works remarkably well just by shifting the notion of what you should be seeing in the image. The thing that looks like a rocket at atop a flame would have been a ‘ghost image’ of the part of the helicopter that was exposed from spill-over from its running lights and the low available light in the environment. This can look nothing like the actual object as the long exposure and how the light plays on the object can result in strange and often elongated shapes—in this case, something like a ghostly image of a rocket. So there you have it, sadly this wasn’t anything more exciting than a helicopter flying in a straight line in the wee hours of a quiet Sunday morning on the picturesque Puget Sound. Above all else, this photo serves as another reminder that sometimes there is much more to an image than what immediately meets the eye.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 17, 2019","F-35â€²s X-Ray Vision System Is Getting An Upgrade, But Will It Actually Save Money?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has officially announced that it has hired Raytheon to supply a new set of cameras for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that will further improve the pilotâ€™s situational awareness. This upgraded Distributed Aperture System, or DAS, will be both cheaper and more capable, but could lead to complications in the future as the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy all have to decide whether or not to upgrade existing aircraft that still have the original setup. On June 13, 2018, the Maryland-headquartered defense contractor issued a press release regarding the selection, but Aviation Week had been first to report on the decision in March 2018 . Northrop Grumman, which provided the original DAS , also known as the AN/AAQ-37, will continue supplying those systems for the aircraft through the Lot 14 production run, with Raytheon taking over afterward. Customers are set to begin receiving the first Lot 15 jets with the new cameras in 2023. â€œRaytheon’s solution delivers next generation capability for the fifth generation F-35,â€ Roy Azevedo, Vice President of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Systems at Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems, said within Lockheed Martinâ€™s statement. â€œOur focus is on providing pilots every tactical advantage imaginable while ensuring taxpayers receive the best value possible.â€ The exact specifications of the updated DAS remain unknown as yet, but Lockheed Martin says that it will be five times more reliable and twice as capable as the older AN/AAQ-37. At present, the DAS consists of six electro-optical cameras positioned at various points around all variants of the Joint Strike Fighter that feed information into the jetâ€™s mission systems and then push that data into the pilotâ€™s helmet . Lockheed Martin released this infographic about the “Next Generation Distributed Aperture System” along with its press release., Lockheed Martin What this does is give them a full, 360-degree panoptic view, even allowing them to â€œseeâ€ through the aircraftâ€™s fuselage. In addition, the system can spot possible threats and has the ability to automatically identify targets for the aircraftâ€™s other sensors, helping the pilot track objects in the air and on the surface. A 2014 test even demonstrated that it could work as a means to monitor ballistic missile launches . You can read more about how it works in depth here . But the AN/AAQ-37 has already been in service for nearly a decade and was in development before that, which has led to it being increasingly outdated. The same goes for the companion Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) under the aircraftâ€™s nose, which Lockheed Martin is also in the process of upgrading . The new version of that system will include a desperately needed capability to engage moving targets with laser-guided weapons, an issue you can read about in more detail here . It seems almost certain that Raytheonâ€™s system will offer higher fidelity imagery, faster and more seamless â€œstitching togetherâ€ of the video feeds from the different camera positions, more reliable identification and classification of potential targets, and other improvements. The updated arrangement may be more physically robust, as well. In its most recent annual review of the F-35 program, covering developments during the 2017 fiscal year , the Pentagonâ€™s Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation cited this last issue as the most pronounced problem with the existing DAS. Damaged camera windows were a major reason for aircraft ending up unavailable for operations or testing, even if they were still airworthy. One of the six camera systems that make up the AN/AAQ-37 DAS., Northrop Grumman The report also noted that there was no common standard between the services of what level of damage would prevent the aircraft from adequately performing its mission. The Air Force said that F-35As with broken camera windows were entirely non-mission capable, while the Navy had determined that this only left its F-35Cs partially mission capable. There was no information on the standard the U.S. Marine Corps applied at the time to its F-35Bs . Physically strengthened camera assemblies could be one of the reasons why Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are sure the new system will be more reliable. And in part due to that increased reliability, the two firms also say the upgraded DAS will help cut unit production and sustainment costs equal to more than $3 billion across the life cycle of the aircraft. The second issue is particularly important for Lockheed Martin, which has come under increasing fire from the Pentagon itself for not making sufficient progress in trimming the price tag of individual F-35s or finding ways to make them less expensive to operate. The company only finalized the Lot 11 contract in May 2018, more than six months behind schedule , after particularly tense negotiations with the U.S. military. Lockheed Martin wants to get the unit cost across all F-35 variants down to below $80 million by 2020. At present, the price of an F-35A, the cheapest of the three types, is $95 million. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., USAF In March 2018, Aviation Week noted that Raytheonâ€™s defeat of incumbent Northrop Grumman to supply a new DAS could be the first indication of a broader trend. Lockheed Martin could potentially seek out new vendors across its internal supply chain as it looks for any additional ways to cut costs. â€œThe supply chain competition for the next generation F-35 Distributed Aperture System resulted in significant cost savings, reliability and performance improvements,â€ Greg Ulmer, Lockheed Martinâ€™s Vice President and General Manager for the F-35 program, said outright in the companyâ€™s June 2018 press release about the DAS decision. â€œWe are aggressively pursuing cost reduction across the F-35 enterprise and this initiative is a clear demonstration of our unrelenting commitment to reduce costs and deliver transformational capabilities for the warfighter.â€ This is essentially the same language Lockheed Martin and the U.S. military had made in its initial decision to pursue two possible engines for the F-35. Then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates nixed the alternate F136 engine in 2011, one many short-sight decisions that found some immediate cost-savings up front, but led to cost growth and other issues in various programs later on. Pratt & Whitney, which makes the F135 engine that has gone on to power the Joint Strike Fighters, announced on June 12, 2018, that it had begun development of a “ Growth Option 2.0 ” upgrade for that turbofan as part of a larger effort to address existing problems and limitations. A US Marine Corps F-35B., Lockheed Martin But this could easily create new headaches for the already often vexing Joint Strike Fighter program. Lockheed has already delivered 300 F-35s to the U.S. military and foreign participants in the project, all of which have the AN/AAQ-37. The firm has dozens of additional jets already in production or on order through Lot 10 and, as already noted, doesnâ€™t even plan to make the DAS shift until it has finished work on at least four more production lots. ğŸ¥³Today the 300th #F35 âš¡ï¸, designated as AF-150 was delivered to the @usairforce . Congrats to the entire F-35 enterprise on delivering 300 of the most advanced fighter jets in the world. Many more to come! https://t.co/6kDdh5jFMs pic.twitter.com/rwEEySkmH8 — F-35 Lightning II (@thef35) June 11, 2018 This can only create at least some new level of logistical difficulty by creating essentially at least two distinct configurations of each of the three variants. It’s true that military aircraft receive significant upgrades and major modifications all the time, but the F-35 is a complex design to begin with that has suffered delays and difficulties in production owing in no small part to the stringent standards it has to adhere to in order to maintain its low-observable characteristics. Raytheon’s cameras will more than likely use as much of the existing mounting architecture as possible to save costs, but this wonâ€™t allow operators to mix and match cameras from the AN/AAQ-37 and the new system if one of them breaks, either. As such, any unit that ends up operating a mix of aircraft with different systems installed would have to source a larger array of replacement parts and services. The same goes for the upgraded EOTS, which will require more significant and expensive changes to the aircraftâ€™s internal structure. And unless the upgrades occur at the same time, it is possible that there may be aircraft with and without one upgraded sensor suite or the other. A US Navy’s F-35C., Lockheed Martin The F-35â€™s internal computer brain and its associated cloud-based network, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), is supposed to help manage these issues. However, it already has difficulty properly identifying which components are malfunctioning and often tells ground crews to send systems that are in perfect working order back to the depot. And since sensor fusion and data sharing are at the core of the F-35, units operating aircraft with different sensor configuration, and software builds necessary to support them, may have trouble operating together. If Raytheonâ€™s DAS and the new EOTS are supposed to offer a significant leap in reliability and capability, then the services may just increasingly feel uncomfortable deploying older aircraft in areas where there is the potential for an actual high-end conflict.Â U.S. military F-35 operators have already largely relegated jets with the obsolete 2B software suites to training missions and, even then, those aircraft have low availability rates â€“ an average of 40 percent or less depending on the variant. In May 2018, U.S. Air Force Colonel Paul Moga, head of the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, told Military.com that his jets, among the oldest F-35As in the service, were â€œ on life support .â€ In September 2017, the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy had already begun to wonder whether it would ever be cost effective to upgrade those jets to a more combat-capable configuration. Just based on software blocks alone, the three services operate F-35s in three different configurations. This also doesnâ€™t take into account the different subvariants of the software code, which they have not yet uniformly applied across the Joint Strike Fighter fleets. A breakdown of the different software blocks for the F-35 as of February 2018. At that point, the U.S. military had upgraded all of the Block 1 and 2A aircraft to the 2B standard. , GAO A recent report that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a congressional watchdog, released earlier in June 2018 was highly critical of the Joint Strike Fighter programâ€™s plans to move toward full-rate production without resolving Â a number of unspecified key deficiencies and without any clear plans about what it would do with older aircraft running out of date software. The review also complained that the costs associated with future Block 4 jets are unknown and that it is unclear what this “final” will actually consist of in terms of missions systems and other capabilities. The U.S. military’s central F-35 program office has already proposed breaking this down further into Blocks 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4, with various incremental upgrades. At the same time, existing aircraft would receive upgrades on a similarly fluid schedule as part of a concept known as Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2).Â A table from the June 2018 GAO report that shows undefined, but serious deficiencies in various categories that the U.S. military does not plan to resolve before moving on to full-rate production., GAO “The program is asking Congress to authorize and appropriate funds for Block 4 without insight into its complete cost, schedule, and technical baselines,” GAO said. “Furthermore, once Congress appropriates these funds, DOD would be able to award a contract, beginning a long-term commitment to Block 4, the costs of which are not fully understood.” Significant internal hardware changes will only add to the program’s complexity and make it more difficult and expensive to sustain an aircraft that has already proven to be especially expensive in this regard. It could also make it harder to field units with jets that all have the same level of capabilities. This, in turn, could easily lead to indirect cost growth, either due to the need for upgrades to older aircraft, the decision to sideline existing types in less demanding roles, or due to lost availability from complications during routine and heavy maintenance. None of this is to say that the upgraded sensors arenâ€™t important to maintaining the F-35â€™s qualitative edge and are badly needed improvements over systems that have become increasingly outmoded over the course of the project’s lengthy development cycle. But whether or not they will truly be able to lower the price of operating the stealthy jets in the long term remains to be seen. â€œIn its rush to cross the finish line, the program has made some decisions that are likely to affect aircraft performance and reliability and maintainability for years to come,â€ the GAOâ€™s latest review said. â€œIf reliability targets are not met, the military services and the taxpayer will have to settle for aircraft that are less reliable, more costly, and take longer to maintain.â€ Lockheed and Raytheon, as well as the U.S military services operating the jets, will have to make sure they have an especially well-defined plan to add in the new sensors to future aircraft and to make the best use of existing jets in order to avoid exacerbating these issues.Â Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The idea of green U.S. Army M1 Abrams tanks with big white stars on their sides, huge American flags flying on top, and art on the hull depicting a turtle wearing a World War II-era tanker uniform, running over a pile of cars sounds like something straight out of a 1980s arcade game. But its actually a real scene from the annual Strong Europe Tank Challenge at the service’s 7th Army Training Command’s Grafenwoehr Training Area in Germany. Since 2016, NATO allies and other friendly nations have sent teams of tankers to Grafenwoehr for the event , which the United States and Germany host together. The gathering involves a number of different activities for crews in and out of their vehicles. The goal is to offer the armor troops an opportunity to train together and build both professional and interpersonal relationships to foster better ties between the participating countries. The 2018 iteration of the challenge included teams from NATO members France, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, along with those from non-member states Austria, Ukraine, and Sweden. This was the first time the British and Swedish Armies had ever participated in the event. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dt4PzbZSMbw Each country supplies its own tanks. The Austrians, Germans, Poles, and Swedes all brought variants of the German-made Leopard 2 . The American, British, French, and Ukrainian crews drove M1A2 Abrams , Challenger 2 , Leclerc , and T-84 tanks respectively. Have you ever seen an Abrams look so cool?

The division, which has a storied history dating back to World War I, is also known as “The Big Red One,” and its insignia was another prominent part of the special paint scheme on the participating American Abrams. The videos above and below give a good sense of the diversity of the Strong Europe Tank Challenge’s events. Beyond crushing cars, teams also conduct conventional gunnery training and precision maneuvering in their vehicles and run through obstacle courses and compete in “ Iron Man ” style endurance challenges while carrying heavy tank ammunition and tires while on foot. https://youtube.com/watch?v=B51RImRXhFw https://youtube.com/watch?v=HGWCCQbz5lo The United States and its allies and partners are hardly the only ones to host this sort of event. Every year since 2013, the Russias have held what they call the Tank Biathlon, which brings together tank crews from all over the world. That gathering is much more akin to a sporting competition, though, and often involves vehicles painted in lurid colors. Participants don’t have to supply their own vehicles either, with most countries receiving Russian T-72-series tanks in order to compete, giving the event the air of an arms show, as well. China notably always brings its own Type 96A and India has employed its T-90S “Bhishma” in the past. There’s no official connection, but the Strong Europe Tank Challenge does seem to be a response of sorts to the Tank Biathlon. The United States has received two unofficial invitations to the Russian event, one in 2013 and another in 2017, but has never sent any teams to participate. https://youtube.com/watch?v=68Gvga_0_iM So far the United States hasn’t won the Strong Europe Tank Challenge, either. The Germans have now placed first twice, in 2016 and in 2018. There’s something more than a little ironic about that given the near constant reports about the poor state of the German Army and the low availability of working tanks. Germany’s public broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported in February 2018 that the only nine of the country’s 44 Leopard 2s were operational. The German team from 3rd Company, Panzerbataillon 393 gathers around the Strong Europe Tank Challenge after their win in 2018., US Army The Germans were also runner-up to the Austrians, who took the top slot, in 2017. Winning the event earns a team a placard on the event’s signature trophy, as well as another one shaped like a round of tank ammunition that the crew gets to keep. One of the crews from 2-70th Armor did pick up first place in the shoot-off, though, earning the title “Most Lethal” and a trophy of their own. A member of 2-70th Armor poses with the “Most Lethal” trophy., US Army There’s no indication the United States or Germany intends to stop holding the challenge, so there’s always next year.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",‘Harvester’ Could Transform Any US Air Force C-130 Into A Nuke Sniffing Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With its two WC-135W Constant Phoenix atmospheric sampling jets becoming increasingly difficult to operate and maintain, the U.S. Air Force is looking for additional ways to rapidly scoop up air samples after nuclear weapon tests and other atomic incidents. Since three replacement WC-135Rs are still years away from delivery, the service may soon turn to a modular kit that can turn a C-130 Hercules into a nuke-sniffing WC-130 as necessary. According to a report by Defense News , two of these systems, known variously as the Particulate Airborne Collection System (PACS) or Harvester, will be in service and operational by the end of 2019. Though the Pentagon did not request any additional money for the program in its latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year , the outlay does note that the U.S. military has spent more than $1.5 million on the effort since it began in 2012. The full Harvester system consists of two separate collection pods. These hang below the C-130 while it’s in flight to gather air samples potentially full of nuclear debris, as well as a workstation for the system’s operator. According to Sandia National Laboratories , which led the initial development of the equipment, during an actual mission, the system operator would first use the Directional Gamma Radiation Sensor (DGRS) to pinpoint the radioactive plume. This particular component consists of four large sodium iodide radiation detectors and a complex processing algorithm. Various Sandia-developed air-sampling pods. Harvester is at the far right., Sandia National Laboratories The aircraft would then fly through this “hot spot” collecting particles, which would get caught in a piece of specialized filter paper. Harvester has its own radiation sensor that can provide immediate data on the possible types of isotopes and how densely they’re concentrated in the air. Once the plane lands, specialists on the ground can physically remove the filters for more detailed analysis. Harvester is also a modular affair that will work on any of the Air Force’s C-130H or J model airlifters thanks to Canadian firm Airdyne’s Special Airborne Mission Installation and Response (SABIR), which you can read about more in detail in this past War Zone feature . This system is essentially a replacement for one or both of the Hercules’ rear paratroop doors that adds an extendable arm with a standardized bomb rack into the aircraft. A C-130H belonging to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard’s 193rd Special Operations Wing fitted with the SABIR door and carrying a podded psychological warfare system ., via Thinkdefense Personnel can then link this system, and any sensor pod or other stores it carries, to a workstation inside the aircraft. In Harvester’s case, SABIR systems on both sides of the aircraft each hold a single collection pod. This combination offers the Air Force significantly more flexibility over the existing WC-135Ws and the future WC-135Rs. The 21st Surveillance Squadron, part of the service’s secretive Air Force Technical Applications Center, or AFTAC , the service’s main nuclear reconnaissance unit, “owns” the systems, but has no aircraft and will have to coordinate with airlift units as necessary to fly actual missions. The inside of a harvester pod where the filter would go., Sandia National Laboratories This arrangement could provide a badly needed backup capability in case the existing Constant Phoenix jets are not available. With only two of them to begin with, it doesn’t take much for accidents or heavy maintenance to bring aerial sampling missions to a halt. “The current [WC-135] airplanes are old. They’re wearing out,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Dave Goldfein told Senators in April 2018 . “Our mission capable rates, and more importantly our aircraft availability rates to go do this mission, are much lower than not only the secretary of defense but the combatant commander’s requirements for that mission.” One of the two WC-135W Constant Phoenix aircraft., USAF With the smaller C-130s, the Air Force would be able to fly collection missions from a more diverse set of airports and airfields, as well. This could offer a more responsive capability during a contingency whether it be an accident or attack of some sort. The Harvester program actually began first as part of efforts to develop capabilities to guard against domestic nuclear incidents. In 2013, Sandia conducted the initial flight tests of the pods on a Customs and Border Protection MQ-9 Reaper drone. A Customs and Border Protection MQ-9 carrying the Harvester system during a test in 2013., Sandia National Laboratories According to one Pentagon presentation in 2015, one concept of operations would involve flying a Harvester-equipped aircraft over an incident site and then having it return to a safe and secure airstrip where technicians would quickly prepare samples for analysis in a laboratory by way of a rapidly deployable clean room. In this way, the U.S. government could quickly identify the exact nature of a potential nuclear incident and respond accordingly. The possible scenarios could range from a terrorist with a “ dirty bomb ” to a rogue state launching a ballistic or cruise missile with a nuclear or radiological warhead at an American facility abroad or a city at home, In its most recent budget request, the U.S. military says that Harvester’s primary mission will still be to support the Department of Homeland Security-led National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) effort and its own Countering Nuclear Threats (CNT) mission. U.S. Special Operations Command recently assumed the role as the lead agency within the Pentagon for countering all weapons of mass destruction. With that in mind, the Air Force’s special operations MC-130s or MQ-9s could easily carry the pods if required. A 2015 briefing slide showing Harvester among other potential developments to support rapid sampling and analysis after a nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction-related incident., DOD Still, Harvester-equipped C-130s won’t be able to completely replace the WC-135s. The podded system can’t collect and analyze nuclear gases, which the Constant Phoenix jets can do with their larger sampling system. There is a separate Modular Whole Air Airborne Collection System (M-WACS) in the works that could give the aircraft this additional capability, but it is unclear when it will be operational. Even so, the C-130s also don’t fly high or fast enough, or have the overall range, to perform the kind of sampling necessary to support AFTAC’s primary mission of monitoring compliance with the Limited Test Ban Treaty and other nuclear arms control agreements, Susan Romano, a spokeswoman for the center, told Defense News. Harvester is really better suited to fill a capability gap between the more capable systems on the larger WC-135s and the more limited suites on smaller platforms, such as the National Nuclear Security Agency’s fixed wing and helicopter-mounted Aerial Measuring System (AMS) and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Collection Technology ( ASPECT ) aircraft. As such, the Harvester-equipped C-130s will also help free up the WC-135s for missions that truly require their more extensive sampling systems. And together, the two types of aircraft will expand the Air Force’s overall capacity to perform this vital mission.

The two Israeli state-run companies officially unveiled the new weapon in a press release on June 11, 2018. In the past 12 months or so, the firms have tested Rampage with the help of the Israeli Air Force (IAF) and they expect to have it in series production and available for sale in 2019, according to a separate report from Israel’s Ynet News . A video presentation and images that accompanied the system’s debut showed an IAF F-16I Sufa multi-role combat aircraft launching one of the weapons. “Sending four fighter jets carrying four Rampage missiles [each] allows us to strike under conditions we’ve never had before,” Eli Reiter, head of IMI Systems’ Firepower Division, told Ynet. The weapon offers “a quantum leap in performance and extraordinary cost-effectiveness ratio, two factors which are important to many air forces around the world,” he added in the company’s press release. Rampage is an air-launched derivative of IMI Systems’ ground-launched Extended Range Artillery guided artillery rocket, or EXTRA. There appear to be only minimal changes to the weapon’s external design for the air-launched role, namely the addition of a reinforced section of the central body with the attachment lugs. Otherwise, from the manufacturer’s own description, the weapon sounds relatively unchanged. The ground-launched extra has the same stated maximum range and also uses a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guidance package to hit its intended target. IMI Systems says the guidance system will work reliably even if a hostile force is jamming or otherwise disrupting GPS receivers, which is an increasingly realistic possibility on modern battlefields . Of course, this doesn’t mean that these electronic warfare attacks wouldn’t degrade the weapon’s capabilities. INS is far less accurate than GPS guidance and likely impact area only expands at longer ranges. The air-launched version of EXTRA, initially known as MARS , has been in development since at least 2012 . It’s not the first time a ground-launched, ballistic weapon has been adapted for aerial use, either. Recently, Russia revealed an air-launched version of its Iskander quasi-ballistic missile , called Kinzhal , which could indicate the start of a trend of converting established guided rocket artillery and similar systems into lower-cost stand-off weapons for aircraft. When it first announced the project, IMI Systems said that its goal was for the weapon to have a total weight of approximately 1,100 pounds to fit on any bomb rack that could accept a 1,000-pound class U.S. Mk 83 bomb . The plan then was for the air-launched version of EXTRA to have a warhead weight around 220 pounds. An older computer-generated rendering of what is now known as Rampage, but with the original MARS branding., IMI Systems In addition, unless the air-launched rampage has a smaller warhead or motor to reduce its overall weight, it should definitely have a greater range than the ground-based EXTRA given the benefit of the added momentum of the launching aircraft, as well as the possibility of a launch at high altitude. There is also the distinct possibility that the artillery rocket system can only hit targets up to 90 miles away using a special, lightweight warhead in the first place. But even at its stated maximum range, the weapon fills a niche between precision guided glide-bombs, such as the U.S. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) and the Israeli-made SPICE , both of which the IAF uses, and longer-range air-launched, land-attack cruise missiles, such as Israel’s Delilah . And its supersonic speed offers significant benefits over these far slower-moving weapons. This could make it ideal for short-notice strikes on time-sensitive targets, including mobile air defense systems and mobile ballistic missiles , giving them little, if any time to fire, seek cover, or otherwise relocate. IMI Systems says Rampage can hit targets out to its maximum range in as little as five minutes. A Delilah under the wing of an Israeli F-16I Sufa., Kgyst via Wikimedia And, as IMI Systems has been quick to highlight, Rampage should be significantly less expensive than weapons in the latter category, presenting it as a cost-effective alternative for engaging targets at a safe distance from at least short- and medium-range surface-to-air missile systems. WIth supersonic speeds, it might be particularly well suited to defeating point-defense systems , as well. Depending on how many components it shares with EXTRA, a weapon already in production and in service with Israeli forces and in other countries, the air-launched derivative could be especially cost-effective. For Israel itself, this could be a valuable capability, particularly in light of its low-level fight against Iran and its proxies , including the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , in Syria. With a range of around 90 miles, Israeli jets carrying Rampage rockets could easily hit targets in and around the Syrian capital Damascus from within Israel’s own airspace. Launching the weapons while flying over Lebanon or after zipping across the Lebanese-Syrian border briefly at high speed – both common IAF tactics – would allow Israeli aircraft to engage opponents near the strategic cities of Hama, Homs, and perhaps even Aleppo further to the north, with minimal exposure to increasingly threatening Syrian and Iranian air defenses . Watch: An IAF attack on a Syrian SA-22 battery after it attempted firing at IAF aircraft pic.twitter.com/yv84W3YXZ8 — Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) May 10, 2018 At the same time, using Rampage would be cheaper than firing Delilahs, which Israel has been employing on higher-risk strikes into Syria. Of course, the air-launched version of EXTRA does not have the ability to hit moving targets, so it would not necessarily be able to fill in against all target sets. IMI Systems says it is best suited to destroying fixed targets such as command centers, communications nodes, military depots, airfields and any other “valuable field targets protected by anti-air systems.” IMI Systems could offer an additional laser-guidance system to add moving target capability to the weapon in the future, as well. This could also allow other manned and unmanned aircraft, as well as forces on the ground, to cue the weapons at extended ranges, making them more flexible and responsive to short-notice requests for fire support or for strikes against fleeting enemies. The cost factor could be even more important considering the sheer volume of potential targets. In May 2018, Israel launched more than two dozen strikes into Syria against sites housing Iranian or Iranian-backed forces, as well as Syrian air defenses that attempted to shoot down Israeli aircraft. The Israelis reportedly employed ground-based rocket artillery during that operation and it is possible that they may have done so in the past, as well. More recently, the IAF attacked more than 50 different targets in the Gaza Strip as tensions with the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas have soared over Israeli troops shooting protesters near a fence that marks the boundary between that enclave and Israel proper. In this case, there have been significant concerns about the potential for civilian casualties given Gaza’s densely populated environment. A ground-launched EXTRA system., IMI Systems IMI Systems says that, just like EXTRA, Rampage will offer extreme precision, falling nearly straight down on its target, and a relatively small warhead, to better reduce the chance of collateral damage. And again, given the speed and range capabilities of the weapon, it could significantly shorten the time it takes between spotting targets in Gaza, which may be just small groups of individuals and a readily portable rocket launcher, and engaging them. With all this in mind, Rampage could also be an attractive, lower cost option for any other country looking to acquire an air-launched stand-off capability. IMI Systems’ says it already has one, unnamed buyer for the system, which is almost certainly a foreign customer. Vietnam, which already operates EXTRA and has reportedly been considering buying Delilah missiles , would be an obvious potential customer. When it first announced MARS, IMI Systems said it was interested in pitching the weapon as readily adaptable to almost any fourth generation combat jet and potentially even lighter aircraft. The possible launch platforms included virtually any variant of Russia’s Flanker family , which would include the Vietnamese Air Force’s Su-30MK2s . The Vietnamese military has already deployed its ground-based EXTRA systems onto islands it controls in the South China Sea , which puts them within range of nearby Chinese outposts. An air-launched derivative would give authorities in Hanoi another means of challenging Beijing’s claims in the region and could help keep its aircraft launch strikes while keeping further away from China’s steadily expanding defensive network in a crisis. The transporter-erector-launcher for China’s HQ-9 long-range surface-to-air missile system, which the country has deployed at various sites in the South China Sea., Imaginechina via AP Images The other known EXTRA operator, Azerbaijan , might also be interested in Rampage, which would be able to hit targets almost anywhere in neighboring Armenia from within its own airspace. These two countries have been locked in protracted and often violent conflict over a disputed portion of their shared border. The country has a number of MiG-29 Fulcrum aircraft, another platform IMI Systems’ suggested could work with Rampage in the past. Of course, the Israeli firms seems to be eager to court export sales for the system broadly. It has claimed that the air-launched weapon could potentially work with variants of the American-made F-15 Eagle and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , the Eurofighter Typhoon , and upgraded, second-hand Israeli Kfirs , among many other types. IMI Systems has said that Rampage could be an option for the F-35 , but at nearly 15.5 feet long, there’s no way it could fit inside the aircraft’s internal weapons bays and would work only if the planes flew in a non-stealthy configuration. Adding stand-off weapons to fourth generation aircraft can significantly add to their utility in general, especially as long-range surface-to-air missile systems continue to proliferate around the world. Unless a country is willing to go through the time-consuming and immensely expensive process of developing a stealthy fifth-generation platform, more advanced and longer range air-launched weapons offer the only real alternative to continue holding potential enemies at threat from the air, especially when it comes to critical targets deeper within their territory. It could also present a valuable tool for attacking air defense nodes to pave the way for additional follow-on strikes. If the IAF is indeed already lined up to buy Rampage, it might only be a matter of time before we see it employed against targets in Syria. If it proves itself there, that could help IMI Systems pitch it to other foreign customers.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An F-15C Eagle based out of Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa has crashed into the sea. The incident occurred around 6:30am local time. The USAF has noted on Twitter that the pilot ejected and was recovered alive from the ocean. Two squadrons of USAF F-15C/D Eagles are based at Kadena Air Base as part of the 18th Wing. Widely considered the ‘tip of the spear’ of forward-deployed USAF forces in the region, 44th and 67th Fighter Squadrons assigned to the wing are considered among the most highly trained and capable air superiority-focused fighter units in the world. Currently, Kadena is also the temporary home of 14 F-22 Raptors from Alaska that are forward deployed as a theater security package. While at the base, working with two of just three front-line F-15C/D units, all of which are stationed abroad, would be a high priority for the F-22 pilots as they would have to fight together if a major crisis were to arise. It remains unclear what the F-15 was doing at the time of the incident. The weather in the region has been poor and that time seems odd for normal training operations. We also don’t know who plucked the pilot out of the sea, although the 18th Wing has an HH-60G Pavehawk unit, the 33rd Rescue Squadron, assigned that often stands alert to deal with just this type of event. The USAF’s F-15C/D fleet has received upgrades in recent years , including new cockpit displays , Sniper targeting pods, and the highly capable APG-63V3 AESA radar system. More enhancements are planned under the ‘Golden Eagle’ initiative that aims to outfit roughly 200 F-15Cs for ongoing duty into the coming decades. But this program is now in doubt as a major part of its upgrade roadmap, arguably its most important feature aside from the radar, has been put on indefinite hold. This costly upgrade included a new digital radar warning receiver and electronic warfare suite that would have made the Eagle far more survivable and deadly in contested environments. Under the new plan, only the F-15E Strike Eagle fleet would get this critical system. Just days ago, documents emerged that showed the USAF intends to retire the entire F-15C/D fleet in the coming years, although that decision will face stiff opposition in Congress. The possibility of replacing the F-15C/D fleet with upgraded F-16s surfaced last year and remains a very controversial topic to say the least. Kadena Air Base seen during an ‘elephant walk’ readiness drill with the 18th Wing’s assorted assigned aircraft ready to go., USAF Today’s crash also comes as yet another aircraft loss in what has been an alarming string of aviation mishaps over the last six months. These incidents have claimed the lives of dozens of U.S. military personnel and a slew of aircraft from all of the services. At least, in this case, the pilot got out alive, which is far more important than the loss of a piece of equipment regardless of its cost or scarcity. We will update this post as more information comes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 8, 2018",Kim And Company Arrive In Singapore Via A Procession Of Chinese And North Korean Jets (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have been closely watching movements of aircraft in and out of North Korea since we reported that foreign aircraft will be part of Kim Jong Un’s travel plans to Singapore for the historic summit. In recent hours, a number of North Korean and Chinese aircraft have made their way from Pyongyang to Changi Airport in Singapore, with Kim’s arrival aboard one of them having just occurred . The Chinese government, via flag carrier Air China, has supplied North Korea with an Airbus A330 and a Boeing 747. The A330 made a run from Pyongyang to Singapore yesterday before returning back to China. This aircraft seems to have conveyed a North Korean advance team including diplomats and security personnel. The 747-400, which just landed in Singapore, was apparently used to fly Kim and his personal aides to the summit. This would also be consistent with our previous reporting that North Korea had settled on such a plan. B-2447 arriving at Changi Airport in Singapore with Kim onboard. , AP The Jumbo Jet in question is quite special. B-2447 is used by the top rungs of the Chinese government, predominantly President Xi Jinping and his entourage, when traveling abroad. It is capable of being specially outfitted with a VIP interior and has special interfaces for secure satellite communications among other modifications. With this in mind, it wasn’t surprising seeing it being used as ‘Kim Force One’ for this special mission. In addition to China’s contributions, a North Korean Il-76 cargo aircraft made its way from Pyongyang to Singapore hours ago, taking on fuel in China along its route. This aircraft carried Kim’s armored Mercedes limos and cargo associated with the trip, likely including his famed portable toilet , along with other security vehicles and personnel. Kim’s limousine being unloaded from a North Korea Il-76 at Changi Airport in Singapore. , AP Maybe the most interesting part of this whole airlift is that Kim’s aging, VIP configured Il-62M also made the flight. It was the last in line to arrive in Singapore and appeared to have made a refueling stop somewhere around Liaocheng, China on its way. Overall this was a fairly impressive aerial display for the leader of a bankrupt pariah state living under crushing international sanctions. It’s also worth considering that this level of VIP-related international logistics are largely a new concept for North Korea, although the short flight to Dalian, China to meet with Xi Jinping in early May, which also included an Il-76 cargo jet carrying Kim’s limousines and support staff, seems to have been used as a test run for the Singapore Summit. It’s also worth noting that all the aircraft took what appeared to be carefully planned routes that kept them over Chinese territory for the maximum amount of time, with the minimal amount of time over water or in international airspace. Meanwhile, Air Force One (VC-25A) has taken an interesting route to Singapore as well, flying east across the Atlantic and making a fuel stop in Souda Bay, Greece. This direction is longer than the polar route but doesn’t fly over Russia and China. Currently Air Force One is somewhere near India on its final leg to Singapore. A USAF C-32A —commonly used as Air Force Two—is also heading to Singapore along a similar route, although it stopped at Ramstein Air Base in Germany for an overnight fuel stop. The U.S. airlift contingent, including and the myriad air lifters used to carry the presidential motorcade and helicopters from HMX-1, including ‘Marine One,’ will be using Paya Lebar Air Base in Singapore instead of Changi Airport. The two airfields are quite close to each other but geographically splitting up the North Korean and American delegations has been a common theme when it comes to the planning of the summit. An E-4B Advanced Airborne Command Post aircraft that always shadows the President during trips abroad also made its way to Asia for the summit, tanking up over the western Pacific while en route. The E-4B will not land at Paya Lebar, it will stage out of another location within a couple hundred miles of the President’s destination as is the common protocol. Now that Kim Jong Un is in Singapore the circus will truly begin, although it is odd that a formal arrival with all the fanfare that deplaning usually includes from a head of state, especially one that never travels abroad, was absent from Kim’s arrival. This could have been a security decision and maybe we will see a video of it from North Korean State Media in the hours to come. We will also have to keep an eye out for any U.S. military movements nearby that could be used as a backstop to remind North Korea of America’s hard-hitting might in the region, especially if negotiations between Trump and Kim hit a rough patch. Stay tuned as this is bound to be a wild ride and we can only hope the summit will end with the U.S.-North Korean relationship in a far better state than it was in at its start.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 4, 2018",What Secretive Anti-Ship Missile Did China Hack From The U.S. Navy?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s relentless cyber espionage campaign against the Pentagon has been one of the central reasons why that country’s technological warfighting capabilities have aggressively matured over a relatively short period of time. In fact, we now see the fruits of their hacking operations on a daily basis via advanced ‘indigenous’ weapon systems , some which are now entering into operational service. But a previously unreported intrusion into a Navy contractor’s computer network has provided the Chinese military with information on the service’s electronic warfare and threat library, cryptographic radio systems used on submarines, specific sensor data, and detailed information on a previously undisclosed and fast-paced initiative to field a supersonic anti-ship missile onto American nuclear submarines dubbed Sea Dragon. Over half a terabyte of information was stolen electronically from the contractor’s computer systems at Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Rhode Island. The installation is a focal point for development and testing of new systems related to sub-surface combat. The contractor’s network was not deemed classified but the information on it in its totality was of a highly classified nature according to the Washington Post , which broke the story. NUWC in Newport Rhode Island., NAVSEA The loss of the Navy’s current electronic warfare library is especially troubling as that type of information is considered among the most sensitive data the Pentagon gathers and is critical to countering enemy defensive networks and allowing U.S. assets to survive in contested territory. This theft paired with information on sensor data that potentially collects that information is especially damning as the enemy can figure out not just what the Navy knows, but exactly how they have come to know it. Yet the news that the Navy is rapidly looking to field a submarine-launched anti-ship missile capable of supersonic speeds is the biggest revelation from this report. Not only that but it is supposedly a weapon already in existence that is being adapted for submarine use. Quite honestly, in a vacuum, it’s good news that the Navy is working on such a capability. Giving U.S. nuclear submarines long-range anti-ship capabilities that they can use while operating where no ship can is a critical ability that should be obtained, but what weapon could this be? A shadowy cutting-edge weapons program Little is known about the Sea Dragon program, as the Washington Post points out: “The Sea Dragon project is an initiative of a special Pentagon office stood up in 2012 to adapt existing U.S. military technologies to new applications. The Defense Department, citing classification levels, has released little information about Sea Dragon other than to say that it will introduce a “disruptive offensive capability” by “integrating an existing weapon system with an existing Navy platform.” The Pentagon has requested or used more than $300 million for the project since late 2015 and has said it plans to start underwater testing by September. … The introduction of a supersonic anti-ship missile on U.S. Navy submarines would make it more difficult for Chinese warships to maneuver. It would also augment a suite of other anti-ship weapons that the U.S. military has been developing in recent years.” Pentagon budget documents show that Sea Dragon, which began in the 2015 fiscal year, was one of many programs that the secretive Strategic Capabilities Office has managed and is listed in a specific line item covering “Advanced Innovative Technologies.” By the following fiscal cycle, this same set of funding also paid for work on land-based railguns, advanced conventional guns and ammo, advanced navigation systems, unspecified enhanced munitions and unmanned aerial vehicle payloads, and a naval drone swarm project called Sea Mob. In the 2016 fiscal year, the Sea Dragon program completed designs for an in-water test apparatus and the ejection body and its associated hardware, as well as successfully completed a test of the weapon system on land. Unfortunately, subsequent budget requests do not list further accomplishments for the program. We do know that the Pentagon expected to start underwater static testing of some portion of the system, as well as begin planning for a “sea-based tactical demonstration,” by the end of the 2018 fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30, but its latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year said that the new funds would go to continued planning for that live-fire test. The Pentagon asked for nearly $150 million in total to support that work, as well finishing underwater static testing, building a sea-based launch support test site, and continued analysis of the conceptual kill chain associated with the weapon system. This is less than half of the money the U.S. military requested for Sea Dragon for the 2018 fiscal year, but the budget documents note that this was a product of cost savings they had achieved by buying extra long-lead time components in advance. We have talked regularly and at great lengths about China’s increasing naval capabilities on virtually every level . We have also talked for years about America’s lack of investment in anti-ship missile systems, which the Pentagon is now working hard to counteract . But there is no existing supersonic anti-ship cruise missile in America’s inventory. Few close U.S. allies possess similar weapons either, with the focus being on low-observability, networking, advanced targeting capabilities and so on, not high-speed. Russia, on the other hand, has focused for decades on developing supersonic and now even hypersonic anti-ship cruise missiles, which are seen as a major threat to American warships. China has also worked hard to independently perfect the anti-ship ballistic missile, with the medium-range DF-21D and a version of the intermediate-range DF-26 becoming one of some of the most potent anti-access threats to American Carrier Strike Groups operating in the Indo-Pacific Theater. So if no supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles exist in the Pentagon’s inventory, or are even deep in development, what is this ‘existing’ weapon? Identifying the mystery weapon This weapon could be one of a number of concepts we identify below. But to start, a submarine-launched version of the SM-6 multi-role missile seems like the most conventional possibility. This is not a cruise missile, but the designation stated in the Washington Post’s article could be just a due to the writer’s lack of knowledge of existing weapon systems and their capabilities or just a misinterpretation of what is clearly a fairly opaque program. SM-6 test launch., Raytheon The SM-6, which you can read all about in this recent profile we published on it, can be launched from the Mark 41 Vertical Launch Systems found on American destroyers and cruisers. In its latest form, it is fully networked, allowing it to receive targeting data from a variety of platforms, including airborne, ground-based, or surface-based sensor nodes. This concept is called Cooperative Engagement Capability/Naval Integrated Fire Control CEC/NIFC and it is one of the most important concepts the sea-going force is trying to implement at this time. USN Although it was designed primarily as a surface-to-air weapon to be used against air-breathing threats and ballistic missiles during their terminal stage of flight, the SM-6 has an increasingly potent long-range anti-ship and a land-attack capability able to promptly strike targets over long distances. The fact that it flies at very high speeds on a ballistic-like track instead of a flat cruise missile like flight profile makes it especially hard for enemies to defend against. Most of America’s nuclear fast attack submarines and all its guided missile submarines have ‘strike length’ vertical launch cells similar to the Mark 41 VLS, that are used to house BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles. Los Angles class USS Santa Fe (SSN-763) with her VLS doors open. , USN A new arrangement, with two large hatches that cover a number of launch tubes and can be more easily adapted to different weaponry, is now being fielded on latest Virginia class submarines. Soon boats equipped with the Virginia Payload Module , which carries four of these large modular missile bays, will be under construction. These same cells currently used for Tomahawk cruise missiles could be configured to house an altered SM-6-booster combination capable of launching the missile submerged without destroying the launch cell. If such an arrangement were developed and implemented, the variety and flexibility of firepower that America’s submarine force would possess would greatly increase. USS John Warner (SSN-785) shows off her modular launch tubes, she was the first of her kind to receive the new setup., USN Because the SM-6 is networked and doesn’t rely on organic sensors installed on its firing platform for targeting, submarines could even act as clandestine launch platforms for anti-aircraft attacks. This would allow for more vulnerable assets, like E-2D Hawkeyes, MQ-4C Tritons , P-8 Poseidons , and powerful radar-packing surface combatants to stand off at long ranges, using their sensor’s great reach—outside the range of their own or nearby weapons—to their advantage and remotely ordering up attacks on enemy ships and aircraft by surprise. The unique list of information Chinese hackers stole from the Navy contractor also points to such a system, which would rely on electromagnetic threat libraries, crypto-communications, and a wide variety of sensors for detecting and engaging threats. Raytheon, the company who makes the SM-6, has a long history of providing tailored weapons for American submarines, and some non-traditional programs have recently seemed to disappear into the realm of deep classification. For instance, the initiative to arm Navy subs with AIM-9X air-to-air missiles as a short-range last-line of defense against prowling anti-submarine warfare aircraft. That program went as far as being successfully tested before going dark, which you can read all about it in this past feature of ours. It is also possible that the Washington Post article’s author was wrong about the missile’s supersonic capability, which would point to fielding an advanced anti-ship cruise missile like Lockheed’s very stealthy and smart Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) aboard submarines. Yet this would probably be a less covert affair developmentally speaking. But such a weapon would be especially useful when combined with the SM-6—or another high-speed anti-ship weapon—allowing for long-range, multi-layer attacks on enemy flotillas. Also, the Navy, and its submarines will be getting a long-range, subsonic, anti-ship capability via the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk. It’s more likely that his weapon could actually be LRASM-B, or at least an evolutionary relative of it. LRASM-B was being developed alongside the subsonic LRASM-A around the turn of the decade and would have performance nearing Mach 3, operating in a similar fashion as the Russian-Indian developed BrahMos anti-ship missile. A model of Lockheed’s supersonic LRASM-B concept. , Americanmilitaryforum.com Development work continued on LRASM-B until around 2013 when it was officially passed over. It is very possible that this design was brought back to life under the shadowy Sea Dragon program, with a focus on submarines as a launch platform, not ships. The budgetary dates and what was mentioned in the Washington Post article would certainly support this possibility as well. Maybe even more promising is the possibility that this is actually the product of a supposedly defunct 2000s initiative to create a high-speed cruise missile dubbed Revolutionary Approach To Time-critical Long Range Strike, or RATTLRS for short. This weapon was all about hitting time-sensitive targets very quickly with little preparation, being able to fly at high altitudes and at speeds approaching Mach 4, obliterating its target with submunitions, a high-explosive warhead, or a penetrating warhead within about 30 minutes time at its maximum range. Elaborate mockups of the missile were being shown off by the mid-2000s., ONR via F-16.net This Lockheed-led initiative built on the Skunk Works’ experience with the D-21 drone and was supported by the Office of Naval Research and NASA. It was funded throughout the 2000s, had successful payload delivery tests on the jet sled, its engine was built by Rolls Royce , and was approaching a complex flight demonstration phase when it disappeared. This could have been due to budget cuts that happened around the turn of the decade, but maybe it was revived in 2013, adapted for the anti-ship mission, and deep in development in updated form by 2015. It’s also worth noting that a submarine-launched capability was part of the program’s initial vision. A RATTLRS cruise-missile inlet undergoes testing at the High Speed Wind Tunnel at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control in Grand Prairie., Lockheed via Deagel.com Adding to the case that RATTLRS may have been reborn in secret is this tidbit of information brought to us by our good friend Stephen Trimble’s twitter feed. Apparently, the Navy has been showing off a model of this exact concept just months ago without any real explanation as to why: Finally, the mystery missile could be a hypersonic missile , not a supersonic missile, for the Ohio class submarine, which the Navy is quietly developing and has test flown fairly recently. Still, the Pentagon has openly discussed these and other hypersonic tests recently, so it’s not exactly top secret. Also, this wouldn’t be a variation of an existing system as described in the Washington Post article. Fielding such a system operational by 2020 also seems remarkably ambitious, but it may be possible and certainly, China has an extreme interest in hypersonic technologies. These are just the clearest possibilities for what this weapon could be. It’s also possible that it is another weapon system clandestinely developed to a certain degree in the past, and brought back into development due to the changing nature of the world by the middle of this decade. During the mid-2000s, time-sensitive strike was such a big deal due to the Global War on Terror that numerous programs existed that never seemed to go anywhere—at least publically. Loose bits sink ships Regardless of the exact identity of this weapon system, the idea that the Navy—or at least one of its contractors—lost so much detailed information on what could be one of its most promising and critical weapon systems, as well as the infrastructure that supports it, couldn’t have come at a worse time. China is pumping huge sums of money into its maritime warfare programs and fortifying its “fortress” like anti-access/area-denial strategy that will make it harder and harder for America’s surface fleet to operate anywhere near striking distance of the Chinese mainland. With this in mind, submarines remain among the most important tools for breaking down this anti-access bubble so that more vulnerable assets can move closer to potential targets and strategic areas. What’s worse is that with detailed info in hand, China is likely going to work hard to replicate this capability, not devise a defense against it. Above all else, this is another terrible reminder about how the Defense Department and the industrial complex that feeds it remains its own worst enemy when it comes to securing highly detailed information about its most critical and costly weapon systems. At some point, the decision has to be made that networks that are not air-gapped and are connected to the outside world in some fashion are not secure enough to gamble such sensitive information on. Physical espionage is a big enough threat to deal with as it is, and the U.S. has failed miserably at defending against electronic espionage using convenient network architecture. USS North Dakota being rolled after assembly., General Dynamics Electric Boat Coming to terms with this reality will mean it will become more time consuming, expensive, and tougher overall to develop new weapon systems. Distributing programs to sites located across the U.S. will instantly become a major issue. But what’s the point in the U.S. developing any of these systems if in the end it is just developing them for its number one technological competitor as well? And the fact that China doesn’t have to pay billions upon billions of dollars for this intellectual property—they can steal for virtually nothing—isn’t only a loss to American national security, but it actually provides the enemy with a major fiscal edge. And that edge is already being exploited in front of our very eyes on an increasingly unprecedented scale.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 17, 2018",Iraqi Armored Brigade Ditches U.S. M1 Abrams For Russian T-90 Tanks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With assistance from Russia, one of Iraq’s armored brigades has swapped out its American-made M1 Abrams tanks for new T-90s. The change comes after the United States complained about M1s ending up in the hands of Iranian-backed Shi’ite militias and could be another sign that the Kremlin is looking to lure Iraqi authorities into its sphere of influence. Iraq’s Ministry of Defense announced the change on its official, Arabic-only website on June 8, 2018. According to a translation of the information by Jane’s 360 , the 9th Division’s 35th Brigade took delivery of 39 T-90S tanks. The unit’s remaining Abrams went to the 34th Brigade, another one of the 9th Division’s units, which has operated M1s, as well as older Soviet-era types. Iraqi officials added that Russian specialists had retrained the 35th Brigade’s officers and crews to operate the new tanks. They did not say whether these individuals were members of Russia’s military, employees of the manufacturer UralVagonZavod (UVZ), or private contractors. Iraq finalized a contract with UVZ in 2016 for a total of 73 T-90S and SK tanks . The Iraqis began taking the deliveries of the first examples in February 2018 . The video below accompanied the Iraqi Ministry of Defense’s announcement that the 35th Brigade had received new T-90S tanks. The T-90S types that Iraq has received are among the most recent iterations of the design, itself an outgrowth of the Soviet-era T-72 , and appear to share some features with Russia’s newest T-90SM variants. The vehicle remains largely unchanged in terms of its basic configuration and has a modernized version of the 125mm main gun found on the original type. The new design does have a significantly more powerful engine, giving the vehicle a top speed of nearly 40 miles an hour on roads and a range of approximately 340 miles on a single tank of gas. A T-90SM tank, which notably differs from the Iraqi tanks in that it has a remote weapon station on top of the turret, but shares some other features, especially in the configuration of the hull., Aleksey Kitaev via Wikimedia The tanks also have a blend of steel and composite armor that offers improved protection over the old T-72, as well as improved fire control systems, night vision optics, and communications equipment. It’s worth noting that Iraq’s past experience with the T-72-series is, at best checkered. Those tanks were notably poor performers during both the first Gulf War in 1991 and the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003, but for various reasons. The T-90SK is a variant for unit commanders, which differs only from the standard type in that it has additional radios and navigation equipment. We don’t know how many S versus SK types are in Iraq’s total order. The video below shows dock workers loading the first batch of T-90s for Iraq onto a ship in February 2018. Iraq’s variants of the T-90 also feature additional defense systems. These include a system that can detect laser designators and rangefinders, found on a number of modern anti-tank weapons, and alert the crew, giving them at least a chance to either maneuver behind cover or deploy a defensive smoke screen. There is also an extensive explosive reactive armor (ERA) suite to defend against anti-tank guided missiles and other infantry anti-armor weapons, such rocket-propelled grenades. They also have slat armor screens around the engine compartment at the rear for additional protection against the latter type of threats. ERA involves blocks of explosives positioned around the vehicle that explode outward on impact, absorbing the blast of an incoming round before it hits the actual hull of the vehicle. Slat armor either pre-detonates the projectile before it can do significant damage or physically stops it from hitting its target. https://youtube.com/watch?v=i3Q1Mj7HHL4 Neither of these defenses are designed to stop high-speed kinetic penetrators. And in the case of ERA arrays, each individual explosive block can only defeat one threat before it needs replacement and can potentially pose a hazard to any nearby friendly infantry or innocent bystanders. This can be a significant problem during urban operations where accompanying infantry units are essential to protecting heavy armor from getting flanked or falling victim to sudden ambushes. But regardless of these improvements over older T-72 tanks, the 48-ton T-90s are simply not in the same class as the 70-ton Abrams. As such, the decision to refit the 35th Brigade with T-90s raises questions about whether Iraq sees the larger, more advanced M1s as being more expensive and complex to operate both practically and politically. One of the Iraqi 9th Division’s M1 Abrams west of the city of Mosul in March 2017., US Army There is no question that the Abrams is more costly to sustain, but in 2018, they’ve also become the source of a complicated dispute with the U.S. government. Since at least 2015 , there had been reports that some of the M1s, as well as other American-supplied vehicles and equipment, had found their way, either by quasi-official transfer or unofficial agreements, into the hands of Iraqi militias, such as Kata’ib Hezbollah – not to be confused with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah – and the Badr Organization . These Shi’ite Iraqi groups, which receive significant support from Iran, have operated under official sanction as members of the country’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) since 2014. In 2016, PMUs officially became part of Iraq’s armed forces. The video below shows a column of vehicles flying Kata’ib Hezbollah flags in 2015, including M1 Abrams. The U.S. government apparently only decided to make clear that it did not approve of the Abrams going to the PMUs sometime after October 2017. At that time, PMUs that had acquired Abrams took part in the Iraqi government’s swift and violent campaign to crush a push for independence in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish Region . In February 2018 , the U.S. military finally acknowledged publicly that the Iranian militias had gotten at least nine M1s, some of which Kurdish forces reportedly immobilized during the fighting in and around the strategic city of Kirkuk . By that time, the Pentagon insisted that the Iraqi Army had already recovered all of the tanks from the PMUs. “We have discovered incidents where some U.S.-origin equipment, including M1 Abrams tanks, came into the possession of certain PMF groups,” Eric Pahon, a U.S. spokesperson, told Military Times on Feb. 8, 2018, using another term for PMUs. “We continue to stress to the Government of Iraq, as we do to all allies and partners, their obligation to maintain U.S.-origin equipment under the operational control of the designated end-user,” he added, stressing that the United States did not support the Iranian-linked groups. In a report to Congress it released in May 2018 , the Pentagon confirmed all of the M1s were back in the custody of the Iraqi Ministry of Defense. In addition, it noted that the U.S. military had begun requiring regular reports about the tanks and their whereabouts and had put unspecified restrictions on maintenance and other support of the vehicles in order to help ensure they didn’t find their way back to the militias. A member of one of Iraq’s PMUs on the streets of Mosul in September 2017., Oliver Weiken/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP There is no indication that Russia has put any similar restrictions on who gets the T-90s or how those units employ them. By freeing the 35th Brigade of M1s, the Iraqi government may have effectively made the unit more readily able to pursue its agendas without American interference. This could be particularly important to the forthcoming Iraqi coalition government, which will almost certainly be led in part by a political bloc with Muqtada Al Sadr at its head. Parties aligned with Sadr’s Alliance Towards Reforms won a plurality of seats in the country’s parliamentary elections in May 2018, but not enough to form a government by themselves. Sadr, a Shi’ite cleric and long-time Iraqi political figure, led a militia against the American-led occupation of Iraq and continued to be a major power-broker afterward. He has strong ties himself with Iran, but has also sought to develop a more diverse set of allies inside the country and out, including taking a meeting with Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman. Iraq’s Muqtada Al Sadr, left, meets with Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman in July 2017. , Balkis Press/Sipa USA via AP Even before the election, the Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi and his administration had maintained close connections with the regime in Tehran and had begun to signal a willingness to seek partners beyond the United States and its allies. It was Abadi’s government that signed the T-90 deal with Russia. Under Abadi, Iraq has also purchased Mi-28NE Havoc gunship helicopters, Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft, Pantsir-S point air defense systems, and is now looking to buy the increasingly popular S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile system. His government has also bought advanced weapons, including light attack jets and armed drones, from China , the Czech Republic , and South Korea , in addition to acquiring more arms from the United States. Iraqi deals with Russia are only likely to grow if the Kremlin continues to prove more willing than the United States to sell more advanced weapons without significant restrictions to whoever forms the next government in Baghdad. And the Russians will almost certainly be happy to try and present themselves as an alternative to the Americans beyond just military deals at the same time. The video below offers a unique 360-degree view of one of Iraq’s Russian-made Mi-28NE gunships during a mission over Mosul in May 2017. As we at The War Zone have noted many times in the past , Russia is eager to expand its influence in the Middle East and has been keen to exploit any potential rifts between the United States and its traditional regional partners. The Kremlin under Russian President Vladimir Putin has made significant efforts to improve and expand ties with Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates , already. During the skirmish between authorities in Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government in 2017, Russia joined Iran and Turkey in siding with the former. In April 2018, officials from Iraq and Russia, along with representatives from Iran and Syria, met in Baghdad to discuss regional counter-terrorism efforts . And as time goes on, and if the immediacy of the threat from ISIS or other terrorist groups continues to recede, Iraq’s various political factions may be more inclined to pursue their agendas in general. These, in turn, may find themselves increasingly at odds with the interests of the United States and further push the two countries apart, presenting more opportunities for Russia or Iran to fill the gap. Depending on how and where its T-90s end up employed, the 35th Brigade may become one of the more visible indicators of just how much Iraq’s allegiances may or may not be shifting.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 20, 2018",The Air Force Has Grounded All Of Its B-1Bs Over A Fault In Their Ejection Seats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has grounded its entire fleet of B-1B Bone bombers due to unspecified concerns about the aircraft’s ejection seats and has no fixed timeline for when it will clear the planes to fly again. The decision comes as an investigation continues into an emergency landing involving the type in May 2018 and amid growing concerns about the readiness of the U.S. military aviation communities as a whole. U.S. Air Force General Robin Rand, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all of the service’s combat-coded bombers, ordered the so-called “stand-down” on June 7, 2018. On May 1, 2018, a B-1B bomber assigned to the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base made an emergency landing at Midland International Air and Space Port in Midland, Texas after declaring an in-flight emergency. The incident involved a fire in one of the aircraft’s engines and resulted in an emergency exit hatch coming off in mid-air. “During the safety investigation process following an emergency landing of a B-1B in Midland, Texas, an issue with ejection seat components was discovered that necessitated the stand-down,” Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all over the service’s combat-coded bombers, said in a brief statement on June 8, 2018. “As issues are resolved aircraft will return to flight.” As of May 18, the service continued to decline to say whether it had recovered the hatch or if there had been any actual malfunction in one or more of the plane’s ejection seats, according to a report from Defense News . The bomber had a standard crew of four on board during the mishap, none of whom suffered any injuries. The swing-wing bomber was not carrying any weapons, the Air Force told the Midland Reporter-Telegram at the time of the accident. Unconfirmed posts on the unofficial Amn/Nco/Snco Facebook Group said that the aircraft’s Offensive Weapon Systems officer tried to eject, which caused the hatch to come off, but that their Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES) II ejection seat failed. Additional notes indicated that the decision to make the emergency landing at Midland came after that individual became stuck and it remains unclear if the aircraft’s pilot had ordered any of the crew to eject. The United Technologies Corporation (UTC) seat is also found on the Air Force’s A-10 Warthog , B-2 Spirit , F-15C/D Eagle , F-15E Strike Eagle , F-16 Viper , and F-22 Raptor aircraft. There is no indication yet about whether or not the issue on the B-1s extends to the seats on any of those aircraft. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NvqB5kqhQEw The Air Force itself has been especially tight-lipped about the incident. Before announcing the stand-down, the last official statement had come from Dyess Air Force base on May 21, 2018. That “update” only restated information that service had already released and reiterated that the official investigation was still ongoing. But the grounding could have a significant, immediate impact on U.S. military combat operations and other activities. In April 2018, some of the Air Force’s more than 60 B-1Bs touched down at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar to take over for B-52 bombers that had been flying missions from that base. From there, the Bones have been supporting operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria and the continuing campaign against the Taliban and other insurgents in Afghanistan . A B-1B takes off from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in May 2018., USAF The B-52s had themselves taken over for the B-1Bs in 2016 when the Bones returned to the United States to receive the Integrated Battle Station upgrade . This package included updated avionics and data links, as well as a self-diagnostic test system. The Bones also regularly take part in drills and other security cooperation activities around the world, as well, including recently deploying to the United Kingdom to take part in the annual Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) exercise. This event includes air and sea training missions in and around the immensely strategic Baltic Sea . The B-1Bs, as they typically do during this drill, trained to employ air-dropped Mk 62 Quickstrike naval mines, which could be essential in limiting a hostile navy’s ability to move freely in the area during a crisis. https://youtube.com/watch?v=gmIdP3RVKWo But the in-flight emergency over Texas and the subsequent grounding has come as the U.S. Air Force, as well as the rest of the services, continue to struggle with a serious spike in aviation mishaps. So far, in 2018 alone, accidents have killed more than two dozen U.S. military aviators. There has been a slew of in-flight emergencies across the Air Force for various different reasons since the incident in Texas, but thankfully without any injuries. Many more never get reported publicly. There has been a surge in crashes, too. On May 23, 2018, a T-38C Talon jet trainer also crashed in Mississippi , but the crew was able to safely eject. This was the first Air Force crash after a WC-130H from the Puerto Rico Air National Guard came down in Georgia on May 2, killing all nine individuals on board. The Air Force says it is taking steps to investigate whether there are systemic problems at play across the service and it completed a service-wide safety review on June 6, 2018. According to Military.com , the Air Force said at least some airmen used anonymous “safety channels” to submit information, which individuals typically do out of fear of retaliation from their superiors. A B-1 sits on the ground at Al Udeid Air Base in May 2018., USAF “Air Force active-duty units have completed the Operational Safety Review announced in May, while Reserve and Guard units still have until June 25 to complete the review,” Erika Yepsen, an Air Force spokesperson, told Military.com. “The feedback will be reviewed across Air Force organizational levels – wings, major commands, as well as Headquarters Air Force.” There was no clear indication of what the review had concluded and what recommendations it might have for units across the Air Force. The Pentagon and the individual services have all repeatedly insisted that the surge in mishaps is not a broad crisis and that each individual incident is a unique confluence of factors. However, there is significant evidence to show that the Air Force and other services responded to years of budget cuts and caps by pulling funding from operations and maintenance accounts, which has had a cascading impact on readiness throughout the U.S. military. In addition, the Air Force, in particular, has been experiencing an unprecedented shortage of pilots and maintenance personnel , which can only have exacerbated the issues. “The safety of Airmen is the command’s top priority,” Air Force Global Strike Command said in its June 8, 2018 statement. “The Air Force takes safety incidents seriously and works diligently to identify and correct potential causes.” Hopefully the issues with the B-1Bs ejection seats, and any other problems the investigation into the May 1 mishap turn up, will be easy to fix and those Bone crews can get back flying safely soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 10, 2018",Kim Jong Un To Fly On A Foreign Aircraft Direct To Singapore For Summit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There has been a tremendous amount of speculation regarding Kim Jong Un’s travel plans for the historic U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore that is scheduled to begin on June 12th, just four days from now. According to new reports, it seems that Kim and his delegation will ride on a foreign aircraft to get there. South Korean news outlet Chosun noted that Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan was in North Korea on Thursday to nail down the challenging logistics surrounding the summit. Part of these discussions resulted in the decision to have the North Korean dictator and his entourage fly on a Singaporean or Chinese aircraft from Pyongyang International Airport direct to Changi Airport or a nearby airbase. Before this decision was supposedly made, it was reported that Kim would refuel in China on his way to the summit and that his North Korean aircraft would be escorted at least part of the way by Chinese fighters. North Korea’s VIP configured Il-62M., AP In recent months, the press has churned out many stories, some of them quite sensational, regarding the questionable reliability of Kim’s executive transports. The two Soviet-era Il-62M airliners’ overall abilities to convey the dictator and his team to locales far beyond the Korean Peninsula, and especially some 3,000 miles to Singapore, is widely viewed as suspect. It is also been posited that just one of these aircraft is even serviceable. Kim photographed on his remodeled Il-62 while flying over Pyongyang to survey a large construction project., North Korea State Media I have profiled Kim’s Il-62s and his other aircraft, as well as his love of aviation in general , in the past. The IL-62s have received a number of upgrades in recent years, especially to its once very dated interior. One of the jets was used most recently to fly Kim Jong Un’s sister—whose star has risen dramatically within Kim’s inner circle as of late—to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. It also flew Kim himself outside of North Korea’s borders for the very first time, providing transportation for a surprise visit to Dalian, China to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping just weeks ago. Kim arrives in Dalian, China, his first trip abroad on an airplane as premier and his second trip abroad overall., North Korean State Media That trip was very short, covering just a couple hundred miles. It also marked just the second time Kim had left the country since becoming premier. The first trip was to Beijing just two months earlier aboard an armored train . So the trip to Singapore is not just a long one for the rickety Il-62, but also for Kim and the power he wields over North Korea’s military-political apparatus, the latter being a critical but somewhat opaque issue that we recently discussed in detail . One of two Tu-204s that provide airliner service from Russia and China to Pyongyang. , Fedor Leukhin/wikicommons But the idea that Kim only has the Il-62 as an organic transportation option is nonsense. North Korea’s notoriously bad state-run airline, Air Koryo, has more modern aircraft available to move Kim about in addition to other Il-62 airliners and Il-76 transports. A pair of Tu-204s acquired in the last decade are the country’s most modern airliners in service that possess considerable range. A trip to Singapore would still likely require a fuel stop, but they would certainly be a more attractive and safer option than the old Il-62s. In recent years these aircraft have seldom flown for long periods over water or to remote or unfamiliar locations, only servicing locales in nearby Russian and China on a scheduled basis. With this in mind, relying on a foreign country’s long-range aircraft and experienced aircrew seems like a very smart move. There are risks on so many levels when it comes to Kim leaving North Korea for the controversial summit, but having his aircraft go missing could quickly spark a conflict. Using a third party’s aircraft that North Korea feels comfortable with should greatly alleviate many of his long-range transportation concerns and it would provide some insurance to the U.S. and its allies that a malfunction wouldn’t turn into a dire international crisis. Using a more modern and reliable aircraft also means that the summit, which could last a number of minutes or be extended for two days, has a better chance of starting on time to begin with. A mechanical breakdown in a foreign country with an old Russian-built aircraft could result in a delay likely measured in days not hours, not to mention a major set of security issues. At the same time, if this report proves accurate, the fact that this is being decided just now, only a few days away from the summit, underscores just how hastily it is being thrown together. And there is still no guarantee it will happen at all. We don’t know what the situation is like at home for Kim and such a distant locale definitely puts the young ruler out on a limb. According to U.S. officials , he is extremely worried about assassination attempts on his way to the summit and while in Singapore itself. So last minute cold feet remains a very real possibility. And just like everything having to do with this summit, Kim’s travel plans could change. He could simply opt to take his own aircraft even after a foreign aircraft is secured. It is also possible one of North Korea’s airliners, and even Kim’s VVIP configured Il-62, could still be used to carry advisors, security personnel, and other members of North Korea’s diplomatic team to Singapore in advance of Kim’s arrival. Regardless of the transportation details, suffice it to say that next week looks set to include one of the most interesting and suspenseful displays of geopolitical theater of our lifetimes.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 26, 2018",Marines Want Their Multi-Role Vertical Takeoff Combat Drone To Be A Flying Radar First,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has outlined seven potential mission sets for its proposed future drone, which will be much larger than the service’s existing unmanned aircraft , but will still be able to take-off from and land vertically on the deck of an amphibious assault ship. Though the plans include a wide array of tasks, the top priority is to get the Marine Expeditionary Unit its own airborne early warning capability to help it operate independently of the U.S. Navy’s Carrier Strike Groups in a high-end conflict against a potential near-peer adversary, such as Russia or China . Earlier in June 2018, the Marines held an industry day event, which was open in part to members of the press, on the status of the project, which has the painfully long official title of Marine Air Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System Expeditionary – or MUX. The Corps subsequently released additional information from the briefings on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps . The Marines envision a basic MUX air vehicle with a vertical takeoff and landing capability and the same physical footprint as a UH-1Y Venom helicopter . It would have low-observable features , including a reduced infrared signature , and ballistic protection for key components. The service wants the initial design to have a minimum internal payload capacity of 3,000 pounds, the ability to carry between 3,000 to 9,000 pounds of weapons or other stores externally, a cruising speed between 230 and 345 miles per hour, an unrefueled combat radius of 350 to 700 miles, and the ability to refuel in flight. As of June 2018, the mission sets for these aircraft are, in priority order, are airborne early warning, air reconnaissance, electronic warfare, communications relay, offensive air support, scout and aerial escort, and cargo. The Marines say the first four of these are “Tier 1,” meaning they will be a threshold requirement for the final unmanned platform. Offensive air support is in a lower priority “Tier 2” category, while the service explained that other drones might ultimately perform the scout-escort and cargo tasks. An early “operational view” of the proposed MUX and its mission sets. The Marines now say the drones may not necessarily end up being able to perform all of these roles., USMC But even within Tier one, the early warning requirement is clearly the Marine Corps’ most immediate priority. At present, U.S. Navy surface forces get this support from the E-2 Hawkeye radar planes , which can only fly from the big deck of a full sized carrier or bases on land . There had been proposals in the past for an airborne early warning version of the V-22 Osprey , which the Marines and U.K.’s Royal Navy considered , but which proved to be too expensive and complex. As such, if a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) embarked on an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), even as part of a larger Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG), wants this kind of support right now, it has to operate in close coordination with and in relative proximity to a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) or rely on support from the U.S. Air Force or an ally. A slide showing various potential V-22 missions., USN “Think about the ESG, the Amphibious Ready Group, the large-deck amphib: even if it’s up-gunned with a set of [other surface warfare] assets with Aegis radars, we are still missing an airborne early warning capability,” U.S. Marine Corps Brigadier General James Adams, who is in charge of the capabilities development directorate at Marine Corps headquarters in Washington, D.C., said at the industry day, according to USNI News . “And therefore, in the fight of the future, we are going to be tied to the carrier strike group.” In its airborne early warning configuration, the Marines want MUX to be able to be able to loiter autonomously in a designated orbit approximately 100 miles from the deck of an amphibious ship and stay on station for at least 12 hours. The drone’s primary sensor would be a radar capable of spotting and tracking aerial threats and an electro-optical sensor coupled with a data link to send that information to the ship in near-real time. A briefing slide showing a notional “typical” mission profile for a MUX in the airborne early warning configuration., USMC In addition to looking out for conventional aircraft, the industry day briefing said the goal was for the system to be able to spot drones as big as what the U.S. military calls Group 3, a category that includes the RQ-7 Shadow and RQ-21 Blackjack , as well as supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles. These are threats that many countries , and even non-state actors , are exploring and which could pose an increasingly serious danger to U.S. amphibious ships and other surface vessels in the future. Being able to extend the sensor range of the ARG or ESG and allow its components to operate across a broader area more detached from other surface task forces would be especially valuable for operations in constrained environments , where enemies might quickly appear and disappear, as well as distributed operations across a wider front. Low flying threats in particular, like cruise missiles and drones, can materialize with reduced warning as ship-based sensors are limited by line-of-sight to the horizon. A flying airborne early warning node overcomes this limitation. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency produced this concept art of a vertical take-off and landing capable maritime drone system as part of its earlier Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) program., DARPA In the Pacific region especially, Marines afloat might be faced with the prospect of operations where they could often be physically separated from other supporting assets . In addition, the Navy’s has been suffering from increasing difficulties in generating manpower and even ships for deployments, which might limit the resources available to begin with, especially when it comes to carriers . As such, the early warning MUX drone would also have a secondary electro-optical and infrared camera suite to monitor and investigate potential surface threats. A signals intelligence and electronic support measures package would give it the additional ability to locate and classify potential enemy threats based on their electromagnetic emissions. A briefing slide that gives a snapshot of the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group’s (ARG) activities in August 2017, showing how far flung its components can be just during limited operations. At that time, the ARG included the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (BAT), the landing platform dock USS Mesa Verde (MVD), and the landing ship dock USS Carter Hall (CTH), as well as the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit., USN/USMC Its onboard data link would also be able to share that information with other platforms to provide them with a better overall picture of the battlefield. Eventually, through the Navy’s plans for an overarching Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) network that links all of its ships and aircraft together, the goal is for the drone to be able to cue air-launched air-to-air missiles and ship-based surface-to-air missiles to take-down hostile targets. Tucked away in the finer points, the Marines have also suggested this version of the unmanned aircraft could carry AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range, infrared-homing air-to-air missiles to try and shoot down threats on its own. Later portions of the industry day briefing describe this as “desired” future weapons capability, as is integrating the radar-guided AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The video below provides an overview of the Navy’s Cooperative Engagement Capability concept. There is clear potential for the drones to serve as sensor nodes for more offensive strikes, even in this configuration. Using the CEC, the MUX drones could conceivably locate targets and relay that information to other platforms equipped with stand-off anti-ship or land-attack weapons. Even without the direct network connectivity, the unmanned aircraft could still allow elements of an ESG to search a larger area faster for potential threats. And the Marines have already test fired the truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) from the deck of an amphibious ship and have expressed an interest in adding either anti-sip capabilities to that system or the ships themselves . Coupled with MUX, this could give the ARG or ESG as a whole an even greater ability to engage hostile surface targets at sea and on land. The Marines are also considering giving the early warning MUX its own ability to deploy expendable drones, which could extend the range of its own sensor capabilities, and let it act as a distributed relay to feed all of that information back to the ship. The Navy is already working with Northrop Grumman on an experimental unmanned aircraft that fits inside a modified cluster munitions dispenser and the U.S. military has previously explored even smaller types that aircraft can fire from their flare dispensers. A mockup of Northrop Grumman’s concept for a small drone inside a modified cluster munitions dispenser., Northrop Grumman Brigadier General Adams said that the ability of the MUX to share targeting data with other air and surface platforms through the CEC network might lead the drone to be unarmed in all of its configurations. “So in some respects, it has an unlimited magazine because it’s the cue-er of other people’s weapons, whether it’s an SM-6 (Standard Missile) coming off a ship, or a [ Small Diameter Bomb ] coming off an F-35 [Joint Strike Fighter] – it can provide [offensive air support] cueing in the networked fight of the future,” he said, according to USNI News. The other Tier 1 MUX types all seem to focus mainly on expanding on one or more of the capabilities in the early warning configuration. The air reconnaissance variant, which the Marines say would never be armed, would replace the air search radar with a wide-area persistent surveillance camera suite and laser imaging system , but keep the other sensors and data link. Details regarding a notional mission using the MUX in the air reconnaissance configuration., USMC A standard mission profile could see the drone performing persistent surveillance over one target area up to 350 miles away for four hours before moving on to search a zone up to 400 square miles in size for threats and other objects of interest for another four hours. In the latter case, the unmanned aircraft could be scanning beachheads and landing zones for danger ahead of an amphibious assault or scouring planned overland routes for ambushes. The electronic warfare version would have a much more powerful electronic support and electronic attack system and a wide-area search radar, which could potentially include a ground moving target indicator functionality to monitor hostile movements, along with the electro-optical and infrared cameras. A key mission for this variant would be jamming enemy integrated air defenses in order to better allow F-35B Joint Strike Fighters to neutralize them. It could also help supply targeting information directly to those aircraft or elements of the ESG offshore and do so at least semi-autonomously. A possible electronic warfare mission profile for the MUX., USMC There’s no reason why MUX couldn’t provide valuable electronic warfare support to the more vulnerable elements of a Marine Expeditionary Unit’s air combat element, such as the Ospreys or its various helicopters. And in the same way that the drones make up for amphibious ships being unable to host the E-2 Hawkeye, this configuration helps makes up for the gap left by the Marine Corps’ decision not to buy the EA-18G Growler . Those aircraft would not be able to operate from the deck of an amphibious assault ship anyways. The Marines also say that Hellfire missiles and the aforementioned expandable drone capability will be threshold requirements for this type. The idea is that this would allow it to perform precision strikes against high value, time-sensitive targets by itself. One scenario the industry day briefing specifically describes is striking at militants or terrorists attempting to flee a site in a vehicle traveling at 80 miles per hour. And despite its description as a communications relay, the Marines seem to envision the last Tier type as a much more multi-purpose configuration with virtually the same systems as the air reconnaissance type and the ability to launch Hellfire missiles. Firing smaller and more cost-effective Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II ( APKWS II ) laser-guided rockets is also a “desired” capability for this type. A concept of operations for the MUX operating in the communications relay role., USMC Still, the primary goal for drones acting in this role would be to fly in a wide orbit for up to 48 hours at a time while sharing video, signals intelligence, and other data back and forth between different platforms, potentially across different waveforms. It’s not clear in this case whether a single MUX aircraft would be airborne for this entire two-day period or if the full system would perform this role, with multiple drones taking shorter shifts. With a mid-air refueling capability, a single relay aircraft could potentially stay aloft indefinitely. The Tier 2 offensive air support MUX type actually sounds very similar to this version even though it is clearly expected to be more of an actual unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) configuration. The main difference would be the mission profile, where it would work directly with MV-22s carrying Marines ashore, sharing information with those aircraft en route, and then loitering over the battlefield for the next six to eight hours providing close air support. There is the possibility the Marines could add the ability to employ Small Diameter Bombs to this variant. A notional mission plan for the Tier 2 MUX., USMC The commonality between the types is entirely by design. The Marines make it clear they’re looking for plug-and-play sensors they can rapidly swap out in the field to get MUX drones back in the air performing different missions relatively quickly. The goal is also for the unmanned aircraft’s onboard mission computers and the ship-based control equipment to readily allow for updates and improvements and have at least some features in common with other existing and planned unmanned aircraft, including the RQ-21 and the MQ-25 Stingray carrier-launched drone. Where things get more complicated is in the third tier, which includes missions the Marines suggest might require a larger or different platform from the one they have in mind for the initial MUX types. Separately, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, the service is experimenting with modified, unmanned UH-1 Huey helicopter that can fly autonomous resupply missions. The Corps has also been looking into other, much smaller unmanned systems for logistical purposes. And the Marines had originally envisioned the escort variant as something potentially as large as a pilotless Osprey and might even land and take-off like a conventional aircraft. This type could carry a much more substantial payload out to much greater ranges. The MUX may not even up fulfilling this notional Tier 3 scout mission., USMC The same goes for the cargo-carrying role., USMC There is a distinct possibility that the Marines might end up looking to the joint-service Future Vertical Lift program to fill those roles. This program is looking to develop replacements for a host of different transport and gunship helicopters across the U.S. military and could include pilot-optional configurations of those aircraft. Whether it’s for the initial MUX types or the last tier versions, The Marines could also leverage other development programs for larger, autonomous or semi-autonomous unmanned aircraft to perform those tasks. In cooperation with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Lockheed Martin developed an unmanned, verticle take-off and landing capable resupply drone concept called the Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES). Bell is also working on a pilotless companion to its new V-280 Valor tilt-rotor , called the V-247 Vigilant , which it has pitched as a multi-purpose platform. There’s also DARPA’s Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) program, which involves a Northrop Grumman air vehicle that could be suitable for the Marines’ purposes. The Marine Corps has said it is looking specifically at ARES, the V-247, and TERN for its MUX project. It’s very likely that this list will grow, though. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works is still developing a low-observable, multi-purpose drone called the Vertical Takeoff and Landing VTOL Advanced Reconnaissance Insertion Organic Unmanned System (VARIOUS). And while DARPA canceled its program based around Aurora Flight Sciences XV-24A LightningStrike electrically-powered drone in April 2018, it’s not hard to see some of that technology possibly making its way into the Marines’ MUX effort. But these third tier concepts could be a long way off. Cost factors already forced the Marine Corps to scale down their plans and could be an issue even for the Tier 1 MUX concepts. An actual artist’s concept showing the XV-24A escorting V-22s, one of the Tier 3 MUX missions., Aurora Flight Sciecnes Originally, “we wanted something that was going to be big, expensive, and probably beyond the reach of the Marine Corps,” Brigadier General Adams said during the industry day, according to Military.com . “[Something that could carry] thousands of pounds of cargo and fire long-range missiles.” The Marines say they are aiming for a unit price for each one of the drones of around $25 million. This would be similar to the price of an MQ-9 Reaper , which is approximately $22 million depending on the exact configuration. “The Navy can afford Triton,” Adams said, referring to that service’s new MQ-4C , a derivative of the U.S. Air Force’s high-flying, long-range RQ-4A Global Hawk , the first of which cost more than $100 million apiece. “We can’t afford something like that.” There is a definite potential for other services to become involved in MUX or leverage its technology, as well. The drone system could easily operate from the Navy’s carriers, especially if it uses the same control interface that service has already been developing for the MQ-25 . A US Navy MQ-4C Triton., USN A vertical take-off and landing system would also be ideally suited to land-based operations in remote locations without the benefit of even unimproved runways.  MUX’s Tier 1 configurations would all be applicable in conventional and special operations further inland . In addition, the airborne early warning and communication relay configurations could be useful to the Air Force as it considers options for replacing the aging E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management and control aircraft. A radar-carrying variant of the MUX or one with a robust data link setup could serve as one or more parts of that service’s proposed “system-of-systems” to replace the larger JSTARS planes. Regardless, there is a clear desire within the Marine Corps for a larger, multi-purpose drone system, though. The service, through the Navy, is looking into hiring contractors to fly unarmed Reapers in support of its operations in Afghanistan. There is also the possibility that it might acquire some of the MQ-1 Predators that the Air Force recently retired . These types would not be suitable for operations from the Navy’s amphibious ships, though. But more importantly, this is the latest part in a much more long-standing push by the Marine Corps to make the so-called “ Gator Navy ” of amphibious ships more of an independent force capable of complex, high-end operations. Our own Tyler Rogoway, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha, wrote extensively about what this concept could ultimately look like back in 2014 . Northrop Grumman’s concept for DARPA’s TERN program, which is reportedly now a possible contender for the Marines’ MUX project., DARPA For this to truly be viable, the Marines desperately need an organic airborne early warning aircraft. But they also need platforms for lower-end strike missions and the communication relay capability that MUX could offer, as well as an escort for the MV-22. In the latter case, this may become even more important if those aircraft take on mid-air refueling or other roles in addition to their air assault and cargo-carrying duties. Taken together, a Marine Expeditionary Unit’s air combat element might not have anywhere near the combat capability of a full Carrier Air Wing, but it could be more than enough to conduct sustained, distributed operations independently of those larger surface task forces. It could also help mitigate the expenses associated with operating even a limited number of F-35Bs from an ESG. In this light, MUX might offer an alternative way to get the added capacity offered by the “ Lightning Carrier ” or other light aircraft carrier concepts , but without the cost. The Marines are looking to see an early operational capability with MUX, essentially a more advanced prototype capable of operations during experimental exercises, by 2025. The goal is to reach initial operational capability with the system in 2028. Full operational capability across the service would come in 2034, according to the present schedule. But with the Corps having now better ironed out its basic requirements, we may start seeing more definitive concepts for what the future drones might look like very soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 5, 2021",The Army Wants New Tracked Vehicles That Will Run In Deep Snow At 50 Below,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time in more than three decades, the U.S. Army is looking to buy a purpose-built cold-weather vehicle. The requirement comes as the U.S. military as a whole is looking to increase its capability to operate in and around the immensely strategic Arctic region in response to similar developments by potential opponents, such as Russia . On June 5, 2018, the Army issued a formal request for information for a high-mobility tracked vehicle family that it is calling the Joint All Weather All Terrain Support Vehicle, or JAASV. Though they do not refer to any existing vehicles already in service, the requirements make it all but certain that this is a replacement for the aging Swedish-made Small Unit Support Vehicle (SUSV), which the service first bought in the early 1980s. According to the contracting notice, the Army wants the JAASVs to be able to be capable of operating in deep snow, as well as marshy ground and rocky and otherwise rugged terrain, all while carrying a 9-man infantry squad or similarly-sized element. It also needs to be fully-amphibious and able to cross rivers, streams, and lakes. It has to work in “extreme cold weather” conditions with temperatures of as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit. And it needs to be light enough that a UH-60 Black Hawk can carry it slung underneath. The Army also wants it to be air-portable under the larger CH-47 Chinook and inside a C-130 Hercules-type airlifter . A US Army SUSV navigates an incline., US Army Beyond that, so far, the service is asking prospective vendors to let them know how fast and big their vehicle is overall. Any company making an offer will have to be able to provide its design in four different configurations, which are general purpose, ambulance, command and control, and cargo-carrying types. With those rear-echelon utility roles in mind, the Army has only specified a need for rollover protection, rather than any defenses against enemy fire, for the vehicles. The Army previously purchased SUSVs, a version of the Hägglunds Bv206D articulated carrier, in those exact same configurations. The American versions used a 125-horsepower Mercedes OM617A in-line five-cylinder diesel engine in place of the less powerful original German-made Ford Cologne V6 gasoline engine. A US Army CH-47F carries a SUSV during a training exercise., US Army The U.S. Marine Corps subsequently acquired a number of the vehicles, as well. The “Joint” in the JAASV implies the new vehicle be for both services. In the Army, the older SUSVs primarily went to units in Alaska, though they also filtered down to National Guard elements in cold-weather and mountainous states, such as Colorado, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Marines maintained their fleet primarily to support their forward-deployed presence in Norway , as well as their own Mountain Warfare Training Center . A US Marine Corps SUSV., USMC The boxy vehicles have incredibly low ground pressure thanks to the wide, rubber band-type tracks and lightweight bodies. Over deep snow, the vehicle can exert as little as 1.8 pounds per square inch of force. A typical human male has a ground pressure of around 8 pounds when standing. The two distinct sections give them good mobility over rough and uneven terrain while still being able to carry an infantry squad or cargo. Larger, single body vehicles might get stuck in various inclined positions or have difficulty getting up and over certain obstacles. Both portions of the vehicle are powered, with a single drive chain providing power to both sets of tracks. The chassis of the front portion of a SUSV undergoing maintenance., USMC Even so, it can travel at 10 to 15 miles per hour, much faster than an individual walking and much more capable over rough, uneven ground than a fast-moving snowmobile. SUSVs have a top speed on improved roads of over 30 miles per hour and a maximum range of between 120 and 200 miles depending on the terrain. The top half of the front portion of the vehicle and the rear compartment can both come off, which makes the vehicles small enough to fit inside a CH-47. C-130s or larger cargo aircraft can also airdrop them if necessary. The modernized Bv206S model was actually low profile enough to drive straight on and off a Chinook. Italian troops load a Bv206S onto a CH-47 helicopter in Afghanistan., NATO They remain capable utility vehicles, but they’re also becoming increasingly unsupportable. In the intervening years since the Army bought the first examples, Hägglunds has changed hands numerous times and is now part of BAE Systems. It no longer makes either the Bv206D or the Bv206S at all, having replaced them in its product line with the significantly larger and more capable BvS10 . The SUSV in U.S. military service was always a niche item and often received little support and attention. For years, the Army National Guard had been one of the SUSV’s biggest supporters, since the vehicles could swim and navigate all sorts of terrain. This made them ideal for getting around during natural disasters and for rescuing stranded civilians in mountainous areas. A US Army SUSV goes for a swim., US Army In 2015, the Marines sent theirs to Production Plant Barstow at the Marine Depot Maintenance Command in Yermo, California for an overhaul. This was their first ever depot-level maintenance on the vehicles after more than two decades on the job. In 2017, the 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry took some SUSVs out on an exercise nicknamed Spartan Pegasus near the aptly named town of Deadhorse, Alaska. According to the Army’s own reporting , most of the vehicles had stopped working by the end of the drills, largely due to failed pressure pumps in the engines and dead batteries. Soldiers from 1-40th Cavalry gather near a SUSV during Spartan Pegasus in 2017., US Army 1-40th Cavalry is part of the 4th Brigade, 25th Infantry Division based further south at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. As an airborne unit, its soldiers more commonly get around using Humvees , other types of trucks, or on foot. The 2017 exercise was one of an increasing number of U.S. military drills near the Arctic Circle . Thanks in no small part to global climate change, the shrinking polar ice cap, and the steadily dropping total amount of ice that reforms in the winter months, the prospects for competition and conflict over the region have only increased. A SUSV belonging to a special “Snow Response Team” of the Colorado Army National Guard with a police-style light bar on top., CO ARNG The Arctic holds immense natural resources and serves as an increasingly viable international trade route and numerous countries, especially Russia , have been particularly keen to stake their claims. The Kremlin is dramatically expanding its military and civil presence above the Arctic Circle and has been buying increasing amounts of ships , combat vehicles , and other equipment specifically suited to the environment. JAASV is almost certainly a response to the same security concerns and while there are no plans for combat-centric designs as of yet, the new tracked vehicles will provide important additional mobility for any units operating in the frigid cold. The ability to rapidly insert them via helicopter or fixed wing aircraft could at least help units get closer to their objective faster in a more serious contingency even if they would likely dismount before any final assault. In the same way, it could also help support conventional scout and special operations units on reconnaissance missions. As such, the new vehicles will almost certainly have to have at least as good performance as the older SUSVs. If the program proceeds, the most obvious choice for the Army would likely be the BvS10, which remains in production. A Black Hawk sling-loads half of an SUSV during training in Alaska. , US Army In 2016, BAE Systems also unveiled a further improved version, the Beowulf , at the annual National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS) symposium with a clear eye toward pitching the vehicle to the Army. Beowulf has a top speed of over 40 miles per hour and a range of at least 250 miles, while remaining air portable slung under a CH-47 helicopter. UH-60s would carry it in two halves with troops reassembling it after it arrives at the destination, which the Army trains to do with its existing SUSVs. The BvS10s are also combat proven, having made trips to Afghanistan with the U.K. Royal Marines, British Army, and Dutch Marines. The Netherlands also sent them to Chad to support peacekeeping efforts there. The Italians have deployed older Bv206S types to Afghanistan, as well, while the Swedes have sent their S models to countries in Africa. It proves the point that these vehicles might have added utility beyond the Arctic and in entirely non-combat roles, as well. The carrier’s ability to cross rocky and sandy terrain means it’s just as much at home in Central Asia or Africa as it is in the Far North. British Army troops in Vikings in Afghanistan in 2009., Crown Copyright The British vehicles, known as Vikings, have received up-armored weapon stations and slat-armor to help defeat rocket-propelled grenades to make them more capable of performing routine patrol duties. A mount for a machine gun above the main cab was always standard on the Bv206S and BvS10 and some operators even turned them into carriers for TOW missiles and other heavy weapons . Otherwise, the Army has few other options when it comes to articulated carriers. ST Kinetics in Singapore offers the Bronco , while Finland’s Sisu sells the Nasu , both of which are visually similar to the BvS10, though they completely different designs. The other major manufacturers of these types of vehicles are in Russia , putting them off limits to the U.S. military. ST Kinetics might be best positioned to challenge BAE. In 2015, the company, in cooperation with defense contractor SAIC, won a deal worth around $100 million to build prototypes of one of the two vehicles the Marines are now considering as part of their Amphibious Combat Vehicle 1.1 program. The two firms have teamed up again to compete for the Army’s new light tank program . An ST Kinetics Bronco., Limkopi via Wikimedia It is also possible that the Army could ditch the articulated carrier concept entirely and pursue a more traditional type of tracked vehicle with a single body . Beyond the service’s desire for the design to be tracked, there is no requirement for it to be in one configuration or another. It will be interesting to see what the service eventually considers to replace the worn SUSVs. The request for information says any company interested in submitting an offer has to do so by June 21, 2018. So we may not have to wait long to see the initial proposals.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 13, 2018","It Takes 41,500 Hours Of Labor To Build A Single F-35A According To New Report","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first of the UK’s F-35Bs arrived at RAF Marham today to much fanfare. It was a big, long-awaited milestone not only for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, but also for the F-35 program. Meanwhile the U.S. Government Accountability Office, better known as the GAO, has released a new report on the status of the F-35 program overall. One of the most interesting tidbits in the report was metrics on how many man hours of labor it takes to manufacture each type of F-35 and how those numbers have changed over time. The chart below shows exactly how many labor hours are poured into constructing each F-35 variant on average. With the A model unsurprisingly being the lowest at 41,541 hours in 2017, the more complex B model taking 57,152 hours, and the carrier-capable C model coming in at 60,121 hours. GAO These numbers generally vibe with the differential in cost of each type as well. But what’s most intriguing is just how much these metrics have decreased over time, underlining that Lockheed has found meaningful efficiencies on the F-35 production line in recent years. Over a five year period of time, the labor it took to assemble a single F-35A dropped by a whopping 62 percent. This is skewed somewhat due to the number of airframes ordered in 2012 compared to 2017, but the between 2016 and 2017 alone the same metric dropped an impressive 12 percent. This is a considerable change for just one year and tells an important story when it comes to the maturity of the F-35’s design compared to 2012. The GAO report states: These improvements in airframe manufacturing efficiency indicate that manufacturing processes are stabilizing and coming under control, and production capability is improving. Lockheed Martin has delivered a total of 266 aircraft to DOD and international partners. As of January 2018, 170 aircraft were in production worldwide, an increase of 20 percent from January 2017. As Lockheed Martin gained more production experience, the average hours needed to produce an aircraft decreased, as shown in figure 6. The line of best fit, shown below, is calculated to help visualize a trend in the rate of change in the data. GAO The average hours needed for rework and repair of aircraft already delivered is still a major issue , but it is also receding, with a change of 70 percent between 2012 and 2017, and 20 percent between 2016 and 2017. Once again, it’s still taking a whopping 6,237 hours of labor to correct production mistakes on each brand new jet. In many cases, this means those aircraft are being pulled from the fleet to receive corrective measures, and at great cost, but at least that number seems to be heading somewhat in the right direction. The F-35 assembly line in Fort Worth, Texas. , Lockheed Martin The report described the drop as a good thing, but it notes that it doesn’t take into account another looming issue that could drastically impact these metrics: According to Lockheed Martin, the rate of quality defects discovered per aircraft delivered has declined 21 percent from 2016 to 2017. However, this metric will likely be affected next year due to a recent discovery of a fault in the production process. Specifically, according to Defense Contract Management Agency officials, in September 2017 Lockheed Martin halted deliveries of aircraft after the Air Force identified corrosion between the aircraft’s surface panels and the airframe because Lockheed Martin did not apply primer when the panels were attached. According to the program office, the Defense Contract Management Agency, Lockheed Martin, and program office subject matter experts are investigating the impact on aircraft that have been delivered without the primer, and estimate that repairs may take between 30 to 40 days per aircraft at a cost that is yet to be determined. More than 270 aircraft have been identified as lacking the necessary primer as of February 2018. According to the program office, responsibility for the costs associated with this issue has not been negotiated. Meanwhile, delivery of aircraft resumed in October 2017. All three F-35 variants fly together in formation near Eglin AFB in Florida. , USAF The F-35 has been flying for over 11 years and has been a constant source of delays and weakening requirements , but these figures do indicate a design whose production process is finally maturing. This reality is also reflected in unit price declines, which is a good thing. Yet at the same time, it also underscores just how ridiculously far-fetched Lockheed’s original timelines and fiscal goals were for the program. As far as the question of how the F-35’s labor hours for production compares to other aircraft, we are having a tough time answering it definitively at this time, at least with fresh data. But according to an archived POGO report , an F-16A took 29,000 man hours to produce in 1984, and the more complex and relatively new F-16C took 45,000 man hours to build in 1989. That same source noted that just the F-22’s center fuselage section took 60,000 man hours to assemble when the program was in its pre-production state in the late 1990s. This was mainly due to the 60,000 fasteners that were used on the section, each of which was installed by hand taking roughly 30 minutes to an hour. The F-16 production line in Fort Worth, Texas. It is now being moved to South Carolina . , Paul Chesley-Getty Images So with just these metrics in hand, the F-35 program doesn’t seem to be gobbling up labor at an astronomical rate, especially considering its low-observable design, which are historically very expensive to produce. The fact of the matter is that all aircraft take a lot of time to build. Even during World War II, when the fate of Britain hung in the balance, it took a whopping 13,000 man hours to build a single Spitfire Mk V. In contrast, it took the Germans 4,000 hours to build a Me109G. We found the chart below in the forums at WW2Aircraft.net and we can’t confirm its accuracy, but it seems to be a good comparative snapshot of the time it took to build other WWII aircraft. You will notice the massive delta in efficiency just over a single war year for all the types stated: WW2Aircraft.net B-24 Liberator assembly line., USAF The real question is how many man hours does it take to produce a competing modern fighter, in particular, the F/A-18 Super Hornet. We reached out to Boeing this morning for that data, but have yet to hear back. We will update the post if and when we get those numbers. But the GAO report is not all good news. The F-35 still has a massive number of unresolved issues that have no sign of being fixed before the decision to enter into full-rate production is made. The report states: To complete the F-35 development program without further delays, the program office plans to defer resolving—to fix or have an approved work around—a portion of the known deficiencies to post-development efforts. During testing, issues identified with the aircraft’s performance are reported to the program office as deficiencies, which are then categorized based on how severely the deficiency impacts the aircraft’s performance. Category 1 deficiencies are those that could jeopardize safety, security, or another critical requirement. Category 2 deficiencies are those that could impede or constrain successful mission accomplishment. According to program office officials, in early 2017 the program office determined that not all open deficiencies found in developmental testing could be resolved within the cost and schedule of the development contract. As a result, the program office and the military services reviewed all open deficiencies and determined that about 30 percent of them needed to be resolved before completing development. According to program officials, some of the remaining deficiencies will be resolved through post-development contracts and not on the baseline development contract. While the program office’s plans for resolving deficiencies remain in flux, officials told us that some are expected to be resolved on future contracts and not through the existing development contract. DOD officials have stated that the program will hold a summit later this year to determine who will be responsible for the costs associated with resolving the remaining deficiencies. As of January 2018, the F-35 program had 966 open deficiencies—111 category 1 and 855 category 2. At least 25 category 1 deficiencies and 165 category 2 deficiencies will not be resolved before full-rate production. See table 2 for a breakdown of deferred category 1 deficiencies by the system affected. According to program officials, it is time to complete the development program as all capabilities have met threshold requirements and are on track to be delivered. Therefore, they told us that it is reasonable to continue resolving deficiencies while in production. The program officials stated that the proposed approach for resolving deficiencies is still under consideration and has not been approved. DOD’s acquisition instruction, however, states that critical deficiencies identified in testing are to be resolved before proceeding beyond low-rate initial production or limited deployment, except as specifically approved by the program’s milestone decision authority. This policy states that identifying and correcting deficiencies early is less costly than resolving deficiencies later in the acquisition process. GAO The report went on to discuss a variety of other issues and topics, including the pitfalls of the F-35’s proposed Block 4 enhancements, as well as the fact that the F-35 has seen little to no improvement in its fairly dismal reliability and maintainability and that it will likely miss a number of threshold requirements relating to those issues before the decision to enter into full-rate production is made. In the end the GAO recommended the following: Direct the F-35 program office to resolve all critical deficiencies before making a full-rate production decision. Direct the F-35 program office to identify what steps are needed to ensure the F-35 meets reliability and maintainability requirements before each variant reaches maturity and update the Reliability and Maintainability Improvement Program with these steps. Whether the Pentagon will end up actually keeping the F-35 in ‘purgatory’ low-rate initial production status until its bevy of critical issues is fixed, we will have to wait and see, especially considering the White House has had a heavy sway over the program since President Trump took office 501 days ago.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Very few details are available so far, but some in a tracked command vehicle is has led Virginia State Police on a medium-speed chase south of the state’s capital, Richmond. There’s no information available yet about who’s driving the vehicle or where it came from. At around 9:00 PM EST on June 5, 2018, video emerged of the chase in progress on U.S. Route 460 in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. The vehicle, either an M577- or M1068-series armored command vehicle in an overall sand color, with police in front and behind, clearly attempting to keep innocent bystanders out of the way. The M577s and M1068s are based on the M113 family of armored personnel carriers, but feature a notably larger rear compartment that allows individuals to stand up and move around. The vehicles typically carry a large communications suite to keep commanders in contact with various echelons at once. An unconfirmed post on Twitter suggested that an individual had stolen the vehicle from Fort Pickett , a Virginia Army National Guard facility just over 40 southwest of Richmond near the city of Blackstone. The site is home to the Fort Pickett Maneuver Training Center, which routinely hosts armored training events, as well as other types of drills. Update: 7:10pm PST— The suspect that was driving the stolen armored vehicle has been apprehended. Nothing more is known about how he was taken into custody aside from the fact that he surrendered. His identity remains unknown at this time. Update: 7:20pm PST— Closer examination of the videos appears to indicate that the vehicle is an M577 based on the number of antenna guards on its roof. The M577s typically have more of these fixtures than the M1068s. A drawing of an M577A3 from an official US Army technical manual., US Army A drawing of an M1068 from the same manual., US Army Update: 12/6/2018, 7:30am PST— The Virginia State Police has still not named the suspect, but has now said that the chase covered a total of approximately 60 miles before the driver apparently came to a stop after hitting a curb. As we surmised, unable to stop the vehicle themselves, they said they chose to escort the M577 to keep bystanders safe. Despite initial reports that suggested the individual had surrendered to police willingly, the Associated Press has since reported that police officered used a dog and a taser to subdue the suspect after they exited the vehicle and began walking around. Images have no emerged of the M577 after the incident had come to an end.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 25, 2018",Journalists Had A Surprise Close Encounter With An RQ-170 Sentinel At Vandenberg AFB,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reporters and photographers were invited out to Vandenberg AFB on Monday to take a closer look at the ICON spacecraft installed aboard a Pegasus rocket, which itself was mounted on Orbital ATK’s L1011 launch aircraft Stargazer . After completing their task they headed back toward the base’s main hangar and were surprised to see something of an almost mythical mechanical creature sitting on the ramp—an RQ-170 Sentinel. The base, which is perched along the Southern California coast, was once set to host a second Space Shuttle launch site , but today it usually sends reconnaissance payloads into high-inclination orbits and conducts ICBM test launches . But the facility has other uses as well, and its long runway is an attractive training feature for California-based military aircraft. Although no squadron of aircraft officially calls the base home, a detachment of secretive RQ-170 Sentinels from the shadowy 30th Reconnaissance Squadron uses the base for testing. This little-known fact was first discovered by our own Joseph Trevithick and it became big news when our contributor Matt Hartman photographed a specially configured Sentinel landing at the base in 2017—a rare encounter that The War Zone was the first to report . Hartman’s image of an RQ-170 specially configured for testing making its approach to Vandenberg AFB back in March of 2017., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Hartman had yet another close encounter of the RQ-170 kind on Monday as he was one of the journalists in the van that got what has to be the closest view of a Sentinel by the press—a seemingly unplanned encounter that ended up being the highlight of the visit. Matt describes the experience as such: “Yesterday was supposed to be a standard day. Show up, check in, get a pass, and load into the van, but it ended with a fantastic surprise. My mission was photographing Orbital ATK’s Lockheed L-1011 ‘Stargazer’ aircraft which was configured to launch NASA’s ICON satellite into space. Our USAF escorts issued the standard rules about no photography or videography while in transit to the media area for our shoot. After an hour of shooting the jet and its space-faring payload out of the base’s expansive apron, we pack up into our media van for the trip back to the public parking area. Under USAF escort we departed the flight line and head to the gate. Upon turning eastbound on the flight line along the main taxiway, sitting in front of the southern side of the main hangar was something spectacular, it was as if I was seeing a ghost. I said nothing, my colleague in the van also saw it and jabbed me trying to figure out if what we were seeing was indeed really what we both thought it appeared to be. We kept driving towards it. By then every journalist in the van was seeing what lay ahead and we all knew we were about to get a very special, albeit seemingly unplanned look at the Skunk Works’ history-making stealth drone. As we rolled by just dozens of feet away, the RQ-170 was sitting there on the flight line with a power cart next to it and a few people milling around it. Its jet inlet looked to have almost a brass or gold-like finish under direct overhead sunlight. Unlike the patch-work cream and black toned Sentinel I had photographed on approach to the base the year before, this one was wearing a dark grey low-visibility scheme on top with lighter gray on the bottom. It also lacked the big flight test data boom that the other one had installed. Overall it looked like a far more operationally relevant configuration of the famed “Beast of Kandahar.” We just silently starred in awe as we rolled past it and continued on to the main gate where we were sent on our way. The cameo appearance of the Sentinel was never even addressed.” The only known official image released of the RQ-170 obtained by our own Joseph Trevithick via FOIA. It shows a uniquely configured RQ-170 on the apron at Andersen AFB in Guam. TO BE CLEAR, this was NOT taken at Vandenberg AFB on June 4th, 2018, but years ago and obtained via FOIA. , DoD/USAF via FOIA So there you have it, even after a decade in the public domain, the RQ-170 remains an elusive flying machine indeed. But a lucky few reporters and photographers got the closest look yet of one on Monday. Seeing as at least one of the Sentinel’s evolutionary forebearers has recently been declassified , maybe the RQ-170 will emerge from the ‘gray world’ and into the light in the not so distant future. And who knows what other derivatives of the Sentinel may exist by now . Until then, we will just have to keep our eyes peeled.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 24, 2019",Use Of Raider Moniker For Modern Special Ops Marines Was Hotly Contested Internally,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When the U.S. Marine Corps established its special operations component in 2006, the new Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, or MARSOC, immediately wanted to create a link between itself and the Marine Raiders, a storied, specialized commando force from World War II. But military forces are, as a general rule, steeped in history and lore with complex and often pedantic rules and regulations to uphold those traditions and the honors that come along with them and new documents show the service’s own historians were vehemently opposed to the idea. In August 2014 , then Commandant of the Marine Corps General James Amos announced he had finally approved the decision to rename all of the units under Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, or MARSOC, as Marine Raiders. The Marine Special Operations Battalions became Marine Raider Battalions, for example, while the Marine Special Operations Regiment turned into the Marine Raider Regiment. The original Marine Raiders came into existence in 1942 to support operations against the Japanese during World War II, before becoming the 4th Marine Regiment in 1944. “MARSOC is the modern-day embodiment of the Marine Raiders of World War II,” U.S. Marine Corps Captain Barry Morris, then a spokesman for the command, said in a statement at the time, according to Marine Corps Times . “We feel we owe it to those Marine Raiders still alive and their families to make every attempt” to maintain their legacy. Behind closed, doors, however, at least two official Marine Corps historians – including one from MARSOC’s own history office – had been apoplectic about the name change. They registered their complaints in writing, which we at The War Zone only recently obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request that dates back to 2015. Censors redacted both individuals’ names for privacy reasons. A Marine Raider, at left, together with other U.S. and foreign special operators forces during a demonstration as part of the annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference in May 2018., USAF “MARSOC claims to the Raider title are based on a perceived legacy that is largely mythological,” the command’s historian wrote in an information paper dated June 2, 2014. “MARSOC has no claim to the Raiders’ lineage and honors, which are currently held by organizations that were formed directly from the original Raider battalions.” To rewind quickly, the World War II-era Marine Raiders themselves have almost as much claim to controversy as combat achievements. Formed just over two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt had personally ordered the Marines to create the specialized units over the service’s not inconsequential protests. A Marine Raider in a dive tank gestures to a civilian wearing a Raider-themed t-shirt during a public demonstration., USMC U.S. Army Colonel William “Wild Bill” Donovan , then in charge of the clandestine Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and who became the chief post-war architect of the Central Intelligence Agency , and U.S. Marine Corps Major Evans Carlson , were both instrumental in the Raider proposal. Carlson was a veteran of the “ Punitive Expedition ” to kill or capture Mexican rebel Pancho Villa and one of the numerous American interventions in Nicaragua . He had gone on to serve in China, where he closely studied the tactics of Communist forces fighting the Japanese in the 1930s. Donovan and Carlson strongly believed there was a unique value in crafting small raiding parties to harass the enemy behind the front lines, forcing them to divert resources to handle the incursions and protect key locations. U.S. Navy Admiral Chester Nimitz, who became head of the Pacific Fleet immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack, was also eager to get “commando” units to attack lightly defended Japanese island outposts. U.S. Marine Corps Major Evans Carlson., USMC Between 1942 and 1944, the Marine Raiders, which eventually consisted of four full battalions organized into a single regiment, were a key part of operations, particularly during the island-hopping campaigns across the Central Pacific. They also became well known for experimenting with new fighting doctrine and tactics, as well as weapons and equipment, including camouflage uniforms . But despite the success of the Raiders, Carlson proved to be a divisive figure within the Marine Corps. He had active connections with Communist and Leftist groups, which he had established to solicit aid for China in its fight against the Japanese. Marine Raiders at Bougainville in the Solomon Islands in January 1944, shortly before the Marines renamed the units as elements of the 4th Marine Regiment., NARA The Marine Corps Major had brought the service’s now widely known mantra “ Gung Ho ” back from China, where Communist insurgents rallied under the slogan “ gōnghé ,” which literally translates to “work together.” He espoused lessons inspired in no small part by what he had seen in his travels with Mao Tse Tung and Zhou Enlai. The Marine officer also imparted a concept of “ ethical indoctrination ” on units under his command, which emphasized the role of non-commissioned officers in helping commissioned officers. The Marine Corps saw this in part as encouraging lower ranking personnel to question superiors and their orders. For the service’s senior leadership, the Raiders represented an organization within an organization, which they found almost completely antithetical to their own experience. The insignia of the modern day Marine Raider Regiment, at left, which features the Chinese characters for “ gōnghé,” and the original World War II insignia, at right., USMC/Wikimedia “The Marine Corps has always felt that its infantry elements are essentially raiders and that the Pacific conditions are different from the European which resulted in the establishment of commandos,” the Pacific Section of the War Plans Division within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations explained in a memo in 1943. “It would like to end its raider program so as to make all infantry organizations uniform and to avoid setting up some organizations as elite or selected troops.” In 1944, the service won out, transforming the Raiders into the 4th Marine Regiment. Carlson died in 1947, escaping what would almost certainly have been serious post-war scrutiny over his leftist activities. Though the Marine Raiders have become a fixture in popular culture since World War II, the Marine Corps’ mixture of ambivalence and open hostility to the organization never really went away. The Marines rejected MARSOC’s request to use the name in 2006 and again in 2011. Before then, the service had fought against the idea of sending personnel off to form its own dedicated special operations entity for decades , arguing that its units were already “ special operations capable ,” essentially the same logic it had used to oppose the Raiders. Members of Marine Corps Special Operations Command Detachment One, the predecessor to Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, circa 2003., Patrick J. Rogers via USMC “Your allegiance, your loyalty … is to the Marine Corps, based on the title you have on your uniform,” Amos reportedly told a gathering of other generals in 2011. “He made it clear that the tie, the connection to our past is absolutely important to him, but we’re not going to name a unit by some naming convention – any unit in the Marine Corps – because we’re Marines first,” Brigadier General David Berger, director of operations at Marine Corps headquarters, told Marine Corps Times after that event. MARSOC’s historian went so far as to cite the 1943 War Plans Division memo detailing opposition to the original Raiders in explaining their own reticence to the idea. They also reiterated that the Raider legacy already lived on in the Marine Corps, with the 4th Marine Regiment. “The Raider name went away, but these Marines fought on under the Fourth Marines’ colors,” they noted. “I have studied, taught, and written history for three decades, and while I am familiar with the battles they fought in, I have never encountered the glamorization of the Raiders that one encounters at MARSOC. Frankly, it is based on a misinterpretation of history that is so far-fetched it borders on fabrication.” “Discussions with younger Staff Noncommissioned Officers reveal that they believe the Raider tradition has been passed on to MARSOC through the Reconnaissance community,” they continued. “However, I can find nothing to substantiate this claim beyond word of mouth/social media examples.” Marine Raiders train with AK-type rifles during a foreign weapon familiarization course., USMC This individual got another jab in at other units already using the “Raider” name without official sanction. In these cases, it appeared to be linked to the Marine Corps’ use of the term “raid” for various types of operations. Marine Expeditionary Units now train to employ so-called “ Maritime Raid Forces ” for limited missions, such as boarding ships at sea or securing objectives ashore. “I should add that MARSOC is not the only Marine Corps organization currently claiming the Raider title – it seems to have come into common use among Marine Expeditionary Unit companies trained to perform small boat operations,” the historian wrote, suggesting they were talking about one of these elements. “A video posted on You Tube [sic] depicts one unit using the title “Blackfoot Raiders.” Having lived in Montana, I can assure you that the Blackfeet did indeed conduct raids – but mounted on horses, not in rubber boats.” The video below is very likely the one the MARSOC historian was referring to in their information paper. The second document we obtained, which is undated, but appears to have come after the decision to change the names within MARSOC, makes many of the same arguments about the 4th Marines’ history. This second individual, a member of the service’s central History Division, also brought up how this would create a problem from the well-established, if obtuse rules about how honors get passed from one unit to another. “Lineage and honors cannot be shared by two units, nor can lineage and honors be arbitrarily changed,” they declared. “The Fourth Marines have far more than a tenous [sic; tenuous] “claim” on the lineage and honors of the World War II Raider battalions. The MCBUL [Marine Corps Bulletin] 5400, released in January 2015, which ordered the redesignation of the MARSOC units, also states that the lineage and honors will remain with the 4th Marines.” This last part is both true and notable. When Amos finally gave in, after substantial pressure from private groups such as the Marine Raider Association & Foundation , he approved the name change, but made clear that 4th Marines still “own” the historical achievements of the World War II Raiders. The two historians do differ in their conclusions. The individual at MARSOC continued to push against renaming the special operations elements as “Raiders,” arguing “that the title Marine is sufficient to mark this Command as unique in Special Operations.” Marine Raiders train to operate all-terrain vehicles., USMC The record from the Marine Corps History Division ultimately cedes the argument given that Amos had already made his decision. “One can certainly appreciate the desire by Marine Corps leadership to pay homage to the Raiders of World War II,” they wrote. “One can also understand the desire to keep that storied name alive, and part of the Marine Corps lexicon, a name that has come to symbolize hard training and hard fighting,” it continues. “With the redesignation of the MARSOC units, that desire has been fulfilled.” Since then, the new Marine Raiders have joined other U.S. special operations forces in important missions around the world, including in Iraq, Syria , and Afghanistan . We don’t know whether MARSOC’s history office still thinks the name change was the wrong decision, but they’re undoubtedly focused more on documenting the new achievements of the modern Raider Battalions.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 23, 2018",Image Of China’s Stealthy ‘Dark Sword’ Fighter-Like Combat Drone Emerges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have talked in-depth about how China is barreling forward with advanced unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) development—and this is just based on what the Chinese government wants us to see. Now a new photo has surfaced that appears to show a full-sized ‘Dark Sword’ UCAV. The concept has been talked about and shown in renderings and models for over a decade and a subscale remote controlled demonstrator was supposedly flown as well. But this is the first time evidence of a far more mature and substantive iteration of Dark Sword has been seen. Dark Sword, which originates from Shenyang Aircraft Corporation , has a low observable (stealthy) configuration that differs drastically from more common flying-wing advanced unmanned aircraft designs. Whereas those are optimized for endurance, altitude performance, broadband low observability, and payload, Dark Sword is designed for sustained speed and agility. Dark Sword has been around in concept form since the mid-2000s, and supposedly a sub-scale demonstrator has been tested, but nothing as elaborate or mature as what is seen in the most recent photo. , UAVglobal.com/Chinese Internet Past renderings depict a conical planform with lifting-body attributes. Non-maneuvering, but possibly retractable canard foreplanes are present on its nose section. A wide, splayed tail section with canted vertical stabilizers and swept wings round out the rest of the design and a single-engine is fed by a sharp, forward-swept, chin-mounted intake. This new image appears to feature a real-life, practical interpretation of the Dark Sword concept using proven low-observable design elements that have been flown on other Chinese stealthy aircraft designs. Most notable is the presence of a Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI). You can read all about this technology in this past feature of mine , but suffice it to say it was minted by Lockheed here in the United States in the 1990s and is a key feature on the F-35, yet China has run with the concept to an even greater degree. Currently, China’s J-20 and J-31 stealth fighters leverage DSI technology, as does the latest variants of the JF-17 export fighter. It has even been incorporated on the second iteration of the J-10, the PLAAF’s ‘bread and butter’ multi-role 4th generation fighter. DSI was patented by Lockheed and tested on an F-16 in the min 1990s before ending up on the F-35. Today, China uses it on a slew of fighter aircraft like the J-10B seen on the left. , Lockheed Martin/Chinese Internet A DSI allows for supersonic flight without the use of complex maneuvering ramps that slow air to subsonic speeds before it hits the engine face. It also removes boundary layer air from the aircraft’s fuselage, providing the engine with stable and consistent airflow throughout the aircraft’s flight envelope without the necessity of non-stealthy splitter plates and other structures. Finally, it provides for radar cross-section reduction in multiple ways. First off, by not needing the aforementioned elaborate splitter planes and maneuvering ramps or bleed air doors which are not conducive to low-observability on the RF spectrum. The DSI’s ‘bulge’ and upturned leading edge also help to obscure the highly reflective engine face incoming radar waves. The presence of a DSI on a more mature and full-scale version of Dark Sword is telling as it gives us a firmer idea of the aircraft’s performance. DSIs allow for supersonic flight up to about Mach 2. This fact helps dispel a lot of the erroneous and far-fetched rumors about Dark Sword, including that it is some sort of hypersonic super-weapon, which simply isn’t the case. In addition, saw-tooth edges can be seen on the Dark Sword’s gear doors, which look very similar to the J-20’s setup. Sawtooth edges and edge alignment, in general, are design elements that have been used since the dawn of stealth to minimize radar reflectivity where there are seams and operating fissures on a stealthy aircraft’s skin. This is an especially useful design element when it comes to optimizing a stealthy aircraft to evade X-Band and similar fire control radars, or at least to deny their ability to attain an engagement quality track. A high-speed tactical UCAV design like Dark Sword would prioritize low-observable design optimization in just such a way as it trades high-performance for broadband stealth against a wider range of radar operating bands. Its tail surfaces and other elements are already less than optimal when it comes to evading lower-frequency radars, but considering its speed, optimizing survivability against air-to-air and common ground-based fire control radars is most important. The airframe also seems to wear a silver paint job similar to what the now operational J-20 wears . This includes lighter grey edges where composite low-observable structures are fitted or where embedded antennas are installed. Whether this is just representative or an actual feature of a working design remains unknown. Maybe the best image of the J-20 as of late. , Chinese Television So, in essence, what we have here is stealthy unmanned airframe that can likely supercruise (fly faster than the speed of sound without the use of afterburner), or at least its design intends to do so dependent on available engine technology and hit top speeds up to around Mach 2. Such an aircraft would be especially well suited for making supersonic dashes across the Taiwan Strait during a conflict as opposed to flying medium or long-endurance surveillance missions. It’s also possible that the design could also be intended to find its way to China’s upcoming catapult and barrier equipped aircraft carriers. Whether based on land or at sea, Dark Sword appears to be uniquely well suited to operate under a ‘ loyal wingman’ or ‘tethered’ concept of operations in addition to an independent one. Under such a setup, Dark Sword would be able to speed ahead of manned fighters on command to collect data and targeting information, or even engage targets itself. Such a capability would be useful to stealthy and non-stealthy manned fighters alike. But for the latter, it could be a huge force multiplier, providing high-end counter-air defense and strike capability without the cost of procuring droves of high-end stealthy manned fighters. What we don’t know is if the aircraft shown in the photo is an elaborate mockup, an actual flying article, or something in between. We also don’t know when the photo was taken as it is more likely than not the project is much farther along now than what is indicated by the image. Remember, the Chinese show us only what they want to. Above all else, this development serves as another reminder of how China is surging ahead when it comes to advanced unmanned combat aircraft capabilities, while the U.S. acts as if the concept doesn’t even exist even after it proved to be a game-changing breakthrough a decade and a half ago. Without a doubt, there is development being done in the classified realm on advanced unmanned systems, but at this stage, that is problematic in itself, especially when it comes to providing significant funding for such programs, as the very concept relies on volume of airframes above all else. It also makes tailoring an air combat fighting doctrine to accommodate such an awesome shift in capabilities nearly impossible, which is hugely wasteful and even negligent as it deeply impacts procurement decisions. It’s not worth relitigating this complex and multi-faceted but seldom talked and highly misunderstood issue in this article as we have explained it in great depth before. You can access that feature here . In the end military culture, big business that serves it, and other special interests at play within the defense-industrial complex have kept advanced unmanned combat aircraft at bay seemingly to protect existing manned programs, at least in terms of having major defense programs of record. Yet they will all have to come to terms with the fact that manned platforms are not the future of aerial warfare and our enemies could care less about existential debates about the ethics of unmanned and autonomous weaponry. At this point, it is quite possible that the Pentagon will be caught off-guard by its potential enemies’ ingenuity when it comes to this technology in the same way they were by far less advanced weaponized hobby-like drones. That was another capability many of us were screaming about for years , with those warnings apparently falling on deaf ears among the Pentagon’s decision makers until the threat had become all too palpable . Oh, and swarms of small drones is another area where China is rushing forward developmentally . Let’s not let history repeat itself again as peer states with mature, high-end, penetrating tactical drone capabilities is far more frightening strategically speaking than some thug jihadis with quadcopters that can drop improvised grenades.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",There Is A Magical Place Called Bomber Camp Where B-17s And B-24s Still Drop Bombs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The high-end military adventure entertainment business has grown from an anomaly to a cottage industry. Flying in a MiG to the upper atmosphere, taking to the skies for mock air combat, crushing through a building in a tank, and going to special operations and spy camps are just some of these exotic opportunities that affluent individuals can take part in. Another adventure like none other has been added to that list—experiencing a full recreation of a World War II bombing mission, including the actual bomb dropping part. Here’s ‘Bomber Camp’s’ pitch for prospective customers, which includes being a crewman on a B-17 Flying Fortress or B-24 Liberator: “Are you looking for a Call of Duty experience, but for real? Do you remember watching the movies Twelve O’clock High or Memphis Belle? Have you ever imagined what it would be like to fly your own mission in a legendary B-17 Flying Fortress or a B-24 Liberator? Young or old you can live your dream at Bomber Camp! Bomber Camp is much more than a “fantasy camp”. It is an immersive WWII living history experience allowing you to step back in time to train for a bombing mission and then to fly it, for real. You will experience sights, sounds, and smells that few others have known, and gain a greater appreciation for the men and women of the “greatest generation”. This year’s Bomber Camp offers a more affordable one-day program. You will attend classes in the morning, have a GI lunch in the mess tent, fly your bombing mission in the afternoon, and relax in the officers’ club after mission debrief. This once in a lifetime opportunity can be yours. Enlist now!” According to Bomber Camp’s website, the idea behind the interactive experience was originated a decade ago by Taigh Ramey, the founder of Stockton Field Aviation Museum . Over the last decade, the concept evolved dramatically, with different World War II reenactors being added to deepen the experience. The Collings Foundation’s WWII era B-17G, B-24J, B-25, and P-51, as well as a PV-2D and other assorted planes, have been integrated into the program. Bomber Camp Facebook page ‘Enlistees’ arrive at Stockton Field in the morning and receive a basic orientation and they then begin their gunnery and bombardier training classes in a mock WWII camp—period specific crew apparel provided. The gunnery classes include how to operate the aircraft’s Browning 50 caliber machine guns and how to employ the bomber’s turrets. Bombing instruction includes the fundamentals of hitting targets with once top-secret Norden and Sperry computing bombsites. But it’s in the afternoon when the real exciting stuff begins. “The afternoon includes mission flights and various ground activities. You will train and fly as a member of a 6-person bomber crew assigned during induction. A mission consists of flights of both the B17, B24 and other planes flying over the target area, with the Sierra Nevada Mountains as backdrop. As a crew you will take up positions in the bomber and rotate through them during flight. Before and after your mission you will participate in ground training activities, including firefighting, radio operation, first aid, and ball turret training. Bombers and escort planes depart promptly at mission H-hour. Prior to flight you can observe ground operations up close as the field comes alive readying the planes for battle just like in WWII. During flight, when permission is given, crews can explore their aircraft, fire simulated-firing 50 cal. machine guns from different crew positions, ride in the ball turret (requires prior ground training), and help to release dummy bombs on the target using the Norden bombsight. After the missions are complete and all planes have returned home safely there will be a mission debrief, reviewing the success — or failure — of each mission flight and its crew. Afterwards everyone will retire to the officer’s club for some well-deserved R&R, with snacks, refreshments, music and lots of stories from the crews and cadre about their derring-do. The evening ends with a toast to the efforts of the greatest generation, and especially to those who sacrificed everything.” The add-ons list is almost laughably awesome—they include flying an ‘escort mission’ in a fighter like a P-51 Mustang. Flight instruction in most of the aircraft is also available at a substantial additional cost. ‘Torpedo Camp’ is an additional half day module that mirrors Bomber Camp but you learn how to shack a ship in the PV-2D Harpoon with torpedoes instead. This all happens between San Francisco Bay and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, so incredible scenery is included in the package along with a t-shirt and ‘personalized dog tags.’ The coolest part of all of this is the simple fact that World War II bombers are actually dropping bombs—albeit inert ones—out of their bomb bays in the year 2018! Prices run from $450 for the day but with no bomber flight and $2,200 for the day with the flight. The escort flight add-on in the P-51 costs $4,500 and an instruction flight in the B-25 will run $3,500. Torpedo camp is a $1,500 adventure in itself. B-17G about to be loaded up before a Bomber Camp sortie., Bomber Camp Facebook page None of this may be cheap, but for the World War II air warfare super aficionado, there isn’t anything similar that can provide such an immersive and interactive experience. And it’s not like the money isn’t going to a good cause. The funds keep these incredible antique aircraft, which also serve as traveling memorials, in the air.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Upgraded Old Cobra Gunships Offer Big Capabilities Without The Price Tag,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Jordan is in the process of upgrading some of its AH-1F Cobra gunship helicopters to a new standard that incorporates many features similar, or outright identical, to those on the latest AH-1Z model . The update package could potentially serve as a model for other countries looking to upgrade their existing AH-1s or for military forces considering buying Cobras for the first time on the growing secondary market. The Jordanian Air Force displayed one of the modified helicopters during the country’s biennial Special Operations Forces Exhibition, or SOFEX, which took place at Marka Airport in the capital Amman in May 2018. According to a report from Aviation International News , Jordan has taken delivery of two of the updated gunships from American contractor Science & Engineering Services (SES) for training purposes, but they will have to go back to the United States for additional live-fire testing. Jordan is looking to upgrade 12 AH-1Fs in total, but it has a number of additional E and F models in service, including 16 it acquired from Israel in 2015, that it could put through the update program if it chose to do so. We have reached out SES for additional information, but at the time of writing we had not yet heard back about our queries. However many helicopters the Jordanian Air Force eventually decides to upgrade, they will be significantly more capable than they had been in their previous configurations. The new versions will feature an Integrated Avionics System from Northrop Grumman that is the same as the one found on the latest new production twin-engine AH-1Z Zulu Cobras, also known as Vipers, from Bell. This suite has an LN-251 inertial navigation system using a fiber-optic gyroscope. It also replaces a number of analog systems in the front and rear cockpits with large flat-panel multi-function displays by L3. New AN/ARC-210 radios from Rockwell Collins round out the major cockpit updates. This comprehensive upgrade significantly reduces strain on operators who no longer have to keep track of the readouts from a mix of analog gauges, optical scopes, and antiquated heads-up displays. The U.S. Army is putting its older UH-60 Black Hawks through a similar and relatively low-cost update program for many of the same reasons. The new Jordanian helicopters also have an improved OrbitalATK AN/AAR-47 missile approach warning system coupled with an Extant Aerospace AN/ALE-47 dispenser able to fire decoy flares and chaff. It’s not clear if there are any additional updates to the gunship’s defensive sensor suite and countermeasures systems planned for the future. One of the cockpits of an AH-1Z showing the two main multi-function displays., Bell The most visible change is SES’ replacement of the original Telescopic Sight Unit, or TSU, with a new L3 Wescam MX-15D sensor turret, which is similar in both form and function to the Lockheed Martin AN/AAQ-30A Target Sight System , or TSS, on the AH-1Z. The TSU was specifically for guiding the TOW anti-tank missile, an optically-tracked weapon that required the gunner to keep the sight on the target until the weapon hit its mark. The new system contains both electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser designator. Not only does this combination of systems it make it more flexible than the older TSU, but it also greatly expands the crew’s ability to use it for reconnaissance and surveillance missions, as well as target acquisition. The new Jordanian AH-1s combine the new sensor system with Hellfire missiles and Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II laser-guided rockets, or APKWS II ,. This pairing will give the gunships good flexibility against a variety of different targets. The ever-popular Hellfires already come in a number of different types. According to Jane’s 360 , Jordan will primarily use the AGM-114R variant, which combines an anti-tank warhead with a fragmentation sleeve for use against both armored vehicles and soft targets. Other options include the tandem-warhead AGM-114K, which has a better chance to defeat countermeasures such as explosive reactive armor, and the thermobaric AGM-114N , ideal for engaging unarmored vehicles and enemy personnel both out in the open and inside buildings. A breakdown of common Hellfire variants., US Army The smaller APKWS IIs mate a laser-guidance system to existing 70mm rockets and warheads, resulting in low-cost precision-guided munitions that can engage a variety of different targets. High explosive warheads are among the most common, but the U.S. military has begun building versions using the M282 warhead that has the ability to break through some armor and reinforced structures. The rockets also have a smaller warhead than the Hellfires, which has allowed other military forces, including U.S. special operations forces, to use them to engage relatively small targets, such as individual enemy fighters in doorways and windows. And Since the AH-1s will be able to carry pods with seven or 19 of these weapons on one pylon, instead of just four Hellfires, it will drastically increase the total number of targets they can engage before needing to rearm, as well. And there’s always the gunship’s 20mm M197 three-barrel cannon under the nose, too. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aPXh0SpQU6w We don’t know the exact price Jordan is paying to upgrade each AH-1F, but it is very likely far cheaper than buying an AH-1Z straight off the production line. A new build Zulu Cobra costs more than $30 million, according to the U.S. military’s latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year. The unit cost of an older twin-engine AH-1W when it rolled out of Bell Helicopter’s plant in 1986 was only around $22 million when adjusted for inflation to 2018 dollars. Single engine models such as the AH-1F were cheaper and the value of older Cobra types aircraft available on the secondary market is almost certain to have depreciated markedly. A Jordanian Air Force AH-1F in its standard configuration., US Army It’s also possible that these upgrades could lead to additional improvements as time goes on. The sensor turret mount especially is readily suitable to other L3 Wescam offerings that could either offer more or less capability as desired. It’s not hard to see other new features, such as a directional infrared countermeasures system, or DIRCM , to defeat infrared-guided anti-aircraft missiles or a new gun system, becoming available for the AH-1 series later on. Despite there being no takers so far, various companies have pitched up-gunning programs for decades already, including swapping out the M197 for the single-barrel 30mm M230 chain-gun found on the AH-64 Apache. The lightweight M230LF version that is now available would be even better suited to any AH-1 platform. The M197 on an AH-1Z. , USMC As such, the upgrade package SES has put together for Jordanian Air Force, or a version thereof, could easily be a more cost-effective starting place for any country still operating older AH-1s or that is looking to do so. Jordan itself has donated AH-1Fs from its own stocks to other countries, such as Kenya and the Philippines . More significantly, as the U.S. Marine Corps retires its AH-1Ws for good in favor of the AH-1Z, the U.S. military has begun actively looking for ways to modernize them for sale to foreign allies and partners. In December 2017 , the Navy said it was interested in hiring a contractor specifically to install a new, commercially available off-the-shelf avionics update to help sweeten the deal, which sounds very much like what SES offered to Jordan. As of May 24, 2018, there were already more than 30 “Whiskey Cobras” sitting at the Bone Yard at Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, according to a monthly U.S. Air Force inventory report. In March 2018, Brazil, which recently bought the helicopter carrier ex-HMS Ocean from the United Kingdom, reportedly inquired about buying some of these gunships. The United States has already had significant success selling off retired OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopters, particularly to allies in Europe and Africa. Combining AH-1Ws, or other second-hand Cobra types, with the SES upgrade package, could be an even more attractive option for small, cost-conscious military forces looking to bolster their capabilities. A US Marine Corps AH-1W “Whiskey Cobra.”, USMC And countries that had expressed an interest in buying American gunship helicopters in the past, but may have been rebuked over human rights concerns and other issues, such as Nigeria , have found President Donald Trump administration much more willing to approve arms sales in general. Trump has even pushed for American diplomats to more actively promote American-made weapons . There’s a distinct possibility that upgraded AH-1s similar to Jordan’s new “AH-1Z Lite” gunships will end up in direct competition with the actual, production AH-1Zs. Bell has been steadily growing the Zulu Cobra customer base , but a lower cost alternative with many similar capabilities could definitely draw away potential buyers. If the cost is sufficiently low, the SES updated Cobras might also present some competition for other American-made and foreign light attack helicopters, as well. It will definitely be interesting to keep an eye out for which countries decide to take the upgrade route and what Cobras they use as a starting place.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",US Special Operators Need A Battle Ready Buggy They Can Cram Into A V-22 Osprey,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Special Operations Command is looking to find a light tactical vehicle that is more capable than its existing all-terrain vehicles , but can still fit inside a V-22 Osprey tiltrotor in a combat-ready configuration. The new requirements effectively concede that the larger internally-transportable vehicles American special operators have access to at present are not truly capable of performing those missions. U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Atkinson gave new details about the effort to develop a new “purpose built” internally-transportable vehicle (ITV) at the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference earlier in May 2018. Atkinson is presently the program manager in charge of the Family Special Operations Vehicles, or FOSOV, for Special Operation Command’s Program Executive Office (PEO) Special Operations Forces (SOF) Warrior. The FOSOV includes a wide array of different vehicles, including militarized all-terrain vehicles , upgraded civilian trucks , and larger Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) types. “We want something beefier than MRZR with more performance and additional life,” he said. According to the Marine officer, U.S. special operations forces presently rely heavily on Polaris Government and Defense MRZR-2 and MRZR-4 all-terrain vehicles, which it refers to collectively as Light Tactical All Terrain Vehicles (LTATV), for so-called “fly and drive” operations involving the V-22. This means that the aircraft can land and special operators can drive their vehicles straight off and be ready to go for the mission at hand without needing to reattach any weapons or other components. Lighter all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles also have this capability, but have more limited payload capacity than the MRZRs. These various light vehicles give special operators added mobility after inserting into remote or austere locations where it might not even necessarily be possible to operate more traditional military trucks. US Army Special Forces soldiers train to drive MRZRs., US Army The problem is that none of these types of vehicle offer significant mounted firepower or protection for the occupants that those larger, purpose-built vehicles offer. According to Jane’s 360 , Lieutenant Colonel Atkinson said the specific goals of the new ITV program were to provide better lethality and survivability over the MRZR, as well as a boost in mobility and range. “They aren’t being used really … no one will approve any real operation with MRZR,” an unnamed U.S. Marine Corps special operator told Marine Corps Times in January 2018. “We’ve used them for recon in training but not in real life.” That being said, there is photographic proof that U.S. Army special operators have employed the all-terrain vehicles in combat in Iraq and Syria . In particular, pictures emerged from the campaign to liberate the Iraqi city of Mosul from ISIS terrorists in 2016 showed Special Forces soldiers in MRZRs working closely with Kurdish forces close to the front lines . Regardless of the differing opinions between the services, finding an acceptable design is easier said than done. For as long as the V-22 program has existed, special operations forces, as well as the Marines in general, have been interested in a combat worthy vehicle that can fit inside the aircraft. A MillenWorks H elicopter Transportable Tactical Vehicle , which the Marines evaluated in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a possible internally-transportable option for the V-22, as well as the CH-53 series of helicopters., USMC via WarWheels The Marine Corps ultimately procured a number of variants of a jeep from a company called American Growler, which proved to be costly and controversial . Since at least 2015 , the service has been looking for a suitable replacement for those vehicles. In 2014, Special Operations Command had begun evaluating General Dynamics Land Systems’ Flyer 60 light vehicle as a possible ITV. This design does fit inside an Osprey, but not in a mission-ready form. In the end, American special operators began receiving a version of the larger Flyer 72 , which the U.S. military now calls the M1288 or the Ground Mobility Vehicle 1.1. Though still billed as an ITV, this type is too big for the V-22 and can only squeeze inside larger CH- or MH-47 Chinook or CH-53E helicopters in a truncated configuration. The video below shows personnel loading Flyers onto V-22s and MH-47 Chinooks, but with many systems removed and stowed beforehand. On top of that, U.S. special operations forces have questioned whether it offers enough firepower and protective features to be truly useful during operations where there is a higher likelihood of direct combat. In January 2018, The War Zone was first to report that Special Operations Command planned to pay defense contractor Military Systems Group more than $3 million for new turrets that could accept a Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station, or CROWS . This remotely-operated system, which can accept various weapons, such as the .50 caliber M2 machine gun and 40mm Mk 47 automatic grenade launcher, would allow the gunner to remain within the safety of the vehicle’s main cabin when engaging enemy forces. General Dynamics is already offering additional armor suites for the Flyer series and has proposed adding active-protection systems to the vehicles. A Flyer 72 with one layer of additional armor and the Iron Fist active protection system., Joseph Trevithick The M1288s will almost certainly be unable to unable to fit inside the V-22 or even larger helicopters with those various features installed, especially the CROWS, which will dramatically increase its overall height. These additions could also have a significant impact on the vehicle’s payload capacity and performance. We don’t know what Special Operations Command’s exact requirements are for the new vehicle, but these past and existing examples demonstrate the very real difficulties in combining the desired capabilities with a platform that fits inside the V-22, or even larger aircraft. There’s also a cost factor that could come in to play. MRZRs have a unit cost of less than $40,000. The prototype Flyer 60 in a dedicated ITV configuration that Special Operations Command bought in 2014 had a price tag of nearly $500,000. A 2015 briefing slide detailing the Flyer-based ITV., SOCOM General Dynamics has since stepped up production of the Flyer series and is adding new types, including a multi-purpose version akin to a lightweight pickup truck called the Flyer 72 Tactical Utility Vehicle, so those costs have likely dropped somewhat since then. However, these larger vehicles will never be as inexpensive as an all-terrain vehicle. According to Jane’s 360, Lieutenant Colonel Atkinson specifically noted that PEO SOF Warrior had limited funds available for the new project at present. And as of 2017, Special Operations Command had more than 850 MRZR-2s and -4s in service. A breakdown of the FOSOV fleet as of 2017., SOCOM Replacing any significant portion of these vehicles could easily become an expensive proposition. But if American special operations forces are increasingly reluctant to use those all-terrain vehicles on actual missions, any cost savings might be a moot point. We won’t have to wait long to see what defense contractors propose to fill this apparent capability gap. One immediately apparent option might be the development of a lightweight armor suite that fits onto the existing MRZRs. In April 2018, Israeli firm Plasan recently unveiled the Yagu , a variant of the Arctic Cat Wildcat , a similar all-terrain vehicle, with a composite armor package that would seem to be an ideal solution to the desire for more protection, though it’s not clear if that vehicle, or a similar design, would meet the rest of Speical Operations Command’s requirements. Atkinson says that an evaluation of various vehicles will begin in the third quarter of the 2018 fiscal year – which began in April 2018 and ends in June – and hopes there will be an actual contract award in either 2019 or 2020. Special Operations Command plans to issue a new LTATV contract in the 2021 Fiscal Year, which it could conceivably combine with this new ITV program. What seems clear is that special operations still have a very clear desire for a combat-ready vehicle that they can drive straight out of an Osprey and that they are far less than pleased with their current options.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a move we had been hinting at for some time, reports state that Kim Jong Un has reshuffled his top military cabinet ahead of a now on again meeting with President Trump and U.S. officials in Singapore on June 12th. Asahi Shimbun writes : “No Kwang Chol, first vice minister of the Ministry of People’s Armed Forces, has succeeded Pak Yong Sik as defense chief, according to a source well-informed about North Korean affairs. The opposition is expected in North Korea’s military ranks to a possible dramatic change in the country’s nuclear policy. There is also an unconfirmed report that Ri Myong Su, chief of the General Staff of North Korea’s military, has been replaced. If the two personnel changes are confirmed, they would mark the replacement of all three of the nation’s top military officials in six months. Kim Su Gil, who was mayor of Pyongyang, replaced Kim Jong Gak as director of the General Political Bureau of the military in May. Kim Jong Gak’s appointment to the post had been confirmed only in February. No and Kim Su Gil have been widely seen as moderates in the military.” In the years following his ascendancy to the position of premier of North Korea, Kim Jong Un consolidated power via a series of notoriously brutal purges of top officials once loyal to his father. But just how firm his grip on power remains as he spearheads potentially drastic changes to the country’s long-standing foreign and defense policy is up for debate. We have long warned that even going into direct talks with the United States and South Korea, along with the imagery that goes along with them, is a threat to the country’s ruling military elites. Just last March, when Kim made his first international trip abroad since rising to power nearly seven years ago, we wrote : “With U.S. and South Korean intelligence communities having only an opaque view into the inner workings of the regime, it isn’t clear if everyone is onboard with Kim’s abrupt change of course when it comes to foreign relations. For hardliners, inviting the American president for talks may seem like a catastrophic and dangerous move, one that could endanger their individual purpose in a future North Korea. The regime relies on a constant existential threat from beyond its borders to keep its iron grip over its populace. Without grand enemies to point to the regime’s power could rapidly erode. In fact, it could endanger the very fabric of North Korean society, one that has been taught that Americans are literally monsters for the better part of a century. For the old guard in North Korea’s ruling elite, their business is a military standoff, without it, their positions and wealth could be in jeopardy. Even after a series of brutal purges that lasted roughly between 2014 and 2016, where Kim executed or removed long-serving officials with deep ties to China, and with potentially opposing visions for the country, it isn’t certain, especially at this chaotic time, that there aren’t still factions that want to see him removed from power. As such, leaving to China, which has also grown weary of Kim’s leadership, would seem to be a risky move unless he was totally certain that his grip on power is assured.” With this in mind, and if the last minute changes Kim’s highest military aide roster did indeed occur, it would seem that there is a real fear of instability—or at least dissension—among the North Korean military’s top ranks. It is also notable that the usual military cadre that surrounds Kim hasn’t been omnipresent in photographs as of late, with Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong being far more visible than in the past. Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping at a second surprise meeting in Dalian, China on May 16th. , NK State Media Considering that Kim Jong Un will be leaving the country for the highly controversial summit in Singapore—only the third trip he has made abroad as ruler of North Korea and by far the furthest away, with the other two being to nearby China—if there was ever a possibility for a coup it would be then. These sudden personnel changes could reflect a move to preempt such an occurrence. But still, this doesn’t answer one of our biggest questions that has been outstanding since his first trip abroad in March—who is in control of the country’s nuclear arsenal when he is gone? North Korea doesn’t have any independent satellite communications systems to support a robust remote command and control system. Anything of the sort would be vulnerable as it would be provided commercially or by China. So clearly Kim’s power and the nuclear arsenal that goes along with it would be far more prone to commandeering while he is thousands of miles away ‘in the blind’ at a summit that largely goes against the country’s long-standing cornerstone as an adversarial military dictatorship. Kim has had multiple meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. , AP This sets up a highly interesting possibility that even if Kim Jong Un wanted to give up his nuclear arsenal and enter into the community of nations, could he actually do it? Would such a drastic move spark revolt from North Korea’s military ruling class and even from those who are considered ‘moderate?’ Time will tell if this even becomes an issue in the first place, as there is no real sign that North Korea intends to relinquish its nuclear weapons anytime soon. Kim’s increased relevance on the world stage due to his abrupt change in tone is also clear, regardless of actual results. After multiple meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russia has also stepped into the high-level fray, sending their top diplomat Sergei Lavrov to Pyongyang to meet directly with Kim—the first time such a high-level meeting has taken place since Kim took control of the country in 2011. The visit not only gave us some unprecedented looks inside the country, but it also illustrated Moscow’s wish to become a more central player when it comes to North Korea’s emergence on the world stage. https://youtube.com/watch?v=eeBJ0V4zRWo Lavrov even invited Kim to Moscow to meet with President Putin and Kim was quoted as saying the following during the top Russian diplomat’s visit: “I highly value the fact that Putin’s administration strictly opposes the U.S.’ dominance.” Lavrov also pushed for the quick lifting of sanctions if any deal was struck, stating : “As we start discussions on how to resolve the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula, it is understood that the solution cannot be comprehensive without the lifting of sanctions.” With China clearly reengaging with North Korea at the highest levels—which some said prompted North Korea to pull back from its rush to meet with the U.S. President—and now Russia stepping into the fray, the negotiations on June 12th will be an even more complex international affair. North Korean officials wave goodbye to Lavrov after his first visit to meet with Kim., AP It’s possible that if the June 12th talks end up going nowhere, China and/or Russia could simply step away from the sanctions regime in exchange for security cooperation with North Korea and to foil the possibility of enhanced U.S. influence in the region. Either country could provide North Korea with everything it needs to maintain a stable economy and to even improve its defenses. Considering both countries border the ‘Hermit Kingdom,’ even a naval blockade couldn’t stop such a strategy from having a massive impact. It’s also possible that such a move would include focusing on negotiations between North and South Korea in order to increase the divide between Seoul and Washington. All the international attention, especially from its neighbors with far greater resources, seems to have made North Korea’s new foreign relations strategy already a success. Even Syria’s Bashar al Assad is supposedly planning to travel to North Korea to meet Kim. If these reports are valid, it’s a strange move considering the countries already supposedly have a deep clandestine relationship, especially having to do with nuclear capabilities and chemical weapons . If the visit does occur, it will be the first time Kim has hosted the leader of a foreign country.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 24, 2018",U.S. Special Operations Command’s Elusive Mothership Is Packing Stealth Speedboats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ever since we posted the first known picture of the Pentagon’s full outfitted special operations mothership —a vessel that is truly designed to hide in plain sight—more information about the shadowy ship’s activities has been trickling in. We recently got another fragmented view of it, taken during a port call in Seychelles just two months after it popped up at a dry dock facility in Oman in early January of this year.  In the year and a half before its arrival in Oman, it seems to have spent a good amount of time in the Mediterranean and possibly the Baltic Sea as well. But before it left on its maiden voyage in mid-2016, it stopped off in Norfolk, Virginia where it was loaded up with personnel and gear, including what a squad of stealthy special operations fast-boats. We have wondered what types of craft would fill the now ironically named M/V Ocean Trader’s four launch and recovery bays located on the ship’s starboard side. The most likely option seemed to be rigid-hull inflatable boats, like the 11 meter Naval Special Warfare RHIB. But it turns out the ship totes around far more advanced vessels in the form of the stealthy Combat Craft-Assault (CCA). Combat Craft Assault, DoD You can read all about the CCA in this past War Zone feature and you can even watch one being tossed out the back of a C-17 in this recent article . But suffice it to say, the type has become a favorite of special operators, and they have been especially active in the Middle East area of operations in recent years. And yes, this definitely comes to mind when you look at the CCA: These new images of Ocean Trader came to us from David Kozdron, who was visiting Norfolk in early May 2016. He was on a tour cruise of the bay at the time and thought the vessel looked interesting. After reading our article about it he remembered seeing the ship from that day and had pictures to show for it. David Kozdron David Kozdron The images are by far the best of the very few photos we have seen Ocean Trader in its finished state. In addition to spotting the types of boats it carries, the photos offer a better view of its massive communications suite and they give a better idea of the overall size of its hangars in relation to the vehicles on its deck. A crop of one of the photos showing the CCA in one of the bays and the Insitu drone launcher of the secondary aft flight deck., David Kozdron There also appears to be a launcher for Insitu drones on the ship’s stern flight deck area. This makes total sense as those efficient and compact remotely pilot vehicle systems are a favorite not just of the U.S. Navy, but also of special operators. The layout of the ship is also ideal for drone operations as its primary flight deck doesn’t have to be fouled during their launch and recovery evolutions, as is the case on many surface combatants and helicopter-carrying vessels. USN Even though we have finally seen full high-quality exterior shots of the Ocean Trader, who knows when or where it will pop-up next. The vessel is not trackable via its standard Automatic Identification System transponder. But considering the amount of information we have gleaned just in recent weeks following a long period of time when the ship seemed to of all but disappeared, it probably won’t be the last time we will be hearing of this phantom-like vessel.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Social media’s aviation geek was abuzz on Thursday as pictures of shrinkwrapped 125 foot long 737 fuselage cradled on a big red flatbed truck was spotted leaving Boeing’s Renton, Washington plant and heading south. 737 fuselages travel by train from Wichita to Washington for assembly, but they are rarely moved on roadways, especially over long distances. After inquiring with Boeing on Thursday as to the backstory behind the mysterious move, we have confirmed details to share. We also filed a request with Washington State Department of Transportation for the permits, but have yet to receive that information. Boeing confirmed much of what we had gleaned from our sources prior to and after the move began, that the load was, in fact, a P-8A Poseidon fuselage that was being trucked all the way to Boeing’s facility at Plant 42 in Palmdale , California. It’s heading there to support the Poseidon’s fatigue testing program. An email from Boeing’s communications team to The War Zone stated: “Following the successful completion of static fatigue testing of one of the U.S. Navy’s P-8A Poseidon test aircraft in December, 2017, Boeing Test & Evaluation is now disassembling and shipping components of the test article to various sites for final, detailed inspection.  This final inspection is a part of standard fatigue testing and is included in Boeing’s contract with the U.S. Navy for P-8A Poseidon testing.” The American southwest, roughly between China Lake, California, the Nellis Test and Training Range in Nevada, and White Sands, New Mexico definitely gets its fair share of strange aerospace object related convoys, but seeing an entire 737 fuselage skimming along the asphalt would definitely be a surprise for motorists. Dave Honan – Davehonan.com Dave Honan – Davehonan.com The last time a 737 was moved by road was in 2012 when another P-8 fuselage was trucked down to Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake for live fire testing. A P-8 fuselage was transported by road from Washington to China Lake’s NAWCWD Weapons Survivability Lab in 2012. NAWCWD engineers used the fuselage to conduct the final phase of the Live Fire Test and Evaluation Program for the P-8A Poseidon to verify the effectiveness of the aircraft’s fire suppression system., USN As for the P-8 Poseidon program in general, the once controversial jet has become a huge success for Boeing. The 100th P-8 is now on the production line and export customers continue to stack up with Australia, India, Norway, and the UK operating the jet or have orders on the books. The aircraft has proven itself highly capable of a slew of missions, and there are more capabilities in the developmental pipeline . With that in mind, knowing exactly how long a P-8 can last, especially considering it spends more of its life at lower altitudes than its commercial counterpart, is key. And that’s exactly what this P-8 has given its life to find out.

U.S. Senators are looking to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the defense budget so the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps can buy fleets of light attack aircraft . This comes amid reports that the former service could finally award a contract to buy these types of planes by the Spring of 2019. On May 24, 2018, the Senate Armed Services Committee, or SASC, approved the latest, amended draft iteration of their version of the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2019 fiscal year, the formal title for the annual defense budget. In the process of the so-called “markup,” the legislators proposed authorizing $350 million to support the Air Force’s light attack effort, as well as another $100 million for a Marine Corps program. In June 2017, the Committee had added $1.2 billion for “a fleet of Light Attack/Observation aircraft” in the fiscal year 2018 draft budget without specifying any particular service, a figure that lawmakers subsequently reduced substantially. “The Marine Corps continues to monitor the Air Force-led Light Attack Experiment to procure a cost-effective, observation and attack (OA-X) air platform for employment in permissive environments, with the intent to employ such an asset as a joint force capability,” U.S. Marine Corps Captain Christopher Harrison, a spokesperson for the service at the Pentagon, told Military.com when asked about the prospective funding. “The SASC’s decision to authorize $100 million for a light attack platform is only reflected in a policy bill.” In July 2017, the Air Force started the first round of its light attack experiment, also known as OA-X, which involved four different aircraft. On May 7, 2018, the service began the second phase , which includes only Embraer and Sierra Nevada Corporation’s A-29 Super Tucano and Textron’s AT-6C Wolverine . Both of these aircraft are twin-seat, single-engine turboprop aircraft. Textron’s AT-6C Wolverine, one of the aircraft participating in the US Air Force’s ongoing light attack experiment., Textron Harrison also noted that so far there was no money approved for such a program within the Marine Corps. However, since at least 2008 , the service has expressed an interest in acquiring such an aircraft, primarily for training tactical air controllers and forward air controllers on the ground on how to request and coordinating close air support missions. In this role, a turboprop, such as the ones the Air Force are evaluating, would offer a cost-effective option compared to using higher performance jet combat aircraft during those exercises. As of 2017 , the Marines had proposed forming a number of composite training squadrons – two on the west coast and two on the east coast – with both a light attack aircraft and F-5 jet trainers to support various training requirements. A page from the Marine Corps’ 2017 Aviation Plan showing the proposed composite training squadron concept., USMC In its 2018 Aviation Plan , though, the Marine Corps had indicated that it was looking to pursue a contractor-operated option to meet this need. Hiring private companies to fly various aircraft in the adversary or “red air” role, as well as for other types of training support , has become increasingly popular across the U.S. military. These arrangements offer a lower cost and more flexible option compared to maintaining dedicated military units to perform these missions or employing other elements in this role. With the U.S. military as a whole buying combat aircraft that are increasingly more expensive to fly, and amid chronic shortages of pilots , ground crews , and mission-ready aircraft , the value of a contractor-operated option is only likely to increase in the near future. It is not clear whether or not the language in the Senate’s draft defense budget would prevent the Marines from spending the light attack money on hiring a contractor to provide that service directly. It’s also unclear if the lawmakers added the money into their version of the bill with the specific goal of the Marine Corps acquiring aircraft it could use during actual operations. At present, the service’s plans do not indicate the planes would have any actual combat mission. An A-29 Super Tucano drops a laser-guided practice bomb during the first phase of the US Air Force’s light attack experiment. the Marine Corps had previously considered this aicraft to be one possible option for its own requirements., USAF As such, we don’t know how this may or may not align with the Air Force’s ongoing OA-X effort or U.S. Special Operations Command’s tertiary light attack project . If any of these services describing near-identical requirements, the Pentagon could compel them to join together on a shared program. If the Air Force and Marines were to settle on a common aircraft it could help lower procurement, logistics, and operating costs. The two services could share pipelines for spare parts and services and join together on larger block buys of actual planes. At the same time, they might even be able to establish joint training structures, something they have already done with regards to the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor. But, so far, though, Congress appears to be the biggest driver of these efforts. The Air Force has yet to truly clarify how many planes it might buy or how it would integrate them with existing forces, despite public pronouncements in support of light attack aircraft in concept. The service also repeatedly insists that the acquisition process has been fast, a claim we at The War Zone have shown to be at best questionable many times in the past . U.S. Air Force General David Goldfein, the service’s Chief of Staff, in the green flight suit, shakes hands with Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson during the first round of OA-X experiment., USAF According to Military.com, an unnamed industry source said that the Air Force was hoping to issue a formal request for proposals, which would help further illuminate its goals for the light attack experiment, in October 2018. The service would then push ahead to award an actual contract within six months. But in February 2018 , Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson had indicated that it was unlikely her service would take delivery of any aircraft until after 2020. And without a clear sense of their mission set and how the Air Force will pay to sustain them once they enter service, there remains a significant risk of the planes ending up orphaned and effectively unusable. Those concerns contributed to scuttling a nearly identical effort in 2012 and we’ve also seen how this has played out with regards to the C-27J Spartan intra-theater airlifter. Ambivalent to the aircraft from the beginning , the service eventually horse-traded those planes away to U.S. Special Operations Command, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Forest Service, as well as foreign allies. It’s not even clear whether or not the Air Force necessarily has a firm grasp on what a light attack aircraft brings to the table. “We should not be using an F-22 [stealth fighter] to destroy a narcotics factory,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in May 2018, repeating a comment she has made many times in reference to a series of strikes in Afghanistan in November 2017. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., USAF It’s true that the long-standing goal of a light attack platform is to provide a relatively cheap way to reduce the strain on more advanced combat jets in lower-threat environments and free them up for higher priority missions in those theaters or elsewhere. These aircraft can also operate in areas with more limited infrastructure and with a smaller overall footprint , giving them added flexibility. This doesn’t obviate the need for those aircraft entirely, even in limited conflicts, though. Are insurgents operating that narcotics factory situated deep inside an area full of more established or even improvised air defenses ? Did friendly forces just discover the site and are enemy personnel already looking to relocate? A light attack aircraft may not be best suited to hitting time-sensitive targets, especially depending on how far away they might be from their operating bases. These planes have no ability to perform stand-off strikes into more heavily defended areas, either. F-22s over Syria in March 2018., USAF It’s also true that a larger fleet of less expensive light attack aircraft dispersed to a greater number of smaller operating sites could provide adequate coverage across a larger area. They would also then be betters situated to loiter over certain portions of the battlefield for extended periods performing armed overwatch and, depending on their exact configuration, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. At the same time, the environment may not be entirely uniform and require a more mix force. In an increasing age of so-called “ hybrid conflicts, ” where regular and unconventional forces are heavily intertwined, a single theater of operations may include areas where the lower and slower flying planes would be perfectly capable of conducting operations and others that could be virtual no-go zones. U.S. military activities in Iraq and Syria offer good examples of this extreme dichotomy even within a relatively constrained battlespace. Closer to the Syrian-Iraqi border, light attack aircraft would be ideal for strikes against ISIS terrorists who are seeking to regroup. Those same planes might be too vulnerable, or too slow to respond, for missions less than 100 miles further west, where American forces and their local Syrian partners are right up against Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government troops and militias and have come under threat from advanced electronic warfare systems and other more robust capabilities . For years now, F-22s have flown regular patrols in those areas to offer a reliable rapid reaction capability . An Afghan Air Force A-29, which the country acquired with help from the U.S. military., USFOR-A The Air Force has also repeatedly stressed the importance of foreign participation in its light attack effort, strongly implying that it is looking to use the program as a vehicle to sell allies and partners on a common aircraft. This has only raised questions about the service’s commitment to forming its own such units. “Is this a way to get more coalition partners into a network to counter violence?” U.S. Air Force General David Goldfein, the service’s chief of staff, asked rhetorically in an interview with Military.com September 2017. “[OA-X] is actually not about the hardware – it’s about the network.” This is an especially curious line of reasoning since the Pentagon has facilitated the sale of dozens of A-29s and other light attack aircraft abroad already. On May 28, 2018, Lebanon received four more Super Tucanos , which it purchased through the U.S. military. #Lebanon takes delivery of four additional A-29 Super Tucanos https://t.co/KGtcXlyFCb pic.twitter.com/6ST1SO3t1O — Air Recognition (@AirRecognition) May 29, 2018 What is clear is that Congress, especially the Senate, has and continues to be supportive of the U.S. military developing a light attack aircraft capability. How and when either the Air Force or Marine Corps actually implement their respective projects remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 26, 2018","It’s Official, The Navy’s Next Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Will Be The Naval Strike Missile","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has awarded its long-awaited Over-the-Horizon Weapon Systems contract to Raytheon, which had joined together with Norwegian defense contractor Kongsberg to offer the Naval Strike Missile, or NSM. The service sees the weapon as an important anti-ship and land-attack weapon capability for the Littoral Combat Ship and its future frigates , but the selection could also pave the way for adding the missiles to other types of ships and for other services to acquire air- and ground-launched versions . The Pentagon included the fixed-price deal, valued at more than $14.8 million, in its daily contracting announcement notice for May 31, 2018. The contract has additional options and could be worth nearly $850 million in total. Under the stated terms, the Raytheon-Kongsberg team will supply the weapon systems, consisting of NSMs in canisters, deck-mounted launchers, and a fire control system. In addition, the contract includes funds for mission support and training equipment and other services. Kongsberg’s NSM is a sub-sonic, sea-skimming cruise missile with a range of around 100 miles primarily geared toward taking out enemy ships. The weapon navigates to the general target area using a combination of GPS, inertial navigation system (INS), and terrain recognition, and can either fly over or around islands and other land masses. According to the Norweigan firm, the INS offers an effective backup in the increasingly likely event that an opponent disrupts the GPS connectivity . In its terminal stage of flight, the missile switches to an infrared imaging seeker to home in on the target. Using a built-in database of representative ship types, the weapon can automatically discriminate between the intended target and other objects, which gives it a high degree of accuracy and makes it much less susceptible to electronic warfare tactics and countermeasures. A Naval Strike Missile flies out of its launcher during a test., USN The missile’s guidance system also gives it a secondary land-attack capability. With its range, though, this is hardly a comparable capability to long-range land attack cruise missiles, such as the Tomahawk . The NSM also makes random movements in its terminal stage of flight to help avoid enemy close-in defense systems and has low-observable or “stealthy” characteristics to make it more difficult for adversaries to spot in advance. Raytheon and Kongsberg are also cooperating on the air-launched Joint Strike Missile, or JSM, which is an improved derivative of the NSM. This is a more robust multi-role weapon with more than double the range depending on its flight profile, a larger warhead, and various other upgraded features. The weapon has a two-way datalink allowing the firing platform to send updated targeting information to it while it’s still in flight or send it heading in a different direction altogether. It is possible that some of these features will eventually migrate to the NSM or that a sea-launched version of the JSM will become available. Of course, its capabilities notwithstanding, the NSM was more or less a shoe-in for the deal after competitors Boeing and Lockheed Martin, who had offered an updated version of the long-serving RGM-84 Harpoon . The very stealthy Long Range Anti-Ship Missile ( LRASM ), respectively, dropped out in May 2017. Boeing complained that the Navy was asking for a far less capable weapon than Harpoon and Lockheed Martin suggested that the requirements looked tailored to one specific offer – an apparent reference to the one from the Raytheon-Kongsberg team. Harpoon has long been the Navy’s go-to anti-ship weapon and despite continued upgrades , the underlying design is becoming increasingly dated. It is possible that the NSM might eventually serve as a partial replacement with the anti-ship variant of the Tomahawk taking over the long-range anti-surface warfare role. The Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Cowpens fires a Harpoon anti-ship missile during a training exercise., USN Neither company has lodged a formal complaint about the contracting process so far. The Navy is undoubtedly hoping it can still avoid any protests now that it has effectively sole-sourced the contract. It already plans to add the Over-the-Horizon Weapon Systems to some of its two distinct classes Littoral Combat Ships, subvariants known as Small Surface Combatants , which would give these perpetually underwhelming ships a stand-off anti-ship and land attack capability they desperately need to be useful in anything but the most low-threat environments. At present, the only weapons on the bulk of these ships are a 57mm rapid-fire gun, RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile close-in defense system, and various smaller automatic cannons and machine guns. In 2014, the service actually installed NSM launchers on the flight deck of the Independence -class LCS USS Coronado as part of a test. In 2016, that same ship received Harpoons on its forward deck as part of an experimental configuration to further validate the basic concept of rapidly adding over-the-horizon anti-ship missiles to the ships. The Navy is also planning to add smaller Hellfire missiles to the ships for additional close-in protection, primarily against swarms of small boats. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UuMU-lc8DZw The Navy’s latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year includes more than $18 million for a total of eight individual over-the-horizon missiles in their launch canisters for the LCS specifically. The accompanying budget outlay sees the service purchasing 12 more in each of the next three fiscal years and then 20 additional missiles in fiscal year 2023, for a grand total of 64 weapons by that point. Millions more would pay for the launcher and fire control components. The NSM is also a key component of the Navy’s plans for its future guided missile frigates, or FFG(X). The service wants to pick one of five proposed ship designs by 2020 and see the first one delivered three years after that. The plan is to buy a fleet of 20 of the ships at a unit cost of nearly $1 billion . Able to perform as an anti-ship and limited land attack cruise missile, NSM could greatly expand the capabilities of these ships since they would not have to carry two different types of weapons to perform both roles. This means that LCS and frigates armed with the missiles could rapidly shift from anti-surface warfare missions to supporting operations ashore and back again without having to rearm. The system’s relatively simple deck-mounted launchers also obviate the need to find trade space under the deck to install more complex vertical launch systems, such as the Mk 41 . An artist’s conception of ship maker Austal’s entry into the FFG(X) program firing an over-the-horizon missile., Austal USA But in buying the missiles for these ships, the Navy might open up a path for additional purchases within the service and elsewhere across the U.S. military. The containerized launchers would be relatively easy to add to almost any suitably sized ship, include the Navy’s new expeditionary sea bases and even logistics platforms . The San Antonio -class landing platform dock ships would one particularly logical starting place since they have existing free space on top of the deck that ship maker Huntington Ingalls had originally been set aside as part of plans to install two Mk 41 eight-cell vertical launch systems. The Marine Corps has already expressed an interest in giving these ships , as well as the forthcoming Flight II San Antonios and other amphibious assault ships, greater offensive capabilities to support expeditionary and distributed operations. Armed with a version of the NSM with updated networked capabilities, and coupled with the Navy’s existing plans to increase data-sharing between its ships and manned and unmanned aircraft, any ship armed with the missiles might be able to engage targets beyond the range of their own onboard sensors. As such, it might be even easier to add in this offensive capability without the need for more complex target acquisition upgrades. The video below details the Navy’s plans for an over-arching networked force. That networking could expand to air- and ground-launched versions of the missile, as well. As noted, the JSM derivative already has a data-link built into its design. Its physical shape is also tailored to the internal weapons bays on the F-35A and F-35C Joint Strike Fighters and could be adapted for external carriage on that aircraft and other planes. Norway already plans to integrate JSM onto its F-35As in the future. A JSM inside one of the internal weapons bays on an F-35A., Raytheon On top of that, Kongsberg already offers the anti-ship focused NSM in a ground-launched configuration for coastal defense, as well, and it’s likely that it could modify the containerized launchers with relative ease to use the JSM. At the upcoming Rim of the Pacific exercises, the U.S. Army already plans to evaluate a truck-mounted NSM system for its own emerging anti-ship requirements . The Raytheon-Kongsberg team may be able to develop a version of the JSM that fits inside a standard pod for the tracked M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and the wheeled M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ). The Army, which has both the M270 and the M142, and the Marines, who employ the HIMARS only, are both interested in acquiring an anti-ship missile that is compatible with these systems. Raytheon is already familiar with these launchers as it is in the process of developing an improved quasi-ballistic missile called DeepStrike , which will work in either launcher as a replacement the Army Tactical Missile System ( ATACMS ) missile. Adding NSM or JSM to these systems would only increase their flexibility and that of various other platforms, since artillery crews could fire them from on board ships and then move them ashore as the battle progresses to strike targets further inland or to defend the beachhead against counterattacks from land or naval forces. They could also quickly switch back to firing guided rockets or other types of missiles, too. A truck-mounted NSM launcher., Kongsberg Networked together, various air, sea, and land platforms with NSMs and JSMs could also rapidly deploy the systems to different areas to create new vectors of attack. This could help disrupt an enemy’s planning process or even force them to abort a planned maneuver. Being able to quickly bring stand-off weapons to bear on a target area from multiple directions could be especially valuable in operations spread across a wide area where small outposts on land might be separated by large bodies of water, such as in the Pacific. In the South China Sea, China is already looking to do much the same thing to try and limit the ability of foreign military forces, especially those of the United States, to operate in the area during a crisis by deploying long-range anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as surface-to-air missiles, on various man-made islands . Vietnam has sought to challenge those moves itself by positioning its own long-range guided rocket artillery onto islands it controls. “The end result of my challenge shouldn’t be a simple exercise where we all high five at the end and then head back to the comforts of our services,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, then head of U.S. Pacific Command, said during a speech in 2017. “Service-specific systems must be able to talk to one another if any of this is going to achieve the effects that we’re looking for. Ideally, we’ll get to a point where we see the Joint Force as a network of sensors and shooters allowing the best capability from any single service to provide cross-domain fires.” With the Navy’s purchase of the NSM, this goal looks one step closer to being a reality.
