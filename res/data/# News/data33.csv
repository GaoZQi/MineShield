Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 5, 2021",Let’s Take Our First Look At Kratos’ Airwolf Tactical Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Drone maker Kratos recently offered the first look at its new Airwolf unmanned aircraft, also sometimes written Air Wolf, which the company describes as a tactical platform intended to perform various military missions. Just as Kratos’ existing UTAP-22 Mako tactical unmanned aircraft is derived from the BQM-167 Skeeter target drone, Air Wolf is based on the smaller MQM-178 Firejet aerial target. On Aug. 25, 2021, Kratos released a picture, seen at the top of this story, of an Air Wolf drone just prior to launch at a range in Burns Flat, Oklahoma, along with press release regarding that test flight. It is not clear when this test flight occurred or if it was the first successful flight of an Air Wolf drone, though we do know it was the first flight test of any kind at the Burns Flat range. Kratos had previously said it expected to begin flight testing of this unmanned aircraft last year. A top-down artist’s conception of the Air Wolf unmanned aircraft., 5-D Systems The “Air Wolf Tactical Drone System completed a 100 percent successful flight at the recently approved Burns Flat, Oklahoma Range Facility,” the press release said. “The Kratos Air Wolf Mission, which was the inaugural flight at the Burns Flat Range location, included multiple new payloads carried by the Air Wolf Drone, including a proprietary Kratos artificial intelligence/autonomy system, which has been developed by Kratos specifically for high performance, jet drone aircraft.” It is also worth noting that Kratos has a manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, around 95 miles east of Burns Flat. “This successful Air Wolf flight at the recently approved Burns Flat Range facility is the latest example of the teaming approach Kratos routinely takes with its partners at the local, state and federal government levels with the objective of accelerating technology development and a focus on science, technology, engineering, and math advancement,” Steve Fendley, President of Kratos Unmanned Systems Division, said in the press release. “The Air Wolf drone system that successfully flew today demonstrated a number of new mission systems which we believe are operationally and tactically relevant for Kratos’ government customer set, as our proven commercial development approach and robust digital engineering, modeling and simulation capabilities, and affordability-focused processes continue to successfully rapidly deliver affordable high performance jet aircraft, not just models, surrogates, or renditions.” Beyond the mention of the drone’s “artificial intelligence/autonomy system,” Kratos’ press release offers few details about Air Wolf’s general specifications or its capabilities. However, a briefing Kratos gave to investors in January makes clear that this drone is based on the MQM-178 , referring to it as “Airwolf (Tactical Firejet).” Another presentation the company gave to members of the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce last year also described it as “Airwolf (Tac FJ).” A slide from the January 2021 investor briefing that describes the drone as “Airwolf (Tactical Firejet).”, Kratos A slide from the presentation to the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce that refers to the drone as “Airwolf (Tac FJ).” This graphic also appears to show this unmanned aircraft and others to scale, given a sense of how it compares size-wise to other Kratos products., Kratos This is all further reinforced by the fact that the drone in the picture that Kratos released last week is registered as an MQM-178 with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Individuals online had previously been able to determine its U.S. civil registration code, which is N887RZ. It would not necessarily take much to reconfigure the MQM-178, which is powered by two small JetCat C81 turbojets, for missions beyond that of being a target drone. Firejet, which has an overall length of 10.8 feet and a wingspan of 6.5 feet, can carry around 70 and a half pounds of payload internally, as well as nearly 35 pounds more under each wing and an additional 20 pounds in pods on each wingtip. The drone, which is launched via a catapult system, has a maximum takeoff weight of close to 320 pounds. In their roles as flying targets, MQM-178s typically carry payloads such as towed targets and fixed flares, as well as radiofrequency emitters and other infrared heat sources to mimic different kinds of threats and make the drone easier to track. With these various payloads, the Firejets can help support aerial combat and air defense training exercises, as well as various research and development and test and evaluation activities. A tactical version of this drone could easily substitute those payloads for various kinds of intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance (ISR) sensor packages, electronic warfare systems , communications relay nodes , and more. Small munitions might even be an option. The website for a company called 5-D Systems , a Kratos subsidiary, has an artist’s conception of Air Wolf alongside pictures of the UTAP-22 and XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, all under the heading “Tactical ISR/Strike Jet UAS.” Interestingly, in another briefing Kratos had given to investors in March 2020, Air Wolf is described separately from Tactical Firejet, with the latter project being described as an “initiative to deploy ‘Switchblade’ Tactical Drone Munition from FireJet Drone.” Switchblade is a small loitering munition, also known as a suicide drone, which can perform ISR tasks and then prosecute targets it finds directly. You can read more about it here . The slide from the 2020 investor briefing that mentions Air Wolf and Tactical Firejet separately., Kratos That presentation also says the company was working on Tactical Firejet, a self-funded effort, in cooperation with AeroVironment, which manufactures the Switchblade, among other things. The customer for Air Wolf is said to be “confidential” and is not named. https://youtube.com/watch?v=5KJZzgatjMg Kratos is, of course, heavily engaged with the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Air Force, as well as the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Its work for the Air Force most notably includes the stealthy XQ-58A Valkyrie drone, a platform that demonstrated its ability to deploy a smaller drone from its internal bay earlier this year and has also been used in a host of other tests, and the Skyborg program .  The goal of Skyborg is to develop an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” and associated systems that will be able to fly various “loyal wingman” type drones, as well as fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). A modified UTAP-22 , a design that the Navy and Marines have already experimented with, as well, has been used in a number of initial Skyborg flight tests. A UTAP-22 drone at the moment of launch during a Skyborg-related flight test., USAF Kratos announced just last month that it was working on another Air Force program, known as the Off-Board Sensing Station, which is being managed by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). You can read more about what is known about that secretive program here . The company is also part of a team led by Dynetics that has been working with DARPA on the Gremlins program . Gremlins, which you can read more about here , is exploring the development of air-launched and air-recoverable drones that can operate together as an autonomous networked swarm. Kratos is known to be working on a number of other classified projects for unspecified customers, as well. Air Wolf, which we know has now been tested with an artificial intelligence-driven autonomy system, would be very much in line with these other developments. An MQM-178-derived platform would notably represent a general capability that is substantially smaller and lighter than either the XQ-58A or the UTAP-22. Air Wolf would seem to be the lower end of an emerging three-tier product line, with UTAP-22 in the middle and XQ-58A at the top-end capability and complexity-wise. Its size could make it ideal for air-launched employment , as either a loyal wingman or an ISR/strike asset, compared to either of these other drones. A graphic showing the relative size of the MQM-178, from which Air Wolf is derived, at the bottom, and the BQM-167, on which the UTAP-22 is based, at the top. The XQ-58A is even larger than the UTAP-22., Kratos In addition, Kratos regularly touts the “attritable” nature of the XQ-58A and the UTAP-22 . What this means is that these drones are not explicitly expendable, but they are intended to be cheap enough that they could be employed in higher-risk environments where commanders might be more reluctant to commit more costly exquisite assets. The smaller Air Wolf could be even more cost-effective for a variety of mission sets. “Kratos’ Ghost Works played an incredibly important role in today’s successful Air Wolf flight, and with our Valkyrie, Mako, Gremlin and Air Wolf drones, we believe that we are ready now, today, to meet our customers’ requirements with a family of affordable, high performance jet drones in the disposable, reusable and attritable classes,” Eric DeMarco, President and CEO of Kratos, had said in last week’s press release. If nothing else, Air Wolf underscores how Kratos continues to grow its already impressive portfolio of advanced unmanned aircraft and expand its related work on autonomy and other related capabilities.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On the evening of September 1st, 2021, the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS McCampbell (DDG-85) had a chemical incident on board. The ship had been undergoing a 17-month long modernization upgrade and refit at Vigor’s Swan Island Shipyard in Portland, Oregon after being forward-deployed to Japan for 13 years. USS McCampbell is the first U.S. Navy destroyer to go through such an elaborate process at the private shipyard. The total cost of the contract for work on the ship, if all options are exercised, is pegged at $155.6 million . We inquired to Vigor as to what happened aboard USS McCampbell and Jill Mackie, the company’s Senior Vice President for Public Affairs, issued the following statement to The War Zone : I can confirm in the course of our ship repair operations today, 9/1, products being used on a US Navy ship repair project underway at our Swan Island Shipyard (USS McCampbell) combined to create a chemical reaction resulting in fumes/smoke. There was no fire. The vessel on which this occurred was immediately evacuated and Portland Fire Department/EMS responded timely. Two individuals are being evaluated for exposure to smoke/fumes. At this time there are no other reported injuries. All people are accounted for. We’re appreciative of the timely response of ship’s crew and Portland Fire department & EMS. The incident is being investigated by both the Navy & Vigor. Work on the vessel has been temporarily suspended. Vigor’s Swan Island Shipyard in North Portland. , Vigor.net The War Zone also contacted Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) to inquire as to exactly what happened, to what extent the ship was damaged as a result of the incident, and the disposition of those who had to be treated medically. We have yet to receive a response. The soon to be improved destroyer was slated to wrap up its refit in November and be returned to the fleet, that desperately needs it, prior to the incident. The Navy has worked to outsource more of its major repair and upgrade work to private yards in an attempt to increase the availability of its ships and submarines by decreasing its backlog of maintenance . The work being done at Swan Island is part of that general initiative. Nearly a year ago, DDG-85’s crew worked with Portland Fire to prepare for a potential emergency aboard the ship during its refit. That training likely came in handy during this incident. , DDG-85 Facebook Page Incidents involving combustible materials aboard Navy vessels have taken on an ever greater interest after the catastrophic fire aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, a multi-billion dollar amphibious assault ship that had to be scrapped as the result of what now appears to have been a case of arson . There have been other smaller fires recently , as well , that have raised major concerns about the threat to American warships from fire, especially when they are undergoing maintenance in port. Luckily, in this case, flames never became an issue. Hopefully, the damage wasn’t extensive and DDG-85 can return to her mission on time.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 1, 2021",This Marine’s Must-Watch Video Shows What Really Happened During The Kabul Evacuation (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A member of the U.S. Marine Corps who took part in the recently concluded noncombatant evacuation operation in Afghanistan has posted an absolutely intense video montage on Instagram showing what the situation on the ground was really like in the past two weeks. It’s an amazing first-hand perspective on what was an extremely challenging, often dangerous , and even deadly situation for American forces, as well as the throngs of people who made their way to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul seeking to get out of the country. The video starts with Marines boarding a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane. This may have been shot in Kuwait, where Marines had been prepositioned for a potential contingency deployment prior to the fall of Kabul . Subsequent clips then show Marines taking stock of the situation after arriving, securing abandoned weapons and even hotwiring a truck, as well as dealing with a sea of people outside the airport. Some of the footage shows weapons pointed at the crowd, as well as what appear to be tear gas canisters fired over them. @Mike_Wahlburger/Instagram At one point, an individual who does not appear to be a U.S. military service person, who could possibly be one of the former Afghan National Defense and Security Forces personnel that assisted American troops in securing the airport or even a member of the Taliban , draws their pistol and shoots into the ground in front of the gathered civilians. If the video does not show up below, you can find it on Instagram at this link . UPDATE: @Mike_WAHLBURGER, the Marine who made the video, said in an Instagram post that he had to take it down, but said others to continue to use it. You can still see the video below as well as a screenshot of his post about taking it down: View this post on Instagram A post shared by The War Zone (@thewarzonewire) @Mike_Wahlburger Much of the rest of the video is a mix of Marines at rest, giving us a look at the spartan conditions they lived in while deployed to the airport in Kabul, as well as clips of them destroying a Lenco Bear Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protect (MRAP) armored truck and an SUV, among other things. The video montage ends with a group of Afghans fist-bumping a Marine as they enter the airport and then a tribute to the Marines who were among the 13 U.S. service members who died in a deadly terrorist attack carried out by Afghanistan’s branch of ISIS last week. The individual who posted the footage included the following message along with it, as well: MAKE THIS GO VIRAL. History Kabul 2021 Id love for this to go viral for many reasons. I hope sharing this with the people on social media it brings light to what happened in Kabul through my point of view. This is all my footage and i also edited everything. I hope this answers questions but also provokes you to ask more. Share and repost this as much as possible. To my brothers and sisters who were there i made this for you and your family. When you have the lack of ability to explain all that happened in those two weeks, show them this. Stand tall and wear the last two weeks on your chest. I havent found a way to explain it with anywords i know. These clips are not from one or two days, they are from two straight weeks of worsening conditions. This is barely even a glimpse. Many of us have felt a purpose greater than ourselves written in history for ever, the need to protect defend and fight for what we believe is right. Living in the shadows of the legends and giants who wore this uniform before us. To our knowledge ending a dark era for the United States military. Not knowing or caring about the circumstances. Only caring about what needs to be done and how we need to do it, putting ourselves last. Many of us joined because we liked fighting and were good with adversity and conflict. Two weeks in Kabul at HKIA put all of that to the test. I cant say enough how proud i am of the Marines i serve with. Most of us old enough to have witnessed the day this war started, and many of us currently serving as teenagers. Odds were stacked against us, circumstances undeniably out of our control but we never let it deter our tenacious approach towards our mission at hand. Adversity and challenges happened 24/7 many at the same time, and almost all had no predesignated plan. We did our absolute best and remained stoic through the sleepless nights and round the clock work with minimal food and water. Staying up for two or more days straight at a time grinding but remaining intensely vigilant. I serve with someones father/son/brother/sister/daughter/mother and i never take that lightly. I take it as a responsibility to never let those people down. I dont have answers for a lot of stuff we had to see and deal with and i dont expect any. But i truly hope this sheds light. I assure you no matter how awful it may seem every single one of us wanted to be there, doing what we were doing, serving our nation that we love and owe. Never take for granted your freedom liberty and pursuit of happiness. To the Marines, sailors and soldiers injured and killed, you will live on as a legacy for decades to come. Never forgotten. I tried to keep it as PG as possible with out jipping anyone of the experience. The familys and loved ones of the service members effected need our help, i searched for as many of their gofundme’s and charities as i can find they are posted at the end. I can always get you a link if you ask and if you have anymore details about them please feel free to let me know. #Kabul #1831b #RBNG #Afghanistan As we at The War Zone have said before, very personal stories of heroism and just how things really were on the ground in Kabul over the past two weeks, and imagery to go with them, are only likely to keep coming out now. It has already been clear that the last two weeks of the U.S. military’s nearly two-decades-long presence in Afghanistan were extremely intense all around, but this video really shows what our servicemen and women went through as America vacated its longest war.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 30, 2022",The Air Force Is Developing Smart Bombs With ‘Torpedo-Like’ Ship Killing Capability,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As The War Zone highlighted just recently , torpedoes, such as the heavyweight Mk 48 , are still king among the available weapons across the entire U.S. military when it comes to sinking enemy ships. Now, the U.S. Air Force is exploring ways it might be able to achieve the same kind of anti-ship lethality with air-launched weapons, including modified 2,000-pound class Joint Direct Attack Munition precision-guided bombs. The Air Force announced yesterday that three F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron, part of the 53rd Wing based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, had taken part in an experiment to explore ways to employ modified 2,000-pound class GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) against “both moving and static maritime targets.” This particular test is part of a larger capabilities demonstration effort, dubbed Quicksink, that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is managing. Four GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs are seen loaded on an F-15E Strike Eagle from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron in this picture released along with its announcement about the Quicksink test in August 2021., USAF “A Navy submarine has the ability to launch and destroy a ship with a single torpedo at any time, but by launching that weapon it gives away the location of the vessel,” an official Air Force news item said. “The QUICKSINK JCTD [Joint Capability Technology Demonstration] aims to develop a low-cost method of achieving torpedo-like seaworthy kills from the air.” The video montage below ends with a clip of a decommissioned Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate having its back broken by a Mk 48 torpedo during a U.S. Navy-led exercise earlier this year, underscoring the anti-ship capabilities that those weapons offer. You can read more about that exercise here . The August test involving the F-15Es built on lessons learned from another Quicksink experiment conducted last year that saw a B-52H bomber from the 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron drop JDAMs ” in order to assess the viability of specific maritime impact conditions,” according to the Air Force. The Air Force did not say how the GBU-31/Bs had been modified to enable them to engage moving targets. Standard JDAMs have a GPS-assisted Interial Navigation System (INS) guidance system that can only be used to point them at specific coordinates. There is a dual-mode 500-pound class Laser JDAM that the Air Force, as well as the Navy and Marines, do field, which features the addition of laser guidance that allows it to be used against targets in motion. However, the Air Force has also said that its go-to precision-guided bomb now for anti-ship strikes is the 2,000-pound class GBU-24/B Paveway laser-guided bomb and that this is an increasingly unacceptable option because of the risks imposed by the employment method. A laser-guided weapon would need something to actually lase the target, whether it be the launching aircraft or a separate platform, which would also have to be relatively close to the target (within line-of-sight) throughout the course of the strike. A Paveway laser-guided bomb seen right as it is about to hit a small boat target during a training exercise., USAF “Not only is this weapon [the GBU-24/B] less than ideal, it also reduces our survivability based on how it must be employed,” Air Force Major Andrew Swanson, an F-15E Weapon Systems Officer from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron, explained in a statement. “This munition [the modified GBU-31/B] can change all of that.” The pictures the Air Force released along with its announcement of the August Quicksink test showed an F-15E carrying four GBU-31/Bs without a fuze or anything else installed on their noses, as one would expect to see. This could suggest that the Air Force has or is in the process of developing a new seeker to go on the front of the bomb to enable it to engage static and moving maritime targets. A close-up of one of the GBU-31/Bs seen in the pictures the Air Force released along with its announcement about the August Quicksink test, showing no fuze or other seeker system fitted to the nose., USAF Some sort of multi-mode guidance system with a mix of options, such as millimeter-wave radar and imagining infrared seekers, in addition to the JDAM’s standard GPS/INS combination, could provide this capability. The Air Force already has at least one weapon, the GBU-53/B StormBreaker , in service now with this kind of seeker system. Last year, in a separate announcement regarding its Golden Horde networked swarming munitions program, AFRL also indirectly disclosed the existence of a guidance system that is capable, at least in part, of homing in on radio-frequency emissions and that is also small enough to be integrated into the 250-pound class GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB). That latter point is particularly interesting to note because, in the pictures that the Air Force provided in relation to the Quicksink test in August, the GBU-31/Bs have stickers on their noses where a fuze or seeker head would go. These stickers have the logo of the Advanced Concept Demo Programs office within AFRL’s Capability Concept Integration Branch. That logo features, in part, artwork showing silhouettes of four munitions networked together that is very similar to other art that the Air Force has released in relation to the Golden Horde program. It also has a silhouette that could represent an air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile, like the ones AFRL is helping to develop as part of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) program, and what may be a reference to the Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM) program, which you can read more about here . A close-up of the sticker seen on the front of one of the GBU-31/Bs. In the lower third is artwork that is very reminiscent of other art that has been released in relation to the Golden Horde program. At the upper right is a silhouette that could represent an air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile. The silhouette in the upper left could be a representation of the weapon being developed under the Miniature Self-Defense Munition program., USAF Two-way data-links and other networked munitions capabilities, such as those that the Air Force is developing under Golden Horde, could potentially provide a way to give JDAMs an anti-ship capability without the need for additional guidance options. Off-board assets could be used to track the target and pass constant updates on its position to a GBU-31/B after release. The JDAM’s existing GPS-assisted INS guidance package is effectively an autopilot that could be programmed to use that data to extrapolate the likely location of the ship even if these links were broken before impact, as well. Whatever the case, if the Air Force can succeed in finding a way to give its 2,000-pound class JDAMs the ability to engage moving ships, this would be a major development. It would add new anti-ship options to any aircraft that can carry the GBU-31/B, such as the F-15E and the B-52H. Upgrades to the B-52H , in particular, have already increased the total number of various kinds of JDAMs, as well as other weapons, that the aircraft can carry, both under its wings and inside its bomb bays. An Air Force briefing slide that offers an overview of upgrades to the B-52H’s internal stories-carrying capabilities in recent years., USAF If these modified GBU-31/Bs can achieve anywhere near torpedo-like capability when it comes to actually damaging enemy ships, the work being done through the Quicksink program could be even more significant. Add the wing kits that are available for the JDAM series of bombs into the equation, which would give the bombs substantially increased stand-off range, and the final result could be very useful anti-ship capability that can be readily integrated onto existing aircraft leveraging weapons already in widespread service. No matter what, improved stand-off capability of some kind would be critical to improving the survivability of a launch platform using existing laser-guided bombs for maritime strikes. The costs of converting existing GBU-31/Bs into these maritime strike versions could very be lower than fielding an all-new anti-ship weapon. If a multi-mode seeker is indeed one of the modifications, these bombs could also offer additional flexibility against other targets beyond ships, as well. Of course, it remains to be seen how close any modified precision-guided bomb can actually get to the anti-ship killing capability of torpedos, which have the added benefit of being able to deliver their destructive force to a ship well below the waterline . This creates completely different kinds of damage control issues for the target’s crew compared to what one could expect to see after above-the-water-line strikes. It could be hard for any bomb to reliably hit areas of the ship’s hull under the waves, if at all. Still, a 2,000-pound class bomb could still do an immense amount of damage to a ship, even in the case of a near-miss. Leveraging the armor-piercing and delayed detonation capabilities found on bunker-buster versions of the GBU-31/B could further increase its effectiveness in the maritime strike role, allowing the bomb to penetrate into a ship before exploding. Bunker buster versions of the GBU-31/B., USAF Regardless, it’s not at all surprising that the Air Force would be exploring various ways to increase its anti-ship capabilities, especially as the U.S. military’s attention, as a whole, has shifted to preparing potential for a potential major conflict against a near-peer adversary, such as Russia or China. China, in particular, has become a major focus area , as has the possibility of a large-scale war in the Pacific region, which would be a heavily maritime-centric fight . The Air Force has already been expanding its maritime capabilities, particularly on its bombers, in recent years. This includes the integration of the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) cruise missile onto the B-1B bomber and the addition of new air-dropped naval mines to the B-52H’s arsenal. Last year, General David Goldfein, then-Chief of Staff the Air Force, alluded to the development of another advanced air-launched anti-ship weapon. It will certainly be interesting going forward to learn more about these modified maritime strike-focused GBU-31/Bs, as well as other developments, in weapons and in new tactics, techniques, and procedures, which might also emerge from the broader Quicksink program.

Kyle Gunn,"Updated on Sep 14, 2021","To Those Who Served In Or Have Been Impacted By The War In Afghanistan, You Are Not Alone","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. These past few weeks have not been easy to witness in regards to the events in Afghanistan. As images and video of the Taliban sweeping back into power and the chaos at Hamid Karzai Internation Airport flooded the news, many began wondering what was the point of nearly 20 years of war and thousands of U.S. and allied troops killed. Before I became social media director here at The War Zone, I, like many of you, served. I deployed to southern Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2011 as a Marine and have been asking myself why did we expend so much blood and treasure for this result and if my time and energy spent there was all just a waste. It is impossible to reconcile all of those lives lost and all those broken minds and bodies while watching the very people who killed and maimed us come back into power so easily. Many people are hurting from these events, and no one group has a monopoly on this pain. Active duty, reserves, veterans, contractors, families or friends, an entire community around this war is feeling the effects of the last several weeks, months, and years. But we do not need to “suffer in silence” and we do not need to carry this pain alone. Comparisons to the fall of Saigon in 1975 are easy to make with the countless similarities. One aspect of the fall of Afghanistan and the fall of Saigon that could not be more different is the social environment and the mental health resources we have access to today. We learned our lesson in how we treat the men and women we ask so much of, and though we still have a ways to go, we are leaps and bounds ahead of where we were in 1975. We want to share with you all some of those mental health resources in the hopes they can help in some way. Maybe the best resource is one that is completely free—each other. Whether it is here in the comments section, or out in the offline world, reach out to your friends and family and check in on them. Connecting with an old friend is incredibly powerful for both parties involved. Make that call or send that text, you could save a life. We understand that there are many more resources than those we are about to share, but these are what we are familiar with, please share any more you have in the comments below. The Department of Veterans Affairs The VA is a great place to start for mental health resources and support for both veterans their families. The Veterans Crisis Line allows veterans, their families, and their friends to call, chat online, or text. You can call them at 1-800-273-8255 (this is also the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) and press 1, text at 838255, or chat online here . These services are confidential, run 24 hours a day, and the VA does perform follow-ups for those who connect via the crisis line. If you or someone you know is in crisis, this is a good place to start. The War Vet Call Center is another confidential call center that runs 24/7 but is geared toward combat veterans and their families. They can be reached at 1-877-WAR-VETS (1-877-927-8387). The Women Veterans Call Center , as you have guessed, caters to female veterans and the unique challenges they face as well as their families, friends, and caregivers.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The saga of dozens of dogs that had been under the care of a non-profit organization in Afghanistan and that had still been at Hamid Karzai International Airport in the country’s capital when the last American troops left earlier this week, continues to develop. It is now clear that this group of animals, which including trained working dogs, but none belonging to the U.S. government, was indeed released into the airport before the final U.S. military withdrawal. There is also a new report that the Taliban are in the process of rounding them up, with the hope of potentially putting some of them back to work. You can get fully up to speed on what was already known in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting on this matter here . Murad Gazdiev, a correspondent from Russian news outlet RT , reported on the issue of these dogs from the airport in Kabul earlier today. Gazdiev posted a video and pictures on Twitter of empty crates and carriers, among other things, but said the only dog he was able to find “was likely a stray.” “The Taliban’a [sic] commander of Kabul airport tells us US troops let their service dogs free as they evacuated,” Gazdiev wrote in a Tweet. “The dogs are being rounded up, and the Taliban plans to, in an ironic twist, put them back into service for the Islamic Emirate. (No, they weren’t sentenced to death).” Depending on the state of the working dogs, they could be valuable to the Taliban. It can cost anywhere between $50,000 and $150,000 to acquire and train military working dogs, depending on their intended roles, which can range from things like bomb detection to more general security work. Beyond that, any dogs running around the airport would simply be a potential hazard to future flight operations there. Hungry and dehydrated dogs could easily be a danger to themselves and others, too. So, the Taliban certainly has a general incentive to round them up. The video below reportedly shows dogs roaming around Hamid Karzai International Airport after the final American withdrawal earlier this week. However, it is difficult to say with absolute certainty that these were from the group that had been in crates and carriers and was subsequently released. The exact fate of any of the dogs remains unclear, regardless of what the Taliban’s plans might be for them. Kabul Small Animal Rescue (KSAR), a non-profit that runs a shelter outside of Kabul, previously said it had brought approximately 130 dogs to the airport in Kabul in the hopes of getting them evacuated. Around 50 of those dogs were “working dogs abandoned by contractors who supported the U.S. mission,” KSAR founder Charlotte Maxwell-Jones told Stars and Stripes in a separate interview published today. The U.S. military and the U.S. State Department have publicly denied leaving any of their working dogs behind in Afghanistan. It is also not clear when KSAR took responsibility for these other working dogs and whether the contractors in question may have been working for the now-defunct government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan at the time. KSAR’s Maxwell-Jones, along with members of the non-profit’s staff and their families, more than 125 people in total, first arrived at Hamid Karzai International Airport last week. They brought the dogs, as well as dozens of cats, last week. She told Stars and Stripes that the Taliban had prevented anyone but her from entering the airport initially, but that she was able to get the dogs inside. Nine of her staff were also able to evacuate, but the rest remain in the country. “All the service members on the ground were very nice,” Maxwell-Jones said of her experience after getting into the airport. “They helped take care of the animals; they took them out; they cuddled them. They were really, really great.” “But some of the higher-ups were like: ‘You’re using our resources,” she continued. “We need to get people out. Do you care about animals more than people?’” The exact factors that prevent KSAR’s dogs from being loaded onto military evacuation flights remain murky. Though the U.S. military had repeatedly stressed that it would focus more on getting people rather than anything else out as the withdrawal deadline, Aug. 31, loomed closer, it is also known that Air Force cargo planes and charter flights were not always leaving Kabul fully loaded. “I didn’t ask to move animals instead of people,” Maxwell-Jones told Stars and Stripes . “I said let’s move them in addition.” Evacuees board a US Air Force C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane at Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 24, 2021., CENTCOM A previous statement from SPCA International, one of the non-profit’s partners, focused blame on a policy decision by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As The War Zone has previously noted, there could well have been additional issues with the importation of any animals into the various foreign countries where American evacuation flights headed first after leaving Afghanistan. Whatever the issue or issues on the U.S. military side might have been, it is also known that the U.S. government did not succeed in getting all of the individuals that it had wanted to out of Afghanistan before the last American troops left. This includes hundreds of American citizens . Separately, Maxwell-Jones says that eight separate charter flights she had tried to book as part of an independent evacuation effort, dubbed Operation Hercules, to get the animals, and her staff and their families, out of Afghanistan had ended up getting canceled. This cost “her a substantial amount of money in nonrefundable deposits,” according to Stars and Stripes . No details were provided as to why these cancellations occurred. Maxwell-Jones is still in Afghanistan now and is continuing to working on getting KSAR’s animals and its staff out of the country. She says she still hoping to get the dogs, including the working dogs, that had been at the airport back, though that seems increasingly unlikely. In the meantime, KSAR is also still looking to rescue any other dogs that may have been abandoned as part of the recently concluded evacuation efforts. Other animal welfare organizations are doing the same, as well. We will still have to wait and see what the future holds for the dogs at the airport in Kabul, but at least now we know that they were not left to starve in their crates, or worse.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 31, 2021",Here’s What Is Really Going On With Those Dogs The U.S. Supposedly Abandoned At Kabul’s Airport (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Central Command has denied leaving any dogs in cages at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, or abandoning any U.S. military working dogs , as the last American troops made their final historic exit from the country. A picture of rescue dogs in carriers in a hangar at the airport has been circulating online and has prompted a firestorm of criticism. However, questions do remain about the ultimate fate of these non-U.S. working dogs. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Karen Roxberry, a spokesperson for Central Command (CENTCOM), issued an official statement on the matter today. Various animal welfare organizations in Afghanistan and outside of the country had been working to evacuate dozens of dogs and cats from the country as part of the larger evacuation operations at the airport in Kabul over the past two weeks. The work of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue (KSAR), a non-profit organization, and Nowzad , an animal rescue charity, have drawn particular media attention. A member of Kabul Small Animal Rescue’s staff holds a puppy., Kabul Small Animal Rescue “The U.S. priority mission was the evacuation of U.S. citizens, SIV and vulnerable Afghans,” Roxberry’s statement reads, referring to, in part, Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) due to the risks they face from the Taliban due to having worked with the U.S. government. “However, to correct erroneous reports, the US military did not leave any dogs in cages at Hamid Karzai International Airport, to include the reported ‘military working dogs.'” “Photos circulating online were animals under the care of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not dogs under the care of the U.S. military,” the statement continues. “Despite an ongoing complicated and dangerous retrograde mission, U.S. forces went to great lengths to assist the Kabul Small Animal Rescue as much as possible.” The U.S. military is known to have evacuated its own working dogs previously. The U.S. State Department has also denied that any of its working dogs were left behind in Afghanistan. Many Afghans outraged and offended Americans evacuated service dogs in Kabul, but left people behind, including so many who helped the United States pic.twitter.com/DpnaZpWCux — Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) August 16, 2021 State Dept spox also confirms that all of its working dogs were evacuated from Afghanistan. “None were left behind.” https://t.co/xrgVmc7SHA — Jacqueline Feldscher (@jacqfeldscher) August 31, 2021 The CENTCOM statement, however, does not speak directly to some of the other allegations leveled by KSAR and other animal welfare organizations regarding the fate of approximately 130 other dogs that had been at Hamid Karzai International Airport. This group of animals is understood to have included some number of former Afghan security forces working dogs. KSAR had been working to get them out of the country as part of an effort dubbed Operation Hercules. “In the end, the dogs and their caretakers were explicitly NOT allowed to board military aircraft, and numerous private charter aircraft were not granted access to the airport either,” according to a lengthy statement issued yesterday by SPCA International, which cited information provided by KSAR founder Charlotte Maxwell-Jones. “Charlotte was informed that most of the KSAR dogs had to be released into the airport on August 30 as the airport was evacuated – turning once rescued shelter dogs into homeless strays.” At the time of that statement, Maxwell-Jones remained in Afghanistan and had reportedly been escorted from the airport back to her shelter, which is situated approximately seven miles outside of Kabul, by the Taliban. Other KSAR staff, along with an unspecified number of rescue cats, were described as being “at another location in Kabul.” KSAR employees at work., Kabul Small Animal Rescue The exact particulars of why the animals were reportedly not allowed to board military evacuations flights and why chartered aircraft arranged on behalf of KSAR may not have been allowed to land at the airport in Kabul are still murky. “The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recently enacted policy suspending transports of dogs from Afghanistan and more than 100 other nations into the U.S., was another terrible impediment, despite our negotiations and pleadings,” according to the SPCA International statement. “We applied for an Emergency Exemption so that Charlotte and the dogs could get out on our chartered flight this week. But the CDC’s adherence to its import policy during this time of crisis put animals and people at risk,” it continued. “We are alarmed that leaders at the CDC are not bringing a more balanced perspective to the importation of dogs, especially after the U.S. House of Representatives rebuked CDC on this issue and passed an amendment to restore a proper screening process.” There could also have been similar issues at play with regards to the importation of animals into countries other than the United States. U.S. military evacuation flights did not head straight to the United States after leaving Afghanistan . In addition, in a now-deleted Tweet yesterday, KSAR had also mentioned “we have so much $ awaiting refunds in canceled flights,” raising questions about the actual status of the expected charter flight. As of Aug. 29, there had been word that another non-profit organization called Veteran Sheepdogs of America had offered to take KSAR’s animals out on a plane it had chartered, but that there were concerns about whether that aircraft could even get to Kabul. Tweets today between Veteran Sheepdogs of America and Gray Television personality Greta Van Susteren indicate that there may be an emerging legal tussle over the whole situation. I called Charlotte in Kabul this morning – about 3 hours ago – and she told me this is a scam. https://t.co/CbNfyJzKBi — Greta Van Susteren (@greta) August 31, 2021 Regardless, everything we know and continue to learn about the last few days of the evacuation operations indicates that it was full of mad scrambles to get people to the airport in Kabul and onto planes on the ground to get them out. It would not necessarily be surprising that many charter aviation companies, whether they believed they could get approval to land or not, might have been hesitant to make the trip. The U.S. military had separately stressed that in the final stages of the evacuations it would prioritize people above all else, as CENTCOM’s statement today reiterates. It is not hard to see how American officials at Hamid Karzai International Airport would have been more preoccupied with finding space on any remaining flights for humans, rather than animals. At the same time, there were reports of official evacuation flights leaving Kabul with room to spare in the leadup to the final American withdrawal. As it stands, the United States was not able to evacuate everyone it had wanted to in the end, regardless, and is now exploring other options to get remaining American citizens and at-risk Afghans out of the country. “We’ll continue to do everything we can to evacuate Kabul Small Animal Rescue’s staff and animals from the country after August 31,” Lori Kalef, Director of Programs at SPCA International, had said in the statement from that organization yesterday, highlighting that people, as well as animals, are also part of this particular equation. “We cannot thank our supporters enough for everything they’ve done to help the dogs and cats of Kabul and their caretakers.” “Charlotte here! I want to apologize for the quiet social media,” according to a post just today on KSAR’s official Facebook page. “We are busy making plans, checking them twice, sorting out details, and keeping things quiet to maintain our own and the animals’ security.” This is not the only instance of disputes between animal welfare organizations operating in Afghanistan and government officials during the recent evacuations from Afghanistan, either. Nowzad, which is based in the United Kingdom and is run by Paul “Pen” Farthing, a former Royal Marine, drew criticism in the past week over its own rescue effort. Farthing arrived in London on Sunday with 150 rescue animals on a private charter flight, but left 68 members of his staff behind. He had been working to get the animals to the airport in Kabul right as Afghanistan’s branch of ISIS launched its deadly terrorist attack last week . A total of 13 American service members and at least 170 Afghans died in that attack, and dozens more were wounded. Critics in the United Kingdom, including government officials, had implied that Farthing’s activities had taken up valuable resources that could have been used to help people get inside to safety before and after that attack. Farthing disputed that U.K. authorities had provided any assistance to him, at all. “I did that with the Taliban… Nobody facilitated my entry… any interpreters or anybody else, there was me and the truck full of dogs and cats,” he said in a subsequent interview . Paul “Pen” Farthing holds a puppy., Nowzad However, he also thanked the U.K. government for its support in the end. That statement came after The Times newspaper reported that it had obtained an audio recording of him leaving an expletive-laden voicemail for a special adviser to the country’s Defense Secretary Ben Wallace over allegations that his animal evacuation flight was being blocked. All told, the exact fate of KSAR’s dogs that were at the airport in Kabul remains unknown. Beyond that, only time will tell what will now happen to that organization, its staff, and its remaining cats, as well as Nowzad staff. Updated 9/1/2021: The Taliban have since confirmed that the dogs in question were released into the airport and are still on the loose. They say they are trying to round them up now and may be interested in putting any working dogs among them to use in the future. Stars and Stripes has also published an interview with Charlotte Maxwell-Jones about the entire situation.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 25, 2021",Huge Taliban Parade Features Throngs Of U.S.-Bought Vehicles And A Black Hawk Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Taliban held an absolutely massive victory parade in the Afghan city of Kandahar today, involving dozens of U.S.-supplied vehicles that the group captured from the former Afghan National Defense and Security Forces as it seized control of the country. At least one ex-Afghan Air Force UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter flew overhead during the procession, which took at least 35 minutes to pass by in its entirety. Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban’s current supreme leader, or Emir, was widely expected to make an appearance at a following rally, but did not . The Taliban first emerged in 1994 and Kandahar, which is the capital of the Afghan province of the same name, holds special significance for the group. In September 1996, they declared the establishment of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and that this city was its capital. Kandahar Province’s Khakrez District is also the birthplace of Mullah Mohammed Omar, the founder of the Taliban and its first supreme leader until his death in 2013. U.S.-supplied Mobile Strike Force Vehicles (MSFV) and other vehicles that the Taliban captured in their recent conquest of Afghanistan taking part in a huge parade in the city of Kandahar on Sept. 1, 2021., via Twitter Now, almost 25 years later, and nearly two decades after the Islamic Emirate was toppled by the United States, it is hardly surprising that the triumphant Taliban would head here to mark its return to power. The parade included a variety of different captured U.S.-supplied vehicles, including Navistar MaxxPro Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected (MRAP) armored trucks, up-armored Humvees , Ford and Toyota pickup trucks, and Navistar 7000-series trucks. At least one of the Navistar 7000s had a 122mm D-30 howitzer on its rear bed. Other vehicles in the procession had various weapons mounted, as well, including a number of Humvees carrying 23mm ZU-23-2 automatic cannons. There was also a line of Mobile Strike Force Vehicle (MSFV) light armored vehicles. The 4×4 MSFV design was developed specifically for the Afghan military, through a contract with the U.S. military, and was derived from the U.S. Army’s M1117 Armored Security Vehicle (ASV) armored car. As already noted, a UH-60 helicopter was also seen flying overhead during the parade. Video had emerged last week reportedly showing a Black Hawk under Taliban control taxiing on the ground at the airport in Kandahar. Earlier this week, additional footage appeared that was reported to show one of these helicopters flying over Kandahar. It’s possible that all of these clips show the same helicopter. An individual was seen suspended below the helicopter in multiple clips of the earlier flight this week and it remains unclear why. Despite reports that this was a person being brutally handed, multiple videos appear to show the person moving freely in what looks to be a harness of some kind. There was at least one report that the Taliban was trying to use this combination to hang the group’s flag on top of a building. The Taliban have captured dozens of former Afghan military aircraft in various conditions. This including dozens of planes and helicopters at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, which the U.S. military said it disabled in unspecified ways ahead of the final historic withdrawal of American troops from the country this week. The ability of the Taliban to operate and maintain any of the aircraft it has captured, but especially more modern U.S.-financed platforms that the Afghan Air Force had acquired, such as the UH-60s and A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft , remains to be seen. The War Zone has explored these issues in detail previously. However, it is clear that the Taliban have been able to find the means necessary to fly at least one Black Hawk, something that is, at best, a highly embarrassing visual for the United States. The group had also seized hundreds of vehicles, as well as troves of small arms, light weapons, and other materiel from Afghan government security forces in the weeks leading up to the fall of Kabul and the final collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan last month. Parades like the one today in Kandahar are clearly meant to further underscore the Taliban’s victory over the former Afghan government and its American benefactors and highlight the very real spoils of war the group has obtained as a result. At the same time, the Taliban now faces its own challenges in governing. A nascent anti-Taliban resistance has emerged in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul and Afghanistan’s branch of ISIS is as opposed to the Islamic Emirate as it is to the United States . There appears to be no massive rush by foreign countries to recognize the Taliban’s new leadership as the rightful rulers of Afghanistan, either, despite the group actively seeking out such ties . Haji Yusuf Wafa, the Taliban’s new governor Kandahar, who led the rally after the parade, reiterated a promise of a general amnesty to former officials who had served the Islamic Republic. The Taliban has previously said that it wants to block Afghans from leaving the country, ostensibly to prevent a brain drain and help get their new Islamic Emirate on its feet. Of course, there have already been multiple, credible reports that the Taliban has been hunting down and executing opponents of its new regime and others as it reinstitutes extremely hardline policies, such as bans on music and the public display of pictures. If nothing else, as the Taliban works to consolidate and legitimize its rule, it seems likely that we will see more parades that underscore its military prowess to maintain control.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The images are now part of history . Thousands of people crowded in dusty avenues, among sewer canals , all trying to reach a gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, and from there get out of a country now under Taliban control . All the while, U.S. special operations forces were using a secret gate to get people into the airport to safety, at least in part, as part of a reported deal with the Taliban. A report from CNN today says that the U.S. military made an agreement with the Taliban that saw the latter group escort American citizens safely into Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul at various times in the past two weeks. During these runs, the Americans would enter the airport through a “secret gate” in the perimeter managed by U.S. special operations forces personnel. A US Marine helps lift an Afghan into Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on Aug. 26, 2021., CENTCOM “The officials said Americans were notified to gather at pre-set ‘muster points’ close to the airport where the Taliban would check their credentials and take them a short distance to a gate manned by American forces who were standing by to let them inside amid huge crowds of Afghans seeking to flee,” according to CNN . “One of the key muster points was a Ministry of Interior building just outside the airport’s gates where nearby US forces were readily able to observe the Americans approach.” “US special operations forces set up a ‘secret gate’ at the airport and established ‘call centers’ to guide Americans through the evacuation process,” the piece adds. “Americans were notified by various messages about where to gather.” This secret gate allowed Americans to avoid the more widely known official gates into Hamid Karzai International Airport, which were constantly jam-packed with thousands of Afghans hoping to secure entry and presented significant security risks. Last Thursday, terrorists from Afghanistan’s branch of ISIS launched a deadly attack outside one of the formal gates, known as Abbey Gate, which killed 13 U.S. service members and at least 170 Afghans, and wounded many more. “It worked, it worked beautifully,” a U.S. government official told CNN of the secret gate and the arrangement with the Taliban that serviced it. CNN ‘s story does not say when the Taliban began escorting Americans to the airport or how many total U.S. citizens were brought there in this way. It does say that at certain points the Taliban were moving groups of people “several times a day.” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), had alluded to all of this in his remarks yesterday where he announced the end of America’s military presence in Afghanistan after nearly two decades. He had also highlighted the Taliban’s contributions to the evacuation operations multiple times, often talking about his former enemies in unusually positive ways. However, he had indicated that the U.S. special operations-led effort had also brought in non-Americans, as well. “Additionally, U.S. Special Operations Forces reached out to help break in – bring in more than 1,064 American citizens and 2017 SIVs [individuals eligible for Special Immigrant Visas], or Afghans at risk, and 127 third-country nationals, all via phone calls, vectors and escorting,” the CENTCOM boss had said. “They [the Taliban] were actually very helpful and useful to us as we closed down operations.” A US Marine pulls an Afghan into the perimeter of Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 26, 2021., CENTCOM There are also multiple reports that indicate that this U.S. special operations forces effort may have at least interfaced to some degree with a number of ad hoc groups , as well as individuals, working to get at-risk Afghans safely inside the airport. Active and retired U.S. service members inside Afghanistan and in the United States, as well as a host of others, have reportedly been involved in these activities. These rescue missions were largely coordinated using secure message boards and chat programs, as well as other online tools, in what became dubbed a “ Digital Dunkirk .” This is a reference to the famous U.K. government-led evacuation in 1940 of elements of the British Expeditionary Force from France during World War II. Last week, in an episode of the Zero Blog Thirty podcast, which you can listen to in full here , U.S. Marine Corps Major Thomas Schueman shared his own story of how he helped an interpreter he had worked with in Afghanistan get to the airport.  That interpreter and his wife and four children, all under the age of five, who are seen in the picture in the Tweet below, are now safely out of the country. However, he is still only referred to as Zak to protect his immediate family, as well as other family members and individuals connected to him that are still in Afghanistan. Schueman specifically mentioned the use of a “secret gate,” where Zak would have been challenged to say a coded phrase, like something one would expect to see in a spy thriller, as one option that was considered. It’s not clear if this is the same gate mentioned in the CNN report or if there were multiple such passageways in operation over the course of the evacuations. Ultimately, the Marine officer was able to coordinate directly with U.S. military personnel at the airport who plucked Zak and his family out of a crowd right next to a Taliban checkpoint and pulled them inside. Earlier this week, a report also came out about a group called Task Force Pineapple that had spirited hundreds of Afghans into the airport, including as many as 500 as part of a single push dubbed Operation Pineapple Express . That effort was going on right up until last week’s terrorist attack. Though that story does not specifically mention the use of secret gates, it does describe the employment of specially-designated individuals who would challenge evacuees to say coded phrases or present some other form of password to get into the airport, such as a picture of a pineapple on their phones. Regardless, these reports of secret gates operated by American special operators, the use of coded signals, and deals with the Taliban, only add to the still growing and oftentimes bizarre-sounding story of the final days of America’s nearly two-decade-long military presence in Afghanistan. We can only expect more stories of ingenuity, heroism and unusual agreements of convenience to emerge as time goes on.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With the Taliban now triumphantly in control of Hamid Karzai International Airport following the historic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, pictures and video have begun to emerge of the military aircraft, as well as vehicles and other materiel, left behind. The head of U.S. Central Command, U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, had announced yesterday that a total of 73 planes and helicopters, among other things, had been “demilitarized” at the airport before the last American troops left, as you can read more about here . You can read more about the final pull-out itself in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting here . Independent open-source researchers Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans, who run the blog Oryx , have been tracking how many former Afghan military aircraft have fallen into Taliban hands for weeks now. They say they have been able to identify at least 48 individual aircraft, 16 fixed-wing planes and 32 helicopters, in the imagery that has emerged from the airport in Kabul so far. An ex-Afghan Air Force A-29 Super Tucano sits among debris in a hangar at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on Aug. 31, 2021., WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images The fixed-wing types are all from the former Afghan military and include 8 A-29 Super Tucano light attack planes, 2 AC-208 armed light utility aircraft , 4 Cessna 208 Caravan utility aircraft, one C-130H Hercules transport plane, and a lone Pilatus PC-12NG intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform. The Afghan Air Force operated the country’s fleets of A-29s, AC-208s, Cessna 208s, and C-130Hs. Afghanistan’s Special Mission Wing (SMW), a separate dedicated special operations aviation force, had been the only unit to fly the PC-12NG.

Another five former U.S. State Department CH-46E Sea Knights are visible in the pictures and video that have come out, as well. This leaves at least 25 aircraft still unaccounted for, based on the official total that General McKenzie provided. It also remains unclear if the State Department CH-46Es, which had already been disabled in some way nearly two weeks ago, as The War Zone was first to report , were included in his figure. Regardless, the State Department said it had abandoned seven Sea Knights altogether, so there should still be the remains of two more at Hamid Karzai International Airport. The imagery from the airport in Kabul also offers some insight into how all of these aircraft were “demilitarized.” Engine cowlings and access panels are seen open on many planes and helicopters, indicating that certain parts were removed or destroyed. An area on the ground underneath the engine of one of the A-29s is heavily stained with lubricant, further suggesting action was taken to disable its PT6 turboprop engine. Oil is seen pooled under the engine of an abandoned A-29., WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images Windows on various helicopters are smashed, as are the gauges in some of the cockpits, while deliberate holes have been cut in the main cabin doors of the Black Hawks. The C-130H is seen now sitting at angle, wing down, with its left main undercarriage now apparently damaged and one of its props is feathered. A view from inside a helicopter showing its smashed windscreen., WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images A good view of the current state of the former Afghan Air Force C-130H at the airport in Kabul., WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images The U.S. military has said that all 73 of the aircraft that McKenzie mentioned are now permanently disabled. “They can look all they want but they can’t fly them,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told CNN this morning. “Those aircraft will never fly again when we left,” General McKenzie had said yesterday. “They’ll never be able to be operated by anyone. Most of them were non-mission capable, to begin with, but certainly they’ll never be able to be flown again.” McKenzie’s point about at least some of the aircraft being unusable to begin is supported by some of the imagery that is now available. One picture notably shows a Cessna 208 aircraft sitting on its tail with no engine and no nose gear, and with the word “SLUDGE” spray-painted on the side, a state that is very different from that of the other Caravans and AC-208s. The “SLUDGE” Cessna 208., WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images How many aircraft the Afghan military had on hand, at all, prior to the Taliban’s sweep across the country earlier this month, and what condition they were all in, is unclear. A number of fixed-wing planes and helicopters, including a number of A-29s, Cessna 208s, PC-12NGs, UH-60s, and Mi-8/Mi-17-types, managed to flee to neighboring Uzbekistan and Tajikstan. You can read more specifically about the 46 aircraft that escaped to Uzbekistan’s Termez Airport here . At least some sensitive equipment may have been removed from many of the aircraft before the fall of Kabul, as well. “The contractors also took proprietary software and weapons systems with them,” Lieutenant General Sami Sadat, the former commander of the Afghan National Army’s 215th Corps, wrote in a piece for The New York Times last week. “They physically removed our helicopter missile-defense system,” he continued. “Access to the software that we relied on to track our vehicles, weapons and personnel also disappeared. Real-time intelligence on targets went out the window, too.” The A-29s notably appear to be missing their sensor turrets, but at least one is seen still fitted to an AC-208. These turrets contain a mix of electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser designator. These aircraft could use the laser designator to mark targets for precision-guided muntions, including laser-guided bombs and 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) laser-guided rockets. There were reports weeks ago that stocks of these weapons were dangerously low , if they had not been entirely expended. An abandoned AC-208 at Hamid Karzai International Airport with its sensor turret visible under the fuselage., WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images What is left of the PC-12NG is less clear. The overall configuration of these highly specialized aircraft remains something of a mystery, to begin with. This has long made them a significant question mark in terms of possible capabilities that the Taliban could gain from capturing them or potential intelligence vulnerabilities. The potential intelligence value of much of what else the group has captured so far would seem to be limited, especially for larger American opponents, such as Russia or China. Regardless, the demilitarization process does not appear to have involved total destruction of any of the aircraft as many had expected would be the case, a decision that seems curious. Heavy equipment at the airport could conceivably have been used to more thoroughly destroy the planes and helicopters in relatively short order. Any need for extensive repairs to fix any cutting that was done into portions of the airframe, including stringers and other supporting structures , would present a significant hurdle to making them airworthy again. Taliban could still use any salvageable spare parts and other components to try to get other aircraft they have captured working again. Video emerged just yesterday purportedly showing the Taliban flying a Black Hawk that they had previously captured intact . Those clips also showed an individual suspended below the helicopter for unclear reasons. Various weapons and other systems from the aircraft at the airport in Kabul could also be repurposed. It is particularly interesting to note that the .50 caliber M3 machine guns in the wings of the A-29s appear to still be in place, though we can’t see if the main bodies of these guns have been destroyed or otherwise disabled in some way. Even if the Taliban can’t make any of the Super Tucanos flyable again, these guns, if they are functional, could be removed and mounted on other platforms, even though they are intended primarily for aircraft use. Militant and terrorist groups have been spotted using aircraft-specific variants of the .50 caliber M2 machine gun, from which the M3 is derived, in ground roles in the past. The pictures and video from Hamid Karzai International Airport also show various other materiel, including vehicles, ammunition, and body armor, among other things, that have now fallen into Taliban hands. There is also at least one picture that shows destroyed computer hard drives that could have held sensitive information. McKenzie said that dozens of MRAPs and Humvees had also been demilitarized at the airport, but the imagery we have now also shows various pickup trucks and at least one Polaris MRZR all-terrain vehicle there, as well. The state of those vehicles is unclear.

The usability of those MSFVs, which are American-made light armored vehicles based on the design of the U.S. Army’s M1117 Armored Security Vehicle (ASV) armored car, is unknown. All of this only adds to the pile of other vehicles and weapons, as well as dozens of other aircraft, that the Taliban captured earlier this month in the final phase of its conquest of Afghanistan. Of course, questions remain about the Taliban’s ability to effectively utilize much of the equipment they’ve captured, whatever state it is, especially when it comes to higher-end aircraft, such the A-29s or UH-60s. Even if they can get various aircraft and vehicles working, maintaining them could present additional challenges. Of course, the Mi-8/Mi-17-series helicopters, which have a much longer history in the region, as well as various vehicles and light weapons, are likely to be easier for the group to operate and maintain for a more protracted period of time. The Taliban could also seek outside support to help sustain even the more exquisite gear they’ve now come into possession of. For instance, the group is actively courting formal relations with China , which purchased a number of S-70 helicopters , the commercial cousin of the UH-60, in the 1980s. The People’s Liberation Army now has decades of experience operating and maintain the type and the Chinese have even now developed their own Black Hawk clone . Other avenues to make use of various captured materiel could be available to the Taliban, as well, including simply selling items to anyone who might be interested. Beyond all this, the captured troves of U.S.-supplied aircraft and other weapons and materiel are simply valuable trophies for the Taliban and further reflections of them having outlasted the United States after nearly two decades of conflict . The group has clearly been keen to make a show of what it has now seized at their airport in Kabul as part of the celebration of its final victory. Members of the Taliban sit in the cockpit of an ex-Afghan Air Force C-130H cargo plane at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul., WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images No matter what, the imagery of the captured aircraft and other materiel left behind at the airport in Kabul, regardless of its state, marks a high point for the Taliban and a low one for the United States.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 26, 2021",Here’s What The U.S. Military Left Behind At Kabul Airport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has now withdrawn entirely from Afghanistan after nearly 20 years of operations in the country. As expected , at the very end, the U.S. military ensured that a variety of weapons and equipment, both American and that had belonged to the Afghan government, were destroyed or otherwise disabled. You can get up to speed on what is otherwise known about the final departure of U.S. forces in our report linked here . At a press conference today, U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), said the following items had been “demilitarized” at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul: At least two Counter-Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM) defense systems A total of 73 aircraft, including U.S. and Afghan airframes 70 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored trucks 27 Humvees A Centurion C-RAM defense system., US Army McKenzie didn’t elaborate on what had been done to any of these systems to render them unusable. The head of CENTCOM also did not name the type of C-RAM systems, which had been used to defend the Hamid Karzai International Airport against a rocket attack by the Afghanistan branch of ISIS just today. He also did not say specifically how many in total were there at the very end, though at least two were previously said to have been in place. The Centurion, each of which costs around $15 million and that you can read more about here , is the only operational U.S. military C-RAM system at present. Individuals on the ground had reported hearing the characteristic sound of the Centurium’s 20mm Vulcan cannon during the recent rocket attack. It is interesting to note that no pictures or videos have since emerged to independently confirm the presence of Centurions at Hamid Karzai International Airport. The New York Times had also previously reported that a C-RAM system, likely another Centurion, had been disabled at the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul when it was fully evacuated two weeks ago. The War Zone has reached out to the U.S. State Department to confirm that system was indeed rendered inoperable. McKenzie did not provide any granular breakdown about the aircraft that were disabled at the airport, either, but he did say that some were already in a state of disrepair. This large total includes dozens of former Afghan Air Force aircraft. Various new and old Afghan Air Force aircraft were at Hamid Karzai International Airport at the time of the final withdrawal, including more recent U.S.-supplied additions, such as A-29 Super Tucano light attack planes, C-130H Hercules transport aircraft, and UH-60 Black Hawk and Mi-17 transport helicopters . Other types that have been out of service for years, such as the L-39 armed jet trainers , three of which are seen in a picture in the Tweet below, were also still there. There have been questions for some time about what steps the U.S. government might take to prevent fixed-wing planes and helicopters that had belonged to the Afghan military from falling into the Taliban’s hands. A picture is circulating online, which is seen in the Tweet below and may well be dated, shows an ex-Afghan Air Force UH-60 Black Hawk with smashed windows and holes cut in its main cabin doors. It also shows dog carriers, some with dogs inside, but it’s not clear what the ultimate fate of these animals might have been. Of course, the Taliban has already captured a number of former Afghan military aircraft at other bases around the country. Afghan crews were also able to fly dozens of others out of the country, including into Uzbekistan, as you can read more about here . Questions remain about how readily the Taliban might be able to utilize the more modern platforms it now possesses, such as the A-29s and UH-60s, as you can read more about here . Video did appear earlier today purporting to show a Taliban-operated Black Hawk in flight. The clip shows an individual suspended by below for unclear reasons. Just a #US supplied UH-60 Blackhawk formerly of the #Afghanistan Air Force hovering over rows of #Taliban flags in Kandahar while dangling someone out the side pic.twitter.com/zndhBcdKvc — Joseph Dempsey (@JosephHDempsey) August 30, 2021 We also don’t know whether the 73 aircraft McKenzie mentioned included the seven CH-46E Sea Knight helicopters that the U.S. State Department said it had disabled in some fashion and abandoned at the airport in Kabul last week, but it likely does. The War Zone had been the first to report on that development. Video has now emerged that appears to have been shot by reporters on the ground and shows members of the Taliban, which are very well equipped, inspecting the disabled Sea Knights. Some people are misidentifying these helicopters as CH-47 Chinooks . It’s a sad end for the aircraft that were deeply renovated in the last decade and will now likely be used as Taliban trophies. EXPECTATION: We will see more imagery of #Taliban forces with the many #Afghanistan Air Force aircraft that remained at Kabul Aiport REALITY: They may seem complete but we can probably assume rendered inoperable by departing #US forces over the last two weeks. pic.twitter.com/lbt7hI0flE — Joseph Dempsey (@JosephHDempsey) August 30, 2021 In their lightning-quick conquest of Afghanistan earlier this month, the Taliban also seized significant numbers of Humvees , as well as other vehicles, including MRAPs and pickup trucks, among many other things. Still, it makes good sense that the U.S. military would look to deny the group access to dozens more, especially if they were up to U.S. standards. #BREAKING As you see in photos #Taliban captured multiple Ford Rangers,1 MaxxPro MRAP, 1 122mm D-30 howitzer artillery and 1 Zu 23-2 anti Air crafts HMG mounted on Ranger. This ain't the full list. in the video below in comment you see a little bit of weaponry seized by Taliban. pic.twitter.com/f6OmmRQJgZ — IEA (previous)—(Now) IEAFG (@IEAFG) August 7, 2021 There was definitely other materiel that the U.S. military destroyed in place at the airport or otherwise disabled before the final withdrawal beyond what McKenzie mentioned at the press conference, as well. For example, we know that American troops broke down various Afghan small arms and light weapons . It’s was largely expected that the U.S. military would leave behind at least some equipment, including certain higher-end systems, during the final withdrawal. Each one of the Centurions alone would have likely required a single C-17 to airlift it out and loading them onto the planes would have taken hours to do. During that window, the forces still at the airport in Kabul would have been without their protective umbrella, one that was needed just hours prior. As such, the call was made to leave the systems and quickly destroy their capabilities so that everyone could leave with as small a window of vulnerability as possible. McKenzie did say that equipment “necessary for airport operations,” such as airport crash trucks and other civilian ground vehicles, were left intact for the Taliban. Getting the airport reopened is very important to the possibility of getting the hundreds of U.S. citizens left in the country out, as well as other foreign nationals and at-risk Afghans. That is if the Taliban really does allow it. All told, a full accounting of everything that was abandoned in Kabul at the end, functional or not, is still yet to come. We will update this story as more information becomes available. You can find our follow-up coverage on what was left behind at Hamid Karzai International Airport here .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 31, 2021",These Two Images Represent The Beginning And The End Of America’s War In Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The two images above aren’t separated that much in terms of where they were taken geographically, but they deviate greatly in terms of how far apart they were taken in time. They represent the operation that would send the first Americans into Afghanistan to kick off the war there, as well as the greater Global War On Terror as we now know it, and the last American soldier to step foot on Afghan soil. The first image was taken on September 19th, 2001, the other was taken today, August 30th, 2021. They are now the alpha and the omega of America’s war in Afghanistan, visually speaking. The image taken on September 19th, 2001 shows CIA operatives aboard a Mi-17 helicopter in Uzbekistan. In the following days, the CIA would make its first clandestine flight into Afghanistan. We did two separate stories on the circumstances surrounding this historic image, which you can check out here and here , but this is our description of it, specifically: The image shows the open rear of a Russian-built Mi-17 with heavily armed men sitting on ammunition cans in the back with just ropes tied around them to ensure they don’t fall to their death if they slip out the back during flight. The mission depicted took place on September 19th, 2001, just eight days after the attacks on 9/11. The CIA says it was to pick up $3M in cash in three cardboard boxes. That money would be used to pay the Northern Alliance to spearhead the fight against the Taliban and to buy the allegiance of local warlords. CIA operators hang out the back of an Mi-17. The Nestle box, one of three, is full of cash., CIA This was the beginning of America’s mission in Afghanistan. On September 26th, CIA operatives would fly into Afghanistan to make contact with tribal warlords and the leadership of the Northern Alliance , which opposed the Taliban. Millions in cash was used to buy their loyalty and jumpstart robust military operations. This operation, dubbed “Jawbreaker,” would spark what became a blitz across the country spearheaded by U.S. special operators, American airpower, and the Northern Alliance, and would bring about the Taliban’s fall from power. By November of 2001, the Taliban would be chased from Kabul. By December, they would no longer control any stronghold in the country and would subsequently morph into an enduring insurgent force. Fast forward nearly 20 years and we have what will become the quintessential image of the war’s end . It shows the commander of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division, General Christopher Donahue, stepping onto a C-17 under the cover of darkness. He had overseen the evacuation operations and was the last person aboard the last transport to leave the country at 11:59 pm on August 30th, 2021, ending the U.S. military’s presence in the war-torn country. General Donahue was the last U.S. serviceperson out of Afghanistan., DoD In the time between the two photos, there were incredible examples of kindness and super-human bravery, as well as inhuman cruelty and evil. The breakdown of the dead reads as such, according to a recent piece by the Associated Press : American service members killed in Afghanistan through April: 2,461. U.S. contractors: 3,846. Afghan national military and police: 66,000. Other allied service members, including from other NATO member states: 1,144. Afghan civilians: 47,245. Taliban and other opposition fighters: 51,191. Aid workers: 444. Journalists: 72. In addition, countless people were wounded, some severely, including over 20,000 American troops. Massive amounts of treasure was spent, as well. Some estimates put the cost of America’s war in Afghanistan at $1 trillion and as high as over $2 trillion. On behalf of our team to all of the 800,000 service people who served in Afghanistan over the years, and to those who served there in any other capacity, as well as their family members, we want to thank you for all your efforts and sacrifices. While America’s overall military mission, and the strategies that defined it, in that country will be debated for many years to come, we must remember that the homeland never received another terror attack emanating from Afghanistan. I don’t think many would have predicted that in the dark days following 9/11. And even though the Taliban may be back in control of Afghanistan after 20 years of blood and treasure spent there, if there is one thing we should have learned over the last two decades, it is that Afghanistan’s future is anything but set in stone.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 19, 2021",The Story Of The Mysterious White 727 That Appeared In Kabul After The Bombing Of Abbey Gate,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The evacuation of Kabul is like none other in history. With open-source intelligence tools abound, including daily satellite images, flight tracking, and even a live camera feed overwatching Hamid Karzai International Airport, the average person can keep tabs on this historic event and unprecedented multi-national military operation in their own homes. In the panopticon that is today’s internet age, peculiarities stand out. One such surprise was seeing a gleaming-white, but quite geriatric 727-200 appear on Kabul’s ragged skyline, landing at the under siege airport amongst the constant flow of C-17s, A400Ms, C-130s, a few modern airliners, and other usual suspects. While all-white airframes aren’t supposed to attract much attention, that paint scheme is also synonymous with clandestine operations, including “whitewashed” aircraft often used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for low-profile operations abroad. With that reality in mind, keen observers keeping an eye on traffic at Hamid Karzai International rightfully started thinking this may be some CIA asset that was slipping in on a unique mission. It turns out, that wasn’t necessarily the case. Thanks to a wonderful story by Erika Gibson of South Africa’s Mail and Guardian , we learned the backstory on this most interesting of participants in the tumultuous aerial evacuation of Afghanistan. The 727, which belongs to a firm called Safe Air Company, takes off from Kabul. , Twitter Video Screencap/Reuters It turns out that Niel Steyl, the Captain of a four-decade-old 727-200 that flies for Safe Air Company , an airline and charter outfit based in Kenya, answered an emergency call from the U.S. State Department for immediate airlift assistance after a complex terrorist attack , which started with a suicide bombing, killed 13 U.S. troops, as well as at least 170 Afghans, on August 26th. At the time, Steyl, his crew, and their 727, which carries the Kenyan registration number 5Y-IRE and is aptly nicknamed Irene , were forward based out of neighboring Kulob, Tajikistan. In the past, they had supported what was a relatively steady drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan before the final dangerous push out of Kabul, which fell to the Taliban on August 15th. Steyl told the Mail and Guardian : “We received a desperate call from the US state department’s officials in Kabul after the suicide bombing attack on Thursday night asking whether we would be willing to assist with mercy flights… The urgency became critical to evacuate a group of Afghan special forces and their families. They have been assisting the US forces in the country for many years. As such, they would certainly have been killed by the Taliban as they are seen as traitors” Their cargo for the dangerous sortie would be hundreds of ex-Afghan special operations forces that were being lodged in a warehouse within the confines of the airport. These troops had worked with the Americans for years and they would be top Taliban targets, but finding room on military airlifters leaving the country became a huge challenge. Hence the mercy flights by Irene . It only took just 40 minutes to load up 308 people onto the cargo-configured 727, which would normally carry between a half and a third of that load during the type’s career as an airliner. Steyl recounted the following about the flight to the Mail and Guardian: “We expected a haggard group but were pleasantly surprised by the well-spoken and neatly dressed group – despite them being holed up in a warehouse under trying conditions for a week. It was humbling to experience the sheer relief and appreciation from their side that we came in time to save them.” Here’s a video of Irene in action, albeit on a far less volatile mission: Because the soldiers and their families could not fit on a single 727 flight, another trip would be needed. On the second trip, they had to stop all movement on the ground at Kabul and could not load and depart quickly because U.S. forces were executing a departure ceremony for the 13 Americans who died during the bombing at Abbey Gate. Once cleared to load and leave, the second flight saw 329 souls packed aboard the old 727. All of the refugees were taken back to Tajikistan where they would wait in a tent community until a further airlift arranged by the U.S. government could move them on to other locations once the evacuation of Kabul was complete. The passengers didn’t even know where they were when they landed, they were just happy to be out of Afghanistan and away from the Taliban. While Safe Air and Irene’s crew are no strangers to flying into dangerous areas in Africa, basically saving hundreds of people, entire families, from the clutches of the Taliban certainly must have been very rewarding. Still, an old 727 loaded with over three hundred people, while not having the millions of dollars worth of defensive capabilities that their military airlifter counterparts have, and flying into what is basically a war zone under extreme terrorist threat in the middle of the day, takes guts. Irene and her crew are one of many groups of heroes that risked life and limb for others during this tragic endcap to the two-decades-long war in Afghanistan. Once the last American boots leave Kabul and the dust settles, we know that there will be many other incredible stories to tell. But this one, about the little old 727 that could, is definitely worth spreading.

Previous pictures and video had already indicated that the American military presence there was already rapidly shrinking. The last U.S. aircraft took off at 11:59 pm local time, which ended nearly 20 years of American military presence in the country and an end to America’s longest war. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: No evacuees were left at the airport (inside) when the U.S. left.Â The commander on the ground let the Taliban commander know that the U.S. was leaving on five final aircraft, and that was all there was in terms of a ‘turnover’ of the airport. 123,000 were flown out as part of the evacuation in total. Many still remain, including Americans, which will now be dealt with diplomatically, at least overtly. A lot of equipment was demilitarized or destroyed in place at the airport instead of loaded onto an aircraft due to the need to get out safely and quickly. We have a new post in the works on this now, so stand by for details. Taliban-U.S. military relationship was characterized by CENTCOM commander General Kenneth F. McKenzie as “programmatic.” They were essential to securing the airport, although they were “not perfect,” they were key and “business-like” in their interactions.Â Even with 10 more days, General McKenzie says they would not have gotten everyone out they wanted to. He also acknowledged there are still Americans there that want out. McKenzie says he thinks the Taliban will have trouble fully securing Kabul. Three U.S. helicopter extractions during the evacuation rescued 185 U.S. citizens and 25 German citizens. You can read about the German component here. Beyond the helicopter airlift component, special operations forces worked to rescue 1,064 U.S. citizens and 2,017 SIV holders or at-risk Afghans, as well as 127 from other countries. This was done remotely by communications channels and escort. We are sure to hear more about these operations and how they overlapped with veteran operations of a similar nature in the days to come. Roughly 6,000 Americans were evacuated in total. General Chris Donohue, commander of the 82nd Airborne and the on-scene commander, and Acting Ambassador Ross Wilson, were the last U.S. officials or troops to step foot on Afghan soil and flew out of the last aircraft.

What is visible online includes at least one B-52H bomber , two AC-130J gunships , an RC-135W Rivet Joint spy plane , an E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane, an E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) jet, as well as a number of C-17A Globemaster III cargo planes and KC-135R and KC-10A tankers.Â MOOSE herd of C-17s following. ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ MOOSE81 09-9211 #AE49C7 ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ MOOSE83 07-7182 #AE20C3 ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ MOOSE85 07-7181 #AE20C2 ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ MOOSE86 08-8197 #AE2FA9 ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ MOOSE88 07-7173 #AE146B ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ MOOSE94 07-7185 #AE20C6 pic.twitter.com/WarjdsPO21 — Evergreen Intel (@vcdgf555) August 30, 2021 Among the KC-135Rs are a number of the U.S. Air Force’s small and secretive fleet of highly-specialized KC-135RT “receiver tankers” that are capable being refueling in mid-air themselves, which you can read more about here . These were among some of the earliest members of the evacuation airbridge, as you can read about here . This is also only what we can see via online flight tracking data. F/A-18 Hornets had flown low enough over Kabul in the lead up the final withdrawal to be spotted by individuals on the ground. The Pentagon had previously confirmed that F/A-18E/F Super Hornets flying from the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan sailing in the North Arabian Sea had been among the types supporting the evacuation operations. Other types of aircraft, including U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles , A-10 Warthogs , and MQ-9 Reaper drones, as well as Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jets, were reportedly among the types either directly involved or prepositioned to provide support if required. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has now also given additional information about the American withdrawal from Afghanistan and what happens next. Most immediately, he said there are plans to establish what is called a “remote diplomatic mission” for Afghanistan in Doha, Qatar. This is perhaps not surprising given that Doha is also currently hosting the only formal overseas Taliban political office and has been the main site for U.S. negotiations with the group in recent years. There are already reports that the Qatari government is emerging as an even more important intermediary between the United States and the Taliban. Blinken also said that the U.S. government would continue to engage with the Taliban about the safe departure from the country of any remaining American citizens, as well as at-risk Afghans. This could include via the airport in Kabul, once it becomes operational again, or via overland routes. “If we can work with a new Afghan government in a way that helps secure those interests…we will do it” Blinken added. “But we will not do it on the basis of trust or faith.” The U.S. military has also released a picture, seen below, of Major General Chris Donahue, the head of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division, who also served as the top commander in Kabul during the now-concluded noncombatant evacuation operation, boarding a C-17. Donahue was the last American to step onto a plane in Kabul during the final withdrawal. According to CENTCOM commander McKenzie, Charge dâ€™Affaires Ross Wilson, the acting U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, was the second to last.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 13, 2021",Al Qaeda Kingpin Resurfaces In Afghanistan Surrounded By Taliban Security,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has emerged online today that reportedly shows Dr. Amin Al Haq, who served for a time as the personal security chief for Al Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden , traveling in the open in Afghanistan for the first time in a decade with a Taliban escort. If the description of this video is accurate, it can only raise questions about the current relationship between the Taliban and Al Qaeda and whether the former group will again give the latter safe haven in the country. At the same time, a controversial American drone strike in Kabul yesterday, which, regardless of its intended targets, increasingly appears to have killed a number of innocent civilians, highlights the potential limits of future “ over-the-horizon ” counter-terrorism capabilities that will be available to the U.S. government going forward. All of this comes on the eve of the final withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and the end of what American officials now say is set to be the largest evacuation airlift operation in U.S. military history. https://youtube.com/watch?v=KkLKJwCr-Is It’s unclear when it was shot, but the video was reportedly taken at a checkpoint in Nangarhar Province, which is where Al Haq was born. He is believed to have fled Al Qaeda’s cave complex in Tora Bora into Pakistan with other senior members of the terrorist group, including Bin Laden himself, sometime between 2001 and 2002. Al Haq was arrested in the Pakistani city of Lahore in 2008, but was released in 2011 under murky circumstances , and subsequently disappeared from the public eye. It’s unclear whether this is actually his first trip back to Afghanistan since then, but it certainly looks to be the first time that he has been spotted out in public, which is notable in its own right. Al Haq’s current connections to Al Qaeda are uncertain, but the video makes it clear that that the Taliban are treating him as a very important individual. The footage shows him riding in what appears to be a discreetly armored SUV as part of a larger convoy. At least two other pickup trucks are seen flying the Taliban’s white flag with the Shahada , a profession of faith that is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, written on it in Arabic. One of these trucks is a Ford Ranger in the configuration that had been used by the now-defunct Afghan National Police. Though the Taliban had captured various vehicles from Afghan government security forces over the years, the group seized substantial additional numbers of them in the past month as its members made lightning-quick advances across the country. This haul included a number of these Ford Rangers, which are now commonly seen under Taliban control patrolling various cities across Afghanistan, including the country’s capital. A screengrab from the video showing a Ford Ranger with Taliban flags. , YouTube screen capture Another pickup truck in Al Haq’s convoy flying Taliban flags., YouTube screen capture A picture showing members of the Taliban in a captured Afghan National Police Ford Ranger pickup prior to the collapse of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on Aug. 15, 2021., AP Photo/Sidiqullah Khan Interestingly, there is also another SUV in the convoy that appears to have an array of antennas on top, which could either point to an onboard communications suite or an electronic warfare system designed to jam signals used to remotely detonate improvised explosive devices. The Taliban are in open conflict with ISIS’ franchise in Afghanistan, also referred to as ISIS-Khorasan Province or ISIS-K , and the latter group is also known to have a significant presence in Nangarhar . Another screengrab showing an SUV in Al Haq’s convoy with an array of antennas on top that could point to a communications suite or some kind of electronic warfare jammer., YouTube screen capture Though Al Haq’s current affiliation is unknown, his re-emergence under Taliban protection can only raise questions about the group’s continued insistence in public that it will not harbor Al Qaeda under its new regime. The Taliban is actively courting international recognition as the leaders of Afghanistan’s new, legitimate government, but they are also already re-instituting a host of hardline policies, including banning music . There are credible reports that it is actively hunting down and executing former Afghan government officials and security forces personnel, among others, as well. All of this is also only likely to fuel further criticism of how President Joe Biden’s administration has downplayed the threat of a potential Al Qaeda resurgence in Afghanistan. Biden himself falsely said that the terrorist group was “gone” from the country on Aug. 20. Other U.S. officials have since made clear that the U.S. government’s official position is that Al Qaeda continues to have a presence in Afghanistan and remains a threat . All of this, in turn, is likely to add to the complications that the U.S. government, as well as the international community, as a whole, face in engaging with any Taliban-led government in Afghanistan going forward. There are unconfirmed reports that the United States, among others, could be entertaining the idea of working to some degree with the Taliban against ISIS-K. The U.S. military has publicly acknowledged taking actions in the past that were deliberately intended to aid Taliban forces fighting against Afghanistan’s branch of ISIS. Like Al Qaeda, ISIS-K remains a clear threat, with the group claiming responsibility for a rocket attack on Hamid Karzai International airport in Kabul just today amid the final stages of the U.S. military’s evacuation operations and final withdrawal from the country. None of the rockets caused any disruptions to American operations, according to the Pentagon. The U.S. military also confirmed today that a counter-rockets, artillery, and mortars (C-RAM) defense system knocked down one of those rockets, while the others hit areas inside the airport and nearby. The C-RAM system in question was very likely a Centurion, which you can read about in more detail here . Separately, there are also calls for the United States to support a burgeoning anti-Taliban resistance in the Panjshir Valley, which is situated less than 100 miles north of Kabul. This movement is led by former First Vice President of Afghanistan Amrullah Saleh and Ahmad Massoud. Saleh was a commander in the Northern Alliance, which fought against the Taliban in the 1990s and early 2000s, and Massoud is the son of another legendary North Alliance leader, Ahmad Shah Massoud. The elder Massoud was infamously assassinated in a suicide bombing by individuals associated with the Taliban and Al Qaeda on Sept. 9, 2001, two days before the infamous 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. It’s important to remember that one of the key reasons for the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, in the first place, was to ensure that the country could not be used as a base for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. The Biden administration has repeatedly insisted that it will retain “over-the-horizon” counter-terrorism capabilities, which is broad terminology meant to reflect aircraft and other forces based outside of Afghanistan, and this will be an adequate alternative to an indefinite military presence in the country. However, a U.S. drone strike yesterday, the target of which American officials continue to say was a vehicle carrying multiple ISIS-K suicide bombers in Kabul, certainly underscores the potential limitations of any such operations going forward. The U.S. military is now investigating that strike after multiple reports have indicated that, whatever the actual nature of the target turns out to be, at least 10 incident civilians died as a result. Targeting specific terrorists, and mitigating collateral damage in the process, can already be a complex proposition in environments where the United States enjoys the benefit of things like persistent aerial surveillance overhead, intelligence networks on the ground, and support from even a nominally friendly host government. “Over-the-horizon” operations in a non-permissive environment where firm intelligence is harder to come by could only make all of this more complicated. All told, it very much remains to be seen exactly how the United States will continue to be engaged in Afghanistan, including militarily, after the imminent withdrawal of the last American troops after nearly two decades of operations in the country.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 26, 2021",American Drone Strike Hits Suicide Attackers Targeting Kabul Airport (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still emerging, but the U.S. military has reportedly conducted a drone strike in Kabul targeting either a suspected car bomb or a vehicle full of multiple individual suicide bombers. This follows earlier reports that another explosion has rocked an area of the city in the general vicinity of Hamid Karzai International Airport . All of this comes a day after an official U.S. government security alert warned of a “specific, credible threat” targeting the airport, while President Joe Biden had separately said that another attack there was “highly likely in the next 24-36 hours.” Reuters reported that the “possible suicide car bomb” was targeted in the strike, but the Associated Press has described it as a vehicle with “multiple suicide bombers” inside. “We are confident we hit the target we were aiming for. Initial reports indicate there were no civilian casualties caused by our airstrike,” A U.S. official told Defense One . “Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material.” This operation comes on the heels of a U.S. drone strike targeting members of Afghanistan’s branch of ISIS, also known as ISIS-Khorasan Province or ISIS-K, in Nangarhar Province. That was in direct retaliation for ISIS-K’s deadly terrorist attack outside the airport, which involved a suicide bomber, last Thursday. That attack killed 13 U.S. service members and at least 170 Afghans, and wounded many more. There had been earlier reports of an explosion in a residential area of Kabul in the general vicinity of the airport. U.S. Central Command had told NBC News that it was aware of the reports of an explosion in the city, but that it could not provide any additional details. There were multiple reports from eyewitnesses on the ground that a rocket might have caused the blast, which could actually have been a missile or other munition launched from a U.S. drone. A U.S. drone strike targeting ISIS-K suicide attackers of any kind would align with growing warnings yesterday that another attack on Hamid Karzai International Airport could be imminent. “Due to a specific, credible threat, all U.S. citizens in the vicinity of Kabul airport (HKIA), including the South (Airport Circle) gate, the new Ministry of the Interior, and the gate near the Panjshir Petrol station on the northwest side of the airport, should leave the airport area immediately,” yesterday’s security alert from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, which is presently operating out of Hamid Karzai International Airport, had read. “Our commanders informed me that an attack is highly likely in the next 24-36 hours,” Biden had said in his statement . “I directed them to take every possible measure to prioritize force protection, and ensured that they have all the authorities, resources and plans to protect our men and women on the ground.” If these reports of a U.S. drone strike in Kabul are accurate, it only underscores how the security situation in the city remains fluid and will only get more tense as the U.S. military gets closer to closing out the current non-combatant evacuation operation in Kabul and affecting the final withdrawal of its remaining personnel. By Aug. 31, just two days away, the U.S. military is expected to have completely pulled out of Afghanistan after nearly two decades of operations. The last U.S. boots on the ground could very well come markedly sooner due to the degrading security situation paired with dwindling force protection capabilities at the airport. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available UPDATE: Here is the official statement on the strike from CENTCOM: “U.S. military forces conducted a self-defense unmanned over-the-horizon airstrike today on a vehicle in Kabul, eliminating an imminent ISIS-K threat to Hamad Karzai International airport. We are confident we successfully hit the target. Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material. We are assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time. We remain vigilant for potential future threats.” Satellite imagery backs up the report from Al Jazeera ‘s Charlotte Bellis below. Just a single C-17 left on the ramp and many helicopters are gone, as well. So this is in its endgame now. The almost continuous highway in the sky full of C-17s has turned into a trickle. KC-135 tankers and strike-capable assets remain visible on trackers. Some special operations aircraft appear to have repositioned into Islamabad, likely moving assets out of the country, such as Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters and possibly some (but not all) of the aircraft belonging to the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) that have been operating in Kabul. Multiple reports state that the Taliban are ready and waiting to take full control of the airport. In the meantime, the Taliban have condemned the U.S. strike against ISIS-K. There is also chatter that the U.S. government may be looking to support the Taliban if they are willing to work with the United States on counter-terror efforts against this ISIS branch. That seems like hopeful thinking as the ties between the two groups and the political implications of the Taliban’s stance towards ISIS-K is far more complex than senior administration officials are letting on. France and Britain are wanting to set up an U.N.-backed ‘safe zone’ in Kabul for foreigners who want to leave the country to go to. All this is happening while the U.S. mourns the loss of its 13 service members, who have been identified as follows: Marine Corps Lance Cpl. David L. Espinoza, 20, of Rio Bravo, Texas Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, 23, of Sacramento, California Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover, 31, of Salt Lake City, Utah U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C.

Soviak, 22, of Berlin Heights, Ohio A large group of people gather at the United States Marine Corps War Memorial for a candlelight vigil on Aug. 28, in memory of the 11 Marines, one Navy Corpsman, and one U.S. Army Soldier who lost their lives on Aug. 26., USMC Pretty much every other country has now left Kabul International, with the British pulling out in full by yesterday: It appears one RAF C-17 crew made their departure a little bit more dramatic with a well-known soundtrack: As for some sort of U.S. diplomatic presence in Kabul after the last boots have left Kabul Airport, at least in the near term, that doesn’t look like a possibility: New State Department statement that seems aimed at getting people out of Afghanistan once the U.S. is gone: We are all committed to ensuring that our citizens, nationals and residents, employees, Afghans who have worked with us and those who are at risk can continue to travel freely to destinations outside Afghanistan.  We have received assurances from the Taliban that all foreign nationals and any Afghan citizen with travel authorization from our countries will be allowed to proceed in a safe and orderly manner to points of departure and travel outside the country.  We will continue issuing travel documentation to designated Afghans, and we have the clear expectation of and commitment from the Taliban that they can travel to our respective countries.  We note the public statements of the Taliban confirming this understanding. UPDATE: Reports claim that the U.S. did not hit a vehicle-borne IED today in Kabul, but instead a family. Considering the nature of the claim, we are likely to hear something from the DoD on this soon: There is also some debate over if an AGM-114R9X was used in the first retaliatory strike against ISIS-K. The Wall Street Journal claims its unnamed sources say it was, but we see no indication of that in the images from the scene: A report now says the U.S. was given the option by the Taliban to secure Kabul, which would have taken a massive amount of troops and would have been impossible on the deadline set, let alone tactically insane. Still, some are pushing this one supposed choice as some grand misstep: Meanwhile, flag-draped coffins holding the remains of America’s heroes who were killed in the blast at Kabul International have returned to the United States aboard a C-17. President Biden, the First Lady, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and others were at Dover AFB to receive them: U.S. Air Force photo by Jason Minto U.S. Air Force photo by Jason Minto Finally, this is the state of Afghan Media: Update: Almost as if on cue, artillery rockets were fired at Kabul International. They definitely got the attention of some in the city. The Pentagon now says C-RAM intercepted them before impacting the airfield. As for exactly what the U.S. hit in its drone strike in Kabul, after claims that innocent civilians were killed instead of ISIS-K suicide bombers, the Pentagon now states the following: We are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today. We are still assessing the results of this strike, which we know disrupted an imminent ISIS-K threat to the airport. We know that there were substantial and powerful subsequent explosions resulting from the destruction of the vehicle, indicating a large amount of explosive material inside that may have caused additional casualties. It is unclear what may have happened, and we are investigating further. We would be deeply saddened by any potential loss of innocent life. – Capt.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 30, 2021",U.S. Executes Revenge Drone Strike On ISIS-K “Planner” In Afghanistan (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a suicide bomber wearing a vest laden with roughly 25 pounds of high explosive killed 13 American servicepeople and many more civilians at Abbey Gate along the perimeter of Hamid Karzai International Airport, U.S. Central Command has announced that one of the drones under its command apparently killed an ISIS-K “planner.” The drone strike occurred in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. This comes just over a day after President Biden promised to hunt down those responsible for the attack and punish them. The statement from U.S. Central Command reads: The following statement is attributable to Capt. Bill Urban, spokesman for U.S. Central Command “U.S. military forces conducted an over-the-horizon counterterrorism operation today against an ISIS-K planner. The unmanned airstrike occurred in the Nangahar Province of Afghanistan. Initial indications are that we killed the target. We know of no civilian casualties.” We do not know if this planner is the same one that is responsible for the attack on the airport or another one of the group’s masterminds. We also don’t know how many people were involved in the attack and the planning that led up to it. Regardless, this action clearly underscores Biden’s promise to take action against ISIS-K. BREAKING: Pres. Biden says he's ordered his commanders ""to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership and facilities."" ""We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose and the moment of our choosing."" https://t.co/aVzjnzGos5 pic.twitter.com/kTw6VbCCSA — ABC News (@ABC) August 26, 2021 The statement does specifically say this was an “over the horizon” operation, in which an aircraft flew from outside Afghanistan to conduct the counter-terror strike. This concept of operations is what the Biden Administration will rely on once U.S. forces leave Afghanistan. It is also worth noting that this strike occurred before the United States had left the war-torn country. Some posited action would be put on hold until then as to not instigate another terror attack. This is a dubious idea that does not fall in line with how ISIS operates. UPDATE: MQ-9 was used as is logical. If we get images of the scene, don’t be surprised if this was a JSOC AGM-114R9X strike. U.S. official tells Reuters the reaper drone, which took off from the Middle East, struck the Islamic State target while he was in a car with another Islamic State associate.

The ISIS-K planner was killed while driving in a vehicle along with an 'associate,' official says. — Lucas Tomlinson (@LucasFoxNews) August 28, 2021 The strike also roughly coincides time-wise with yet another warning about the possibility of an impending terror attack on Hamid Karzai Airport from the State Department: #Afghanistan : Due to security threats at the airport, we continue to advise U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to the airport and to avoid airport gates.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 1, 2021",Operation Pineapple Express Saw Special Ops Vets Lead The Rescue Of Hundreds Of Afghans,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier this week, the collection of current and former members of U.S. special operations forces units , intelligence operatives, aid workers, and others were able to sneak hundreds of at-risk Afghans into the safety of the American-controlled portion of Hamid Karzai International Airport . This involved helping small groups navigate past Taliban checkpoints to a secret entrance into the airport, and included the use of codewords and other signals. One of the individuals who led the effort, nicknamed the Pineapple Express after the group’s own nickname, Task Force Pineapple, said that the entire affair often felt like something straight out of a Jason Bourne movie. ABC News was first to report on the Pineapple Express mission, which took place between Wednesday and Thursday. Individuals from Task Force Pineapple were still shepherding Afghans into the airport when the fatal terrorist attack occurred yesterday evening, which you can read more about here , and some of the evacuees were wounded as a result. Members of this ad hoc group of special operators and others said they were able to help as many 500 Afghans get to safety in this one particular operation and that they had rescued more than 130 others since Aug. 16, the day after the Taliban marched into Kabul . A US Marine helps lift an Afghan up into the perimeter at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan on Aug. 26, 2021., CENTCOM “Dozens of high-risk individuals, families with small children, orphans, and pregnant women, were secretly moved through the streets of Kabul throughout the night and up to just seconds before ISIS detonated a bomb into the huddled mass of Afghans seeking safety and freedom,” retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mann , a member of Task Force Pineapple and a retired Green Beret commander, told ABC News . “This Herculean effort couldn’t have been done without the unofficial heroes inside the airfield who defied their orders to not help beyond the airport perimeter, by wading into sewage canals and pulling in these targeted people who were flashing pineapples on their phones.” The U.S. military has conducted a number of rescue operations in Kabul officially, including in coordination with allies and partners, in the past two weeks. British, French , German , and other foreign forces had carried out similar activities, as well. However, informal groups and other kinds of networks that have sprung up have also become a critical means of getting individuals to safety. Task Force Pineapple is one of these entities, but there are known to be others, including one named Task Force Dunkirk , a reference to the legendary evacuation of the remnants of the British Expeditionary Force from France in 1940 during World War II. Individuals and groups outside of Afghanistan, using various online tools, have also been helping to coordinate these kinds of evacuations as part of what some have dubbed a “ Digital Dunkirk .” Retired U.S. Army Captain Zac Lois , another former Green Beret working with Task Force Pineapple, “said he modeled his slow and steady system of maneuvering the Afghan families in the darkness after Harriet Tubman’s Underground Railroad for American slave escapees,” according to ABC News . This particular network, which has reportedly been just using an encrypted chat group to coordinate its activities, uses Underground Railroad terminology, with “conductors” helping individuals move through a chain of safe locations in Kabul to get to the airport. Lois is described as the railroad’s “engineer.” Those helping to guide Afghan “passengers,” who include former government security forces personnel, intelligence assets, interpreters, and their families, among others, to safety are also referred to as “shepherds” in today’s story. The evacuees are ultimately told to link up with individuals at the airport who are identified by some sort of code, such as a specific addition to their clothing. It’s not clear what, if any, weapons the volunteers on the ground might carry, but pictures Lois provided to ABC News do show individuals who are apparently part of Task Force Pineapple carrying small arms. CENTCOM The exact extent to which Task Force Pineapple, and other groups like it, have been coordinating directly with the U.S. government is unclear, but formalized links do exist. “The group I was attached to as a volunteer was listed in the command center as a supporting element. We were part of the team,” Tim Kennedy, an active-duty Army special operator who has been working with another group wrote on Twitter today, while also offering additional details you can read below. Regardless, until this week, with the U.S. government’s withdrawal deadline, which is still set for Aug. 31, drawing ever closer, Task Force Pineapple has only ever moved small groups of people in a single night. Even the details about what Task Force Pineapple has been doing sound absolutely harrowing. ABC News ‘ piece includes the following description of the mission that started it all: It all began with trying to save one Afghan Commando, whose special immigrant visa was never finalized. During an intense night last week involving coordination between Mann and another Green Beret, an intelligence officer, former aid workers and a staffer for Florida Republican and Green Beret officer Rep. Mike Waltz, the ad hoc team enlisted the aid of a sleepless U.S. Embassy officer inside the airport. He helped Marines at a gate to identify the former Afghan commando, who was caught in the throngs of civilians outside the airport and who said he saw two civilians knocked to the ground and killed. “Two people died next to me — 1 foot away,” he told ABC News from outside the airport that night, as he tried for hours to reach an entry control point manned by U.S. Marines a short distance away. With Taliban fighters mixing into the crowd of thousands and firing their AK-47s above the masses, the former elite commando was finally pulled into the U.S. security perimeter, where he shouted the password “Pineapple!” to American troops at the checkpoint. The password has since changed, the sources said. Ramping up operations earlier this week only increased the risks. Mann described what happened between Wednesday night and Thursday morning as being “full of dramatic scenes rivaling a ‘Jason Bourne’ thriller unfolding every 10 minutes,” according to ABC News . “The small groups of Afghans repeatedly encountered Taliban foot soldiers who they said beat them but never checked identity papers that might have revealed them as operators who spent two decades killing Taliban leadership,” the ABC News story explained. “All carried U.S. visas, pending visa applications or new applications prepared by members of Task Force Pineapple.” There have been reports for days now about the difficulties Afghans and even American nationals have had in getting through Taliban checkpoints to get to the airport. Politico reported just yesterday that U.S. officials had made the extremely controversial decision to pass information about U.S. citizens and Afghans to the Taliban to try to ensure they could get to the airport. This, of course, could only have increased the already substantial risks faced by all of these individuals, especially Afghans who are already in danger of reprisals due to their past work with the United States or affiliations with the now-defunct government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. “Many of the Afghans arrived near Abbey Gate [at Hamid Karzai International Airport] and waded through a sewage-choked canal toward a U.S. soldier wearing red sunglasses to identify himself,” the ABC News piece continued. “They waved their phones with the pineapples and were scooped up and brought inside the wire to safety. Others were brought in by an Army Ranger wearing a modified American flag patch with the [U.S. Army’s 75th] Ranger Regiment emblem.” At one point during the mission, a number of Task Force Pineapple teams on the ground lost signal to their cellphones and were unable to communicate with the rest of the group. This was reportedly the result of active electronic warfare jamming on the part of U.S. forces at the airport who were trying to prevent cellphones from being used to remotely trigger improvised explosive devices . There were other, separate reports earlier this week that jammers might have been used for this purpose amid escalating concerns that a terrorist attack could be imminent. This was all, of course, before yesterday’s events outside of the airport in Kabul, which started with an individual detonating a suicide vest they were wearing. “The whole night was a roller-coaster ride. People were so terrified in that chaotic environment,” Jason Redman , a retired U.S. SEAL, author, and member of Task Force Pineapple, told ABC News . “These people were so exhausted, I kept trying to put myself in their shoes.” “I have been involved in some of the most incredible missions and operations that a special forces guy could be a part of, and I have never been a part of anything more incredible than this,” retired Army Major Jim Gant, another former Green Beret who been working with Task Force Pineapple, also said. “The bravery and courage and commitment of my brothers and sisters in the Pineapple community was greater than the U.S. commitment on the battlefield.” Gant is a near-legendary, if controversial former Green Beret who became known as the “ Lawrence of Afghanistan ” before being forced into retirement in 2014 after an affair with a Washington Post reporter. It’s not clear whether Task Force Pineapple, or any of the other similar groups, is still operating in Kabul or, if they are, how long they will continue to do so. The U.S. military is only days away from the date of its expected total withdrawal from Afghanistan and there are already indications that official evacuation operations are starting to wind down. This has included the start of controlled detonations at the airport to destroy equipment that won’t be withdrawn at the end. There were also reports today that the Central Intelligence Agency had closed down one of, if not the last of its major operational sites in Afghanistan. Other countries have been announcing the end of their own evacuation operations for days now ahead of the American deadline. There are also reports today that the Taliban have been exerting more authority over the civilian side of Hamid Karzai International Airport, though American officials have denied that U.S. troops have already pulled out completely. While the U.S. government has insisted that evacuation operations will continue right up until the last moment, the total capacity to get people out of the country can only shrink in the coming days. With that, the ability of groups like Task Force Pineapple to just find planes to get people onto will also decrease. “I just want to get my people out,” Gant told ABC News , referring to Afghans who worked with Americans over the past nearly two decades of American operations in Afghanistan, as well as their families. Hopefully, more of them will be able to make it to safety one way or another, but, unfortunately, the window to get out via the U.S. evacuation effort at Hamid Karzai International Airport is rapidly closing. Regardless, of what happens going forward, we have only beginning to hear the incredible stories of how many of them got out and the heroes who made it happen.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 30, 2021",This Remote Alaskan Lighthouse’s Wooden Helipad Belongs In Star Wars,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Alaska is a wild and beautiful place, but it is also a harsh and unforgiving one. This goes for landlubbers and seafarers alike. Lighthouses played a major role in making the state’s complex waterways navigable throughout the 20th Century. Hence the activation of the Cape Decision lighthouse in 1935 on the southern tip of Kuiu Island. While the lighthouse was made of concrete, the long service walkway that snaked along the coast away from the lighthouse to the boathouse, before jutting out to sea, was made of wood. After the advent of the helicopter, a landing pad was retrofitted into it. Today, the entire setup looks like a dramatic landing pad locale from Star Wars, albeit one built out of wood by Wookies, not out of sterile metal by Empire. The lighthouse went unmanned in 1974, but it still serves as a navigation aid. It has been preserved by a passionate group known as the Cape Decision Lighthouse Society that still visits it for various purposes, including scientific research and recreation, as well as to keep it up. It is located in one of the most beautiful places on the planet, surrounded by orcas, bald eagles, and, well, bears. Lots of bears. Being so remote, the helipad is still used to access the property by U.S. Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawks that bring critical supplies and Maintainance crews needed to keep the navigational aids in working order. U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Lexie Preston This is where the photos of the MH-60 come into play. I posted them on Twitter and people really took an interest in them, with many making the point that there was a strong Star Wars vibe with the landing pad and, like my own observations, noted how the wooden cliffside landing pad arrangement doesn’t look all that encouraging. Cape Decision Lighthouse is located on the southern tip of Kuiu Island., Google Earth U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 1st Class Sara Francis Star Wars is known for its dramatic, if not precarious landing pads. , Lucas Film Yet the reality is that the landing pad has been there for many decades. Before its existence, ships and flying boats serviced the island, but the landing pad made accessing it much easier and it even helped save the installation from a raging fire in 1989. The lighthouse seen in its early years prior to receiving the landing pad, then after in 1966, and on the year the installation become unmanned, 1974. , Lighthousefriends.com A good description of the scary incident, as well as more information on the history of this unique lighthouse, can be found at Lighthousefriends.com . It states, in part: As Conklin reached the helicopter pad, he noticed thick black smoke emanating from beneath the boardwalk near the boathouse. It wasn’t immediately clear if the pier was on fire, or if the thick smoke from the barrels was simply swirling down through the pier. After discharging the thirty-pound extinguisher into the two barrels, Conklin discovered, much to his alarm, that the pier was indeed ablaze. Conklin sprinted back to the lighthouse yelling “Fire!, Fire!” With additional extinguishers in hand, the three-man crew scampered back to the boathouse and attempted unsuccessfully to subdue the flames. Realizing that the fire could spread to surrounding structures, Conklin broadcasted a mayday call to the Coast Guard. The men then formed a bucket brigade to transport water to the fire from the station’s cistern, located thirty feet away. Help finally arrived in the form of a helicopter from Sitka and the buoy tender Woodrush , which happened to be within thirty miles of Cape Decision servicing other aids to navigation. As the helicopter was approaching to land, the fuel inside the boathouse exploded sending a tremor along the pier. Portable firefighting equipment was off-loaded from the helicopter after it was able to safely land, and the coastguardsmen had the fire under control in about four hours. Although the exact cause of the fire was listed as “unknown,” it is most likely that either the diesel leaking from the barrels or airborne embers ignited the pier. The boathouse and a good section of the pier and catwalk leading to the helicopter pad were destroyed in the blaze. Cape Decision Lighthouse truly looks like a wonderous, almost storybook-like place and it is really neat that it still exists in preserved form. The helipad just puts it over the top though. I bet Coast Guard aircrews love making the trip out to the historic locale and its wooden cliffside landing pad.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 26, 2021",Pentagon Confirms American Troops Have Been Blowing Equipment Up At Kabul Airport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army Major General Hank Taylor has corrected the record regarding the horrific terrorist attack near Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul yesterday, saying that the U.S. military now only believes that there was one suicide bomber, rather than two. The reports of a second bombing at the nearby Baron Hotel were incorrect. He did also confirm that American troops at the airport had conducted “controlled detonations” to deliberately destroy equipment yesterday. This could account for at least reports from individuals in Afghanistan’s capital that they had heard a number of additional blasts later in the day. Major General Hank Taylor provided these and other details at a press conference this morning alongside Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby. Taylor also said that the total number of American service members who had died yesterday remained at 13. There have been separate reports that at least 18 other U.S. personnel were wounded. US troops manage at gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan., DOD The death toll among Afghans continues to rise , with reports indicating that at least 169 other people were killed, and that many more were injured, in the attack, which included the suicide bombing and subsequent gunfire near Hamid Karzai International Airport’s Abbey Gate. ISIS’ branch in Afghanistan, also referred to as ISIS-Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), which views the Taliban , as well as the United States and others, as enemies, has claimed responsibility. “The actual specifics of what type of equipment was destroyed, I don’t have that,” Taylor said in response to a question about the subsequently controlled detonations at the airport in Kabul. “The commander has the authority there to destroy equipment.” “You can expect that there will be other equipment and material things that will not be brought back with us. We’re going to do this in a judicious way,” Press Secretary Kirby added. “So, you’re going to continue to see things disposed of in a responsible way as we get closer to the end of the mission and I think people would expect us to do that.” At present, the U.S. government’s plan remains to conclude the ongoing evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport and have American troops completely withdraw from Afghanistan by Aug. 31. Kirby confirmed that American authorities are looking at continue to help people get out of the country after that date, but said that whatever this assistance consisted of would not necessarily have a military dimension to it. While neither Taylor nor Kirby could provide any specifics about what was blown up at the airport yesterday, or what American troops may otherwise be preparing now to dispose of in any way, this could include destroying weapons and equipment that had belonged to the now-defunct Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). Much of this materiel had been supplied by the United States , to begin with. In fact, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) released a picture earlier this week, seen at the top of this story, showing members of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division “de-militarizing” Afghan weapons at the airport in Kabul. The picture shows the soldiers working on various 7.62mm AK-series rifles and PK-type light machine guns , along with an RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launcher and a 12.7mm DShK heavy machine gun . There appears to be at least one 5.56mm M4/M16-type gun among the assortment of weapons being broken down, as well. Various AK-type rifles undergoing a “de-militarizing” process at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2021. At least one M4 carbine or M16 rifle is visible in the background, as well., CENTCOM PK-series light machine guns, also undergoing “demilitarizing.” Belted 7.62x54mmR ammunition for those guns is also seen., CENTCOM A DShK heavy machine gun being broken down., CENTCOM An RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launcher., CENTCOM While parts could be removed from any of these weapons to make it impossible for someone to simply pick them up and begin using them, they are all types in widespread service around the world . In addition, during the lightning-quick conclusion of their conquest of Afghanistan earlier this month, the Taliban captured hoards of small arms and light weapons, among troves of other things, including American-supplied M4 carbines and M16 rifles, as well as AKs, PKs, DShKs, RPG-7s, and other Soviet-designs. All told, it would be hard to ensure that the Taliban, or other militant or terrorist groups in Afghanistan, would not be able to put these weapons to use without completely destroying them. The same would go for any leftover ammunition. This brings up questions again about whether the U.S. military might be prepared to destroy other larger, higher-end equipment at Hamid Karzai International Airport that had belonged to ANDSF units, especially former Afghan Air Force aircraft that are still there. There have also been reports that the U.S. government has at least considered the possibility of employing airstrikes to destroy captured equipment after the evacuation operations end next week. A pair of US Army CH-47F Chinook helicopters supporting evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021. A C-130H Hercules cargo plane that had belonged to the now-defunct Afghan Air Force is visible in the background to the left., US Army American equipment will, of course, also be among what gets destroyed between now and next Tuesday. This could potentially also including larger, more costly items, such as aircraft and light armored vehicles. The War Zone was first to report last week that the U.S. State Department has already abandoned seven CH-46E Sea Knight helicopters at Hamid Karzai International Airport after taking unspecified steps to render them inoperable. The New York Times has also reported that a significant amount of other materiel, including a Centurion counter-rockets, artillery, and mortars (C-RAM) defense system, which you can read more about here , had been destroyed in place at the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul. As part of the U.S. government’s existing plans to withdraw all American forces from Afghanistan, which had preceded the fall of Kabul to the Taliban earlier this month, U.S. troops had already been destroying various items in-country, including light armored vehicles and ammunition. Some materiel had also been transferred to ANDSF elements , something that is, obviously, no longer an option. None of this is, of course, necessarily surprising given the current U.S. withdrawal schedule. As the Aug. 31 deadline approaches, it is only reasonable to expect that operations will slow and that toward the very end the focus will be on pulling out whatever U.S. military elements remain on the ground. Evacuation and other military airlift flights will slow and American commanders will have to decide how to load those planes in the most appropriate manner. This could easily come down to things like choosing between using a C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane to airlift out a single helicopter or hundreds of passengers . Evacuees head toward the flightline at Hamid Karzai International Airport, with two Air Force C-17As visible in the background., CENTCOM Despite reports of gates at the airport in Kabul being welded shut and people being turned away , Pentagon Press Secretary Kirby did insist at today’s press conference that evacuations of American nationals and others would continue right up until the very end. At the same time, American allies and partners who have been conducting their own evacuation operations out of Hamid Karzai International Airport in coordination with the United States over the past two weeks are already closing out those missions ahead of next week’s deadline. This will only further reduce the overall airlift capacity available going forward. “Lives are going to be the priority,” Kirby said bluntly at today’s press conference. “Some stuff will obviously come back with us, but for the aircraft that are departing, as we get closer to the end of the month, we want to prioritize passenger seats as much as possible.” Kirby also said that the amount of information the U.S. government gives out about how many troops it has in Kabul and other details about the American military presence there will slow in the coming days for operational security reasons. There are reports that other U.S. government agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), are also stepping up their withdrawal processes. It seems likely that other privately-funded evacuation efforts will end in the coming days, as well, as the security situation at the airport in Kabul becomes even more fluid as American troops leave. All told, the United States seems to be moving ever more inexorably toward ending its nearly two-decade-long presence in Afghanistan in the next few days. Destroying American or other military equipment in place at Hamid Karzai International Airport is clear evidence of the increasing finality of the mission.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the third time in as many days, the Japan Air Self Defense Force has sent fighter jets out to monitor drones belonging to China’s People’s Liberation Army flying in the East China Sea and the Miyako Strait, which lies southwest of the island of Okinawa . These intercepts underscore the Chinese military’s growing unmanned aircraft capabilities , as well as the strategic significance of this body of water, which is one of a number of maritime passages linking the East China Sea to the Philippine Sea, and the broader Western Pacific Ocean. This recent flurry of activity began on Aug. 24, 2021, when a lone Tengoen TB-001 Scorpion medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone flew into the East China Sea northwest of Okinawa. A single People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Harbin BZK-005 MALE drone then flew a sortie back and forth through the Miyako Strait yesterday. Today, another TB-001 conducted a similar flight through the Miyako Strait. In all three cases, the JASDF scrambled fighters to investigate the Chinese drones’ activities. F-15Js have borne the brunt of the JASDF’s alert commitment, which sees scrambles happen hundreds of times a year. , JASDF On both Aug. 25 and Aug. 26, one Shaanxi Y-8Q maritime patrol plane and one Shaanxi Y-9JB electronic intelligence aircraft accompanied the drones on their flights, according to Japanese officials. The JASDF did not report any other PLA aerial activity related to the TB-001 sortie on Aug. 24. A Shaanxi Y-9JB electronic intelligence aircraft that the JASDF photographed flying through the Miyako Strait on Aug. 26. , JASDF BZK-005 series drones are primarily long-range intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and the original design was reportedly capable of flying continuously for up to 40 hours at a time. The standard BZK-005, which was first unveiled in 2006, has a single pusher propeller, a pair of swept main wings, and a twin-boom tail configuration. The PLA did also unveil an armed variant, with a revised center fuselage, known as the BZK-005C , in 2018. The main sensor system seen on most BZK-005 variants is a turret under the nose of a type that typically contains a mix of electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras. Pictures emerged last year of another version of this drone, called the BZK-005E, with a radar system under the nose, instead and the electro-optical turret relocated to its lower central fuselage area. Chinese Internet Pictures that the JASDF released of the BZK-005 flying through the Miyako Strait this week show this more recent configuration, with the radome under its nose and an under-fuselage optics turret. The BZK-005 is capable of beyond-line-of-sight operations via satellite control and can be configured to be multi-intelligence gathering platforms. JSDF JSDF The TB-001 Scorpion is also a long-endurance drone with a twin-boom tail, but is substantially different in its overall design from the BZK-005. The larger Scorpion, which was the first unmanned aircraft to come out of Tengoen , a company that was only established in 2016, has a pair of engines, each driving a single propeller, one on either side of its central fuselage under its straight, high-mounted main wing. TB-001 drone during testing., Globalsecurity.org Unlike the BZK-005, the TB-001 was designed from the outset as an armed drone , with four underwing hardpoints capable of carrying various stores, though it also has a sensor turret underneath its central fuselage. The pictures that the JASDF released of the Scoprions it intercepted this week do not show them carrying anything under their wings, but do show additional sensor systems, possibly a radar or electronic intelligence gathering pod, under their fuselages, as well as various antennas scattered around the airframe. Regardless, these twin-engine drones can be equipped with multi-intelligence gathering capabilities that are even more advanced than the TB-001, including a radar mounted in their noses. They also have full beyond-line-of-sight operations capabilities. JSDF JSDF JSDF JSDF These drones provide China with an efficient ability to collect multiple types of intelligence over and around the highly strategic strait. These can range from mapping and cataloging electronic emissions from air defense systems to taking detailed radar maps of the area and collecting imagery of vessels of interest. All of this is especially important considering Chinese carrier groups traverse the strait with concerning regularity these days. While these drones are advanced, being somewhere in the range of the MQ-1 to MQ-9 class (very roughly), China has far more advanced systems in operation , especially in terms of high flying surveillance types , and in the developmental pipeline . But those are not really needed for this type of non-combat task, which also taxes the JASDF’s alert fighter infrastructure just by being out there. It will be interesting to see if the use of these drones over three days straight is indicative of a new pattern or some sort of naval movement that will soon materialize in the region. A trio of Chinese warships, two destroyers and a frigate, did also sail through the Miyako Strait on Aug. 24. Regardless, these drone sorties are just another reminder of China’s growing unmanned capabilities and how they will soon become yet another major tactical and strategic challenge in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 27, 2021",American Troops Confirmed Killed In Kabul Airport Terror Bombing (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has confirmed that a number of U.S. service members were killed and wounded in a complex terrorist attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul today. At least 13 Afghans have also died as a result of the attack and scores more were wounded. You can get up to speed on what else is known so far about this incident in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting here . A statement from Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby did not say specifically how many Americans had died or were wounded, or otherwise provide any details about who those individuals were. The Wall Street Journal had already reported that four U.S. Marines were killed and three more were wounded, but this remains unconfirmed. Prior to this, the last two confirmed U.S. military fatalities in Afghanistan were two U.S. Army special forces soldiers who were killed in action in Nangarhar province on Feb. 8, 2020. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for today’s attack, but there are reports that U.S. officials believe it was the work of ISIS’ franchise in Afghanistan. Also referred to as ISIS Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K, this group treats the United States and its allies and partners, as well as the Taliban , as enemies. There are also unconfirmed reports that more attacks may be imminent, as well. What this might mean for the U.S. military’s timeline for withdrawing entirely from Afghanistan, something that is presently set to be complete by Aug. 31, remains to be seen. At present, there is no indication that the U.S. government has halted evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport. At the same time, various other foreign countries have closed out their missions entirely in Kabul already, or are preparing to do so, ahead of the American deadline. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update 2:25 PM EST: There are reports emerging that the total number of U.S. military fatalities from this terrorist attack may be substantially higher than the initial Wall Street Journal report. So far, Pentagon has not yet provided any official casualty figures. Update 3:00 PM EST: Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has now issued his own statement regarding today’s attacks and the American casualties. Update 3:35 PM EST: U.S. Marine Corps Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, has now said that at least 12 U.S. service members were killed in the terrorist attack in Kabul today and that 15 more were injured. The U.S. military has also now confirmed that it has assessed the attackers to have been members of ISIS-K. An investigation into the exact specifics of the attack is still ongoing. McKenzie added that there were still “very active threat streams” that are “imminent” and that he expected these attacks to continue. The threat streams include a variety of potential attack types, ranging from rocket attacks on the airport to car bombs. He also said that gunmen have previously directed small arms fire at aircraft landing at and taking off from Hamid Karzai International Airport. The threat of indirect fire on aircraft at the airport could be a very serious issue, but the CENTCOM commander said that there were defense systems in place to mitigate those dangers. It’s not clear exactly what he might have been referring to. There has been no clear evidence of Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar systems, such as the Centurion, which you can read more about here , in place in aerial shots of the airport or recent satellite imagery. In addition, he highlighted how MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and AC-130 gunships , as well as  “ other manned aircraft ,” continue to provide armed overwatch capabilities. McKenzie also confirmed the presence of a task force from the U.S. military’s secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) is at the airport Kabul, which could include the helicopters from the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment known to be there now . The CENTCOM head said that, at least at present, evacuation operations are continuing, despite today’s attacks. He also said that the U.S. military is still actively engaging with the Taliban about the security situation in Kabul, as well, and that the group’s members may have thwarted other ISIS-K attacks. He added there were no indications that the Taliban were involved in today’s attack. “If w e can find who is associated with this, we will go after them,” McKenzie said in response to a question about whether the United States would respond militarily to this attack. “We’re prepared to take action against them.” McKenzie declined to comment on whether there had been any additional terrorist attacks in Kabul after the initial incident earlier today. Update 6:35 PM EST: President Joe Biden has now also spoken directly to today’s events. He said “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay” and that the United States would respond directly to the attack at a time and place of its choosing. Biden echoed earlier comments from CENTCOM commander McKenzie, saying that the U.S. military’s evacuation operation was still ongoing at Hamid Karzai International Airport and that the U.S. government has been engaging directly with the Taliban as part of that mission. However, “getting every single person out can’t be guaranteed,” the President added. President Biden also defended the turnover of Bagram Airfield to the now-defunct government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which occurred under highly controversial circumstances in July. He said that this base, which is situated north of Kabul, “was not much value added” and that it made more sense to center the final withdrawal and subsequent evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airpot in Kabul. Unlike the single-runway airport in Kabul, Bagram is a larger facility with two runways and significant other supporting infrastructure that is also more defensible, in no small part because it is not located inside a dense urban area. It’s extremely hard to see how Bagram would not have been a valuable facility for supporting the ongoing evacuation operations. Biden did accept responsibility for “all that has happened of late,” but also reiterated his position that it was not worth more American lives to continue on in Afghanistan. Speaking at a subsequent press conference, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that the U.S. government’s current plan is to have all troops out of Afghanistan by Aug. 31. She also said that “we have an enormous amount of leverage over time” to engage with the Taliban about getting Americans and others out of the country after that date. ISIS has also now formally claimed responsibility for the attack in Kabul today. Update 7:10 PM EST: The U.S. military death toll from today’s attack has risen to 13 after another individual succumbed to their wounds. The dead include members of the U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army. The flag over the White House has been lowered to half-mast to honor the victims of the attack in Kabul. Flags at federal government facilities and on naval ships will also be lowered to half-mast through Aug. 30. Update 7:30 PM EST: Unrelated to today’s terrorist attack in Kabul, Politico has reported has emerged that the U.S. government reported turned over a list of names of U.S. citizens, green-card holders, and Afghan nationals, ostensibly to facilitate their entry into Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Of course, there are immense concerns that this decision put those individuals, especially the Afghans, at increased risk. Another report from The Times newspaper in the United Kingdom says that documents with information about Afghans who had been working with the U.K. government, among other things, had been abandoned at the British embassy compound in Kabul and seized by the Taliban. This could also potentially put those individuals at increased risk. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 29, 2021",Navy Halts Plans To Give Its Super Hornets Conformal Fuel Tanks (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy appears to have all but scrapped its plans to equip its future Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornets with conformal fuel tanks , or CFTs, at least for the time being. Boeing says it is not presently expecting to deliver any Block III jets with CFTs to the Navy. The service itself has also revealed that it issued a formal stop-work order to Boeing with regards to the continued development of the CFTs back in January. Tim Martin, Shepard News ‘ Air Editor, tweeted out the new details about the CFT’s place, or apparent lack thereof, in the Navy’s Block III Super Hornet upgrade plans earlier today. Aviation Week reported back in January that the Navy was considering axing the tanks, but the service does not look to have disclosed at the time that an actual stop-work was in place. The War Zone has reached out to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) for more information. A US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet fitted with conformal fuel tanks, or CFTs, during testing., USN “The U.S. Navy issued stop-work orders to The Boeing Company for work related to Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFTs) on Jan. 6, 2021, to pause the development of the CFT Engineering Change Proposal, citing struggles with cost, schedule, and performance,” the service said, according to Martin. “The Block III’s coming off our assembly today have the provisions in place to accept a conformal fuel tank in the future,” Boeing also told Shepard News’ Air Editor, while also confirming that the jets would not be fitted with CFTs as standard, as had been expected. It remains unclear exactly what the issue or issues that the Navy has experienced with the CFTs might be, though the service told Aviation Week previously that “technical, structural, and sustainment” problems had emerged during testing in a “carrier environment.” Boeing’s additional statement to Shepard News’ Martin that it is still offering CFTs as part of its Super Hornet pitches to Canada and Finland , neither of which plan to fly any jets from the deck of a flattop, would seem to reinforce the understanding that whatever is going on is specifically linked to carriers operations in some way. It is possible that the issue could have to do with a CFT-equipped aircraft’s ability to handle the heavy stresses of landing or taking off from aircraft carriers, including how the tank structures themselves cope with such stresses. It also isn’t clear if the CFTs impede routine maintenance or other tasks, potentially even requiring their removal and reinstallation on a regular basis, which could be a costly and time-consuming proposition and may be even more troublesome aboard the tight confines of an aircraft carrier. Of course, we have to stress that these are just some possibilities. Boeing’s Advanced Super Hornet demonstrator., Boeing Additionally, it is worth noting that the most recent annual report regarding the Super Hornet from the Pentagon’s Office of Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, which covers developments in the program during the 2020 Fiscal Year, makes no mention of CFTs in any way. Whatever the exact problems are, the Navy’s decision to entirely halt work on the CFTs, which Boeing originally unveiled as part of its Advanced Super Hornet concept in 2008, is significant. The service, as well as Boeing, had long touted the tanks as a critical component of the complete Block III upgrade package, which also includes improvements to help reduce the jet’s radar signature, modernized mission computers and data links, and new wide-area multi-function displays the cockpits, including the rear ones on two-seat F/A-18Fs, that are customizable to best meet mission requirements and user preferences. You can read more about the Block III upgrade effort here . The Navy has around 540 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and is planning to bring the vast majority of them up to the Block III standard. In addition, the Navy is putting these jets through other upgrade programs. These include the addition of improved satellite communications (SATCOM) capabilities and the ability to employ an infrared search and track (IRST) system in a modified drop tank. You can read more about the Navy’s IRST work and its significance in this past War Zone feature . There is also Service Life Modification (SLM) process that will extend each aircraft’s expected lifespan out to around 10,000 flight hours, a 50 percent increase over existing Block II Super Hornets. An overview of the components of the Block III Super Hornet upgrade package, as well as other Navy upgrade efforts for the aircraft., USN The CFTs, which are designed to be installed one on either side of the F/A-18E/F’s central spine on top of the jets’ center “barrel” section, had promised to get the upgraded aircraft greater range and performance. The two tanks can hold 515 gallons of fuel, in total, compared to 480 in the standard, draggy drop tank that Navy Super Hornets regualry carry on their centerline stations now. More importantly, the conformal tanks don’t take up space on underwing pylons, freeing them up for additional weapons or other stores. Boeing had said in the past that a CFT-equipped F/A-18E/F armed with a pair of AIM-9X Sidewinders , two AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), and two 2,000-pound-class precision-guided bombs would have a combat radius of 714 nautical miles. A combat radius of a Super Hornet with the same loadout, but only a single centerline drop tank instead of CFTs, would only be 594 nautical miles. In addition, the new IRST-equipped drop tanks sacrifice fuel to integrate that new capability. CFTs offered a way to mitigate that loss in range on aircraft carrying that sensor system. A US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet with drop tanks under each wing, as well as a modified one containing an infrared search and track system, or IRST, on its centerline station., Lockheed Martin CFTs had also been seen as a potentially significant addition to the Navy’s EA-18G Growler electronic warfare planes for the same general reasons . The Navy, together with Boeing, is still making progress in the development of the MQ-25A Stingray , an unmanned aerial tanker drone. In June, NAVAIR and Boeing announced the first successful aerial refueling of a Super Hornet by the T1 developmental test asset , which is being used to support work on the Stingray program. Earlier this month, T1 also transferred fuel to a Navy E-2D Advanced Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft equipped with an aerial refueling probe for the first time . The service only took delivery of its first non-developmental air-to-air refueling-capable E-2D in 2019. The Navy expects to reach initial operational capability with the MQ-25A in 2025. Even if it keeps to this schedule, if the service’s F/A-18E/Fs don’t receive CFTs, they will still have less range and stores-carrying capacity in combination with these drones than they would with the tanks. There will also be some amount of demand for these drones to refuel F-35C Joint Strike Fighters , which do not have the ability to carry range-extending drop-tanks at all, at present. Even if an advanced drop tank with stealthy qualities were to be developed for the Joint Strike Fighter, it would have at least some impact on the jet radar-evading characteristics and would be less likely to be employed when these jets need to be at their stealthiest. At the same time, F-35Cs do boast greater range, to being with, than Super Hornets. A briefing slide showing the Navy’s projected carrier air wing (CVW) composition by 2030, which includes five to eight MQ-25As., USN All told, the loss of hundreds of miles of potential range for the Navy’s Super Hornets could be a significant issue, especially in any future high-end conflict requiring operations across a broad area, such as a potential one against the Chinese in the Pacific region. The range capabilities of the Navy Super Hornets not only impact the targets that the jets can reach from a carrier’s deck, but also how far that flattop can stay away from enemy defenses. With anti-access and area denial threats, including ever longer-ranged and faster-flying anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles, only continuing to grow, this is not a minor issue. All of this does come as the Navy is looking to stop buying any more Super Hornets and shift its attention to a new advanced fighter jet design as part of its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. Congress has responded to those plans with skepticism and you can read more about that emerging debate between the Navy and the legislators that control its budget here . In addition, though Boeing has stressed that CFTs remain part of the packages the company has submitted for fighter competitions in Canada and Finland, the Navy’s decision could still have an impact on export opportunities. While Canada and Finland might plan to operate their jets exclusively from bases on land, this is not the case for all potential Super Hornet customers. Boeing is notably pitching the F/A-18E/F to India as a carrier-based fighter jet and artwork the company has produced of a notional Indian Super Hornet show it fitted with CFTs. Shepard News’ Martin made no mention in his Tweets about whether Boeing is still offering CFTs as part of its Indian bid. An artist’s conception of an Indian Super Hornet fitted with CFTs., Boeing As already noted, Boeing has stressed that the Navy’s Block III Super Hornets will still have the provisions necessary for the installation of CFTs in the future, if the service decides to change course. Right now, whatever issues cropped up in testing appear to have been so severe that the Navy determined that the tanks are more trouble than their worth. Update 8/26/2021: Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has now confirmed directly to The War Zone that it did issue a stop-work order with regards to the conformal fuel tanks (CFT) in the Block III upgrade package on Jan. 6. “The F/A-18 & EA-18G Program Office (PMA-265), like all U.S. Navy programs, frequently engages with industry to evaluate available technologies and how they could potentially be applied to our platforms and systems; however, this does not mean they are nor will become programs of record,” NAVAIR also said in response to a question about what other range-extension capabilities, or any other strategies to mitigate the decision to halt work on the CFTs, that it might now be exploring now.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 19, 2022",Night Stalker Little Bird Helicopters Flew German Commandos On Kabul Mission: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung is reporting that special operators from the country’s Special Forces Command (KSK), which were recently deployed to Kabul to help extract German citizens, have executed a successful heliborne operation outside of the airport. They did so not using the pair of special operations-modified Airbus H145M helicopters that were sent to support their mission ( read all about that here ), but aboard MH-6 Little Bird helicopters belonging to the legendary 160th Special Operations Airborne Regiment (SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers , instead. Süddeutsche Zeitung writes (Google translation) : Special forces of the Bundeswehr took German citizens out of Kabul for the first time with helicopters. According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung , soldiers from the Special Forces Command (KSK) and the Americans rescued more than a dozen citizens fleeing the militant Islamist Taliban in a secret operation on Wednesday night. According to Bundeswehr circles, the two Bundeswehr helicopters that were relocated to Kabul specifically for such purposes last Saturday were not used. The operation was carried out with the equally maneuverable Little Bird helicopters of the Americans. Such operations are not possible without close cooperation with the United States. The US military controls the airspace. There had been speculation about such operations for days. The soldiers on-site, led by Brigadier General Jens Arlt, had so far only operated from the ground. Using the German helicopters was initially considered too risky. It was also said that there was no release for use. In addition, the special forces initially concentrated on the vicinity of Kabul airport in order to rescue those in need of protection. According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung , the operation last night was the fourth KSK operation. It all started with the rescue of an Afghan family from Munich. … “The window to save people is closing,” say Bundeswehr circles. Accordingly, the Bundeswehr could carry out its last evacuation flights on Friday, and the rescue operation may have to be ended even earlier. The Bundeswehr depends on the USA and its people to secure the mission. The mission described sounds very much like a rescue operation that Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby and U.S. Army Major General Hank Taylor, the Director of Current Operations within the Office of the Joint Staff, disclosed at a press briefing earlier today, but would not discuss in any detail. The full exchange regarding that mission from the Pentagon’s official transcript is as follows: MAJ. GEN. TAYLOR: Yes. So last night during the period of darkness there was an operation to be able to go out and safely evacuate evacuees back into Kabul. They were at HKAI [Hamid Karzai International Airport] and they’re safely there preparing to be evacuated. Q: So when you said — was it — was it in Kabul and then they brought them into the airport or was it at… MAJ. GEN. TAYLOR: It was outside of the airfield — outside of the airfield in a way that and we were able to bring them back to Kabul safely, and they are preparing for evacuation. MR. KIRBY: Back to the airport. MAJ. GEN. TAYLOR: Airport — to the airport. MR. KIRBY: It was inside Kabul. David. Q: Americans? Q: Was that a — was that a helicopter operation? MR. KIRBY: It was. Q: Can you tell us how many? MR. KIRBY: We’re not going to provide specific details. Less than 20. Q: Less than 20. Q: Americans? MR. KIRBY: Less than 20. I’m not going to provide additional details. If the report is indeed accurate, the KSK working directly with the Night Stalkers, which have been part of the aviation portion of the evacuation since it began, and, as The War Zone was among the first to report , expanded their capacity and capabilities early in the operation, makes total sense. America’s top special operators train often with their German counterparts, which are very highly regarded for their abilities. The 160th SOAR is also extremely adaptable when it comes to working with all types of special operations players, from federal law enforcement agencies to foreign teams. The MH-47 is the Night Stalker’s heavy-lift workhorse, but its smaller stablemates off unique capabilities, as well., US Army As it sits now, ongoing extraction missions outside of the airport appear to be a joint effort between various special operations units and the CIA , with the 160th SOAR providing higher-end airlift and close air support capabilities. An H145M just like the ones sent to Afghanistan to support German special operations forces. , German Air Force For certain missions , especially urban ones , the Night Stalkers’ compact MH-6 Little Birds are especially well suited . The elite unit already knows its way around Kabul and has been operating there for nearly two decades, and continued to do so even after the Taliban took control. These and any number of other factors could have led to the KSK working with the Night Stalkers instead of using their own helicopters. MH-6 with special operators embarked on its planks., US Army Just how active the 160th has been in snatching up evacuees in Taliban-controlled urban terrain over the last week or so may not be fully known until after the operation ends, or maybe never at all. These missions are not just high-risk to the pilots and operators, but to the overall stability of the evacuation operation as a whole. One inadvertent firefight could change the direction of the entire situation drastically. As we pointed out days ago , the 160th SOAR may very well end up being the last American forces out of Afghanistan as their MH-60s and MH-47s can aerial refuel, allowing them to deploy out of the country without being broken down and loaded into airlifters as normal Army helicopters require. Even their Little Birds, which do not have aerial refueling capabilities, can be broken down and loaded into a transport plane as small as a C-130 in minutes, not hours. A 160th SOAR crewman directs the rapid loading of an AH-6 aboard a C-130. , USMC A member of the special operations community recently added some color to this special capability to The War Zone , stating: This is what they train to do. Literally weekly. Large units like the 82nd may train a couple times a year on strat air loading. And it’s usually the maintenance company that’s in charge, not the aircrews, and it takes forever. In the 160th, it’s the flight companies (to include pilots) who lead the loading and unloading for the exact purpose of being able to do the task rapidly with as few resources as needed. The 160th SOAR also has a major close air support mission in Kabul as they are able to apply kinetic capabilities more precisely than any other unit, which could be absolutely essential in what is one of the most complex urban combat environments the U.S. military has ever faced. This is especially true when it comes to protecting Hamid Karzai International from being attacked, not just supporting special operators beyond the airfield’s perimeter. An AH-6 fires .50 caliber and 7.62mm guns, as well as rockets, at the same time. These small helicopters pack a huge punch and they can employ their weapons in tight conditions where no other airborne platform can., DOD 160th SOAR Little Birds and Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) configured Black Hawks can do what even the AH-64 Apache— also deployed to the Kabul’s airport —can not. As we understand it, the Apache is limited by its crew’s visibility and how its weapons are configured. It was designed to battle tanks from a distance. As such, the visibility beneath the crew heavily is restricted at closer distances. They also rely on the TADS (Target Acquisition Designation Sight ) to operate the weapon systems, which effectively precludes them from having the ability to be surgical at very close range, unlike the MH-60 DAP or AH-6 Little Bird. The same 30mm cannon and 19-shot rocket pod shared with the DAP and the Apache is a great example of this difference. The DAP has largely the same weapons as the Apache but they are not controlled by the TADS and are fixed in place. This creates a dramatic difference in accuracy between the two frames—one is more capable of providing area effects and the other being a pinpoint precision purveyor of firepower even at very close ranges. A DAP configured MH-60 Black Hawk., United Composites It’s also worth noting that the DAP is dual-role and it can be converted back into a transport helo in a couple of hours or less.  This provides a lot of contingency capability in a single aircraft. The Little Birds can literally fly down streets below rooftop levels and employ their weapons, making very rapid and coordinated re-attacks. So basically, we are talking about a unique capability here that cannot be rivaled and is tailored for the extreme tactical situation like the one the U.S. and its allies are facing in Kabul right now. Training is another factor. The 160th SOAR features the most capable and highly trained and experienced helicopter crews in the world. Their ability to provide airlift or close air support is unrivaled. AH-6 Little Bird pilots doing their thing., DoD Still, according to our contact, it comes down to people, not hardware, that make the biggest difference: This is exactly what the unit was created to support. Surgical strike and hostage/isolated personnel rescue. … It’s not just the sexy gadgetry, but the fact that these people are ready, able, and absolutely committed to their mission, regardless of the risks or the odds. It’s truly remarkable. Buttons and switches are neat, but it’s what young men and women on the ground stand ready to do that’s magic. Always has been.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 18, 2021",Video Purports To Show U.S.-Supplied Black Helicopter Taxiing In Taliban Hands,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has emerged online that is said to show a former Afghan Air Force UH-60 Black Hawk , supplied by the United States and now under the control of the Taliban, taxing on the ground at Kandahar Airport in southeastern Afghanistan. Whether the description of the video is accurate or not, it is likely to be at least a propaganda coup for the Taliban, which seized substantial amounts of American-financed military aircraft , light armored vehicles, weapons, and more that had belonged to government security forces over the course of its lightning-quick conquest of the bulk of the country earlier this month. At the same time, it remains to be seen how extensively the Taliban will use any of the Black Hawks, or any other aircraft the group has captured, or if they will serve other purposes, including simply as trophies. It is important to note that the video, seen in the Tweet below, does not show the UH-60 in question actually flying and there is no indication one way or another that it got off the ground in this particular instance. It’s also not clear who might be behind the controls. It is difficult to accurately assess how many UH-60s, or any other types of former Afghan military aircraft, that the Taliban have now captured. Last week, Reuters reported that the Taliban had seized approximately 40 fixed-wing planes and helicopters, but satellite imagery from that The War Zone has reviewed from Planet labs indicates that this total is likely higher. Experts and observers had already identified what appeared to be at least four different Black Hawks under Taliban control. This included two at the airport in Kandahar, which is collocated with a major air base that the U.S. military turned over to the now-defunct government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in May. It is also known that dozens of aircraft from the former Afghan military have fled the country to airports in neighboring Uzbekistan and Tajikistan . Satellite imagery indicates that six UH-60s were among the dozens of fixed-wing types and helicopters that arrived at Termez Airport in Uzbekistan in the aftermath of the fall of Kabul on Aug. 15. You can read more about that in detail in this past War Zone piece . Some of the former Afghan military UH-60 Black Hawk and Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip helicopters at Termez Airport in Uzbekistan are seen in this satellite image taken on Aug. 16, 2021., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION https://t.co/sqiWNxtXNh — Yuri Lyamin (@imp_navigator) August 17, 2021 Accurate accounting, in any way, of former Afghan military aircraft is made even more difficult by the lack of available public information on the inventory of the former Special Mission Wing (SMW), a dedicated special operations aviation element that was separate from the Afghan Air Force. It is unclear what the SMW’s overall size at the time of the collapse of the country’s government, or at any time prior to then, and what overlap there might have been, if any, between in its fleets and those of the Afghan Air Force. As of June 30, the Afghan Air Force had 45 UH-60s, 33 of which were categorized as “usable / in-country,” according to the most recent quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a U.S. government watchdog that Congress established in 2008. That same report said that the SMW had just recently begun to integrate Black Hawks into its operations, but does not make clear whether or not those helicopters remained technically assigned to the Afghan Air Force’s fleet. SIGAR’s public summary of Afghan Air Force fleet totals, as well as details about their readiness, as of June 30. This does not include aircraft assigned to the Special Mission Wing., SIGAR Whatever the total number of Black Hawks that remain in Afghanistan might be, and whether or not this newly emerged video does actually show one that now belongs to the Taliban moving on the ground, how many Black Hawks the group has now that could be reasonably described as flyable is a completely different question. The decision by the U.S. government to supply UH-60s to the Afghan Air Force, ostensibly to supplant its Russian-made Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip-type helicopters, was highly controversial , to begin with. Though the case was made that the new helicopters offered valuable additional capability for Afghanistan’s security forces, the decision was largely driven by U.S. sanctions on Russian creating significant hurdles for the continued sustainment of the existing Hips. A general push to “buy American” and other political considerations were also factors, despite the Afghan military’s extensive experience with Mi-8/Mi-17 series and lack thereof with regards to the UH-60. It’s worth noting that footage of the Taliban flying in Hips has, perhaps unsurprisingly, already surfaced . By the time Kabul fell, maintenance of the Afghan Black Hawk fleet was still almost entirely reliant on foreign contractors, who left the country earlier this year as part of the U.S. government’s existing drawdown plan. Contractors continued to work with their Afghan counterparts remotely, but their absence on the ground have a huge impact on the readiness of the UH-60 fleet, as well as others. “The [readiness rate of the] UH-60 fleet was at 77% in April and May, but dropped to 39% in June,” according to SIGAR’s last quarterly review. That report also said that “the SMW can field no more than one UH-60 per night for helicopter missions,” a notable detail, given that the SMW was long understood to be better resourced than the regular Afghan Air Force. “A technical issue now meant an aircraft — a Black Hawk helicopter, a C-130 transport, a surveillance drone — would be grounded,” Lieutenant General Sami Sadat, who had been the commander of the Afghan National Army’s 215th Corps, wrote in a piece that The New York Times published just today . “The contractors also took proprietary software and weapons systems with them. They physically removed our helicopter missile-defense system. Access to the software that we relied on to track our vehicles, weapons and personnel also disappeared. Real-time intelligence on targets went out the window, too.” Contractor-related issues were only some of the factors in the readiness equation. As of June 30, despite having 45 UH-60s in inventory, the Afghan Air Force only had 28 complete, fully-qualified Black Hawk aircrews, which would include the pilot, co-pilot, and crew chief. It’s also worth noting that the Taliban had been actively pursuing a campaign of assassinating Afghan Air Force pilots as part of the group’s overall campaign to take control of the country. As already noted, we don’t know who might have been in the cockpit of the helicopter seen in the video reportedly taken in Kandahar and the Taliban may well have deliberately shrunk the pool of potentially available pilots with any experience on the Black Hawk. This does not, of course, completely eliminate the possibility that the group may have subsequently enticed or coerced at least one such pilot to defect . A lack of qualified maintenance personnel and sources of spare parts could still lead to any remaining operational Afghan UH-60s ending up grounded. At the same time, depending on the state of the entire fleet of captured Black Hawks, the Taliban might be able to cannibalize other airframes to help keep a smaller number airworthy. The group, who is well on their way to establishing a new formal government in Afghanistan, could reach out to other countries. China, which has been actively engaging with the Taliban in recent months, notably purchased a small fleet of S-70s, the commercial version of the Black Hawk, in the 1980s and has experience operating and supporting the type. Regardless, the captured Black Hawks, flyable or not, will still be useful to the Taliban as trophies for propaganda purposes than as operational airframes. It also remains to be seen whether or not any foreign countries, such as Russia or China, will have any interest in the UH-60s for their intelligence value or any other reason, though this seems unlikely. The Black Hawks that the U.S. government supplied to the Afghans were refurbished ex-U.S. Army UH-60A models brought up to a standard, referred to as UH-60A+ , which was described as being close, performance-wise to the UH-60L. UH-60As and UH-60Ls, and equivalent commercial models, have been in service around the world for decades now, and are not representative of the latest UH-60M and UH-60V variants in U.S. Army service. There is also no indication that the United States ever followed through on plans to deliver more capable armed gunship variants of the Black Hawk to Afghan forces, which might have contained more sensitive systems. Questions about the Taliban’s ability to use and sustain any Black Hawks it now possesses, even in the near term, apply equally to other captured Afghan military aircraft. The need for extensive contractor support was a major factor in the readiness of other types, as well, including A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft and AC-208 armed light utility planes , both of which were capable of employing precision-guided munitions . Contractors and Afghan personnel work on an Afghan Air Force A-29 Super Tucano., USAF The A-29s and AC-208s were arguably the most modern aircraft in the Afghan Air Force’s inventory and the systems on board those planes, such as their sensor turrets or avionics, could be of greater value to outside actors, including foreign intelligence agencies. This would also be the case with regards to any ex-SMW PC-12NG intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft now in Taliban hands. The actual capabilities of the specialized PC-12NGs and their overall configurations are somewhat of a mystery, making them perhaps the biggest question mark in terms of intelligence vulnerabilities. An Afghan Special Mission Wing PC-12NG., DOD It is worth noting that General Sadat’s New York Times piece does raise new questions about whether certain sensitive pieces of equipment were already removed from various Afghan military aircraft as contractors left the country, specifically to mitigate any security risks. “It’s understandable for people to be concerned about any capability falling into the hands of folks where we don’t know exactly how they’re going to use it, who are going to use it against, whether that’s an M16 [rifle] or whether that’s an A-29,” U.S. Air Force General Mark Kelly, head of Air Combat Command, had also told Defense News in an interview last week. “But suffice to say that the technology that’s in the A-29 is not cutting-edge technology.” The Taliban could also seek to negotiate with the United States over the Black Hawks, or any other aircraft it has captured. Though the possibility seems remote, finding a way to effectively sell the aircraft back to the U.S. government could be especially beneficial for the group given that billions of dollars in Afghan government funds are now frozen in American banks. They could also seek to sell significant portions of the former Afghan military aircraft fleets to other buyers. Whether the U.S. government might seek to impede any of this directly remains in question. There have been reported discussions among American officials already about the potential of using airstrikes to destroy captured equipment in Afghanistan after the ongoing evacuation operations in Kabul wrap up. No matter what, the Taliban just getting a Black Hawk up and running at all is certainly embarrassing for the U.S. government and the group has multiple ways it could exploit those helicopters, as well as other U.S.-supplied aircraft it has now captured. At the same time, the actual operational utility of any of those planes or helicopters or the actual security risks they might pose to the United States, or its allies and partners, remain to be seen.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 24, 2021",These Are The Military’s Options For Extending Evacuations In Afghanistan. None Of Them Are Good.,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It is looking less and less plausible that the U.S. and its allies can get everyone out of Afghanistan they need to, as well as their own military personnel and assets, by the time the August 31st deadline strikes . This is becoming a massively contentious issue as parts of the international community, including close allies to the United States, and those in U.S. Congress, are demanding the timeline be left undefined in order to end the evacuation when it makes sense operationally, not based on previous promises to the Taliban. So what does a prolonged evacuation mission look like in what could be a fully contested environment—one in which the Taliban does not offer security assurances to the U.S., nor allows it to be in the country at all anymore, even possibly taking direct military action against American forces that remain there? First off, some sort of deal is clearly being sought between the U.S. and the Taliban. CIA Director Bill Burns met with the head of Taliban, kingpin Abdul Ghani Baradar, in a clandestine face-to-face engagement, in an obvious attempt to work something out. The problem is, what the Taliban will want in exchange for allowing an extended U.S. evacuation operation will probably be very troublesome to give—most likely access to large financial resources and limitations on who the U.S. can evacuate, as well as yet another deadline. And that is if they are willing to negotiate at all. In this image provided by the Minnesota National Guard, Minnesota National Guard Task Force 1-194 soldiers fly on a C-17 Globemaster en route to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Monday, Aug. 23, 2021., AP After fighting the U.S. for two decades, allowing its once bitter enemy, who it has long branded as an occupying force, to basically operate a beachhead at the country’s international airport in the capital indefinitely is hardly a good look, at least internally amongst the Taliban’s own ranks. But the U.S. has locked access to billions in funds that the Taliban will really need in order to transition to ruling the country in any kind of a smooth manner (albeit everything is relative with the Taliban in charge). Possibly a deal in which these funds are slowly released as the U.S. completes its evacuation operations could be had, but politically speaking, handing the Taliban access to billions of dollars is hardly a welcome move, especially for the already embattled Biden Administration who continues to cling to the hopelessly bogus claim that this evacuation operation was well planned and executed. Such an agreement will immediately be deemed a ‘drug deal’ by political opponents and even some allies alike. Just the human rights dimension of such an agreement would be very damning in itself. Taliban fighters patrol in Kabul, Afghanistan. After the Taliban takeover, employees of the collapsed government, civil society activists, and women are among the at-risk Afghans who have gone into hiding or are staying off the streets., AP Assuming the Taliban say no to any deal offered by the U.S., and beyond American forces leaving prematurely and likely destroying billions in hardware on the way out, the hulks of which will still be used as trophies by the Taliban, maybe the best hope would be that the Taliban will work with other foreign elements to keep its airport open to commercial flights. Under such an arrangement, the group would still need to allow foreigners to leave unmolested. Yet under even this unrealistically hopeful scenario, there would be no U.S. force protection or presence of any kind. Basically, whoever is left would be entirely at the mercy of the Taliban, beyond whatever country is providing basic security at the airport. But as we know all too well, just getting evacuees to the airport safely is becoming the biggest battle. Many would view this possibility as unacceptable, regardless. Once again, America would literally be betting people’s lives—many of which are viewed as traitors or marked individuals by the Taliban—on the Taliban’s word and kindness. What about the U.S. government just telling the Taliban to piss off and that it will be finished when it’s finished with the operation? Well, first of all, the U.S. would then be operating in a contested scenario, surrounded by the enemy, with a very shallow perimeter between its forces and Taliban militants, and this would be occurring in a dense urban environment surrounded by civilians where the Taliban have a distinct advantage. RPGs, mortars, and even basic gunfire becomes a massive threat when the proximities are so small and the bad guys are actually instructed to use those lowly capabilities against you. U.S. Marines with Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force – Crisis Response – Central Command, provide assistance during an evacuation at Hamid Karzai International Airport, Kabul, Afghanistan., AP As I have discussed in the past, a single mortar team could wreak absolute havoc on Kabul’s airport, the aircraft parked there, and the people trying to evacuate and keep the airport operating. It is very clear where the aircraft—which are giant immobile gas cans when on the ground—are all parked. You could just imagine what even a single well-placed mortar could do to the flightline and those trying to board aircraft on it. Even fire from an AK-47 or machine gun can bring down a mighty transport aircraft. At the same time, traditional forms of airpower have little effect in countering or even responding to such attacks under these circumstances. Now, if the Taliban actually ordered an assault on the airfield, it would be a whole other level of bad. In other words, Hamid Karzai International Airport, which is loosely akin to the highly intimate San Diego International in its size, layout, and urban locale, is about as bad a place to execute a contested operation like this as one can imagine. Hamid Karzai International in Kabul., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Making things worse, the Taliban will just shut down all roads leading to the airport and brutally punish those who try to circumvent the de facto siege. At that point the U.S. would be relying on vertical lift—helicopters—to go collect people to evacuate. Every single mission would be different with its own major risks, the Taliban being basically everywhere is glaringly one of them, and even the helicopters would become prized targets. That isn’t good when their only base of operations is at an airport in the middle of Afghanistan’s largest city that is encircled by Taliban fighters. Not the best scenario by any means. In this image provided by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Air Force aircrew, assigned to the 816th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, prepare to load qualified evacuees aboard a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III aircraft in support of the Afghanistan evacuation at Hamid Karzai International Airport, Kabul, Afghanistan., AP Then we come back to Bagram Airfield —you know, the massive installation with two runways and a huge, well-fortified perimeter, located in a not-so-dense area around 25 miles north of Kabul? That one. In one of the strangest military decisions I have seen in my life, the U.S. gave the stronghold back to the Afghans in early July—well, more like it cut and ran from the facility it built up so much over 20 years. Why on earth the U.S. would have done this before the evacuation had ended is just beyond puzzling. As we have stated repeatedly , Bagram would have provided a more secure location to help relieve the pressure of operations at Hamid Karzai International, as well as being a contingency location should the security situation in Kabul deteriorate massively, which at one point, it did. C-130s and CH-47s could have ferried evacuees from Kabul to Bagram to help offset some of the smaller urban airport’s load. In fact, airliners could have been leveraged more easily at the far more secure Bagram Air Base instead of just military transports, and direct rescue operations using helicopters could have been run out of there more securely. Bagram Airfield., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Listen, the list of advantages goes on and on. The point being is that the U.S. government could now either work a deal with the Taliban or take it back by force in order to continue the evacuation in a more secure and less high-profile locale. Beyond shuttling people from Hamid Karzai International, helicopters could be used to pick up evacuees all over the country at unpredictable locales and they could then be flown out of Bagram. The U.S. Army’s 173rd Airborne Brigade out of Italy is set up for just this kind of mission—airfield seizure. If they are not presently tasked, they could at least help secure the field until the United States decides to leave based on its own timeline. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NR7D7L3e_bE The problem with this plan has to do with how the Taliban may react. If they decide to militarily contest the occupation of Bagram Airfield, the U.S. would still deal with threats from beyond its perimeter, although they will not be so dense, surrounded by innocent lives, or near in proximity as at Hamid Karzai International, which is a huge difference. The U.S. government could threaten to destabilize the Taliban government unless they leave American forces alone at Bagram and otherwise play very hardball with them. This could have the desired effect of the Taliban protesting the presence of U.S. troops at Bagram, but taking a wait-and-see attitude. The other possibility is that the Taliban starts taking hostages and putting on large-scale executions until the U.S. military leaves. Of course, this would result in a dramatic response from the United States, as well as the world community, and the Taliban would be risking a ton in doing so just to antagonize the U.S. government even though they are fully aware that American forces will eventually leave. Then we have the ‘ over the horizon ‘ option, which isn’t really an alternative to forces in situ at all. The cold truth is that Afghanistan is a landlocked country surrounded by nations that are either hostile to the United States or do not want to directly support our operations in the now Taliban-controlled country. In other words, staging special operations and other forces in a bordering country and flying groups of people out that way isn’t readily on the table, at least that we know of, and doing so would come with great risk, especially without establishing a temporary austere base in the country to support these operations. An MH-47 Chinook from the US Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment refuels in flight from a US Air Force MC-130 special operations transport/tanker aircraft., US Army So unless a deal can be worked with a neighboring country—one that can even be trusted—even this low-volume solution is really not possible without going to sea basing, and that is the most inconvenient proposition of them all. Kabul is 800 miles from international waters, which includes flying over Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is beyond the range of any helicopter without inflight refueling. Executing such long-range missions using CH-53Es, HH-60s, MH-60s, or MH-47s, would be a slow and challenging process to sustain and would be rife with risk, especially at the volumes needed to continue any meaningful form of mass evacuations. The MV-22 Osprey fleet could potentially be mobilized to a large degree to support this concept, but doing so from the sea would require any available amphibious assault ships, sea bases, or even supercarriers, to be reconfigured to enable primarily these operations. This and deploying enough Ospreys would take time the U.S. does not have. How long the MV-22 fleet could sustain such an extremely high-tempo operation is also highly questionable. The MV-22 is technically capable of making it to Afghanistan and back at faster speeds than helicopters, but leveraging the force en masse to do so would be a huge undertaking and would take time to assemble. , USMC There is one more wildcard that could impact all of this. Not all of Afghanistan is controlled by the Taliban. There is a burgeoning resistance group not far to the north of Kabul that has actually gained ground in recent days, although the Taliban is trying to see that come to an end. The group is led by ex-Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh and former Afghan politician Ahmad Massoud, the latter being the son of a legendary Northern Alliance general, and has battle-hardened fighters protecting an area of Afghanistan that has never fallen to the Taliban. You can read all about this group in this past article of ours . This group’s existence and moderate values could represent a major opportunity for the United States. The Pentagon could potentially help reinforce this resistance and set up an austere forward operating base capable of sustaining helicopters and tactical transport aircraft in this still autonomous region. Using a hub and spoke arrangement, helicopters could fly evacuees in from around Afghanistan and C-130s and possibly even C-17s could fly them out of the country. Even the C-17 can operate from austere airfields when needed, although the C-130 is better suited for the mission when very rough strips are involved., USAF We have a limited understanding of the disposition of this rebel force at this time and how the Taliban’s new counter-offensive against them is going, so it isn’t clear how feasible such a plan would be, but it may represent the best opportunity available if indeed the security situation in the region is relatively stable. Still, such a move will result in a major reaction from the Taliban, which sees this group as an existential threat to their dominion over the country. There is a model for this already, though. It is how the U.S. military originally took control of Afghanistan with the help of the Northern Alliance, primarily by leveraging airpower to support advances by local forces. Doing the same just to support the group long enough to get everyone out could be a very attractive possibility, and the Taliban would not be able to use dense urban terrain to shield itself from airpower, like in Kabul. A remote austere forward operating base could be set up independently in the country without help from indigenous forces, but securing it and the territory around it for what would be an operation that would last days, but will still be limited in duration, would be very challenging. Overall such a concept is extremely risky and it poses a whole number of extreme logistical and security challenges. Doing so for a one-off operation that lasts hours, not days, is much more plausible, but it does not address the sustained evacuation operations issue. So, there you have it, there are no good solutions here that immediately come to mind, with the best and most realistic one likely being making a miserable deal with the Taliban to allow the U.S. to continue operations in exchange for funding their dastardly government or who knows what. Even then, getting Afghan allies out of the country will likely not be possible outside of pointed vertical lift operations as the Taliban is already drastically curtailing the ability of Afghans to leave their country. The only other option may be just leaving many who the U.S. has promised safe passage behind to be dealt with by the Taliban. But even then, we are unlikely to be fully done with the evacuation, albeit who we can actually extract and when will become incredibly limited. All this is a product of poor planning and questionable intelligence, or at least questionable interpretation and execution based on existing intelligence. We are paying the price now and it could get much higher before this is all over.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 27, 2021",U.S. Prepared To Destroy Equipment It Can’t Airlift Out Of Kabul As Withdrawal Deadline Looms (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has confirmed that U.S. forces at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul could destroy any weapons and other equipment that they cannot take with them as they withdraw at the end of the ongoing evacuation operations . This comes as the planned deadline for the conclusion of this mission, Aug. 31, looms ever closer. To be completely gone by that date, American troops will have to begin packing up sooner than that, which only raises further questions about how many evacuees will actually be able to depart safely in the end, especially now that the Taliban says it has actively begun blocking Afghan citizens from leaving the country. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby, together with U.S. Army Major General Hank Taylor, the Director of Current Operations within the Office of the Joint Staff, spoke the process of the final American withdrawal from Kabul, whenever that might occur, during his latest press briefing on the still highly fluid situation in Afghanistan today. Kirby made clear that, if nothing changes, the plan is to complete a total withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from Afghanistan by next Tuesday. A member of the Canadian armed forces walks past Afghans at an entry point into Hamid Karzai International Airport, with US troops seen in the background, on Aug. 24, 2021., USMC “The drawdown of both people and equipment will be done in the same manner that we would do it anywhere else,” he said. “Obviously, there’s a strong bias to be able to get our materiel out with our people. If there needs to be destruction or other disposition of equipment there at Hamid Karzai International Airport then do that and we’ll do that appropriately.” Kirby did not elaborate on what American troops could be compelled to destroy, or how they might do it, as the withdrawal deadline approaches. The U.S. military did notably destroy an unknown quantity of ammunition at Bagram Airfield, which is situated north of Kabul, before it executed the extremely controversial pullout of the last of its personnel from that base in July. Various kinds of large and otherwise costly items could well be among what has to be destroyed. As The War Zone was first to report last week, the U.S. State Department has already confirmed that it has no intention of airlifting seven of its CH-46E Sea Knight helicopters out of the country and that it has deliberately disabled them in unspecified ways. The New York Times reported yesterday that an unspecified Counter-Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM) defense system, very possibly a Centurion C-RAM system, which you can read more about here , had been destroyed in place that the U.S. Embassy when it was shuttered last week. Light armored vehicles had also been abandoned after being rendered inoperable. Similarly, several armored vehicles weren't driven to HKIA but were instead left inoperable at the embassy compound, a contractor said. Based on corroborating video with satellite imagery, I can confirm this includes several Oshkosh L-ATVs and Lenco BearCats. — Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) August 23, 2021 It also remains to be seen whether American troops might be ordered to destroy or otherwise disable any remaining aircraft, or other weapons and equipment, at Hamid Karzai International Airport that had belonged to the military of Afghanistan prior to the Taliban takeover last week. There have been reports of discussions, broadly, with the U.S. government about the potential use of airstrikes to destroy a wide variety of weapons and equipment that have fallen into the Taliban’s hands. A recent satellite image of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. “Any retrograde out of, or drawdown, if you will, out of an environment that you can’t assume, is always going to be permissive is one that has to be done very carefully,” Kirby added, acknowledging that the potential threats to American and other foreign troops at the airport, as well as evacuees, are already significant. “It has to be sequenced in a very methodical way so that the safety and security of our people and the people we’re trying to protect is considered of paramount importance.” He further explained that the Pentagon is not planning to provide any sort of regular updates about the withdrawal of troops or materiel, regardless of when that process starts or is expected to conclude. This is necessary to “limit vulnerabilities in the information space and in the actual physical space of the airport as we move out,” he said. Broadly speaking, any such withdrawal needs to be “done in a very careful, methodical way so that you can preserve as much capability to the very end as you need, as well as security… not just the security for our folks, but the security for the people we’re trying to safely evacuate.” Questions about this final withdrawal process, and what it will mean for the ongoing evacuation operations, are growing as a consensus is emerging that it will be impossible, logistically, to evacuate all Americans, along with thousands of other foreign nationals and at-risk Afghans, by the end of the month. This is an increasingly inescapable reality despite the U.S. military significantly increasing the rate at which it has been able to get evacuees out of the country. At the press briefing today, General Taylor said that the U.S. government had been able to facilitate the departure of 1,000 people every hour in the past 24 hours, but acknowledged that there is still much work to be done.

Austin III (@SecDef) August 24, 2021 Reports coming out now make clear there is a fierce debate happening, both within the U.S. government and among other nations, about the possibility of extending the evacuation mission in Kabul beyond the current Aug. 31 deadline. Various foreign officials have said in the past 24 hours that the final departure of American troops from Kabul would likely spell the end of their smaller evacuation missions. Today, representatives of the G7 group of industrialized nations, which includes the United States, issued a statement that included a call to “avoid arbitrary dates for ending military support to the evacuation.” Chairs of #G7 member states' foreign affairs committees issue statement on #Afghanistan . pic.twitter.com/KGA9z4H4Jn — Steve Herman (@W7VOA) August 24, 2021 In addition, Adam Smith, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters that there is a contingency plan for continuing to conducting operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport after leaving a classified briefing regarding the situation in Afghanistan today. At the same time, there are other reports that President Joe Biden is looking to hold firm on the Aug. 31 date. It is, of course, worth noting that having a contingency plan and actually implementing that plan are two completely different things. House Armed Services Committee Chair Adam Smith (D-Wash.), emerging from classified briefing just now, tells us that there is in fact a contingency plan for going beyond Aug. 31. He said there are “absolutely” risks to Americans & servicemembers if troops stay past Aug. 31. https://t.co/R6CwbEVlHR — Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) August 24, 2021 A core issue in this discussion remains that the ability of any evacuation operations in Kabul, current or future, to proceed without interference, or worse, is entirely dependent on the Taliban. American officials continue to make no secret that troops on the ground and other personnel are engaging on a daily basis with Taliban members on various issues. The Washington Post was first to report earlier today that the Biden administration had dispatched Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director William Burns, who is also a career diplomat, to hold a secret face-to-face meeting with Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, which very likely touched on the deadline issue, among other things. The Taliban, publicly, continued to make clear that they want all American and other foreign troops out of Kabul by Aug. 31, whatever the outcome of the reported Burns-Baradar meeting, or any other discussions between American and Taliban officials, might have been. Pentagon Press Secretary Kirby said it was his understanding that there was little “dissonance” between the Taliban’s public position on this matter and what its members had been telling their U.S. government counterparts behind closed doors. Adding to the complexity of the situation, the Taliban further announced today that it was blocking Afghans from getting to Hamid Karzai International Airport. “The road that ends at the Kabul airport has been blocked. Foreigners can go through it, but Afghans are not allowed to take the road,” Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesperson for the group, said at his own press briefing today. “This country needs our doctors, engineers, and those who are educated — we need these talents.” ""We will not be extending 31st deadline. They can take all the people who belong to them. We are not going to let Afghans leave"" spokesperson for the Taliban Zabiullah Mujahid says those with foreign passports can leave but not Afghan nations #Afghanistan — Yalda Hakim (@SkyYaldaHakim) August 24, 2021 Taliban has started to lock it down asking Afghans not to go to the airport and asking the US to not to encourage people to leave the country as “Afghanistan needs their talents” Thousands are still desperately trying to get to the airport — Nafiseh Kohnavard (@nafisehkBBC) August 24, 2021 Of course, this implicitly also means that Afghans who might be at risk of Taliban reprisals, such as those who worked with the U.S. government or other foreign organizations over the past two decades, will also be prevented from reaching the safety of the airport. There had already been reports that this was happening, but now it is a matter of official Taliban policy and it is unclear what options the U.S. government or other countries may have now to get Afghans out of the country. All told, the future of the U.S. military’s evacuation mission in Kabul and, by extension, those of other countries, is highly uncertain at present. Unless an official decision is made to extend these operations soon, American troops will need to begin packing up well ahead of the Aug. 31 deadline. As those withdrawals progress it will only get harder to reverse course and the risk to forces still at the airport will dramatically increase. U.S. officials say the military will have to begin its withdrawal from Afghanistan by Friday to meet the August 31 deadline. — Idrees Ali (@idreesali114) August 24, 2021 If a decision is made to keep U.S. troops in Kabul after that date, they could find themselves trying to continue evacuation operations while in active conflict with the Taliban. If the overall security situation were to devolve rapidly at that point, American forces could find themselves in the even riskier position of having to execute a hasty withdrawal while under attack. At that point, it’s not hard to see precious airlift capacity being devoted to moving people, rather than equipment. For example, a single helicopter could take up the entire cargo bay of a C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane that could be used to carry hundreds of passengers instead. With limited support available on the ground at the very end of the mission, fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters with aerial refueling capabilities, such as the elements of the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) now in Kabul, could easily be among the very last to leave, as The War Zone has previously explored in detail . It is in those circumstances, especially, that they could find themselves most compelled to destroy various weapons or other equipment in place as they leave the country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 23, 2022",Watch The Ex-USS Ingraham Frigate Get Its Back Broken By A Torpedo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has released a video montage from a recent Sinking Exercise , or SINKEX, off the coast of Hawaii. The footage includes clips showing the Navy, together with the Marine Corps, pummelling the ex-USS Ingraham , the last Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate ever built, with a variety of weapons, before a Mk 48 torpedo fired from the Los Angeles class nuclear attack submarine USS Chicago finally breaks the ship in two. The SINKEX was one part of the unprecedently huge Large Scale Exercise (LSE) 2021 , which began on Aug. 2 and ended on Aug. 16. LSE 2021 was centered, in large part, on helping the Navy and Marines explore and refine various new expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations . The SINKEX portion was focused on demonstrating various long-range maritime strike capabilities that both services have now or are in the process of fielding. The first half or so of the video, seen in full above, starts with a series of clips showing various weapon systems employed in the SINKEX. In order of appearance, they are Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes and Marine F/A-18C/D Hornet fighter jets armed with AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missiles, a UGM-84D submarine-launched Harpoon onboard USS Chicago , the ground-based Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) unmanned launch system for the stealthy Naval Strike Missile (NSM) cruise missile, and Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets armed with AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) precision-guided glide bombs. As already noted, USS Chicago , which also happens to be the Navy’s oldest Los Angeles class submarine presently in service, after the decommissioning of USS Olympia in February, also fired a Mk 48 torpedo during the SINKEX. Navy F-35C Joint Strike Fighters dropped Paveway-series laser-guided bombs, as well. The F-35Cs flew from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson , which is the first to carry those stealthy jets on an operational cruise. The second portion of the video shows various weapons being fired at the ex-USS Ingraham , which was decommissioned in 2015 and was subsequently set aside to be used as a target, and then hitting the ship. The strike footage includes a clip where a smaller weapon, possibly a JSOW or Paveway, appears to strike the center of the ship, followed by a missile, which would be either a Harpoon or an NSM, hitting the stern. A screengrab from the US Navy’s video montage from the recent SINKEX conducted as part of Large Scale Exercise 2021. Smoke is seen rising from the center of the ship where a weapon has impacted. The white object seen to the left of the stern is a missile about to hit the ship., USN capture This is followed by a view of the Mk 48 torpedo striking the side of the former Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate, causing the center of the ship’s hull to buckle and likely break. Another view of the coup de grace torpedo impact, seen below, had already emerged online . The Navy’s new video ends with the sunken ship’s bow seen still poking straight up above the waves. Overall, it’s an impressive display of maritime firepower and demonstrated various maritime strike capabilities that the Navy and Marine Corps see as essential components of their new concepts of operations. In the end, though, it also highlighted how torpedoes, such as the Mk 48, are still king when it comes to sinking warships. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 21, 2020",Massive Expansion Underway At Russia’s Northernmost Arctic Air Base (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is continuing to expand its aviation facilities at Nagurskoye Air Base , which sits adjacent to its large Arctic Trefoil outpost . A year ago nearly to the day, we reported on Russia’s work to expand the base’s runway from 8,200 feet to 11,500 feet before winter, as well as prepping other areas for improvement. Now it appears that not only was the runway extension successfully executed last winter, as predicted , but a new, massive parking apron is now under construction that can support far larger aircraft deployments of aircraft than in the past. This fits with Russia’s strategy to militarily dominate the increasingly strategic Arctic region, which will see new shipping routes emerge due to climate change and is high in energy reserves. In fact, satellite imagery also shows that a small deployment of cargo aircraft, A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning aircraft, and MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors already occurred last winter. You can see the massive apron under construction at the highly remote base in the image at the top of this story and below, which was taken by Planet Labs on August 19th, 2021: Image of the airfield taken on August 19th, 2021. The northern apron area is being expanded to a very large degree., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. As noted earlier, the new apron sits next to the large runway extension that was completed last summer. You see below what the runway looked like during that construction around this time last year: The runway being lengthened a year ago., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. The same runway seen two years ago, in 2019, before being lengthened and improved., PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. As you can see, this new large apron area in the northern area of the base will connect with the smaller existing apron area located midfield. This lengthened runway and the existing parking area were used last winter, when a deployment of Il-76 and An-26 cargo aircraft, as well as an A-50 airborne early warning aircraft and MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors, called the base home for a period of time. The A-50 and Foxhound combo could provide a large anti-air umbrella over a major swathe of the Arctic region. Now, with an expanded runway and greatly enlarged parking areas, these deployments can grow dramatically, and will likely include strategic bombers and maritime patrol aircraft in the future. March 27th image showing the deployment of aircraft and what appear to be missiles to the existing apron area on the airstrip. It is very challenging to obtain optical satellite imagery of the base as it is almost always covered over solid by clouds., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Our analysis on what the highly strategic installation could provide really hasn’t changed, but the addition of the large apron area was the missing link needed to ramp up and support persistent combat aircraft operations from the base. We stated the following a year ago: The work being done represents a major expansion of the strategic airfield, which sits on an island called Alexandra Land in the Franz Josef archipelago, since Russia first announced plans to establish it in 2016. At that time, a separate dirt strip located to the east at the original base, which then became a snow-covered runway in the winter months, measuring just over 5,575 feet long, was the only means of supporting air operations there. Russia began paving the new air base’s runway, as well as an apron, in 2018. In April 2020, a press release from the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet declared that the completed facility was capable of regular operations throughout the year. That announcement was already a major development, regardless of Nagurskoye Air Base’s size. Since around 2014, Russia has embarked on a campaign to steadily expand its physical presence in the Arctic, including the construction of new airfields, as well as the refurbishment of existing sites. As it stands now, there are a number of operating locations in the country’s frigid northern regions. However, a significant number of these sites are little more than seasonal ice runways, which do not allow for year-round operations, and therefore offer much more limited benefits for the Russian military. The risk of extremely poor weather remains a major hazard to aerial activity in the region, in general. In fact, just getting a satellite image of the base is extremely rare, with cloud cover being present consistently throughout the year. The increasingly robust air base at Nagurskoye raises the possibility that combat aircraft will actually be permanently, or at least rotationally stationed there sometime in the near term. As far back as 2016, the Russian Ministry of Defense had publicly laid out plans to build special heated hangars there to house MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors or Su-34 Fullback combat jets, as well as Il-78 aerial refueling tankers . There have been continued reports since then that a unit of MiG-31s could eventually take up station at the Arctic air base. A MiG-31 interceptor flying over the snow-covered Russian countryside. , Dmitriy Pichugin/wikicommons Il-76 Candid airlifters already make trips to help bring in supplies, equipment, and personnel to the remote outpost. These flights have supported the continued growth of the Arctic Trefoil, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . Construction of much more expansive facilities in recent years has enabled the base to support larger operations , as well as the construction of a radar site to allow personnel to better monitor nearby air and sea activity. Russia has also indicated that it could establish actual air defenses at the site to further protect it. With its much longer runway, as well as any other improved facilities, Nagurskoye may be more capable of acting at least as a forward staging base for larger aerial assets, such as Tu-95 Bear and Tu-160 Blackjack bombers and Tu-142 Bear and Il-38 maritime patrol aircraft . These aircraft have already been conducting more regular flights in the Arctic from bases on mainland Russia, presenting numerous challenges to potential opponents, especially with regards to foreign submarine operations , which have long used the remote, often ice-covered waters to help evade detection while conducting various activities. Russia’s entire Arctic push has been driven in no small part by receding polar ice, a product of global climate change, allowing Russian military forces and commercial interests , as well as those from other countries, to operate more regularly in the region. This has notably included increased commercial shipping activity through Arctic waters during periods of the year when those routes had previously been impassable, or at least required the use of ships with ice-capable hulls or escorting icebreakers . There is also now new potential for the exploitation of various natural resources in the region, ranging from oil to fish. All of this has, in turn, increased the potential for both competition and conflict. Even just using Nagurskoye as a base for interceptors and strike aircraft would mean that Russia has the only tactical air combat capabilities permanently stationed in the entire region. A mix of interceptors and maritime strike fighters, as well as airborne early warning and maritime patrol aircraft, would give Russia the ability to reach out from its most northerly base and control the skies and seas over long distances around it. This, together with any future ground-based defenses , would give the Kremlin an anti-access/area-denial upper-hand in what could very well become one of the most hotly contested areas of the planet, but one that is also incredibly inhospitable and would present significant operational challenges for opponents without a similarly well-established physical presence in the region. We have seen similar airfield expansion efforts in Syria that, as predicted, precipitated the deployment of strategic bomber aircraft and MiG-31s. With all this in mind, if Russia can finish the apron by the time the very harsh weather hits at its most northerly major military installation, winter could see the deployment of large numbers of combat to the new apron. In that regard, last year’s deployment of an A-50 and a handful of MiG-31s was likely just a preview of what to come as Moscow moves to cement its military supremacy over the ever more important Arctic.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 4, 2021",Check Out This Los Angeles Class Nuclear Submarine Transformed Into A Floating Schoolhouse,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last week, the U.S. Navy towed a curious-looking Los Angeles class nuclear attack submarine, with a new boxy, building-like sail that looks like it belongs to a submarine-themed amusement park attraction, to its new home in Charleston, South Carolina. This submarine, the USS San Francisco , is actually now not much of a submarine at all, and is now set to be used as a moored training ship, or MTS, for sailors learning how to operate and maintain nuclear reactors. What will eventually be formally redesignated as the MTS San Francisco , with its hull number subsequently changing to MTS-711, arrived in Charleston on Aug. 16, 2021. The training vessel will be assigned to Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU) Charleston , which already has another MTS converted from a decommissioned Los Angeles class boat, the former USS La Jolla , which was delivered back in 2019. What is set to become the MTS San Francisco , a moored training ship to help teach sailors how to operate and maintain nuclear reactors., USN “This project has definitely been a marathon rather than a sprint, but the project team has kept up its endurance as we near the finish line,” Charles Brock, the superintendent of the conversion project, which was carried out at Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) in Virginia, said in a statement. “Given the extensive work required, it’s taken a lot of effort and teaming not only within every department in the shipyard but with all nuclear-capable shipyards, both public and private, and all naval nuclear laboratories to get the ship tested and ready for tow. We were excited to see the future MTS 711 head down the river to finish the last of its testing and ultimately fulfill its new mission.” San Francisco spent 34 months in dry dock as part of the conversion into an MTS. Beyond the new sail and the installation of another boxy structure over the boat’s stern, the process involved cutting the submarine into three parts and installing three new hull sections in between. Another view of the future MTS San Francisco with its new boxy superstructure over the stern is also visible., USN “The new hull sections arrived from General Dynamics Electric Boat via barge,” according to the Navy. “NNSY craned hull sections, averaging 700 tons, into the dock and attached them to San Francisco .” At least one of those new sections arrived fully equipped and ready to be installed, which the Navy said saved more than 10,000 man-days worth of work.  This was a lesson learned from the conversion of La Jolla into an MTS. La Jolla after its conversion into a moored training ship in 2019., USN “Throughout the conversion, the project team leveraged lessons learned from La Jolla on a variety of jobs ranging from piping installation to component outfitting to tank restoration,” the Navy explained. Other “innovations supporting the project team included implementing a cold cut hull cutting process, installing several hatch enclosures to improve submarine access for both personnel and equipment, pre-testing of the diesel generators using temporary systems to expedite final testing, and deploying a new scaffolding system to improve worker safety during the vessel’s 34 months in dry dock. This scaffolding system has since become widely used at NNSY.” The Navy did not detail the exact nature of the conversion work. However, since the submarine will no longer need to sail, dive, or otherwise conduct regular operations, there is certainly a significant amount of equipment that could be removed to both free up room for new training spaces and to simplify the logistics of sustaining the MTS. In the case of La Jolla ‘s conversion, the Navy did say that the reactor plant had been upgraded to reflect more modern designs, which would be important for its new training role. La Jolla and San Francisco have both been described as “ next-generation training ships ,” as well. They are set to replace NPTU Charleston’s two existing MTSs, which have been in use since the 1990s. The Lafeyette class nuclear ballistic missile submarine USS Daniel Webster and the James Madison class nuclear ballistic missile submarine USS Sam Rayburn were converted to serve in this role. In April, Sam Rayburn was towed to NNSY , where it is now waiting to begin the defueling and dismantling process . The MTS Daniel Webster and MTS Sam Rayburn at NPTU Charleston., USN Another view of NPTU Charleston after the arrival of the MTS La Jolla, but before the departure of the MTS Sam Rayburn. , USN NPTU Charleston “is a technical school operated by the U.S. Navy in Goose Creek, South Carolina to train enlisted sailors, officers, Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL) civilians and Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory (Bettis) civilians for shipboard nuclear power plant operation and maintenance of surface ships and submarines in the U.S. nuclear navy,” according to the unit’s website. At present, submarines make up the vast majority of nuclear-powered vessels in Navy service, with others being its Nimitz and Ford class supercarriers . NPTU Charleston work training civilians from KAPL and Bettis, both of which are Department of Energy (DOE) facilities, also highlights the unique nature of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPP). NNPP, more commonly known as Naval Reactors, is a joint Navy-DOE enterprise . Whatever the MTS conversion work on either La Jolla or San Francisco entailed exactly, having an actual reactor plant inside a converted submarine can only be extremely valuable for new sailors training to become what are commonly referred to as “nukes.” You can read more about what those individuals, and the various other members of a submarine’s crew, do here . It’s interesting to note that is actually not the first time that San Franciso , a first-generation Los Angeles class submarine that was commissioned in 1981, has been cut up. The boat was initially homeported at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and conducted numerous cruises in the Western Pacific before being moved to Arpa Harbor in Guam in December 2002. Just over two years after it started conducting operations from Guam, the boat hit an undersea mountain while sailing approximately 364 nautical miles southwest of that island at a depth of 525 feet. Impressively, while the submarine suffered extensive damage, its hull remained unbreached and it was able to limp back to Arpa Harbor. The Navy subsequently determined that San Franciso ‘s crew had not followed “several critical navigational and voyage planning procedures” and relieved the boat’s commanding officer, Commander Kevin Mooney. Six other crew members received non-judicial punishments. Twenty other officers and sailors received commendations for their actions during the accident, in which 98 members of the crew were injured. Machinist’s Mate Second Class Joseph Allen Ashley died the day after the incident from a head injury he had sustained. The damage to USS San Francisco after its underwater collision., USN Since the submarine’s nuclear reactor had only been recently refueled prior to the accident, a costly and complex process that had extended its expected service life out until 2017, the Navy subsequently decided to repair the boat. Temporary repairs were made to the submarine Guam, which subsequently sailed under its own power to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) in Bremerton, Washington, making one stop along the way in Pearl Harbor. A picture showing temporary repairs made to the USS San Francisco to allow it to sail to PSNS., USN San Franciso ultimately received an entire new bow section, which had been taken from another Los Angeles class submarine, the USS Honolulu . The Navy said the repairs to San Francisco cost $79 million , but that it would have taken $170 million to refuel Honolulu ‘s reactor. Honolulu was decommissioned as a result of the Navy’s decision and San Francisco returned to the fleet in 2009. The latter submarine completed its final operational cruise in 2016 and the Navy announced the following year that it would be turned into an MTS. The USS San Francisco certainly had a unique operational career. Now, in its highly modified form, it will continue to serve the Navy for years to come, helping to train new sailors to operate nuclear reactors on other submarines.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 24, 2021",Pentagon Dismisses The Idea Of Retaking Bagram Air Base To Support Kabul Evacuations (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby downplayed the idea of U.S. forces potentially reopening Bagram Airfield , or other air bases in Afghanistan, to assist with ongoing evacuation operations in that country. This comes as a Taliban spokesperson has said the planned end of U.S. military evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 31 is a “red line” issue for the group and that any attempt to unilaterally extend the timetable would “provoke a reaction .” Kirby, who speaking alongside U.S. Army Major General Hank Taylor, the Director of Current Operations within the Office of the Joint Staff, responded to a number of questions regarding the current timetable for U.S. military evacuation operations in Afghanistan at a briefing this morning. Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, which is nestled inside a dense urban area, has just one runway, and relatively limited ramp space, is presently serving as the nexus for U.S. government-assisted evacuations, as well as those being carried out by various other countries. At least publicly, the Biden administration continues to plan to conclude the U.S. non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO) on Aug. 31. US Marines stand guard along the perimeter at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on Aug. 20, 2021., USMC “What you’re talking about would be an expenditure of resources, and personnel, as well as an increase most likely to the threat that they’re under to try to go back and … retake Bagram airbase, which is the size of a small city,” Kirby said. “It was closed down as part of the retrograde. It was always supposed to be closed down as part of the retrograde. It was the last base to be turned over to the Afghans.” Kirby’s description of the size of Bagram, which American forces substantially expanded after 2001, underscores exactly why it could be so useful for supporting evacuation flights. The facility, which U.S. forces are intimately familiar with after having used it as a major hub for operations for nearly two decades, has two large runways and a host of other supporting infrastructure. Bagram, which is situated some 30 miles to the North of Kabul, also has the benefit of a much larger and more readily defensible perimeter that isn’t inside an urban area. A satellite image of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A satellite image of Bagram Airfield., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION If Bagram could be opened and operated in a secure manner, even in a contested environment, it could be possible to shuttle in evacuees from Hamid Karzai International Airport, offering an immediate way to relieve the current logistical strains imposed by conducting evacuations flights from a single airport. In addition, the base could present a valuable fall-back location to continue evacuation operations should the security situation in Kabul continue to erode, and that could be maintained after Aug. 31. The U.S. military vacated Bagram, which is situated to the north of Kabul, under extremely controversial circumstances at the beginning of July. Kirby stressed, as he had last week , that there had already been planning around the potential for conducting a NEO exclusively from Hamid Karzai International Airport just three weeks ago, before the beginning of the Taliban’s final, lightning-fast offensive across Afghanistan that culminated with the fall of Kabul on Aug. 15. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had again defended the U.S. military’s responses to the situation in an interview with ABC News ‘ Martha Raddatz yesterday, saying “I do” in response to a question about whether he felt “the planning was acceptable and appropriate.” Kirby did not respond directly to questions about whether it might be possible to work with the Taliban, via the Pakistani or Qatari governments, to reopen other airfields across Afghanistan for evacuation flights. When asked, he also did not confirm or deny a report that the White House had scrapped a plan for elements of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division to parachute into Bagram, seize it, and then reopen it to support the ongoing NEO. Online flight tracking data last week and over the weekend showed U.S. Air Force E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft, powerful tools for connecting personnel on the ground to aircraft flying above, orbiting directly around Bagram on at least two separate occasions. This had prompted speculation about a potential plan for American forces to reopen that base. It is also worth noting that continency response elements of the 82nd Airborne already make up a significant number of the approximately 5,800 U.S. troops now deployed to Hamid Karzai International Airport to support the ongoing evacuations. The U.S. Marine Corps’ Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force – Crisis Response – Central Command (SPMAGTF-CR-CC), another go-to force for crises in the region, has also sent personnel to support the evacuations from the airport in Kabul. All of this limits the number of high-readiness elements that the U.S. military could call upon for any additional missions. Though not mentioned at the briefing, the Army does also has the 173rd Airborne Brigade based in Italy. This unit has a standing mission to be prepared to conduct contingency response missions in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility, which includes Afghanistan. At the same time, it is also one of the primary contingency response forces that the U.S. military can call upon for operations in Europe and Africa, which could impact the decision to deploy it in this case. It’s not clear how many of the brigade’s almost 4,000 troops may be in a position to deploy on short notice, at all, as well. There have already been persistent questions about the U.S. military’s ability to successfully complete the planned NEO before Aug. 31. A host of security, logistical, and bureaucratic issues have continued to hamper the evacuation operations, at times grinding them to a halt entirely, since the effort began in earnest following the fall of Kabul to the Taliban just over a week ago. The Pentagon has been working to speed up evacuations out of Kabul and Major Hank Taylor said today that 16,000 people had departed via Hamid Karzai International Airport in the past 24 hours, 11,000 of which were on flights facilitated by the U.S. government. That is a tempo of operations that is higher than the U.S. military had previously expected it would be able to reach, having originally set a goal of being able to move between 5,000 and 9,000 people out of the country every day. In addition, yesterday, the Pentagon announced the activation of the Civil Air Reverse Fleet, a mechanism through which the U.S. military can compel commercial airlines and charter services to provide aircraft to support contingency operations that you can read more about in detail here . A total of 18 commercial planes are now set to assist in the movement of evacuees from intermediate staging locations to more permanent destinations, including facilities in the United States . A backlog in the processing of Afghan evacuees at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar has a cascading impact on the entire airbridge last week, leading to a complete stoppage of all flights out of Hamid Karzai International Airport for eight hours , underscoring many of the challenges still facing the entire enterprise. Defense One reported earlier today that the U.S. Air Force, alone, has airlifted more than 30,000 people, in total, out of the country. However, there are an estimated 20,000 people still at Hamid Karzai International Airport waiting for evacuation flights. Thousands more American citizens and Afghans who would be eligible to evacuate with American assistance are elsewhere in the country. It has proven to be hard, if not perilous, to travel within Kabul to the airport, let alone get there from outside of the city. Throngs of average Afghans trying to flee the country by air continue to gather outside the airport, as well. This has led to growing calls from within the United States , as well as from America’s allies and partners, to extend the evacuation timetable. Unfortunately, a Taliban spokesperson has now said that the group will not allow this to happen. “It’s a red line. President Biden announced that on 31 August they would withdraw all their military forces,” Suhail Shaheen, a Taliban representative at the group’s political office in Doha, Qatar told Sky News earlier today . “So if they extend it that means they are extending occupation while there is no need for that.” “If the U.S. or U.K. were to seek additional time to continue evacuations – the answer is no. Or there would be consequences,” he continued. “It will create mistrust between us. If they are intent on continuing the occupation it will provoke a reaction.” Pentagon Press Secretary Kirby declined to say what the U.S. government’s plans might be force extending evacuation operations beyond Aug. 31 might be at present, but he insisted that the goal remained to conclude the mission by the end of the month. He also said that “we all understand that view” in response to Shaheen’s “red line” comments and said that the U.S. military was in “constant coordination and deconfliction” with the Taliban in Kabul to work on getting people safely to the airport. Kirby also revealed that the U.S. military had carried out a second operation to recover Americans outside of the airport using unspecified helicopters , but declined to elaborate further. He also indicated that teams on the ground were conducting similar rescue missions on a case-by-case basis. Last week, the Pentagon had disclosed that it had extracted 169 Americans from a hotel in Kabul using a trio of Chinook helicopters . Another mission involving American helicopters, as well as allied forces, was also reportedly launched to rescue an Afghan officer and their family. There is a contingent of helicopters from the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment at Hamid Karzai International Airport now, which, together with other special operations forces, would be ideally suited to these kinds of missions, as you can read more about here . British, French, and German forces have also been leaving the airport to help retrieve people from elsewhere in Afghanistan’s capital and bring them back to the airport. Troops from a number of other countries are also operating at the airport. General security in and around the airport remains a concern, as well. Earlier today, at least one former member of the Afghan government’s security forces now helping provide security at Hamid Karzai International Airport was killed, and others were wounded, when an unknown gunman or gunmen opened fire on a position outside the north gate. U.S. and German forces were also involved in the ensuing firefight, but sustained no casualties. It remains unclear if the hostile armed individual or individuals involved were members of the Taliban, but this is the second such incident in the past week. Over the weekend, there were also reports of intelligence indicating the potential for ISIS’ franchise in Afghanistan to try to launch terrorist attacks in Kabul, including at the airport. With all this in mind, additional questions have emerged about whether smaller foreign military contingents will be able to continue their own operations after the last U.S. forces leave Kabul, whenever that might occur. U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC today that the departure of American troops would mean the end of the British mission. “I don’t think there is any likelihood of staying on after the United States,” Wallace said. “Even if their timetable extends, even by a day or two, then that will give us a day or two more to evacuate people, because we are really down to hours now, not weeks, and we have to make sure we exploit every minute to get people out.” In addition, it’s important to remember that the U.S. military will have to begin drawing down its current presence at Hamid Karzai International Airport before the official last day of operations and that evacuations would be similarly curtailed. Pentagon Press Secretary Kirby declined to say, given the current Aug. 31 deadline, whether or not actual evacuation flights could end up halted as early as this coming Saturday. Whatever the case may be, there is only a little over a week left in the U.S. evacuation timetable, as it stands now. Whether the Taliban can be convinced to allow for an extension of any kind, and keep to any such agreement, is unclear. It is worth remembering that the group was opposed to the Biden administration’s original extension of the overall drawdown plan beyond the original deadline in May, as had been agreed upon by the previous Trump administration, earlier this year, but largely acquiesced to it. At the same time, the Taliban was still an insurgent force when that extension plan was announced, not the de facto government of the country, as it is now. All told, the future of the U.S. military’s ongoing evacuation operations, and those of its allies and partners, is increasingly uncertain, as is whether or not thousands of people still looking to escape the country, including Afghans fleeing the Taliban’s rule, will be able to get out safely. Update 4:00 PM EST: U.S. Army General Steve Lyons has said at a separate press briefing today that “the threat is significant” to aircraft arriving and departing from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. General Lyons also provided additional details about the sheer scale of the current evacuation effort. He disclosed that a total of three babies have now been born on evacuation flights, as well. The U.S. Air Force disclosed one such birth over the weekend.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the evacuation of Kabul under the Taliban’s rule grinds on into its second week, let’s get caught up on what is happening now in the war-torn country.Â There are more very troubling signs that many U.S. citizens and allies in the capital won’t be able to make it through the chaotic gauntlet surrounding the airport and on to salvation. The interview below is the best account I have heard about the situation and how futile it has become for those who are actually cleared to leave the country. It seems that some major bone-headed missteps by the State Department have only made the situation all that much worse:Â We have all seen scenes from outside the perimeter wall at Kabul International, but this video from this morning gives a good look at how perilous it really is: The scene at Kabul airport several hours ago per source from an NGO who is trying to get people out.

The massive influx of people is causing huge diplomatic and logistical issues. Essentially, the U.S. is putting evacuees in huge hangars at air bases, such as Al Udied in Qatar, which are becoming major humanitarian crises in themselves. The mass overflow of people coming out of the country to bases in the Middle East halted movements at Kabul International for hours yesterday, for instance. Now the Biden Administration wants to active the Civil Reserve Air Fleet of commercial airliners to help move these people, many of which are refugees, to other locales once they reach their first and very temporary destination.

Bottom line: It's complex, and the bottlenecks are not yet gone. — Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) August 21, 2021 While the Germans, French, and British are executing pointed recovery operations outside the gates of the airport, the U.S. had, until yesterday, claimed that it was not doing the same, at least publicly. Apparently, some tension was building over the issue between the countries involved, as the U.S. thought it could destroy any chances of a successful evacuation mission if one of these operations went wrong. Now we know that the U.S. has, at least to a very limited degree, used helicopters and special operations forces to extract some individuals outside of the airport’s grounds, as well. As we detailed, the 160th SOAR “Night Stalkers” are there in greater force now and they, along with the special operators they carry, are the most capable of executing these types of operations.Â BREAKING: The 169 Americans rescued by US forces were airlifted from a nearby hotel close to Kabul Airport by 3 CH-47s Thursday — Tara Copp (@TaraCopp) August 20, 2021 Afghan national police officer Mohammad Khalid Wardak was hiding with his family in Kabul, hunted by the Taliban, as his supporters frantically sought help for him. After a series of failed attempts, Operation Promises Kept lived up to its name. https://t.co/mMfMu7exAJ — The Associated Press (@AP) August 19, 2021 These types of operations may have to be greatly expanded in order to successfully evacuate U.S. citizens and key Afghan allies. There is a new warning that ISIS’ franchise in Afghanistan may use the situation at the airport for a mass casualty event or some other type of terror attack. This is not surprising as all it would take is one grenade or suicide vest to dramatically complicate a very complicated situation and cause carnage against those trying to leave the country and possibly even U.S. and other forces deployed to the airport’s perimeter. The Taliban and what is referred to as ISIS-Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K, are also in open conflict with each other. An AP piece on this developing story reads, in part:Â The official said that small groups of Americans and possibly other civilians will be given specific instructions on what to do, including movement to transit points where they can be gathered up by the military. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. The changes come as the U.S. Embassy issued a new security warning Saturday telling citizens not to travel to the Kabul airport without individual instruction from a U.S. government representative. Officials declined to provide more specifics about the IS threat but described it as significant. They said there have been no confirmed attacks as yet. #Afghanistan : Because of security threats outside the gates at the Kabul airport, we are advising U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to the airport and to avoid airport gates unless you receive individual instructions from the U.S. government to do so. https://t.co/0t8PBnQABN pic.twitter.com/jjr0LpYR1b — Travel – State Dept (@TravelGov) August 21, 2021 Meanwhile, the Taliban’s leadership continues to consolidate power and move to organize a formal government in Kabul. This included the return of Taliban co-founder and once imprisoned figurehead of the group, Mullah Ghani Baradar, to the Afghan capital. He was also the primary negotiator with the Trump Administration on the so-called peace plan. Those negotiations occurred out of Qatar, where the Taliban has held a formal, public-facing, political office.Â The Taliban's co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar arrived in Kabul on Saturday for talks with fellow members of the group and other politicians on establishing a new Afghan government https://t.co/K974C67TT8 — Economic Times (@EconomicTimes) August 21, 2021 #Afghanistan : #Taliban commander Abdul Hamid Hamasi inspects captured #US made armored vehicles in #Kabul pic.twitter.com/uXajS4sbwP — Indo-Pacific News – Geo-Politics & Defense (@IndoPac_Info) August 21, 2021 At the same time, the newly formed indigenous military resistance to the Taliban’s newly minted rule is growing and expanding in the nearby Panjshir Valley. The group, which you can read our full report on here, is led by Amrullah Saleh, the now ex-Vice President of Afghanistan and son of the legendary figure Ahmad Shah Massoud who led the Northern Alliance before being assassinated by the Taliban in 2001.

An E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft, which provides battlefield connectivity across multiple radio systems and data-link waveforms (you can read all about it in this exclusive feature of ours ), was orbiting over Bagram Air Base. Bagram was turned over (well more like abandoned) by the U.S. military to Afghan forces in early July, a move that was puzzling at the time as it seemed like it would be an essential node to execute the evacuation. Instead, just Kabul International is being used, which is a single point of failure of mammoth proportions, with its single runway surrounded by urban sprawl and now, the Taliban. You can read more about how puzzling this move was in my tweet thread from last Sunday posted below.Â #USAF BACN BLACKWOLF13 ops #Kabul area 1900z pic.twitter.com/Q1reVGC1UT — nde (@5472_nde) August 20, 2021 When this happened, we couldn't figure it out.

This is beyond the intel failure that they would waltz out of there and the Taliban would remain far over the horizon. Absolutely nuts. — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) August 16, 2021 Probably as dumbfounded as we are: https://t.co/CjFi2juadV — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) August 18, 2021 It isn’t clear what the BACN aircraft would be doing over there, but taking back Bagram temporarily, even with the tacit approval of the Taliban, would be highly advantageous, especially considering huge sums of people still need to be evacuated from Kabul Airport, with its single runway, where the security situation could collapse at any moment due to a huge array of potential events. Doing so would require an additional thrust of manpower, but even securing the installation for contingency operations would be an improvement on the current status quo. This is especially true if the evacuation will spill past its August 31st deadline. Shuttling evacuees there via helicopter and C-130 the 25 miles to Bagram could provide a major relief valve for the current operations at Kabul International. Still, the administration’s willingness to make such an expansion of the mission at this point is highly debatable.Â There is also the possibility that the E-11 BACN aircraft is working in some way to support or monitor operations near the aforementioned Panjshir Valley. Supporting pointed special operations missions is also a possibility, we just don’t know. As for how the Pentagon got the Taliban’s advance on Kabul so wrong, it still remains unclear. Claims that there was no intelligence that pointed to the immediate fall of the Afghan Army and its controlling government are conflicted by reports that there was such intelligence and even outright concerns raised.Â Gen. Mark Milley says ""the intelligence clearly indicated multiple scenarios were possible"" in drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, adding: ""There was nothing that I or anyone else saw that indicated the collapse of…this government in 11 days."" https://t.co/RcYLXBp792 pic.twitter.com/GAuvIJqzhp — ABC News (@ABC) August 18, 2021 U.S. diplomats warned of Afghanistan's collapse in dissent cable last month. https://t.co/VzQ7VK9mFl — ABC News (@ABC) August 20, 2021 But just how hours before the Taliban took the capital, and it was very clear that they would imminently, the Pentagon still acted like that was not going to happen remains a major sticking point.Â . @LucasFoxNews to John Kirby: ""Two days before kabul fell, you said from that podium: 'The city is not right now in any imminent threat environment.'

But being surprised that the Taliban is sweeping through the country on our way out may be the height of stupidity and is a reminder that with all its resources, DoD can be so blind — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) August 14, 2021 On that note, the U.S. military pulling its aerial surveillance assets out of the country before the actual evacuation will prove to have been a major mistake, one that we should have learned in Iraq when ISIS blitzed across the country with little warning. Instead, we relied on far from persistent ‘over the horizon’ capabilities and the Afghans. A terrible move that likely contributed, at least in some major fashion, to the U.S. government being surprised by the Taliban’s advances. But by last week, the writing was on the wall. The disconnect between what we were seeing and hearing thousands of miles away and what the administration and the Pentagon, which presides over a trillion dollar a year military and intelligence capability, were stating was just beyond comprehension. The photo below is also worth mentioning, not just because it is touching, but it shows the configurations for some C-17s operating out of Kabul for mass evacuation operations. The bracing staps are there for people to hold onto as they sit on the floor of the aircraft. A massive slide of people during evasive maneuvering, for instance, could drastically disrupt the aircraft’s weight and balance, potentially leading to a very dangerous situation. It also keeps people from piling into each other during maneuvers, causing all types of potential dangers. You also see that the floor has been covered in plastic. It has been noted that the C-17s single restroom cannot support many hundreds of people. As such, people have been relieving themselves on the aircraft’s cargo floor, which can take time to clean and is not a pleasant job. This appears to be some sort of mitigation of that stark reality.

It isn’t clear if this was triggered by the crew proactively or if the aircraft’s countermeasures suite got tripped and executed the flare release. We may see more of this in the coming days, especially considering the Islamic State threat. While MANPADS (shoulder-fired heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles) have proliferated throughout the region , they are not considered a highly dense threat in Afghanistan, but all it takes is one and they are certainly in circulation.Â French Air Force A400M dispensing flares as it departs #Kabul Airport #Afghanistan pic.twitter.com/9C2UM9BcwO — Air & Sea Intel (@air_intel) August 21, 2021 There is also the question of the Mi-17 flying in the background. It isn’t clear who is piloting the Mi-17, although there are a number of Mi-17s that had belonged to the all-but-defunct Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) on the ground at Kabul, and the Taliban have apparently gotten a few that they’ve captured into the air.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 20, 2021",What The Civil Reserve Air Fleet Is And Why It’s Been Activated For The Third Time In 70 Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. military has turned to a little-used arrangement with commercial airlines and charter companies, through which it can compel them to provide aircraft to support various operational requirements in a crisis, to support the ongoing evacuations out of Afghanistan . Some two dozen companies are part of this Civil Reserve Air Fleet and agree to provide aircraft and crews in as little as 24 hours, if needed. In this case, the planes will not fly directly to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, which is the nexus of the evacuation mission , but will instead help ferry evacuees who have been brought to intermediate locations to more permanent destinations. The Pentagon announced that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had ordered U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) to activate Stage I of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). At the time of writing, American Airlines , Atlas Air , Delta Air Lines , and Omni Air are each set to contribute three aircraft as part of this activation. Another four would come from United Airlines , while Hawaiian Airlines would provide two more. U.S. military officials have not specified exactly what types of planes make up this fleet of 18 aircraft in total. US Marines arrive at March Air Reserve Base in California in 2004 after flying from Iraq on board a chartered airliner., USMC The Department of Defense and the Department of Commerce formally established the CRAF in December 1951. The decision was a direct result of experiences from the Berlin Airlift just a few years earlier, in which commercial aircraft had been utilized in an ad hoc manner.Â Airline and charter air transportation companies participate in the CRAF via contracts with TRANSCOM. Participation is entirely voluntary, but firms that do so are given preference when competing for U.S. military peacetime passenger and air cargo deals as an incentive.Â Aircraft from participating companies are assigned to support either international or domestic requirements based on their capabilities. “To participate in the international segments of CRAF, carriers must maintain a minimum commitment of 40 percent of its CRAF-capable fleet. Aircraft committed must be U.S.-registered,” according to the U.S. Air Force . CRAF carriers must also be able to provide four complete aircrews for each one of these committed aircraft. The U.S. military reviews the status of participating companies and their fleets regularly to make sure they still meet these and other requirements, including maintenance and general safety standards. As of this month, 24 carriers are enrolled in the CRAF program and have committed 450 aircraft, in total. Of those planes, 413 are in the international segment, while the remaining 37 are in the national, or domestic, segment. “These numbers are subject to change on a monthly basis,” the Air Force says in its official fact sheet , which also includes a complete list of participating companies. Those aircraft are otherwise free to perform their regular commercial duties. The actual activation of the reserve fleet is broken into three stages, with the first, the one now mobilizing to support the evacuations from Afghanistan, being sized to respond to regional contingencies. Activating the second two stages would increase the overall number of available aircraft and they are structured around the expected demands of a major theater war and a general national mobilization, respectively.Â “When notified of call-up, the carrier response time to have its aircraft ready for a CRAF mission is 24, 48, or 72 hours depending on which CRAF stage is activated,” according to the Air Force. TRANSCOM, through the U.S. Air Force’s Air Mobility Command (AMC), oversees the employment of activated CRAF aircraft, but individual carriers remain responsible for operating and maintaining their aircraft. This reserve fleet has only been activated twice for actual operations since its creation, though CRAF aircraft have taken part in exercises over the years, as well. The first instance was in 1990 to support the Gulf War , while the second came in 2003 as part of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq . Troops taking part in Exercise Team Spirit 86 disembark from a Civil Reserve Air Fleet aircraft., DOD Troops from the US Army’s 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) board a Civil Reserve Air Fleet flight bound for Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Shield in 1990., DOD Members of the US Army’s 4th Infantry Division prepare to disembark from a CRAF flight in Kuwait during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. , AP Photo/Saurabh Das The “CRAF activation provides the Department of Defense access to commercial air mobility resources to augment our support to the Department of State in the evacuation of U.S. citizens and personnel, Special Immigrant Visa applicants, and other at-risk individuals from Afghanistan,” according to an official press release . “CRAF activated aircraft will not fly into Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. They will be used for the onward movement of passengers from temporary safe havens and interim staging bases. Activating CRAF increases passenger movement beyond organic capability and allows military aircraft to focus on operations in and out of Kabul.” There had already been reports yesterday that airlines and charter carriers who are members of the CRAF had received a so-called “warning order” alerting them that potential activation was imminent. Charter flights have already been bolstering the U.S. military’s airbridge out of Kabul and the Department of Defense said it had helped approximately 17,000 people , the vast majority of whom are non-U.S. citizens, get out of the city just last week. Afghanistan update via WH pool. pic.twitter.com/VXf3vkGb5O — Howard Altman (@haltman) August 21, 2021 However, a lack of facilities in which to process evacuees, especially Afghans fleeing their homeland in the face of the Taliban takeover, for movement onward has, along with other logistical and bureaucratic issues, created significant bottlenecks. The first news of the potential use of the CRAF fleet came amid reports that many Afghan evacuees are languishing in a hangar at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar while waiting to move to other, more formalized facilities in the region and beyond.Â Backlogs at Al Udeid, alone, got so bad last week that all flights, including military evacuation missions, out of Hamid Karzai International Airport were paused for approximately eight hours between Aug. 19 and Aug. 20.

A number of nations have agreed to take hundreds of Afghans, but are still waiting for the first flights to arrive due to the various issues at play. During a call w/ lawmakers, @SecBlinken listed countries who have offered to take in evacuees frm Kabul: Albania, Bulgaria, Canada, Columbia, Costa Rica, Chile, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Mexico, Romania, Qatar, Rwanda, Uganda, Sudan and Ukraine – sources to me & @AndrewDesiderio — Lara Seligman (@laraseligman) August 20, 2021 As the Pentagon has noted, the activation of the CRAF aircraft should help ease some of these logistical issues, while also freeing up U.S. military cargo aircraft to conduct potentially more hazardous flights out of Kabul. This, in turn, could help reduce congestion at Hamid Karzai International Airport, which has limited ramp space and only one runway , resulting from flights being held on the ground there because intermediate staging locations are not able to receive additionalÂ evacuees. Unfortunately, none of this will help with separate, persistent issues in getting evacuees to Hamid Karzai International Airport. The situation outside the airport remains often chaotic , and sometimes deadly , and new security concerns continue to emerge from one day to the next . Yesterday, the U.S. State Department told Americans not to come to the airport, unless they received instructions from the U.S. government due to unspecified security threats. It was later reported that there were indications that ISIS’ franchise in Afghanistan might be looking to launch terrorist attacks targeting the evacuation operations. #Afghanistan : Because of security threats outside the gates at the Kabul airport, we are advising U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to the airport and to avoid airport gates unless you receive individual instructions from the U.S. government to do so. https://t.co/0t8PBnQABN pic.twitter.com/jjr0LpYR1b — Travel – State Dept (@TravelGov) August 21, 2021 American service member gives water to #Afghan children while they wait to be allowed to enter the base.

It’s not clear then why the U.S. military has only activated elements of the CRAF fleet now, despite the ground truth in Kabul and clearly mounting issues elsewhere in the evacuee pipeline. Beyond that, it was known for months before the sudden fall of Kabul that thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. government and who are now at risk of Taliban reprisals would need assistance leaving the country in the near term, which could have precipitated many of these same issues, regardless of the security situation in Afghanistan itself. The August 31st deadline to complete the evacuation, regardless of the Taliban’s state of power in the country, only makes the delayed call-up for CRAF that much more puzzling. At the same time, as has been the case for a week now, the ability of all foreign evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport to continue without direct hostile interference remains entirely at the whim of the Taliban. The group continues to move towards formalizing its return to power in Afghanistan, though armed resistance to its rule has also emerged .

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 26, 2021",Night Stalker Special Ops Helicopters Now In Kabul Could Be Critical To Evacuation (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The application of American airpower was an absolutely decisive factor in American forces and their Northern Alliance allies sacking the Taliban from power in 2001. It remained so throughout the 20-year conflict until the United States pulled its aerial assets from supporting the Afghan National Army. The rest is history. But the highly precarious situation the U.S. military is in now in as a result of the rickety evacuation operation centered entirely at Kabul’s international airport, which is now totally surrounded by the Taliban, makes traditional airpower provided by fighters, drones, and bomber aircraft, a far less effective tactical option to lean on in a pinch. One very unique, highly-trained, and specially-equipped group is capable of overcoming these limitations, if they are called upon to do so, and they are now in Kabul in force—the 160th Special Operations Airborne Regiment (SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers . Based on publically available images on the ground and from satellites, the 160th SOAR had a small presence of a couple of transport helicopters in Kabul when the city fell to the Taliban on August 15th, but since then, their numbers have been significantly bolstered, most notably by a contingent of at least eight AH/MH-6 Little Birds , as well as specially modified MH-60 Black Hawks and MH-47 Chinooks . These two larger types are capable of in-flight refueling and can deploy directly without having to be broken down to be flown in on a transport aircraft, which are currently highly taxed bringing in standard forces to protect the airport in Kabul and flying out Americans and Afghan allies. MH-60s and MH-47s refueling from an MC-130 special operations transport/tanker aircraft under the cover of darkness., US Army The Little Birds, on the other hand, are designed to be stuffed in transport planes as small as a C-130 and can be ready to be flown in a matter of minutes, not hours, once they are rolled off the aircraft. As such, the 160th is especially capable of quickly deploying to an area without taxing logistical aircraft and can leave just as fast as they arrived, unlike their conventional force counterparts. This could be especially important for the high-risk proposition of having U.S. forces actually exit from Afghanistan, once and for all. The simple fact is that someone has to be the last to leave once the mission comes to a close. You can clearly see some of the 160th SOAR’s contingent at Kabul in the image with the Turkish soldier walking by in the tweet below and an MH-60 DAP in the tweet below that: One can reasonably predict that it will be the 160th SOAR and the special operators they carry that will be the last Americans to leave Hamid Karzai International Airport. The U.S. force protection contingent currently there, which numbers in the thousands of troops, will have to draw down and depart at the end of the evacuation mission. This will demand a shrinking perimeter and whoever is last to leave will have to be capable of doing so very fast, and potentially fight their way out. There will not be time to break down complex helicopters and slowly load them onto lumbering transports. As such, it is very possible that the 160th SOAR will be the force tasked with this ultra risky endcap to America’s two-decade-long mission in the war-torn country. This is somewhat fitting as it is also the 160th SOAR and the SEAL operators they often carry that went into Pakistan and killed Osama Bin Laden a decade ago. The Al Qaeda mastermind was the predominant figure that set the events in motion that led to the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. Special operators fast rope out of a Night Stalker MH-60 at night. , US Army Still, getting out last in a lightning-quick manner isn’t the only thing this force could be extremely useful for. The unprecedented situation U.S. forces and are in right now of trying to get people out of the country while being totally surrounded by enemy fighters and civilians, in a dense urban area, makes executing close air support of any kind in an emergency very tricky and extremely volatile both tactically and politically. Hellfire missiles and 500-pound laser-guided bombs are nearly impossible to use under such conditions, leaving drones, fighters, and bombers largely unemployable. Extreme precision is required and with this comes the necessity of close proximity. Outside of their special operations transport duties, this is where the 160th SOAR really shines. Their AH-6 Little Birds and MH-60 Black Hawk derivatives in the Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) configuration are all about the intimate application of airpower against enemy forces in very challenging terrain. They use 7.62mm and .50 caliber machine guns to make pinpoint strafing runs, even flying down streets at below building-top level to accomplish the desired effect. They can also sling standard and laser-guided rockets capable of killing a single fighter in a doorway , as well as Hellfire missiles, if need be, but the whole idea is that they can fight from the air without causing mass collateral damage in situations in which almost anything else cannot, and especially when supporting special operations forces on the ground. You can see how this capability could be essential in the current situation, where even a warning strafing run can be carefully applied to keep the enemy at bay or taking out small groups of fighters that are very near civilians without large numbers of innocent lives lost. They can do all this in the black of night and with ferocious frequency, as well. An AH-6 Little bird sprays .50 caliber and 7.62 mm ammunition while also delivering a rocket. The tactic of rapidly combining gunfire with rocket barrages is a staple of the 160th SOAR’s gunship capabilities., USMC Simply put, there are no other aircraft in the inventory, or crews so highly trained, that can deliver this level of exacting and close-up and personal close air support and do so repeatedly, with rapid follow-ups, as needed. For protecting a perimeter of an airport deep within a sprawling urban area, this capability could mean the difference between the entire mission failing in spectacular fashion and not. Only second to the 160th SOAR in terms of precision close air support are the few AH-64E Apaches at Kabul’s airport and the AC-130 gunships that have been circling high overhead. However, they cannot really compare to what the Night Stalkers can do in terms of surgical application of airpower in an urban area when it is needed most. At the most basic level, they are limited by their high-explosive armament compared to the far more flexible, lighter weaponry carried by the DAPs and AH-6s. An MH-60 in the DAP configuration., United Composites Finally, the relatively large contingent of Night Stalkers now at Kabul’s airport also provides the ability to execute complex special operations missions, especially rescuing key personnel, outside the perimeter of the airport. Loaded up with special operators, they have the ability to go out and hit targets with extreme violence of action and save individuals from falling into the Taliban’s clutches. In fact, this may have actually already have happened at least once . The U.S. official says it is not conducting personnel recovery and evacuation operations outside of the airport, even though France and Britain are, but this may need to change as the Taliban are making it hell for people trying to reach the airport. This reality will likely only get worse, not better, as the evacuation crawls on and the Taliban become more settled in and emboldened. The reconfigurable MH-60s and MH-6s are both capable of supporting these operations, but the MH-47s are especially well suited for them and can recover many people at once, if need be. MH-47 Chinook from the 160th SOAR., US Army Finally, the Night Stalkers have the ability to operate in dense urban areas, which are filled with dangers for helicopter crews, unlike any other flying unit on earth. This exact mission is why they tirelessly train all around some of America’s biggest cities , landing on high-rises , executing mock assaults on complex facilities , and flying blacked-out down city streets . These constant urban training operations cause a lot of public concern and even outright protest, especially from the ‘black helicopter’ conspiracy theory crowd, but this deployment to Kabul under these extremely high-stakes circumstances is a glaring example of why they do that training and why it is so indispensable. An MH-6 lands on a government building in Long Beach, California for urban assault training. , US Army An MH-6 flies down a city street in Downtown Los Angeles during an elaborate urban training exercise. , VIA @MMERCAD4 The U.S. special operations community has known for some time now that future battles will be fought in “megacities” and that they have to train for the litany of dangers they represent. Should the evacuation go south for any reason, the vision of battles to come could morph into reality. With any luck, the Night Stalkers will help keep the Taliban at bay and, if ordered to do so, will be able to go out and help grab Americans and our friends who absolutely cannot make it through the Taliban’s gauntlet in order to find salvation at the airport. Beyond that, they and the special operators they taxi around are likely to be the last U.S. servicepeople to set foot on Afghan soil when the current nightmare of a situation finally comes to an end.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 26, 2021",Germany Sending Special Ops Helicopters To Kabul To Rescue Evacuees Outside The Airport (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As early as tomorrow, a pair of German military Airbus H145M helicopters configured to support special operations missions could be zipping around Kabul helping people evacuate the city. They will be working together with elements of the German Army’s elite Kommando Spezialkrafte, or Special Forces Command, some of which have been at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan’s capital since Monday. This comes after British and French forces started conducting similar rescue missions outside of the airport’s perimeter, but while the U.S. military, at least publicly , continues to insist it does not have any intention or the capacity to do the same. German officials announced the deployment of the pair of H145Ms, via Airbus A400M cargo planes, and their expected mission in Kabul on Aug. 20, 2021. They will join thousands of other U.S. and foreign troops, including another contingent of special operations helicopters from the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), already at Hamid Karzai International Airport. A German Air Force H145M LUH SOF helicopter., German Air Force German Air Force A400Ms, as well as Airbus A310 Multirole Tanker Transports (MRTT), have been flying an increasing number of evacuation sorties out Hamid Karzai International Airport since Aug. 16. Chaos in and around the airport hampered those operations initially, with only seven evacuees on the first German flight out of Afghanistan. Navigating through the country’s capital, which is now firmly under the control of the Taliban, just to get to the airport remains difficult, if not potentially perilous , for foreign nationals and Afghans alike. “We have just informed the German Bundestag that we are expanding our operation in Afghanistan,” a post earlier today from the German Ministry of Defense’s official Twitter account read, using the formal name of the country’s parliament. “The aim is to bring those to be protected from their whereabouts in Kabul to the airport.” Between 2015 and 2017, Germany acquired 15 specially-configured H145Ms to support the Kommando Spezialkrafte (KSK). The H145M is one of the latest variants in the highly successful H145, which is derived from the Eurocopter EC145. H145s, and the earlier EC145s, are in widespread military and civilian use around the world. This broad family of helicopters includes the variants of the UH-72 Lakota in service with the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy . The H145M is powered by a pair of Turbomeca Arriel 2E engines and can cruise at just over 130 knots. It comes standard from Airbus with a glass cockpit, digital avionics, and other modern systems. Germany’s helicopters, also sometimes referred to by the name of the program under which they procured, Light Utility Helicopter Special Operations Forces (LUH SOF), have a number of additional distinctive features, including provisions for fast-roping equipment, as well as missile approach warning sensors and dispensers on the skids for launching decoy flares. Personnel fast-rope from a German military H145M helicopter., Airbus The Germany H145Ms can also be armed with 7.62mm Minigun Gatling-type machine guns , known as the G6 in German service, on mounts in the doors on either side of the main cabin. There are no Miniguns visible in the official pictures the German armed forces have released so far regarding the deployment of these helicopters, but a gun mount appears to be visible on at least one of the two helicopters as it is being loaded onto an A400M. A German H145M being loaded into an A400M cargo plane for deployment o Kabul. What appears to be a mount for a G6 Minigun is visible through the open main cabin., Bundeswehr Exactly how the German military will employ these helicopters remains to be seen, but German news outlet Der Spiegel has reported that the plan is to use them to extract individuals from areas of Kabul and bring them to the safety Hamid Karzai International Airport. “The Bundeswehr emphasized that the KSK helicopters should only be used over Kabul,” according to Der Spiegel , using the formal name for the German armed forces. “In addition, every flight must be well prepared, a meeting point and signs agreed with which the people to be rescued can clearly identify themselves. The time on the ground must be as short as possible so that there is no crowd.” Der Spiegel also highlighted how the relatively small H145Ms could be particularly useful for operating within a dense urban area such as Kabul, being able to more readily land on rooftops or in small open areas on the ground in order to rescue people compared to larger types. The helicopters could also help provide cover for teams working on the ground. A member of Germany’s Kommando Spezialkrafte Marine, or Naval Special Forces Command, armed with a 7.62mm G27 rifle provides overwatch support while riding an H145M helicopter during a training exercise., Bundeswehr “It won’t be a normal taxi shuttle,” Eberhard Zorn, the Bundeswehr Inspector General, said according to Der Spiegel . With regards to which individuals the KSK might be soon be looking to rescue, the German government has said it is working to help both “German nationals and other persons at risk” get out of the country safely. There are reports that several hundred, but less than 1,000, German citizens remain in Afghanistan at present. Despite reports that the Taliban have given assurances that foreigners will be allowed to leave unmolested, there are numerous reports that reality on the ground is very different. The situation is also much more dangerous for Afghans, especially those who have worked with foreign governments over the past two decades and are now at risk of Taliban reprisals. Just with regards to Germany, at least one German national was shot while traveling to the airport , though thankfully the wound was not life-threatening. Separately, a relative of an Afghan reporter working for German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle in Germany was murdered by the Taliban , and another member of their family was seriously injured in the attack. With all of this in mind, there are also questions about whether the Taliban will allow the German H145M helicopters to conduct their activities in Kabul without interference. Bundeswehr Inspector General Zorn said there is an assumption that the Taliban will “let the helicopters go,” according to Der Spiegel, but there does not appear to be even any formal assurances, for whatever those might be worth, that this will happen. If the helicopters or KSK personnel come under attack and are forced to defend themselves it’s not hard to see how that could escalate into a more serious situation that could have subsequent impacts on foreign evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport. At the same time, it is worth noting that British and French forces have been conducting similar activities on the ground in Kabul outside of the airport for days now without any major reported pushback from the Taliban. Meanwhile, the U.S. military has publicly insisted it is focused entirely on operations at the airport itself and is not planning to send troops out into the city to round up American citizens and others. President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials did confirm today that American forces at the airport have helped people get over the perimeter walls, in addition to through established gates. It is worth noting, though, that elements of the U.S. Army’s 160th SOAR would be ideally suited to performing similar missions to the ones the German military is planning to carry out with their H145Ms, and would be able to do so on a much broader scale, if they aren’t already. The 160th’s mix of AH/MH-6 Little Bird, MH-60 Black Hawk, and MH-47 Chinook helicopters presently in Kabul offers a wide array of unique capabilities, including the ability to carry out highly surgical close air support missions, if required, which you can read more about here . Yesterday, the Associated Press reported that unspecified American forces, working with “multiple allies,” including the British, had carried out a mission to rescue a former Afghan National Police officer and members of his family. The New York Times has also now reported on independent efforts carried out by its own employees to help Afghans get to the safety of the airport. The situation in and around the airport remains tense and fluid. Evacuation operations, all of which have to share the airport’s single runway, are also still facing various hurdles. Today, it emerged that commercial flight operations had been shut down for approximately eight hours due to bureaucratic and logistical issues inside and out of Afghanistan that had resulted in congestion on the military side. All of this only adds to persistent questions about how long it might take to complete all of the planned foreign evacuation operations. Speaking today, President Joe Biden committed to getting all Americans, as well as various at-risk Afghans, out of the country, but declined to say whether or not the expectation was still that it would be possible to get this done by the end of the month, when the entire mission is supposed to end. This, of course, doesn’t take into account that the Taliban could change their position at any moment on allowing an island of foreign military presence at the airport in Kabul, where thousands of troops are on the ground now and with more, such as this new German contingent, on the way, to exist at all. Any concerted and deliberate attacks by the Taliban on foreign forces at Hamid Karzai International Airport would, of course, completely change the character of the ongoing evacuations there and any operations elsewhere in Afghanistan’s capital. Depending on how rapidly the security situation might then devolve, troops at the airport might be forced to hastily evacuate, which might compel them to abandon large pieces of equipment, such as helicopters , that cannot be quickly loaded onto flights out of the country. No matter how the overall situation in Kabul continues to evolve, Germany’s deployment of the two H145M helicopters underscores that more and more foreign governments are coming to the conclusion that they cannot limit their evacuation activities to the confines of Hamid Karzai International Airport. It’s not clear how anyone can reasonably expect the majority of foreign nationals, not to mention at-risk Afghans, to otherwise even get to the airport safely. Update 4:50 PM EST: The full statement from Bundeswehr Inspector General Eberhard Zorn also says that the U.S. military requested the deployment of the H145Ms to help support operations. “These helicopters were requested by the American side,” he said, according to Behörden Spiegel . “The Americans mostly fly there with large-volume helicopters, so they needed a smaller machine in the urban environment of Kabul.” “So it’s always a collaborative effort,” he continued. “We always have a corresponding airmobile intervention reserve provided by the Americans in the background. So that means they are real aerial operations.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Land Special Operations"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 16, 2021",Packed C-17 Cargo Jet Out Of Kabul Actually Had 823 People Onboard Setting New Record (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has corrected the record about just how many Afghan evacuees a heroic aircrew out of Dover Air Force Base in Delaware packed onto their C-17A Globemaster III in Kabul on Sunday night. The total number of passengers wasn’t 800, as The War Zone was first to report based on recorded radio communications, it was even more than that. The Air Force says 823 were actually on that plane, which used the callsign Reach 871, and that this is the largest evacuation flight the type has ever flown. The Air Force’s Air Mobility Command (AMC) issued the correction today. The service had earlier confirmed various details about the heavily laden flight, but had said that there were only 640 passengers on board when it left Afghanistan. However, this figure did not include more than 180 small children who rode on their parents’ laps, many of whom are clearly visible in a picture that subsequently emerged of Reach 871’s jam-packed cargo bay. A picture of Afghan evacuees inside Reach 871’s main cargo bay, with a number of children on laps clearly visible., USAF “The initial count of 640 inadvertently included only adults. 183 children were also aboard,” according to posts on AMC’s official Twitter account. “The original number was based on how many bus seats were filled departing the aircraft and didn’t account for the number of children in laps.” This revised figure aligns with the audio recordings of conversations between Reach 871’s crew and other Air Force personnel, likely conducted via satellite radio, that had previously emerged and that you can listen to below. “800 people on your jet?! Holy… Holy cow… Ok…,” a person can be heard saying at one point after getting the estimated headcount from an individual on the C-17A. It’s also not surprising that the crew of Reach 871 didn’t have a firm grasp at the time on exactly how many people were in the back. The plane had been on the ground at Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 15, 2021, the day the Taliban marched into the city , touching off days of chaotic and terrifying scenes as desperate Afghans tried to flee the country by air. Amid the chaos on Sunday night, hundreds of Afghans began loading themselves into the back of the plane. These individuals had been cleared to evacuate with U.S. assistance, but were not all on the official manifest for this flight, according to Defense One . Reach 871’s crew was presented with a choice of trying to unload and then reload the plane with only individuals on their list, or to try to get as many people on as they could. A much more orderly loading of a US Air Force C-17A evacuation flight at Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 18, 2021., USMC “We have women and children and people’s lives at stake, it’s not about capacity or rules and regulations—it’s about the training and the directives that we were able to handle to make sure we could safely and effectively get that many people out,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Eric Kut, the commander of Reach 871 during the sortie, said, according to Defense One . “Everybody was very thrilled to actually leave,” Air Force Technical Sergeant Justin Triola, a loadmaster on the flight, told CNN ’s New Day this morning. The Air Force has also now confirmed that Reach 871’s crew will not face any disciplinary action for any breaches of protocol over the massive evacuation flight. “That crew is facing no disciplinary action for the mission of Reach 871,” Air Force Major General Thad Bibb, head of 18th Air Force, AMC’s top operational command, told Defense One . A C-17A’s official maximum passenger capacity, when using seats on pallets attach to the cargo bay floor and others mounted on the interior walls, is only 134. Past evacuation flights have seen more people loaded onto Globemaster IIIs, using the “floor loading” method also on Reach 871, including one flight in 2013 that carried  670 people to safety after Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines. The crew of Reach 871 now holds the undisputed record for total people evacuated from a crisis via C-17A. With thousands still left in need of help getting out of Kabul, where the overall security situation still remains very fluid, only time will tell how long that impressive life-saving record might stand. UPDATE: It looks like the standard C-17 load has been modified to get as many people out as safely as possible.

Brett Tingley and Marc Cecotti,"Updated on Sep 22, 2021",Radio Transmissions From Police Helicopter’s Chase Of Bizarre Craft Over Tucson Add To Mystery,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On February 9, 2021, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) helicopter encountered what was described as a “ highly modified drone ” hovering in controlled airspace above Tucson, Arizona. A Tucson Police Department (TPD) helicopter was called in to aid the CBP aircraft in its pursuit of the small aircraft, but the drone, or whatever it was, was able to outrun both of them as it flew through military airspace, deftly maneuvered around both helicopters with bizarre agility, and ultimately disappeared into cloud cover above the altitude the helicopters could safely fly. A police report previously obtained by The War Zone showed that the TPD crew described the drone as “very sophisticated/specialized” and “able to perform like no other UAS” they had previously encountered. Now we have the actual audio from the CBP helicopter’s interactions with air traffic controllers in Tucson during the incident, as well as audio from an after-action call between the TPD crew and the air traffic control tower. From the conversations heard on the recordings, which The War Zone obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), it’s clear that all parties involved with the incident were baffled by the drone’s performance, noting that it appeared “super sophisticated” and possibly satellite-controlled. If you haven’t yet caught up on the Tucson mystery drone saga, be sure to read our most recent reporting . A CBP Airbus AS350 A-Star helicopter., CBP In the air traffic control (ATC) recording of the 70-minute long incident, the CBP helicopter crew member can be heard describing the drone as a “dim flashing light,” and also notes that he cannot track it while wearing night-vision goggles. In the call, the helicopter crew repeatedly identifies the drone’s location as directly above Davis-Monthan Air Force Base or the fuel tanks just west of the base. The crew can also be heard wondering what the unmanned air vehicle’s (UAV) size might be, repeatedly stating that its high speed and impressive maneuverability made it difficult to get a decent visual identification. Throughout the hour-long pursuit, the law enforcement aircrews can be heard saying that the mystery craft was essentially playing with them by repeatedly positioning itself directly above their helicopters’ rotors, some 1,000 feet above them. At one point (around 60:55 in the runtime of the recording below), the air traffic controller says “we filed this up as high as we can” and “we did call Washington,” presumably meaning a federal office in Washington, D.C., quite possibly the FAA national headquarters . The entire call can be heard here: A rough map of where the drone was reportedly first seen. On the left are fuel tanks owned by a private energy firm; on the right is runway 12 at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base., Google Maps In the second recording, a phone call between Air Traffic Control tower at Tucson International Airport and the TPD helicopter crew recorded the day after the encounter, the helicopter crewman notes that the drone maintained a speed of 75 knots in a 30-knot headwind. “So you think it was a drone?” the Tucson tower employee asks during the call. “Yeah was definitely a drone,” the TPD helicopter crew member replies. “I just couldn’t tell you – I couldn’t give you its dimensions as it was moving… too sketchy for us to… I assure you it was not a quadcopter, and it was the most advanced drone we’ve dealt with over the last decade here. Its abilities were pretty incredible, um, I just – I can’t tell you exactly its size.” The Tucson tower employee then asks if it could have been a larger UAV like an MQ-1 Predator . “It’s not aircraft-sized,” the TPD helicopter crew member replied. “From what I can tell just from its position light, you know, I would have to imagine it was larger than a quadcopter, and I guarantee you it was nothing like a quadcopter from how long it was up – it has to be satellite-driven because there’s no line-of-sight, there’s no cell phone coverage that could have dealt with that, so it has to be satellite-driven, which is pretty freakin’ sophisticated.” The helicopter crew member then laments not being able to apprehend the craft, saying he really wanted to see what type of technology was aboard the drone. You can hear the full audio of the call below: In addition to these audio recordings, The War Zone has obtained the FAA’s Air Traffic Mandatory Occurrence Report filed the day after the incident occurred. The report, filed by the crew of the CBP helicopter, contains a summary detailing the encounter: PILOT OF TROY164 (AS50) REPORTED A NMAC ON FREQ 118.3.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 24, 2021",Want Uncle Sam To Get You Out Of Kabul? It Could Cost You Thousands Of Dollars… Or Maybe Not?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As if things weren’t bad enough for people trying to get out of Afghanistan via the country’s Hamid Karzai International Airport, those who do manage to get onto a U.S. evacuation flight could be saddled with the additional burden of having to pay back Uncle Sam for the privilege. U.S. law not only allows for, but demands the U.S. State Department to seek reimbursement from private U.S. citizens and foreign nationals it helps evacuate in a crisis, even if they don’t ride out on an American plane. See the update at the bottom of this story for new details. Politico ‘s National Security Daily newsletter today highlighted this fact, noting that this is in spite of repeatedly public assurances that these flights would be free. At least one individual told the outlet that State Department personnel were asking for payments of up to $2,000 from American citizens and even more than that from other potential evacuees. A US Marine escorts Afghans to an evacuation flight at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on Aug. 18, 2021., CENTCOM “U.S. law requires that evacuation assistance to private U.S. citizens or third country nationals be provided ‘on a reimbursable basis to the maximum extent practicable,'” a State Department spokesperson confirmed to Politico “The situation is extremely fluid, and we are working to overcome obstacles as they arise.” In terms of U.S. law and established regulations, this is, unfortunately entirely accurate. The first part of the spokesperson’s statement is identical to information the State Department provides on its own website . Marines at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul check-in evacuees ahead of their flights on Aug. 18, 2021., USMC “By taking a U.S. government coordinated transport, evacuees are obligated to repay the cost of their transportation,” the website adds. “The amount billed to evacuees is based on the cost of a full fare economy flight, or comparable alternate transportation, to the designated destination(s) that would have been charged immediately prior to the events giving rise to the evacuation. Because different evacuation transports may go to different destinations, the cost of one transport may be different than another. We encourage people to leave on the first transport they are able and eligible to board.” The State Department does say that it offers loans to cover these costs upfront. “Generally, individuals evacuated on a U.S. government-coordinated transport, including charter and military flights or ships, even if those transports are provided by another country’s government, must sign an Evacuee Manifest and Promissory Note,” according to the State Department. It is particularly notable given the context of the ongoing evacuation operations in Afghanistan, which involve multiple different countries, that this applies even if another nation is providing the transportation in coordination with American authorities. Terms and conditions found in the Evacuee Manifest and Promissory Note form., US Department of State The loans are extremely short-term, as well. The State Department website outlines additional fees and penalties that could start stacking up if a bill goes unpaid for just 30 days: Payment will be due within 30 days from the bill date. In accordance with federal debt collection regulations, if full payment is not received within 30 days from the due date, interest and a $50.00 administrative charge for processing and handling will be assessed. If this account becomes 90 days past due, then penalties will be assessed on the unpaid balance. Once a debt has been delinquent for 90 days, the debt will be referred to the Department of Treasury for collection and they may collect the debt via administrative offset of federal payment (e. g tax returns, social security), referral to a private collection agency, referral to credit bureaus, through administrative wage garnishment and/or through other actions permitted by law. It’s not immediately clear what provisions may be available to waive any of these fees. It is worth noting that U.S. government employees who are under official orders to evacuate from a country, such as staff from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, are eligible for advances on their pay to cover immediate costs, but may also be required to reimburse their particular office at the end of the day. With regards to State Department personnel, specifically, “recovery of the indebtedness will be affected by the payroll office having jurisdiction over the employee’s account unless a waiver of recovery has been approved,” according to the most recent edition of the Department of State Standardized Regulations (DSSR). Though clearly defined in the law and regulations, it’s still hard not to see all of this adding insult to injury when it comes to what is happening in Afghanistan right now. American nationals and other individuals with valid U.S. passports, are struggling just to get safely to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, despite the U.S. government’s insistence that it has assurances from the Taliban to let them through unmolested. The State Department itself has warned that it cannot ensure the safety of anyone trying to get to the airport. At the same time, the U.S. military continues to say it has no plans to send troops outside of Hamid Karzai International Airport to actively gather up American evacuees, or any others for that matter. Meanwhile, British and French forces are doing exactly that , despite having more limited resources on the ground. Other individuals, especially Afghans, many of whom may already be in increased danger from the Taliban due to their past work for the U.S. government, face even greater risks. Stories of the desperation of regular Afghan civilians trying to flee the country by air have been piling up for days. These range from an incident where individuals tried to cling to the outside of a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane as it was taking off , which reportedly resulted in a number of subsequent deaths , to multiple reported instances of parents handing small children to U.S. and other foreign troops on the other side of the airport perimeter in hopes of at least saving them. How the U.S. government expects many of these people, who may well be leaving with the only world possessions they have left, to pay back the price of an evacuation flight, is unclear. It’s possible that Congress could pass legislation to waive or otherwise pay these costs. Even if lawmakers move fast, any such law could still take some time to go into effect, while, at the same, the clock will already be ticking on the repayment of evacuation loans before new fees and penalties are levied. Until something changes, if you’re a private American citizen or a foreign national hoping the U.S. government can help you get out of Afghanistan, you could soon find yourself out thousands of dollars. This is especially unfortunate for many Afghans who are leaving the country with little already to start a new life in a foreign land. Update 8:00 PM EST: Just as this story was being published, Politico reported that it had received a new statement from State Department spokesperson Ned Price regarding this policy. “In these unique circumstances, we have no intention of seeking any reimbursement from those fleeing Afghanistan.” Given Politico ‘s earlier reporting, this appears to be a recent change in policy. It remains to be seen what will happen now to individuals who might have already paid or agreed to pay evacuation-related fees.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 2, 2024",Navy Fighters Are Flying Armed Overwatch Missions Over Kabul,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets flying from the deck of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan , which is presently sailing in the North Arabian Sea, have been flying armed overwatch sorties over Kabul in the past 24 hours, according to the Pentagon. However, U.S. military officials have denied earlier reports that these aircraft made any low passes over the city and have declined to elaborate on exactly what might prompt American warplanes to conduct airstrikes in support of the ongoing evacuation operations in Afghanistan’s capital. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby and U.S. Army Major General Hank Taylor, the Director of Current Operations within the Office of the Joint Staff, provided the new details about armed aircraft operating in the skies over Kabul at a briefing at the Pentagon today. Kirby stressed that these recent Super Hornet sorties were not the first missions by armed American aircraft over Afghanistan since the drawdown of American troops in the country morphed into a massive evacuation mission after the Taliban took Kabul on Aug. 15, 2021. The Super Hornets operating over Afghanistan, like other American combat aircraft , would have to fly to the country via Pakistan with the help of U.S. Air Force aerial refueling tankers. A pair of armed U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets refuel over Afghanistan in 2010., USAF “These are not low pass flights…they are at altitude,” Kirby said. “There had been some reporting out there that there were low passes and that there was some sort of shows of force, and I think we felt it was important for the General [Taylor] to provide some context about what is happening in the air and why.” Journalists and others in Kabul had taken to social media earlier in the week to comment about what they described as low passes by fighter jets. Subsequent reports had suggested that these individuals could be hearing low-flying fighters carrying out shows of force in support of the evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport. This would not necessarily have been surprising given that the situation at the airport was extremely chaotic earlier in the week and remains tense, with continued reports of violence just outside the perimeter that U.S. forces and other foreign military personnel have now established. Shows of force involving low and fast-flying combat jets are typically employed to discourage hostile or potentially hostile individuals from pursuing attacks on American personnel or facilities overseas without having to actually resort to lethal airstrikes. “The ability to provide close air support is something that needs to be immediate if the condition on the ground ever required that,” General Taylor explained. “We ensure there are always assets available so that the commander.” Yesterday, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army General Mark Milley, had said that a wide array of aircraft, manned and unmanned, were either flying similar missions over Afghanistan or were otherwise positioned in the Middle East to respond to contingencies there, if necessary. In addition to Super Hornets, he had said that these assets included U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunships , B-52H bombers , F-16C/D Viper fighter jets, and MQ-9 Reaper drones, and U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jets. A picture of a US Air Force B-52H bomber, with bombs visible on pylons under its wings, flying over Afghanistan on Aug. 13, 2021, which was only released today. , USAF “Obviously force protection is a high priority,” Kirby added at today’s press conference. “This is just an added layer of force protection.” It is worth pointing out that the new information from the Pentagon today does not mean that people on the ground in Kabul were entirely wrong about hearing low-flying jet-powered aircraft. The C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane, which is powered by four jet engines, is the primary platform that the U.S. military is presently using to help Americans and others evacuate Kabul. In addition, as The War Zone reported in detail last month, the C-17A crews train to conduct low-altitude tactical takeoffs , as seen in the video below, specifically to help avoid potential hostile fire from the ground. Doing this when taking off from the airport in Kabul would make good sense given persistent reports of gunfire outside of Hamid Karzai International Airport and indications in the past that at least some of this might have been Taliban members taking potshots at departing aircraft. Just in the past 24 hours, 13 C-17As arrived Kabul carrying troops and equipment, according to General Taylor. A dozen of those planes left Hamid Karzai International Airpot in the same period, with more than 2,000 passengers on board, he added. Since evacuation operations began over the weekend, the U.S. military has facilitated the departure of approximately 7,000 people, in total, through Hamid Karzai International Airport. This includes American citizens, Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) due to the risks they now face due to their past work with the U.S. government, and what Taylor described as “other evacuees in coordination with the State Department.” US Marines process evacuees at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on Aug. 18, 2021., USMC Evacuations through Hamid Karzai International Aiport are still proceeding steadily, at least according to the Pentagon, and the plan remains for the entire operation to conclude by Aug. 31. “We have not experienced and security incidents nor interference since my last update,” Taylor said, referring to his last briefing on the situation in Afghanistan yesterday. At the same time, reports continue to emerge that even U.S. citizens and others with valid American passports are struggling to make their way through Taliban checkpoints to get to the airport at all. SIV applicants and others, especially average Afghans who are desperately trying to flee the country as the Taliban formalize their new regime, are faring even worse . Yesterday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that there was no plan, at present, for U.S. forces to go outside of the airport to try to help people get to the airport, and Press Secretary Kirby and General Taylor reiterated today that this remains the case. This comes amid reports that British and French forces are doing exactly the opposite , and have been actively heading out into Kabul to find and gather up evacuees. This reportedly causing tensions of various sorts between U.S. personnel on the ground and allied forces. All of these issues only raise further questions about how long it might take for the U.S. military to complete all of the expected evacuation flights. There also remains no guarantee that the Taliban will continue to allow foreign military activity of any kind to continue at the airport in the coming days, let alone weeks from now. The basic logistics of the operations at the airport, where there are now approximately 5,200 American troops, among other forces, has also been a point of concern. “There is plenty of fuel sustainment capability at Hamid Karzai [International] Airport,” Press Secretary Kirby said in response to a question about whether the U.S. government might be having to buy fuel from the Taliban. “We also have the ability on our own, our logistics ability , to fuel our aircraft as needed.” U.S. forces in Kabul will also need to be extracted at the end of the mission and may be forced to abandon substantial amounts of materiel, especially if there is a need to rapidly leave Hamid Karzai Airport due to sudden changes in the overall security situation. The War Zone has already been able to confirm that the U.S. State Department has now abandoned seven CH-46E Sea Knight helicopters in Afghanistan’s capital, which supported the initial evacuations from the U.S. Embassy to the airport, as you can read more about here . While the Pentagon is stressed that armed aircraft are still only performing overwatch missions over Kabul, they also made clear that they could quickly shift their focus to close air support, if needed. They could also be called in to destroy aircraft, vehicles, and other equipment left behind at Hamid Karzai International Airport whenever the last elements of the evacuation force ultimately depart. “We’ve made it very clear to the Taliban that any attack upon our people and our operations at the airport will be met with a forceful response,” Press Secretary Kirby said. Whatever happens, the Pentagon has made clear that armed American combat aircraft have been, are, and will continue to be overhead above Kabul, poised to act if need be.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 17, 2021",The State Department Has Abandoned Its CH-46 Helicopters In Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. State Department has confirmed that seven CH-46E Sea Knight helicopters , also colloquially known as “Phrogs,” belonging to its Air Wing have been rendered inoperable and abandoned in Afghanistan as part of the ongoing evacuation effort . This non-combatant evacuation operation, or NEO, could very well be the last major mission ever for any Sea Knight belonging to the U.S. government, with the State Department already in the process of divesting its entire fleet. In addition, the Pentagon says that this NEO could be the second largest in American military history, the other being the evacuation of Americans and others from South Vietnam in 1975. As The War Zone has already reported , there is evidence that at least one of the State Department’s now-abandoned Sea Knights in Afghanistan, which it originally obtained second-hand from the U.S. Marine Corps, took part in both operations. A US State Department CH-46E Sea Knight with US civil registration code N38TU. There is evidence that points to the possibility that this helicopter, then in service with the US Marine Corps, took part in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Americans and others from South Vietnam in 1975, and then also helped get people from the US Embassy in Kabul to nearby Hamird Karzai International Airport on Aug. 15, 2021., US Army “The Department left seven CH-46 helicopters behind in Afghanistan which were rendered inoperable,” a State Department official, speaking on background, told The War Zone . “These helicopters were already being phased out of the Department’s inventory and were slated for eventual destruction due to age and supportability issues.” A satellite image showing three of the State Department’s CH-46Es, among other helicopters, at Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 17, 2021., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION That same individual also confirmed that there are no other aircraft of any kind belonging to the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Office of Aviation, or INL/A, better known as the State Department Air Wing , left in Afghanistan. This means that a number of ex-U.S. Army HH-60L Black Hawk helicopters belonging to the Air Wing that had appeared in Kabul earlier this year have now been withdrawn. It’s not clear how many other CH-46Es are still in the Air Wing’s inventory or how many of those airframes are actually flyable. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records show 23 Sea Knights registered to the State Department. This is the same number of these helicopters that it had on hand in 2018 . A US State Department CH-46E Sea Knight in Afghanistan., Dan Stern However, we also know that the FAA’s database includes other State Department aircraft that have been withdrawn from service and are presently in storage awaiting divestment . We also know that the FAA list includes the Phrogs now languishing in Afghanistan, including the one that may have also participated in Operation Frequent Wind in South Vietnam in 1975, which has the U.S. civil registration code N38TU. You can read more about that aircraft and the history of the Phrog in U.S. service, in general, which traces back to the arrival of the U.S. Marine Corps’ first CH-46As in the 1960s, here . The State Department started getting its ex-Marine CH-46Es, which had gone through extensive overhauls to restore them to a like-new condition , in 2012. For years, for security reasons, these contractor-operated helicopters served as the primary mode of transportation for American diplomats and others between the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and nearby Hamid Karzai International Airport, among other destinations in Afghanistan, as part of a program known as Embassy Air . On Aug. 15, 2021, as the Taliban moved into Kabul, the State Department’s Phrogs swung into action to help American diplomatic staff make their final trips from the Embassy to the airport. We don’t exactly what was done to them afterward to make them unusable and how permanent that process might be. US Marines escort American diplomatic staff at Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 15, 2021. A State Department CH-46E is seen in the background., USMC Regardless, Hamid Karzai International Airport has now been transformed into the nexus of the U.S. military’s evacuation operations, as well as those being carried out by other foreign military forces. U.S. Army General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said earlier today that, at present, the U.S. Air Force was conducting around 20 C-17A Globemaster III sorties every 24 hours out of the airport. Thousands of American troops, as well as other foreign forces, have continued to pour in to help provide security and otherwise help with the mission. A US Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan on Aug. 17, 2021., USAF “We have a significant amount of rotary aviation, to include attack and lift helicopters,” Milley added. Pictures and videos that have emerged over the past few days have shown U.S. Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, as well as UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47F Chinook transport helicopters. A number of special operations MH-60M Black Hawk and MH-47G Chinook helicopters , as well as AH/MH-6 Little Birds , all of which belong to the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , also appeared at the airport this week. Beyond the C-17As, a variety of fixed-wing aircraft have also been flying to and from Afghanistan, or are otherwise prepositioned in the Middle East to provide support, if necessary. This includes Air Force AC-130 gunships , B-52H bombers , F-16C/D Viper fighter jets, and MQ-9 Reaper drones, as well as Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets and AV-8B Harrier jump jets, according to Milley. However, “I don’t have the capability to go out and extend operations in Kabul,” Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin added at today’s press conference alongside General Milley. “We don’t have the capability to go out and collect large numbers of people.” American nationals and others the U.S. government is seeking to assist continue to face serious and potentially life-threatening hurdles in just getting to the airport. Regular Afghan citizens who have been trying to escape the country by air for days now are faring even worse . There is no plan now for the U.S. military to begin conducting operations elsewhere in Afghanistan to help rescue any of those individuals who might be stranded across the country. If it comes to that, one has to wonder if it might have been valuable to have kept the State Department’s CH-46Es, which had various self-defense capabilities , including door and window-mounted 7.62mm M240D machine guns, flyable for just a little while longer. There already remain significant questions about the true extent of U.S. government contingency planning and intelligence assessments that led to the decision to consolidate the entire NEO within the limited confines of Hamid Karzai International Airport rather than, say, spreading some capabilities to the larger and more secure air base at Bagram Airfield to the north of Kabul. The U.S. military transferred Bagram to the now-defunct Afghan government in July under highly controversial circumstances . How long it might take for the U.S. military to expand the evacuation enterprise to the desired level, where American military aircraft will be able to get out 5,000 to 9,000 people every day, as well as if the Taliban will continue to allow those operations to continue unencumbered, remains to be seen. It’s also unclear what the final stages of the mission will look like. The State Department’s comments about the CH-46Es are also the first confirmation that the U.S. government does not plan to extract all of its deployed materiel, even aircraft, at the end of its presence in Afghanistan. If there is a sudden need to close out the ongoing NEO rapidly, other helicopters may well get left behind, as well. This has raised questions about whether the U.S. military might conduct airstrikes to blow up any such assets that get abandoned after pulling out the last of its forces on the ground. “There’s going to be plenty of time to talk about regrets,” General Milley said at today’s press conference. “Right now is not the time.” It is somewhat sad to think that the helicopters that did such a good job at keeping our diplomatic staff safe are being left in a hostile country. These aircraft could very possibly be the last operational Phrogs the U.S. government will ever fly. It’s also worth noting that variants of the Sea Knight, as well as its commercial analog, the Boeing Vertol V-107, are still flying elsewhere around the world , in various roles, including firefighting duties . At the U.S. military’s central boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona alone there are dozens of Sea Knight airframes in storage, which could still be useful sources of spare parts. Still, airlifting the State Department’s Phrogs out of Afghanistan would likely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and require significant time, while also taking up airlift capacity that could be better used to help people and more advanced helicopters evacuate the country. No matter what, priorities are priorities. Lives and more advanced gear matters more. Although it would probably be better off destroying them on their way out than letting them be used as Taliban trophies.

Justin Bronk,"Updated on Jan 6, 2022",The Truth About Cyber Warfare’s Impact On Airpower,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has become relatively commonplace in policy and military circles for the term ‘cyber’ to be attached to lists of both threats to and enablers for traditional airpower capabilities. Cyberweapons are without doubt an important tool in warfare, espionage, and deterrence. The potential attack surface against which they can be employed is increasing rapidly as ever more of the fabric of society becomes digitized and network-enabled. However, the tempo and nature of the processes by which military-grade cyber capabilities can be developed and deployed are regularly misunderstood in non-specialist circles. Confusion over where the boundaries lie between offensive electronic warfare and cyber capabilities can further distort public discussions of how these important capabilities fit into conventional military operations, and the application of airpower, in particular. Broadly, the fundamental dividing line between electronic warfare (EW) and cyber is that where offensive EW capabilities are designed to interact with hostile systems using electromagnetic energy emissions, offensive cyber capabilities are designed to interact with hostile systems using data in the form of code. In practice, the boundaries between the two spheres of operations are often somewhat blurred. This is especially true as an increasing number of platforms such as the US Navy’s EA-18G Growler and the F-35 Lightning II are fielded with systems and sensors which can potentially interact with enemy systems using both EW and cyber techniques, and in some cases transition quickly from one to the other in flight. There are also similarities in that designing effective military EW and cyber capabilities require a detailed understanding of the target systems or networks, which must be refreshed frequently in order to remain relevant. However, the timescales involved in developing electronic attack capabilities and offensive cyber capabilities against military systems are very different. This is because of how cyberattacks work. The EA-18G is an electronic warfare platform, but its mission may also bleed into the cyber domain., U.S. Navy photo by Cmdr. Ian C. Anderson, USN A military cyberattack functions, in essence, by the accessing, alteration, or deletion of data held within a hostile network. This is done in the virtual domain so as to achieve an effect in the real world. As such, a cyberattack can serve a wide range of purposes depending on what data is being accessed and what its intended function is within its host network and/or system. Effects of a successful attack range from gaining detailed intelligence on how threat systems work, preventing a target system from performing its function correctly, temporarily disabling key functions, or even causing it to malfunction in such a way as to cause physical damage. This article is sponsored by Private Internet Access However, before any desired effects can be designed into a cyber payload, an attacker must work out what data is held in which adversary networks, and what coding language and programming logic is being used in those networks. Many civilian networks use commercially available and, therefore, easily understood coding languages and logic. This makes penetrating and subsequently exploiting such systems significantly easier than sensitive military systems which are purpose-built and regularly monitored. In either case, a cyber attacker must gain an initial access point to discover and then extract data to reveal what is stored on a given network and how it is coded. The U.S. military is in a race to create cyber weapons and defend against them., USAF This vital first step in planning any cyberattack must be done without the data breach being identified as a hostile presence. In the case of bespoke military systems, this task is made more difficult by the fact that the attackers will not be initially familiar with the coding language and rules of the network, and thus will struggle to mimic legitimate network traffic well enough to avoid rapid detection. If an attacker is detected, then they will not only be rapidly isolated from the network, but may also be counter-attacked using the gateway connection they have created. The most sensitive military systems are also generally air-gapped, which means that they have no interfaces, either wired or wireless, to outside networks or the wider internet. As such, in order to conduct initial network reconnaissance, attackers will need to bypass physical isolation measures and then set up a remote access connection for data exfiltration and future penetration attempts. Once a network has been identified as containing useful target data for theft, modification, or deletion, an attacker must attempt to bypass security measures and gain control over administrator accounts which will then grant the necessary permissions. Since almost all military and sensitive civilian systems are protected by multifactor authentication security measures, this either requires human intelligence assets to willingly or unwillingly give up passwords, keys, and biometrics, or hacking to bypass those security measures. A cyber warfare operations officer watches members of the 175th Cyberspace Operations Group analyze log files and provide a cyber threat update utilizing a Kibana visualization on the large data wall in the Hunter’s Den at Warfield Air National Guard Base, Middle River, Maryland. , J.M. Eddins Jr./U.S. Air Force Hacking involves finding ambiguities or errors in the coding of a network that can be exploited to bypass the need to enter authentication information. Most complex systems have potential vulnerabilities, but sensitive networks will also be checked and patched regularly to remove any that are discovered by chance or exposed by a detected attack attempt. Once access to the required administrator nodes is gained by an attacker, they can leverage them to alter and insert data, including cyber weapons. A cyber weapon is a package of code, typically carefully calibrated to perform a specific function within a specific networked system while making attribution and detection as difficult as possible for defenders. Once inserted successfully, a cyber payload may be triggered immediately. However, if it is intended to be used in the future it must be coded to either trigger automatically when certain conditions are met, otherwise, access must be re-established to trigger it at a desired point in time. Many military systems operate under emission control posture for extended periods when operating against modern opposing forces, and in the case of ships, mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and aircraft in flight, they are also physically isolated from most potential access methods. Software is also regularly updated and patched, which can result in the vulnerability being used for access being deliberately or inadvertently shut off before a cyber weapon’s payload can be triggered. S-400 air defense system control element., Russian MoD Software updates can also change the internal logic of a system such that a previously emplaced cyber capability no longer functions as intended when triggered. Furthermore, military networks tend to be protected by real-time monitoring of all traffic across the limited number of known access points. Therefore, each access attempt to either trigger, assure or update an emplaced cyber weapon capability risks detection and subsequent purging or counterattack by the network defenders. The practical upshot is that developing a cyber capability against a sensitive hostile military asset such as air defense early warning networks, aircraft avionics, or intelligence processing systems takes years of concentrated effort and carries significant risks of discovery and attribution. Furthermore, once established, there is no guarantee that the capability can be triggered on-demand in support of a future kinetic operation, nor that it will not be discovered or patched into irrelevance by enemy cyber defenses before it can be used. There is also no way to predict with certainty the various potential second and third-order effects if the payload escapes beyond the confines of the system it was designed to attack. Therefore, such capabilities are viewed in most nations as strategic level military tools, and knowledge of their existence, capabilities, and limitations is held at a very high level of classification. Release authorization is also typically held at a much more senior level of the military and political command structure than conventional military assets. The length of time required to establish capabilities in sensitive, hostile networks, and the difficulties of assurance and triggering for emplaced payloads significantly affect how cyber capabilities interact with the air domain. One of the most important uses of cyber capabilities over the medium to long term is to gather sensitive information about critical enemy systems such as radars, missile guidance logic, or seeker performance. Such data is critical for programming effective aircraft countermeasure systems, electronic warfare suites, optimizing tactics for terminal missile evasion, and far more. An F-35 prototype undergoes electromagnetic testing in an anechoic chamber. , Lockheed Martin-Jack Noble Publicly acknowledged cyber breaches aimed at obtaining this sort of information on American air systems suggest that most state attacks target the industrial supply chain rather than bespoke military systems. This would make sense since the supply chain in many modern aerial combat and air weapons programs is multinational and diverse, which makes finding vulnerabilities and networks with lax security measures easier for attackers. It also has implications for the potential areas of vulnerability for combat air capabilities to more direct cyberattacks in a future conflict. The closed and heavily monitored nature of most avionics and mission systems make direct cyberattacks on aircraft and command systems difficult (although perhaps not impossible) for adversaries to accomplish in practice. However, it would not be surprising if less heavily defended ancillary logistics and industrial supply networks suddenly started to malfunction or fail during critical phases of a future state-on-state conflict as a result of previously embedded hostile cyber payloads. If spare parts are not delivered reliably, then even the simplest combat aircraft will rapidly lose effectiveness, as fleets are cannibalized to maintain a steadily decreasing number of jets ready to fly and fight. If munitions and fuel cannot be supplied, then effectiveness and sortie rates will drop even more rapidly. As the extent of digitization of the supply and maintenance chain on which western air forces depend becomes ever greater, the potential attack surface also expands. Tech. Sgt. Emil Wodicka, left, and Staff Sgt. Samantha Birnschein, 372nd Training Squadron, Detachment 3, work a wing reattachment and repair on a repurposed F-35A Lightning II at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, July 13, 2020., U.S. Air Force photo by R. Nial Bradshaw It is impossible to assure every aspect of the enterprise against sophisticated and dedicated state attackers all the time. Therefore, the best defense against a potentially crippling cyberattack targeting key air assets in wartime might well be to increase the level of redundancy and extra capacity in the maintenance and spares system to reduce the impact of attacks when they inevitably occur. This would also have significant potential benefits in terms of improving overall availability but as always, the limiting factor that constrains such ‘inefficiency’ in peacetime is cost. In terms of real-time cyber enablers for conventional operations, the first key question for air forces is what enemy systems have been infiltrated and implanted with relevant cyber payloads capable of causing operationally useful effects? If the conflict in question is against an adversary nation or in an area that was not a major focus for defense planners prior to the outbreak of hostilities, then it is unlikely that cyber payloads are already in place. Given the time scales required to develop and successfully install them, cyber professionals cannot simply create operationally relevant effects from scratch at short notice. However, critical assets such as the air defense networks of well-established adversary nations are likely to have been the target of longer-term efforts, and there may be useful payloads in place either in the main systems themselves or within ancillary systems upon which they depend. Cyberweapons have a very different development and use profile than kinetic weapons., USAF The second question at that point is whether the officers planning an airstrike at the operational level are aware that the potentially useful cyber capability exists or not. Offensive cyber capabilities are some of the most highly classified national security tools. Even if planners are aware of the existence of a potentially useful cyber capability, they may well lack the authority to authorize their use in support of conventional strike operations. High-end cyber payloads embedded within important components of a state adversary’s defenses take years to develop and emplace, and once used will be rapidly discovered, patched out, and potentially attributed. The adversary will also gain detailed knowledge about the techniques employed as they examine the code within the payload, which could help them improve their own offensive cyber capabilities over time. Therefore, the authority to use them will be vested at a very senior level, most likely head of state or at least Joint Chiefs level. If the capability is known and can be authorized in sufficient time to be incorporated into the planning process for a conventional air operation, the third vital question is whether it can be coordinated sufficiently closely with the precise timings of aircraft movements and weapons releases. The emergence of Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars as a primary sensor and emitter on modern combat air platforms does offer a potential way to remotely trigger previously emplaced cyber payloads in enemy systems. Since any radar must be, by its very nature, a receiver that transmits an interpretation of electronic signals as encoded data into a network, AESA radars can be used to interact with enemy air defenses in a more sophisticated manner than traditional EW. An AN/APG-79 AESA being fitted into a F/A-18 Legacy Hornet., Raytheon With a sufficiently detailed understanding of an enemy radar system and the way it interacts with the wider defense network, airborne AESA radars could be used to either transmit coded activation signals for a previously emplaced cyber payload, or electromagnetic energy patterns designed to be recognized as a trigger signal by the payload when they are picked up by the hostile radar. However, bearing in mind the difficulties in assuring remote triggering access and proper functioning of a previously installed cyber payload in an enemy system, any air operation which includes cyber enablers must accept a significant risk that the cyber capability does not work as expected. Furthermore, once used, an adversary will quickly dig out and identify the code in question, so cyber payloads – while potentially capable of causing significant disruption at key moments – tend to be single-shot weapons with temporary effects. In the air domain, cyber weapons are best thought of as tools that can help open a temporary window of vulnerability for a major strike force, given sufficient preparation time, permissions, and understanding across multiple command levels. The challenge they pose to air forces is primarily a persistent disruptive threat to information security, ancillary systems, and logistics chains. For rapid, on-demand degradation of key enemy sensors and weapons systems, however, kinetic strikes and digitally-enabled electronic warfare remain far more important.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 23, 2021",A New Northern Alliance Against The Taliban Is Forming In Afghanistan’s Panjshir Valley (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the Taliban now controls virtually all of Afghanistan , including the country’s capital, Kabul , one region, the Panjshir Valley, remains outside of the group’s tightening grip. Now, a resistance movement is forming there, led by, among others, Amrullah Saleh, who had been First Vice President of Afghanistan until the collapse of the internationally-recognized government this past weekend, and now claims to be the legitimate leader of the country. Yesterday, in a post on Twitter, Saleh declared himself “the legitimate care taker [sic] President,” citing the constitution of the now all-but-defunct Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which says the First Vice President assumes this role “in absence, escape, resignation or death of the President.” The Islamic Republic’s last President, Ashraf Ghani, fled the country as the Taliban advanced toward Kabul and unconfirmed rumors are swirling that he and his entourage escaped with $169 million in cash. His whereabouts were uncertain until today, when officials in the United Arab Emirates confirmed he was in their country , having been allowed in on “humanitarian grounds.” A file photo of Amrullah Saleh at a rally in Afghanistan in 2011., AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili Saleh says he is still in Afghanistan. Video footage had emerged on Aug. 16 that reportedly showing him, along with Ahmad Massoud and others, boarding an Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip-type helicopter at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul as the relocated to the Panjshir, which only lies some 70 miles north of Afghanistan’s capital. Ahmad Massoud is the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, who fought against the Soviets in the 1970s and 1980s and then against the Taliban in the 1990s. The elder Massoud, who became known as the “ Lion of Panjshir ,” was a prominent member of the Northern Alliance, which the United States leveraged to help oust the Taliban from power in 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Ahmad Shah Massoud was assassinated on Sept. 9, 2001, in a suicide attack carried out by individuals linked to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, who were posing as journalists who had come to interview him. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YwP0T2jtjOQ Amrullah Saleh was also a member of the Northern Alliance, as was Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, who had just taken up the post of Defense Minister of Afghanistan in June. Mohammadi has endorsed Saleh’s claim as the country’s legitimate leader and has also called for the arrest of Ashraf Ghani. Saleh was also head of Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS), the country’s main intelligence agency, which had deep and controversial ties with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), between 2004 and 2010. A picture had emerged on Monday that reportedly showed an individual holding the Northern Alliance’s green-white-and-black flag in the Panjshir. Saleh and the rest of the leadership of what are some are now referring to as the Panjshiri Resistance are trying to rally forces to their cause there, including former Afghan government security forces who have evaded the Taliban. Militarily speaking, the Panjshir Valley, despite being currently isolated and so close to Kabul, could present a challenge, simply due to the complex nature of the terrain, for the Taliban to capture. That group was notably never able to take control of the valley during its first rise to power. Of course, at the time, the Northern Alliance also controlled other surrounding provinces, including ones that provided overland access to neighboring countries, such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the north, through which outside support could more readily flow. The current size of the Panjshiri Resistance is unknown, while the total size of the Taliban has been estimated to be more than 200,000, including around 60,000 core militants and another 90,000 militiamen aligned with the group. The Taliban’s numbers may have increased just recently, with defections of Afghan security forces and pro-government militias being a key component of their lighting-quick advances leading up to the fall of Kabul on Sunday. The Taliban also captured a significant amount of largely U.S.-supplied military equipment, including armored vehicles and artillery, which can only bolster forces’ capabilities. However, no matter what the precariousness of the new Panjshiri Resistance’s physical disposition might be, its existence at all presents significant geopolitical complications for the Taliban, as well as outside powers, even just in the near term. The Taliban has already declared the return of its Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and its leadership is now descending on Kabul to formalize change in power. This includes the group’s co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who returned, along with others, to Afghanistan from Qatar today. Baradar was released from a Pakistani prison in 2018 as part of ostensible peace negotiations with the U.S. government, the Taliban side of which had been run out of official political office in the Qatari capital Doha. Taliban representatives have already been working with other notable Afghan figures, including former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah, regarding a peaceful transition of power to the new Islamic Emirate. Abdullah Abdullah notably lost a highly controversial presidential election to Ashraf Ghani in 2019. After Ghani fled, Karzai had announced that he, together with Abdullah Abdullah and warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, were forming an interim authority in Kabul. Any such formalized transition could help give an air of legitimacy to the Taliban’s conquest of Afghanistan and its claims to power. Amrullah Saleh’s challenge that authority, of course, now presents new hurdles. It raises concerns about the potential for increased sectarian violence in the country. The Taliban’s membership, like Afghanistan itself, is predominantly made up of ethnic Pashtuns. Saleh, Massoud, and Mohammadi are all Tajiks, an ethnic minority in the country. It’s worth noting that, while the Northern Alliance did include Pashtuns, it was first established by Tajiks, like the elder Massoud, and Afghanistan’s various minority groups still made up a significant portion of the forces under its umbrella by 2001. Separately, there are already reports that members of the minority Hazara ethnic group are also already trying to get to the potential safety of the Panjshir. The Hazara are predominantly Shia rather than Sunni Muslims, making them a minority in Afghanistan in that respect, as well. Hardline Sunnis, such as the Taliban, have often persecuted Shias , who they see as heretical. There are already indications that this could be the case under the Taliban’s new rule in Afghanistan. Pictures emerged today reportedly showing the destruction of a statue in the city of Bamyan of Abdul Ali Mazari, a Hazara figure who fought the Soviets and the Taliban, and who the latter group is widely believed to have tortured and killed in 1995. The Taliban claimed at the time that he attacked their representatives during a meeting near Kabul. This, in turn, brings up the possibility that Saleh and his comrades may be able to leverage minority discontent with the Taliban, in particular, to bolster the ranks of the new Panjshiri Resistance inside the country and secure support elsewhere. It’s worth noting that Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum ,  who had been the Fourth First Vice President of Afghanistan, and Ata Mohammed Noor , a Tajik powerbroker who had been Governor of Afghanistan northern Balkh Province, both managed to flee with forces under their command into Uzbekistan last week. Before escaping the country, Noor accused Ashraf Ghani and his administration of a deliberate conspiracy to step aside and let the Taliban take over, though there has been nothing to substantiate that claim. Dostum and Noor were also both previously members of the Northern Alliance. Dostum was notably the Afghan commander at the center of the now legendary story of U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers who fought on horseback in the opening stages of the American intervention in the country in 2001. Disaffected Pashtuns who don’t support the Taliban, both inside and outside of Afghanistan, could be drawn to the new resistance movement, too. More and more reports are coming out about the Taliban brutalizing average Afghans and attacking any who oppose them. At least three people were killed today, and more than a dozen others were injured, in an attack on an anti-Taliban demonstration in the city of Jalalabad. All of this could hamper the Taliban’s push for formal international recognition, as well. Today, Afghanistan’s Embassy in Tajikistan replaced the portrait of Ashraf Ghani with one of Amrullah Saleh, and the ambassador there,  Zahir Aghbar, says he has rejected the Taliban’s rule . Others may follow, creating the potential for political crises in multiple countries. Many countries, including the United States , are already adopting a wait-and-see approach with regards to recognizing any new Taliban government. Even, the Pakistani government, which has long been accused of accomodating, if not actively supporting the Taliban and other militant groups opposed to the government in Kabul, has said it won’t rush to offer recognition to the new Islamic Emirate. Saleh’s claim to be caretaker President can only impact any such deliberations about the legitimacy of the Taliban’s emerging government. At the same time, foreign powers, such as the United States, may try to push back having to answer any such questions until after ongoing evacuation operations in the capital Kabul. The ability of the evacuation airlift at Hamid Karzai International Airport to keep proceeding as smoothly as it can is entirely subject to the whims of the Taliban. The situation continues to be especially tense as foreign nationals and others try to make their way there through Taliban checkpoints. For days already , thousands of increasingly desperate Afghan citizens have been trying to flee the country by air. All told, even as the Taliban work to consolidate their authority across Afghanistan, forces are assembling to oppose them and the country’s future is far from certain. Update 4:00 PM EST: The Washington Post has published an op-ed from Ahmad Massoud himself, which he says he wrote from the Panjshir Valley. The piece, which is worth reading in its entirety , confirms the general plan, at least for the time being, to resist the Taliban and includes an appeal to the United States for support. “I write from the Panjshir Valley today, ready to follow in my father’s footsteps, with mujahideen fighters who are prepared to once again take on the Taliban,” Massoud writes. “We have stores of ammunition and arms that we have patiently collected since my father’s time, because we knew this day might come.” “If Taliban warlords launch an assault, they will of course face staunch resistance from us,” he continues. “Yet we know that our military forces and logistics will not be sufficient. They will be rapidly depleted unless our friends in the West can find a way to supply us without delay.” “The United States and its allies have left the battlefield, but America can still be a ‘great arsenal of democracy,’ as Franklin D. Roosevelt said when coming to the aid of the beleaguered British before the U.S. entry into World War II,” Massoud adds. “America and its democratic allies do not just have the fight against terrorism in common with Afghans. We now have a long history made up of shared ideals and struggles. There is still much that you can do to aid the cause of freedom. You are our only remaining hope.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On August 15th, 2021, the U.S. Navy led the execution of a Sinking Exercise (SINKEX) off Hawaii as part of the ongoing and unprecedently massive Large Scale Exercise 2021 . Not a whole lot is known about this SINKEX just yet, but multiple types of weapons were involved, including a Super Hornet-launched AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) and stealthy Naval Strike Missiles (NSM) launched from the Marine Corps’ new unmanned ground-based launcher vehicles. P-8s were also involved, which could mean they employed AGM-84 Harpoons . There are likely a number of other weapons that were fired at the frigate, too, as is typically the case during SINKEXs , which are prized and infrequent training and developmental opportunities. The incorporation of the Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) is a major development for this SINKEX. The system uses an unmanned vehicle based on the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle’s chassis, known as Remotely Operated Ground Unit Expeditionary-Fires (ROGUE-Fires), that carries twin Naval Strike Missile launch canisters. A Naval Strike Missile streaks out to sea before striking a naval target ship, Aug. 15, 2021, aboard Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands, Hawaii. , USMC The concept is set to underpin the Marine Corp’s new expeditionary anti-ship capability, which is a core component of a major remodeling of the force to be better suited for supporting distributed operations , especially in the Pacific Theater, during a peer-state conflict. During the live-fire drill, two NSMs were employed, one from a launcher delivered by C-130 and another by one delivered by LCAC hovercraft . The Naval Strike Missiles apparently both struck the ex-USS Ingraham just as planned after flying over 100 miles to their target. This is a big accomplishment for the Marines’ anti-ship missile system program, which is only around two years old. You can read much more about NMESIS in this past piece of ours. NMESIS rolling off an LCAC. , USMC NMESIS rolling out of a KC-130., USMC USMC USMC While the Marine Corps’ NSM firings were clearly a big part of the SINKEX, it was still just one facet of what all came together during the evolution. Large Scale Exercise 2021 is all about integration across multiple domains and great distances using complex networks. A release about the NSM test states: LSE 21 was a live, virtual and constructive scenario-driven, globally-integrated exercise with activities spanning 17 time zones. LSE 21 applied and assessed developmental warfighting concepts that will define how the future Navy and Marine Corps compete, respond to crises, fight and win in conflict. … SINKEX, the exercise scenario involving NMESIS, provided a testing environment for new and developing technologies to connect, locate, identify, target and destroy adversary threats in all domains, culminating in the live-fire demonstration of the naval strike missile against a sea-based target. During the exercise, forward-deployed forces on expeditionary advanced bases detected and, after joint command and control collaboration with other U.S. forces, responded to a ship-based adversary. Simultaneous impacts from multiple, dispersed weapons systems and platforms across different U.S. services—including NMESIS—engaged the threat.

USS Ingraham (FFG-61) seen during her operational career back in 2008., USN As you can see in the image at the top of this story, she was a tough ship, taking who knows how many hits from various weapons while still staying afloat. Her forward superstructure is totally blown out and she has another deep rupture on her stern, among other injuries. It is worth noting that it is standard practice to seal up the target ship’s compartments and remove all major combustibles prior to a SINKEX, which offers a bit more survivability than what a normal operational configuration could offer, although she has no sailors executing damage control, either. Usually, we do get some clips of at least a few of the impacts of the weapons used in these drills, although this being a more sensitive, non-international exercise could change that.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the chaos at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul was beginning to unfold after the Taliban entered the city on Sunday, an entirely different kind of exodus was underway from the country’s northern regions. Satellite imagery confirms that dozens of fixed-wing aircraft, such as A-29 Super Tucano light attack planes, and helicopters, including UH-60 Black Hawks , from the now-defunct Afghan armed forces, originally supplied by the United States, are sitting at Termez Airport in neighboring Uzbekistan. An image, taken yesterday, Aug. 16, 2021, of Termez from Planet Labs shows the sudden appearance of at least 22 small fixed-wing planes and 26 helicopters. The resolution of the imagery means we can’t say for sure that all of these aircraft came fled from Afghanistan. However, what we can see fits almost perfectly with an official statement from the government of Uzbekistan that 46 aircraft, 22 fixed-wing types and 24 helicopters, coming out of Afghanistan had been “forced” to land.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A much more typical satellite image of the main portions of Termez Airport from April 2020, showing it largely devoid of any aircraft., Google Earth Authorities in Uzbekistan said that this total did also include one A-29 that came down inside Uzbekistan. Initial reports had indicated that it had been shot down, though it was later said to have collided with an Uzbekistan Air Force fighter jet, reportedly one of the country’s Russian-made MiG-29 Fulcrums , leading to the loss of both planes. Exactly what happened is now in dispute , but pictures did emerge on social media showing the downed Super Tucano and its pilots, who were able to eject safely. Online flight tracking sites had appeared to show some Afghan Air Force aircraft trying to flee first to Tajikistan, so it is also possible that this A-29 simply ran out of fuel while trying to find a safe place to land. At least six Super Tucanos do appear to have made it Termez. The satellite imagery, as well as other pictures that have now appeared on social media, make clear that the fleeing Afghan aircraft included more types than just A-29s. There appear to be at least five Cessna 208B Caravans , which could include AC-208 types fitted with sensor turrets and capable of firing 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) laser-guided rockets in addition to the standard light utility versions, among the fixed-wing types. Another 11 of the fixed-wing planes look to be Pilatus PC-12NG intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft. An Afghan Special Mission Wing Pilatus PC-12NG., DOD The helicopters look to be a mix of Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip and UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopters, with what looks to be 19 and 7 of each type, respectively. There do not appear to be any of the late Afghan Air Force’s fleet of smaller Hughes 530F Little Bird armed scout helicopters now at Termez. Afghan Air Force UH-60 Black Hawks., AP PHOTO/RAHMAT GUL Afghan Air Force Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip type helicopters., USAF Whatever the exact breakdown is, if the total figure, 46, is accurate, this would be a significant number of the Afghan military’s total available airframe as of the end of July, according to the Office of the Special Inspector for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, an American government watchdog created by Congress in 2008. SIGAR’s 52nd quarterly report , which it released on July 29, said that there were 167 Afghan Air Force aircraft “Usable / In-Country,” with another 44 airfames technically in inventory. In addition to the aforementioned fixed-wing types and helicopters, the Afghan Air Force also had four C-130H Hercules airlifters, the fate of which is uncertain. An Afghan Air Force C-130H Hercules airlifter., USAF It is important to note that SIGAR’s figures do not include aircraft assigned to Afghanistan’s Special Mission Wing (SMW), an entirely separate special operations aviation unit that operated its own helicopters and fixed-wing types. The SMW notably operated the entire fleet of Pilatus PC-12NGs. The actual number of available Afghan Air Force aircraft may well have been lower as of Sunday. There had been separate reports that the operational capacity of the Afghan Air Force was declining in the days leading up to the release of SIGAR’s report. The Afghan Air Force had been hamstrung due to a host of factors for years already. This included a persistent inability to train sufficient numbers of pilots and maintenance personnel, leading to a heavy reliance on foreign contractors . When those personnel left the country earlier this year as part of the United States’ troop withdrawal plan, Afghanistan’s air force went into a figurative nose dive . The readiness of its two newest platforms, the UH-60 and the AC-208, suffered especially because of that decision. Contractors talk with a member of the Afghan Air Force, wearing blue, regarding an A-29, at Hamid Karzai International Airport in 2016., USAF “The AC-208 fleet, for example, had maintained a 93% readiness rate in April and May, but dropped to 63% in June,” according to SIGAR. “The UH-60 fleet was at 77% in April and May, but dropped to 39% in June.” If all of the decisions over the past 20 years or so about what aircraft to equip the Afghan Air Force with, which were made largely by its American benefactors, have been controversial in some way, the adoption of the UH-60 was perhaps the most so . The Black Hawks were intended to replace Afghanistan’s Russian-made Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip transport helicopters. While there may have been a practical case to be made for this decision, it was driven largely by difficulties in acquiring spare parts after the United States slapped sanctions on Russia in 2014 over the Kremlin’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and direct support for dubiously local separatist groups fighting against the government in Kyiv, as well as Russian activities in Syria. The problem was that the Hips were the only aircraft in Afghan Air Force inventory by that point that Afghans themselves were capable of operating and maintaining with any degree of independence from contractors. They were also ideally suited to Afghanistan’s often hot-and-high operating conditions , something the U.S. military itself conceded in 2018. The limits of Afghan Air Force capacity clearly visible as the Taliban advanced across the country , with the group’s members capturing a number of helicopters and fixed-wing types. However, a significant number of these appeared to be non-flyable. It’s notable that the ones that they did appear to get working were all Hips. It remains to be seen how well any future Taliban Air Force will fare trying to make them operational without any foreign support. Similarly, it’s not clear how valuable any of these platforms, which have limited capabilities compared to their counterparts in service with the U.S. and other Western militaries, might be to foreign intelligence agencies, such as those in Russia or China. “It’s understandable for people to be concerned about any capability falling into the hands of folks where we don’t know exactly how they’re going to use it, who are going to use it against, whether that’s an M16 [rifle] or whether that’s an A-29,” U.S. Air Force General Mark Kelly, head of Air Combat Command, told Defense News in an interview yesterday, speaking generally in response to questions about the Taliban seizing Afghan military equipment. “But suffice to say that the technology that’s in the A-29 is not cutting-edge technology.” “They may actually be able to get it airborne, but they’d probably be more dangerous to their own wellbeing than they would [be] to people on the ground,” he added. Regardless, it’s not at all surprising that Afghan Air Force pilots would try to use any available aircraft to flee the country as the Taliban took Kabul. The group’s takeover of that city capped off a string of lightning-quick advances across the country that had led to the collapse of the internationally recognized government led by President Ashraf Ghani, who fled himself and whose whereabouts are presently unknown. In July, Reuters had also reported that the Taliban had stepped up an assassination campaign specifically targeting Afghan Air Force pilots. Afghan Air Force pilots celebrate their graduation from a training program in the Czech Republic in 2018., DOD Even before all of this, there had been instances of Afghan pilots deserting, especially while participating in training programs overseas, including in the United States, at least in part due to fears for their personal safety, for years. In 2019, U.S-based training for Afghan AC-208 pilots was infamously halted entirely after nearly half of the individuals participating in the program went missing. Two years earlier, “we found that nearly half of all foreign military trainees that went AWOL while training in the United States since 2005 were from Afghanistan (152 of 320),” SIGAR said in another report . What will happen to the former Afghan Air Force aircraft in Uzbekistan, and the crews that flew them there, remains to be seen. Uzbekistan authorities say that are now actively engaging with the Taliban, including on matters of border security. “Uzbekistan is in close contact with members of the Taliban movement on issues related to border protection and efforts to preserve calm in border areas,” according to an official statement today from Uzbekistan’s Foreign Ministry. “We also firmly declare that attempts to violate the state border will be met with a tough response.” After the Afghan A-29 went down, CNN ‘s Jake Tapper reported that members of Congress were trying to find a way to ensure the safety of those pilots. “Senate staffers were trying to reach State Department officials, who are already overwhelmed with the deteriorating situation,” he wrote on Twitter on Aug. 15. Who technically owns any of the aircraft now at Termez could become a significant point of contention between various actors, including the Taliban and the United States, as well. The government of Uzbekistan could simply seek to impound them and claim them as their own, as other countries have done with fleeing military aircraft in the past. However, the country’s current president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has sought to improve relations with the United States in recent years and could also seek to leverage the situation in some way to that end. The entire affair highlights another parallel of sorts between what’s happening in Afghanistan and the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975, when South Vietnamese Air Force pilots flew dozens of planes, including fighter jets, to neighboring Thailand to escape the advancing North Vietnamese military. As it stands now, there’s an entire effectively stateless air force, originally financed by the United States, just sitting at an airport in Uzbekistan.

Adam Kehoe and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 19, 2021",Five Decades After Evacuating The Embassy In Saigon The CH-46 Phrog Did It Again In Kabul,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A striking photo of a CH-46E Sea Knight flying over the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul this week occasioned immediate visual and emotional parallels with the Fall of Saigon, nearly fifty years ago. It turns out that the images and helicopters are not only similar, but they possibly involve some of the same aircraft that flew in Operation Frequent Wind , the mission to evacuate Americans and others from Saigon at the end of the conflict in Vietnam in 1975. Regardless of if this is the case, it is amazing that the CH-46 is still doing this type of mission nearly half a century after Saigon fell and years after the U.S. military officially retired the type from service. Eagle-eyed observers on Twitter were quick to note that at least one of the helicopters seen flying over Kabul could match one seen in Vietnam-era photos from the deck of the USS Hancock during its mission to rescue as many people as possible from Saigon. Department of State Air Wing CH-46 Phrogs approaching a landing zone in Afghanistan. , US Army The Bureau Number (BuNo), a serial number applied to all aircraft that the U.S. Navy purchases regardless of their ultimate recipient, on one of the helicopters in the photo could read 154038, matching a CH-46E that was indeed transferred to the State Department as N38TU in 2012. If accurate, at least one Sea Knight may have participated in both historic evacuations. The Phrog’s Past Nicknamed the “Phrog”(or Battle Phrog) by a Marine Corps major due to its frog-like appearance from the front, the CH-46 Sea Knight was originally procured by the Marines in 1961. Exactly why Marines used the “ph” has apparently been lost to time. Whatever the origins of the spelling, the “Phrog” moniker is apt in more than one regard. V-107 prototype in 1961. The V-107 would become the H-46. , Joop van Bilsen / Anefo -Wikicommons The operational concept of the Phrog dates back to the post-World War II era when the advent of atomic weaponry led war planners to be wary of massing amphibious forces in one place. Instead, their strategy was to engage in “ vertical envelopment ,” using helicopters to leapfrog enemy defenses. Though the attacking force would be weaker in numbers, it would be highly mobile and avoid large concentrations of men and equipment that could be targeted with weapons of mass destruction. The Phrog went on to be a vital asset in various ensuing Cold War conflicts. The primary utility of the helicopter came from a new design that utilized turbine engines instead of a reciprocating power plant, and a tandem-rotor configuration that could handle heavy loads at appreciable speeds and altitudes. The CH-46 can accommodate three to five crew with seventeen additional passengers and has a maximum lift capacity of about 12,000 pounds. The top speed of the helicopter is 165 miles per hour. By the late 1960s, the Marine Corps, through the Department of the Navy, had acquired over 400 of the CH-46 Sea Knights. The increased capacity, rear ramp configuration, and speed of the helicopter made it highly valuable as a utility-transport helicopter, but its size posed a significant vulnerability. Over a third of all Sea Knights were lost in Vietnam, with 109 brought down by hostile fire. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xuVXwklc20I Still in widespread Marine Corps use at the time, the CH-46 played an important at the end of the conflict in Vietnam in 1975. After fixed-wing evacuations were stymied by rocket and mortar fire, helicopters were used by Marines to evacuate American personnel and Vietnamese refugees to ships positioned in the South China Sea. In the desperate closing days before the fall of Saigon, more than 50,000 people fled the city by air. As the North Vietnamese gained more territory, the conditions of the evacuation became more dire. A raid on a South Vietnamese airport led to helicopters needing to fly out to the waiting fleet to refuel. As logistics became more complicated, chaos and confusion grew. During Operation Frequent Wind, 71 helicopters flew over 650 sorties between Saigon and elements of the Seventh Fleet off shore. The high operational tempo led to some accidents, with a CH-46 flown by Captain William Nystul and First Lieutenant Michael Shea crashing into the sea after a night mission, killing both men. The enlisted crew survived the accident, but the bodies of the two pilots were never found. Further complicating matters, South Vietnamese military pilots flew helicopters, as well as small aircraft out toward the American ships in hopes of reaching salvation. Famously, photographs captured chaotic moments aboard U.S. Navy carriers as sailors and Marines pushed Vietnamese helicopters overboard in frantic attempts to make room for incoming aircraft. Over 40 helicopters were pushed into the sea during the operation. Vietnamese UH-1 Pushed Overboard During Operation Frequent Wind , U.S. Marines in Japan Ultimately, the CH-46 played a pivotal role in saving the lives of more than 7,800 people in the helicopter airlift portion of the closing chapter of the Vietnam War. The CH-46 Sea Knight continued to be a mainstay of American airpower long after Vietnam. Speaking to Marine Corps Times in 2012, Marine Corps Colonel David Walsh, previous manager of the Corps’ CH-46 program at Naval Air Systems Command explained, “the CH-46 has really been the backbone of the Marine Corps medium-lift, assault-support fleet. They have participated in every engagement the Marine Corps has since they were introduced back in Vietnam.” Indeed, the CH-46 played a role in Grenada, Beirut, Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Iraq again, and, of course, Afghanistan. Over their service lives, most of the helicopters were upgraded from earlier variants into CH-46E models, which included the use of fiberglass rotor blades and reinforced airframes, among other improvements. Phrogs refueling at a FARP during the war in Iraq., USMC It is also important to note that the CH-46 was not exclusively a Marine Corps platform. H-46 variants were also flown by the Navy for utility-transport and search and rescue roles. Versions of the Sea Knight, and its commercial analog, the Boeing Vertol Model 107, were also flown by the nations of Japan, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, and Canada. A New Chapter In Afghanistan With The Department Of State An Air Wing CH-46E in Afghanistan, Dan Stern The Marine Corps ultimately scheduled the final sundown of the CH-46 fleet for 2016, as the service transitioned to the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor. However, 17 of its CH-46E helicopters got a new lease on life when they were transferred to the Department of State in 2012. The helicopters were assigned to the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, or INL. Despite the Bureau’s primary focus on counter-narcotics operations, its Office of Aviation, or INL/A, better known as the Air Wing, is responsible for conducting a wide array of missions in support of American diplomats and U.S. allies and partners around the world. The State Department maintains a significant inventory of aircraft, including fixed-wing planes, helicopters, and small drones, which are all contractor-operated and that you can read about here . In Afghanistan, as well as Iraq, the Air Wing has operated formalized charters services, collectively called Embassy Air. Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft tasked to support the Embassy Air mission in both countries have ferried personnel between the U.S. Embassies in Baghdad and Kabul and various other sites for years, among other duties, which you can read more about here . In Afghanistan, the CH-46Es became the primary Embassy Air platform, taking over for various models of Sikorsky S-61 and supplanting plans to acquire a fleet of modernized S-61T helicopters, a program that encountered significant difficulties . Since then, the Phrogs have proven themselves to be effective and reliable in State Department service. As part of the transfer of the helicopters from the Marines in the first place, the Sea Knights had undergone extensive overhauls. Colonel Walsh explained to Marine Corps Times at the time that “all the wires get taken out. They are really broken down to bare metal and components, and it is really reworked to almost new condition.” The DOS Phrogs were deeply reworked with their cabins looking almost brand new once they were delivered for operations in Afghanistan., USN The restoration of the helicopters presaged an extremely busy operational life in Afghanistan. For example, in Fiscal Year 2017 alone , the helicopters flew a total of 32,000 scheduled flights and 3,500 unspecified “special missions.” In recent years, the CH-46 has been the default way for the State Department to transport personnel between the U.S. Embassy and the airport, chiefly due to security concerns. The use of the expensive helicopters to transit a distance of a few miles has attracted controversy , particularly as the State Department relies on private contractors to operate the helicopters. One particularly high-profile mission was transporting former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a visit to Afghanistan. You can see a brief clip of his ride here, with a 7.62mm M240D machine gun prominently in view: In Afghanistan, one sign about security: @SecPompeo landed at Bagram, flew via small plane to State Dept facility at Kabul airport, went by helicopter to US embassy and drove in armored vehicle the few hundred yards to prez palace. He said Potus Afghan strategy is working. pic.twitter.com/hDF0Ik5KNM — Nick Wadhams (@nwadhams) July 9, 2018 While State Department Sea Knights sometimes fly without weaponry, all of them retain their ability to be armed with M240D machine guns for self-defense. Additionally, all of them have missile approach warning sensors and flare dispensers to mitigate the risk of heat-seeking man-portable shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. Another one of Embassy Air’s CH-46s, with the decoy flare dispensers visible under the forward fuselage and above the rear sponsons., US Army In recent months, the State Department has also begun operating ex-U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters in Afghanistan in addition to the CH-46s. Rapidly Evolving Circumstances As the world watches the rapidly unfolding events in Afghanistan, difficult questions swirl around the evacuation of both US personnel and civilians from the war-torn country. Though the circumstances today in Kabul are markedly different from Saigon in 1975, there is an undeniable deja-vu like quality to the operation, which marked a low-point in American foreign policy nearly half a century ago. Vietnam too was a war that was not won, with the U.S. leaving in distress after the sacrifice of much blood and treasure. Regardless, not only was the CH-46 once again involved in the evacuation operations, the last departure from the embassy in Kabul is believed to have been a CH-46: ""This is not Saigon""…just Kabul Disaster Last Departement of State's CH-46 leaving US Embassy pic.twitter.com/m1iLNlsgT4 — Harry Boone (@Harry_Boone) August 16, 2021 Nearly 50 years after Saigon fell to the advancing North Vietnamese military, the aging Phrog is still providing support for the same vital mission: close out one of America’s long misadventures in a foreign land and convey as many Americans and allies to safety as possible. Remarkably, the same type of helicopter, and perhaps even some of the same aircraft, are creating new iconic images of an American retreat. A CH-46 evacuates personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon., Public Domain Given the geography of Afghanistan and the very precarious security situation in Kabul, it remains unclear how the helicopters themselves will ultimately depart the country, or if they will at all. Unlike in Vietnam, there is no nearby fleet within close range waiting to receive them. As such, there will need to be enough spare airlift capacity and time to remove them, or they will need to be flown out of the country by making dangerous fuel stops on the ground. The alternative would be that they would be demolished in place. Like so many Americans and friends who helped the U.S. during the two-decade-long war in Afghanistan, hopefully, the Phrogs will make it out alive. At this point, some of them could be remarkable artifacts of two historic wars, albeit both of which are ones that Americans would like to forget.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 23, 2021",RC-135W Rivet Joint Spy Plane Is Flying Orbits Over Kabul (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Online flight tracking software showed that a U.S. Air Force RC-135W Rivet Joint , an airliner-sized intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, was orbiting around Kabul today as the United States and other countries continue to conduct evacuation operations from Hamid Karzai International Airport. Pictures have also emerged indicating that helicopters belonging to the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) are also now on the ground at the airport. This all comes as the planned size and scope of the American evacuation mission continues to grow with the announcement today of new plans to send a command and control element from the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division to help oversee operations at the airport . You can get more information about the overall situation in Afghanistan’s capital, where the Taliban are continuing to consolidating their control, in The War Zone ‘s previous coverage of the crisis here . The RC-135W, serial number 62-4138, using the callsign Python 52, was tracked leaving Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in the Persian Gulf earlier today. The jet then flew out over the North Arabian Sea, before turning north toward Afghanistan via Pakistan. This is a routine route for American military aircraft flying from the Persian Gulf to Afghanistan. The aircraft is no longer visible using online flight tracking software, but it is not clear if it has returned to base. Regardless, the Rivet Joint’s presence in the skies around Kabul, where the risks to the high-flying aircraft would be virtually non-existent, makes good sense. These aircraft are extremely powerful electronic and signals intelligence -gathering platforms. They are regularly used to scoop information about the type and location of various signal emitters, such as radars, to help in the construction of an “ electronic order of battle ” detailing the air defense, command and control, and other capabilities of an adversary or potential adversary. The Taliban, of course, lack any significant air defense capabilities and have limited command and control infrastructure. However, an RC-135W is also able to intercept and monitor communications chatter across a broad area, and also has the capability to relay important developments directly to friendly forces on the ground. A typical Rivet Joint crew will include a number of Crypto Linguists fluent in relevant languages, such as Pashto or Dari in the context of Afghanistan, so that they can immediately begin to analyze whatever transmissions the plane’s sensors pick up. You can read more about the overall capabilities of the Air Force’s Rivet Joints, and how they typically conduct operations, here . An official US Air Force graphic describing the different members of a typical Rivet Joint crew and their responsibilities., USAF Right now, the Taliban’s leadership has, at least publicly, said it will not interfere with the ongoing foreign evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport. The group has, at least in some cases, gone so far as to help foreigners make it to the airport. At the same time, Taliban members are reportedly blocking Afghans from doing the same. At the same time, U.S. military activities at the airport, as well as those of other foreign military forces, are entirely at the whim of the Taliban, which is still getting situated in the capital. On top of that, it is not clear how much direct control the group’s leaders necessarily have over all of their members now operating across Kabul. There have been persistent reports of gunfire around the airport, some of which may be aimed at military personnel inside or evacuation flights landing or departing. Just yesterday, the Pentagon confirmed that American troops had shot and killed two armed individuals, but could not say whether or not they were members of the Taliban. A Rivet Joint circling overhead would be a powerful platform for checking to see if what the Taliban’s leadership is saying publicly matches up with what its forces on the ground in Kabul are saying amongst themselves. At the same time, the intelligence analysts onboard could be gleaning additional useful details just about the group’s command and control capabilities, and potential vulnerabilities there might be that could be exploited, if necessary. Having the aircraft on station would provide a measure of early warning if the group’s general attitude to the expanding foreign military presence at the airport begins to shift in a dangerous direction, as well. Sending the Rivet Joint over Afghanistan with its transponder on, allowing it to be tracked publicly online, could also help send the message to the Taliban that the U.S. military is listening very closely for any such signs of an impending attack. This would not be the first time the U.S. military has employed a Rivet Joint in such a manner, either. One of these aircraft was on station during the release of U.S. Navy sailors from Iran in 2016, specifically to help double-check that the regime in Tehran was following through with their end of the deal. You can read more about that operation here . At the same time, the U.S. military’s presence at the airport continues to grow. The Washington Post’s Dan Lamothe reported that a headquarters element from the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division will now be headed to Kabul to help “improve coordination and oversight of the airfield itself” since the unit “often trains in seizing and holding airfields in tense circumstances.” This deployment is on top of existing plans to establish a total force of at least 6,000 Army soldiers and Marines at Hamid Karzai International Airport. Absolute chaos at the airport yesterday, as large groups of Afghans trying to flee the country by air, possibly numbering the thousands, breached a security perimeter established around the flightline, hampering the arrival of some elements of that force. The facility, at least the parts the U.S. military and other foreign forces are operating out of, now appears to be largely secure. Interestingly, what appears to be MH-60 Black Hawk , MH-47G Chinook , and AH/MH-6 Little Bird helicopters from the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) can be seen in the background of pictures, available here and seen in the Tweet below, that have emerged ostensibly of Turkish troops who are now helping to secure the airport. Those helicopters were not visible in pictures of the flightline over the weekend, which did show various other U.S. military aircraft on the ground. It is possible that the 160th SOAR brought in these helicopters as part of the expanding evacuation mission or that they flew in from elsewhere in Afghanistan as the U.S. military consolidated its forces in Kabul in the face of the Taliban’s lightning gains last week that led up to the fall of the capital on Sunday. These helicopters could be very useful for supporting the ongoing evacuation operations, especially in the latter stages of the mission. The MH-60s and MH-47Gs are both capable of refueling in flight, unlike the standard Army AH-64 Apaches, CH-47 Chinooks, and UH-60 Black Hawks, or the State Department’s CH-46 Sea Knights and UH-60 Black Hawks , which are also in Kabul. The AH/MH-6 Little Birds are not capable of refueling in flight, but can be fitted with range-extending fuel tanks and are specifically designed to be loaded on and off larger transport aircraft relatively rapidly. This could help these helicopters get out of Afghanistan in the end. Members of the Army 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment unload an AH-6 Little Bird from a US Air Force MC-130 special operations transport aircraft. It takes relatively little effort to get the helicopter into a flyable state from the state it is seen in here, with its rotor blades folded and weapon planks in their stowed configuration., DOD As The War Zone has already reported , a number of modified KC-135RT “receiver tankers,” which are piloted by specialized crews trained to fly very low and operate in blacked-out conditions at night, are also supporting the evacuation operations. You can read more about the Air Force’s very small and shadowy fleet of KC-135RTs here . Unlike standard KC-135Rs, the KC-135RTs, which are primarily tasked with supporting special operations forces, can also refuel in flight. With that capability, they are often used to help create a “stack,” serving as conduits for transferring gas from regular tankers to various other platforms, especially U.S. Air Force MC-130 special operations transport/tankers . Those aircraft can then pass that fuel to helicopters, as well as Osprey tilt-rotors . Air Force HC-130 Combat King rescue aircraft , some of which have been seen in Kabul, as well, are also able to serve as tankers for helicopters and Ospreys. Escape from the country is something that is necessarily guaranteed for the other U.S. military and State Department aircraft in Kabul. It remains unclear how Hamid Karzai International Airport will be able to sustain the continuing influx of thousands of American troops and what the plan is for extracting those forces, as well as their vehicles, weapons, and other materiel, at the end of the operation. Providing cover for those final moments of the evacuation could be complicated, as well. Flight tracking software does indicate that Air Force AC-130 gunships and B-52 bombers continue to fly sorties to Afghanistan from the Persian Gulf , but there have been no confirmed airstrikes in days. A single report from Pajhwok Afghan News did emerge of a purported strike in Kabul earlier today, but there has been no subsequent corroborating information. U.S. Central Command’s main public affairs office told The War Zone that there have been no American strikes of any kind in or around Kabul today. All of those questions also apply to the activities of other foreign forces at the airport in Kabul, who may well be increasingly jockeying just for physical space on the ramp as time goes on. A number of non-U.S. military contingents are on the ground now, as well, including the aforementioned Turkish security force, to which a group of Azerbaijani troops is attached. The U.S. government had been negotiating with Turkey about providing security at the airport following the final withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, but there had been reports of that specific plan being scrapped now that the Taliban have seized control of the country. How long the Turkish and Azerbaijani troops ultimately stay on the ground remains to be seen. All of this, of course, as already noted, hinges on the Taliban’s continued acquiescence to foreign military activity of any kind at the airport. There’s no guarantee that the group’s position will remain unchanged day-to-day, let alone over the next few weeks that the U.S. government says it will take to get its employees, other American and third-party nationals, and certain Afghans out of the country safely. The Pentagon said yesterday that it was still days away, at best, from reaching its goal of having the capacity to help up to 5,000 people evacuate every daily. Overnight, nine Air Force C-17As arrived in Kabul carrying around 1,000 troops and their equipment, and then left with between 700 and 800 evacuees, in total, aboard, underscoring the sheer volume of aircraft will be necessary to reach the U.S. military’s desired tempo of operations. It remains murky exactly what categories of Afghans the U.S. military will ultimately help flee the country. Individuals who are eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) due to their work with the U.S. government, which has now put them at risk of reprisals from the Taliban, are the clearest cut group, but even then it is not entirely clear how many will come to the United States and how many might end up in other countries, at least temporarily. The Pentagon has said it is prepared to receive up to 22,000 Afghans at facilities in the United States for processing, but American officials have also been working to secure passage of thousands more to other nations . The increasing desperation of average Afghans at the airport remains palpable , as well, which can only present a continued risk that groups may again try to get onto the flightline and force their way onto evacuation flights. The willingness of some of these civilians to take extreme measures to try to leave the country has already been on full display, with terrifying videos having previously emerged showing Afghans trying to grab onto an Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft as it took off. Some held on after the plane got airborne and then appeared to fall their deaths. New reporting today indicates that at least one Afghan also got trapped in the aircraft’s right wheel well and died. A video that appears to show that individual’s body stuck in the aircraft, which is extremely graphic, has emerged online and can be found here . Yesterday, Ajmal Ahmady, the now-former Governor of Afghanistan’s central Da Afghanistan Bank wrote on Twitter that his colleagues had helped literally push him onto a military plane leaving Kabul on Sunday after his commercial flight was canceled. Ahmady added that one of his contacts still in Afghanistan had told him that the Taliban were now looking for him. Fears for the safety of various former military and other government officials, among others, are also growing as Taliban members are reportedly going house-to-house looking for specific individuals, such as Ahmady. There had previously been discussions about the potential risks of the Taliban seizing the Da Afghanistan Bank, which reported last year that it had over $9 billion in Gross Foreign Exchange Reserves. The U.S. government has now frozen Afghan government funds held in American banks, which could increase tensions between American officials and the Taliban. All told, the situation in Afghanistan, as a whole, remains very fluid and new developments, including with regards to ongoing evacuation operations at the airport, could easily come quickly and without warning. As we’ve said, this is very likely one of the reasons why an Air Force RC-135W Rivet Joint is now flying overhead. We will update this story as the situation continues to develop. Update 2:30 PM EST: The U.S. government has confirmed that it is actively engaging with the Taliban to ensure that evacuation operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport continue unhampered, and that American nationals and other evacuees can make it there safely. There are also ongoing discussions, including with the Taliban, and the expected duration of the mission and whether it might extend beyond the current planned end date of Aug. 31. Biden’s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has also echoed recent comments from other U.S. government officials, including Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby , that American authorities had planned for all contingencies surrounding potential evacuations from Afghanistan, but that the rapidity of the collapse of Afghanistan government and its security forces had not been expected. Sullivan also said that President Joe Biden had not spoken with any foreign leaders since Kabul fell on Sunday, which seems very curious given the scramble by other countries to conduct their own evacuation operations. Sullivan also offered new details about the current capacity of the U.S. military to help individuals evacuate from Afghanistan, saying that approximately 300 people are expected to leave the country on each outgoing cargo plane. The hope, of course, is still that this figure will increase substantially in the coming days. Update 3:20 PM EST: U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), visited Hamid Karzai International Airport today to evaluate ongoing operations there first hand. In a statement, he reiterated that the U.S. military has conveyed to the Taliban that any inference with the evacuations will “be met with overwhelming force in the defense of our forces.” McKenzie also said that the airport is currently “open to civilian air traffic operation under visual flight rules.” U.S. officials have also now said that as many as 11,000 American nationals may still be in Afghanistan, along with an equal number of foreign diplomatic personnel and other third-country nationals, all of who could need help evacuating. Between 4,000 and 6,000 Afghan civilians also remain at the airport in Kabul and are reportedly refusing to leave except on a plane out of the country. Update 3:55 PM EST: The U.S. Air Force has confirmed to Politico that it has opened a formal investigation into the incident involving the Afghans who jumped onto the outside of the C-17A at the airport in Kabul and the reported resulting fatalities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 27, 2021",Situation At Kabul Airport “Would Have Been Difficult For Anyone To Predict” Says Pentagon Spokesman (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby has insisted that the U.S. military was prepared for noncombatant evacuation operations out of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, but that “the Images…would have been difficult for anybody to predict.” A flood of disturbing videos and pictures has emerged in the past 24 hours of the utterly chaotic situation at the airport in Afghanistan’s capital. You can get fully up to speed on this still fast-moving situation in The War Zone ‘s previous reporting here . Kirby’s comments about preparedness, which are highly debatable considering the reality on the ground leading up to the crisis at the airport, followed his announcement that Hamid Karzai International Airport had finally opened again for evacuation flights after mobs of Afghan civilians desperately trying to get out of the country had stormed the flightline and runway earlier in the day. Some individuals even grabbed onto the outside of a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster as it was taking off, and then appeared to fall to their deaths. While the airport is supposedly open, according to the Pentagon, very few flights have come and gone since the announcement was made. Kirby made all of his remarks at a press conference alongside Gary Reed, head of the Pentagon’s Afghanistan Crisis Action Group, and U.S. Army Major General Hank Taylor, the Director of Current Operations within the Office of the Joint Staff. This came after President Joe Biden had addressed the nation to defend his decision earlier this year to continue with the total withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan. How that drawdown has been carried out directly contributed to the Taliban’s rapid conquest of the vast majority of the country, culminating in the group’s almost total takeover of Kabul yesterday. There has been mounting criticism about the Biden administration’s handling of the entire debacle, including from members of Congress from the President’s own Democratic Party . “I would take issue with your designation of this operation at the airport as a failure,” Kirby said in response to questions from CNN reporter Barbara Starr. “Yes, we do plan for all manner of contingencies. This is a planning organization. We do that specifically to try to mitigate risk and to try to be ready for unforeseen circumstances, but it is not a perfect process. Plans are not always perfectly predictive.” Kirby highlighted how there had been no major Taliban attacks on the airport. He could not say whether or not two Afghans who had been shot and killed there earlier today by American troops were Taliban members. It was confirmed that one U.S. service member did suffer “superficial” wounds during the incident, but was immediately returned to duty. The Pentagon’s Press Secretary had no further details about any other reported Afghan casualties. Still, “as is a well-known military maxim that plans don’t often survive first contact and you have to adjust in real-time,” he continued, insisting that the Taliban’s rapid progress toward Kabul was something that would have been difficult for anyone to predict. “We did plan on noncombatant evacuation operations.” “As far back as May, there were drills being done here at the Pentagon to walk through what different noncombatant evacuation operations might look like,” he added. “There was another one recently done just two weeks ago, a tabletop exercise to again examine what a noncombatant evacuation would look like out of Hamid Karzai International Airport, specifically at the airport.” You can watch today’s Pentagon press briefing on the situation in Afghanistan in full below. It is important to note that the security situation in Afghanistan by the end of July was significantly different than it had been in May, which could only have impacted the utility of any earlier contingency planning. A few weeks ago, the Afghan government also still appeared to be holding the Taliban at bay, at least to a degree , but there had been increasing questions about the capacity and willingness of forces aligned with the government in Kabul to keep fighting well before then. Perhaps most importantly, the handing over of major U.S. bases, such as Bagram Airfield near Kabul, to the Afghan government in recent months, has only put further constraints on any plans for a major evacuation operation. As it stands now, the airport in Kabul is the only realistic option available to the U.S. military and other foreign powers for airlifting people out without having to attempt far more austere operations that present major challenges of their own. “We think that those exercises did prepare us in terms of having the resources forward,” Kirby also insisted, referring to the prepositioning of Marines closer to Afghanistan before Kabul fell. “It would be wrong to conclude that the United States military did not view, as a distinct possibility, that the Taliban could overrun the country, including Kabul,” he said, adding the caveat that the speed with which Afghan forces collapsed was unforeseen. Whatever planning did occur, the chaos that has since enveloped the airport has only continued to hamper its implementation. Kirby spoke of the continuing plan to deploy thousands of additional U.S. troops – the total expected force size still appears to be approximately 6,000 personnel, despite reports earlier than it had grown to 7,000 – to Hamid Karzai International Airport to assist with the ongoing evacuations, with the goal still being for American forces to eventually be able to airlift up to 5,000 people out of the country every day. Kirby said that U.S. diplomatic staff, as well as other American nationals, and certain “Afghans we can help” were expected to be put on those flights. However, the bulk of those forces have yet to deploy, and the arrival of at least some contingents was delayed by the halt to all flight operations earlier today. At the same time, plans to have a Turkish force deploy to help provide general security at Hamid Karzai International Airport, an expected component of the overall U.S. military withdrawal plan prior to the fall of Kabul, have reportedly been dropped . Regardless, it also continues to remain unclear how the airport will be able to accommodate all of the foreign military personnel heading to Kabul, which also includes forces from other countries that are now inbound to help their nationals evacuate, or the expected tempo of U.S. military flight operations. Fuel reserves at the airport are of particular concern as well as other basic aviation services. Getting U.S. forces out at the end of the evacuation operation is also a very pressing concern in light of recent developments Beyond that, neither Kirby nor Major General Taylor nor Mr. Reed could provide a firm number of how many people, in total, the U.S. military has flown out so far. Just getting to the airport could be a challenge. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, which is now operating in a dramatically reduced fashion from the airport, issued a travel notice earlier today warning American citizens to shelter in place until they receive further instructions about flights out of the country. More than 700 Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) due to past work with the U.S. government that has now made them vulnerable to Taliban reprisals have departed in the past 48 hours, according to Taylor, who added that this brought the total number of SIV applicants evacuated to almost 2,000. The U.S. military, however, is presently making arrangements for tens of thousands of such individuals to come to the United States or otherwise leave Afghanistan, which will be a major undertaking. When it comes to SIV applicants, another reporter also noted at the press conference that Mr. Reed’s Afghanistan Crisis Action Group, which is helping with that process, was only established in July, despite President Biden announcing the withdrawal timeline back in April. Reed said that the Pentagon could not act until it had gotten a specific request for help from the U.S. State Department, which is in charge of the SIVs. When the entire evacuation operation, which is still, at best, days away from reaching the peak airlift capacity, might wrap up is also unclear. In addition to evacuees, the thousands of American troops now pouring into the country, along with their helicopters, vehicles, weapons, and other materiel, will also need to be redeployed at the end of the mission. All of this applies equally to other foreign forces and whoever they plan to extract from Afghanistan. Kirby declined to speculate on what might happen after Aug. 31, which is just a couple of weeks away and is the current expected end date for the mission, if there are still people trying to get out of Afghanistan. The U.S. government also still does not appear to have any specific plans to aid the rest of the Afghans who have made their way to Hamid Karzai International Airport and are increasingly desperate to flee the country’s new Taliban leadership. Maybe the biggest wild card in all of this is the Taliban, who have so far acquiesced to the ongoing foreign military operations at the airport in Kabul, so long as all of the troops there ultimately leave. How they might react as these evacuation operations continue to drag out, and as more foreign troops flood into the airport, is yet to be seen. The group could decide at any time that American and other foreign forces will no longer be tolerated in the country. Any sort of chance occurrence, like the death of Afghan civilians or Americans, could splinter the crisis into a new direction, as well. All told, no matter how prepared the U.S. military was or wasn’t to conduct major evacuation operations in Afghanistan, or is or isn’t now, it’s uncertain whether its current plans will survive the next few days, let alone until the end of the month. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update 8/17/2021: Imagery of the arrival of other foreign security forces in Kabul has begun to emerge as evacuation operations continue. A contingent of troops from Azerbaijan is now at the airport and say they are attached to a larger Turkish force that is now providing security there. Despite earlier reports that plans for Turkey to deploy troops to guard Hamid Karzai International Airport had been scrapped, Ankara has at least sent some personnel for this purpose. Whether they continue with this mission after the U.S. military pulls out the last of its forces, as had been planned, remains to be seen given the Taliban takeover. A new video that appears to have been taken by an Afghan clinging to the side of a departing U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport has also emerged online. There is no way to immediately confirm whether or not this shows a first-person perspective of a now-infamous incident wherein some Afghan civilians held onto a C-17A as it took off, with some then appearing to subsequently fall off to their deaths, or if those horrifying circumstances may have repeated themselves.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 20, 2021",800 People Evacuated From Kabul Aboard A Single C-17 Cargo Jet (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the situation continues to deteriorate in Afghanistan, with even Kabul’s international airport, the last hope for U.S. and other foreigners trying to leave the country, being at least partially overrun, we are now hearing that the U.S. Air Force packed one C-17 cargo jet with roughly 800 people and flew them to safety. If these reports, as well as recorded audio, prove to be accurate, it could be a record for an aircraft that serves as the backbone of the Air Force’s jet transport fleet. For full context, make sure to read our latest update on the situation in Kabul which is linked here. RCH (Reach) 871, a C-17A from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, took off from Kabul just a few hours ago. This was likely during the same period when the airport’s civilian ramp areas were being stormed by Afghans seeking salvation from the Taliban’s impending rule. Understanding the worsening situation, the aircraft’s crew apparently packed what they thought to be around 800 people into the jet’s main cargo bay and headed for the safety of Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. A C-17’s cargo hold is seen configured for paratrooper operations, which usually include less than 150 soldiers. You can get an idea of just how dense 800 people would be in the C-17’s cargo hold., USAF Our friend Evergreen Intel was reporting this information in near real-time and new intercepted audio that has surfaced, which you can hear here , seems to confirm the reports.Â Update: can confirm this is the correct number expected to be aboard… 800 souls outbound USAF C-17A RCH871 from Kabul, Afghanistan! Thank you to @geoff_mcmaw for providing me with the information! Thank you also to the crew of C-17A 01-0186 for their amazing work! https://t.co/fhMxt0iSiJ — Evergreen Intel (@vcdgf555) August 15, 2021 As you can tell, the person talking to the flight, likely via satellite radio communications, is as stunned as we were when he heard the passenger load number. He asks “Ok, how many people do you think are on your jet?” Then after getting a reply from RCH 871 he responds “800 people on your jet?! Holy… Holy cow… Ok…” According to Boeing, a C-17’s passenger carrying capacity is officially “80 on 8 pallets, plus 54 passengers on sidewall seats.” So, if this 800 number proves true, you can get an idea of just how jammed-packed the aircraft must have been. We know that C-17s can move far more people than their official capacity during an emergency, as was the case after a Typhoon hit the Philippines in 2013. One photo published by the USAF showed a Hawaii-based C-17 carrying a reported 670 people to safety: More than 670 Tacloban residents sit on board a C-17 Globemaster III before being evacuated to Manila following Super Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines Nov. 17, 2013. , U.S. Air Force Photo/Staff Sgt. Ramon Brockington This is unlikely to have been the only super-packed U.S. flight that has or will leave Kabul. We also know that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) packed one of their C-17s with people before this flight in an attempt to get them out before the Taliban sacked Kabul: Scenes from #Kabul Airport, #Afghanistan showing people boarding what appears to a C17 (please correct me if wrong) and what appears to be gunfire in the air in the distance. pic.twitter.com/p3l7zrVu77 — Aurora Intel (@AuroraIntel) August 15, 2021 A tanker bridge has also been created that is refueling heavily laden USAF transport flights as they move from Afghanistan to safer locales in the Middle East.

In the meantime, this serves as yet another reminder of how the C-17 and its dedicated crews continue to make the impossible possible when called upon to do so.Â UPDATE: Our friends over at DefenseOne.com , Marcus Weisgerber and Tara Copp, have some new reporting on RCH 871. They say the aircraft was swarmed by Afghans that were cleared to leave and instead of trying to kick them off and prolong their stay, the aircrew decided to go. The article states: The C-17, using the call sign Reach 871, was not intending to take on such a large load, but panicked Afghans who had been cleared to evacuate pulled themselves onto the C-17â€™s half-open ramp, a video posted late Sunday showed. Instead of trying to force those refugees off the aircraft, â€œthe crew made the decision to go,â€ a defense official told Defense One .  â€œApproximately 640 Afghan civilians disembarked the aircraft when it arrived at its destination,â€ one defense official said. So a couple of things here, first the stated load is 160 people shy of 800, but that is still an incredible human airlift feat. If the official is describing the same flight in question, the tense situation clearly resulted in the crew not knowing exactly how many people were even on their jet. One part of this story doesn’t check out though, at least to our understanding. The video mentioned shows a UAE C-17, not a USAF one, that arrived before RCH 871. So that cannot be RCH 871.Â C-17 at Kabul airport half an hour ago (via @SnapMap ) pic.twitter.com/aZgFBCM414 — Samir (@obretix) August 15, 2021 Regardless, there are likely multiple flights that were far more heavily laden with evacuees than planned departing Kabul International during the last 24 hours or so.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 17, 2021","U.S. Troops Kill Two Armed Afghans At Unsecured Kabul Airport, Thousands More Being Sent (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. troops at Hamid Karzai International Airport shot and killed two armed individuals in self-defense earlier today, according to the Pentagon. This follows reports that the American forces had determined the facility and its flightline were not secure, and shut down all operations there, including military evacuation flights, after throngs of Afghan civilians breached the perimeter. You can read more about the chaos that’s been unfolding at the airport as many Afghans continue to hope to escape the country, and its new Taliban rulers, by air in The War Zone ‘s earlier coverage of this worsening crisis here . The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times were among those to first report the fatal shootings at the airport in Kabul, which has been transformed into an island of foreign military presence in a country now almost entirely under Taliban control, with U.S. forces now attempting to secure at least their operating areas and the runway. It’s unclear at present who these armed individuals were and, while they could have been members of the Taliban, it’s equally possible that they were Afghan civilians hoping to somehow muscle their way onto a flight out of Afghanistan. Multiple reports in the past day or so have said that U.S. military officials have been engaging directly with Taliban representatives in and outside of Afghanistan about the situation, and warning them against interfering in any way with their activities at the airport. There have also been reports of persistent gunfire outside of the airport, including Taliban members taking potshots at departing aircraft. As The War Zone , among others, has already reported , Afghans at Hamid Karzai International Airport have been showing signs of increasing desperation, with horrifying scenes having already emerged, including of people clinging to the outside of U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane as it took off and then falling to the ground, likely to their deaths. There were previous unconfirmed reports that as many as five other people may have died on the ground, as well, under unclear circumstances. All of this had led the U.S. military to conclude that the airport was no longer secure enough to continue even military evacuation operations earlier today. It’s not clear if this assessment may have changed in the intervening time. Military forces from other countries have at least been working to stage closer to Afghanistan as part of efforts to help their own nationals and others evacuate the country. The present status of commercial aviation activities at Hamid Karzai International Airport is also unclear. A Turkish Airlines Boeing 777, flight TK707, did manage to leave earlier in the day before the latest closure. The Pentagon denied yesterday that it had completely closed the airport to all current and future commercial flights, as had been implied from earlier reporting , but did acknowledge sporadic stoppages. The situation has changed dramatically for the worse since then, obviously. Earlier today, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a warning notice regarding the airspace over Kabul and surrounding areas, declaring them to be “uncontrolled.” It also noted that all air traffic control responsibilities had been passed to the U.S. military, something the Pentagon had previously announced, but it isn’t clear how or even if the U.S. military is dealing with the commercial flights. At the time of writing, the U.S. government’s basic operational plan for the ongoing evacuations appears to be mostly unchanged, though the expectation now is that the American force at Hamid Karzai International Airport will swell to 7,000 personnel in the coming days. This reflects the announcement just today of the planned deployment of yet another 1,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division to Kabul. This force will, hopefully, then be able to help facilitate the movement of up to 5,000 people out of the country every day. At the same time, it’s unclear how the airport will be able to receive more U.S. personnel and how they will safely depart once the mission is done. Who those evacuees will necessarily be is less clear. The U.S. government has consistently said it working to its employees, as well as third-party diplomatic staff, out of the country. Regular American citizens in Afghanistan are still being advised to shelter in place, rather than attempt to make their way to the airport. American authorities are also now looking at potentially airlifting tens of thousands of Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV), due to past work with the U.S. government that has put them at risk of reprisals from the Taliban, to the United States. However, reports yesterday said that, at least for the time being, that flights of SIV candidates out of Afghanistan had been effectively suspended to focus first on getting Americans onto evacuation flights. In the meantime, there are reports that Taliban members are going door to door in Kabul looking for government officials, among others, adding to concerns about what the future might hold for many Afghans under the group’s hardline rule. Those fears are not limited to Afghans in the country’s capital, either, nor is the accompanying sense of desperation. The government of neighboring Uzbekistan has confirmed that its air defense forces had shot down an Afghan Air Force A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft that crossed into its airspace. The pilots were both able to eject, but their fate is now uncertain, with the U.S. government reportedly trying to help secure their safety and prevent their potential deportation back to Afghanistan. Earlier this year, a report emerged the Taliban had stepped up an assassination campaign targeting Afghan Air Force pilots and it is very likely these two individuals were trying to flee the country in their plane. Online flight tracking software had also shown what appeared to be similar flights out of Afghanistan into Tajiistaken yesterday, where they appeared to be denied permission to land. Back in Kabul, whatever the U.S. government’s current evacuations plan might be, the crisis at Hamid Karzai International Airport is seriously deepening. The ability of American troops to maintain a secure perimeter is already clearly in question and any debris left from mobs of civilians on the runway could severely flight operations. There are also growing questions about exactly how the thousands of incoming troops, and their materiel, to include the helicopters that have supported the evacuation operations in Kabul, will ultimately be extracted after all is said and done. In addition, the ability of foreign military forces to conduct activities without the threat of a more concerted attack continues to be entirely at the whim of the Taliban, a terrible position to be in on all levels. How firm the group’s command and control is over its members in Kabul is unclear, as well, no matter what deals have been struck about the status of the airport. Desperate Afghan civilians who may be increasingly driven to violence themselves only add more risks for an already tense situation to become even more disastrous than it is right now. Members of the Taliban on top of a captured US-supplied Humvee at a position outside of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul With all this in mind, whoever the armed individuals who reportedly attacked American troops were, the incident is another worrying indication of where things may now be headed in this deepening crisis. We will continue to update this page as new information comes available. Update 2:00 PM EST: Satellite imagery showing the chaos today at Hamid Karzai International Airport has begun to emerge. A new Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) has also appeared warning any aircraft bound for Kabul to make sure to have as much fuel as possible due to concerns that available stocks at Hamid Karzai International Airport may be running low. This highlights the very real and increasingly likely possibility that U.S. forces will need to airlift in additional fuel, a very costly proposition , in the coming days to sustain the ongoing evacuation operations. There are now also reports that at least 46 Afghan Air Force aircraft, including fixed-wing types and helicopters, have been forced to land in Uzbekistan. If true, this would reflect roughly a quarter of that service’s flyable aircraft, as of July. However, it is important to note that, just in the past few weeks, reports had already begun to emerge the number of usable aircraft available to Afghan forces had shrunk considerably due to various issues , including a lack of trained maintainers. Pictures and video from the Taliban’s advances across the country had shown the group’s members capturing a number of clearly non-flyable airframes . Separately, the Pentagon has confirmed that it has not carried out any airstrikes in Afghanistan for several days and that the U.S. military’s primary focus now is on the evacuation operations at the airport in Kabul. Images have also been circulating on social media suggesting that one of the U.S. military’s top-secret stealthy Black Hawk helicopters might be involved in the evacuation operations in Kabul. However, the complete video from which the still frames in question were taken makes clear that the aircraft in question is a typical Army UH-60. Multiple regular Black Hawks were observed flying around Kabul yesterday as evacuations began. Update 3:10 PM EST: Al Jazeera is reporting that the Taliban have been blocking people in Kabul from entering Hamid Karzai International Airport, in some cases firing warning shots into the air. This could account for some of the gunfire heard within the airport. That same outlet has also reported that three German military aircraft carrying the country’s own evacuation force have had to divert to Uzbekistan due to ongoing issues at the airport in Kabul. A Turkish A400M airlifter also appears to have diverted to Pakistan after attempting to land. Update 3:55 PM EST: A picture has emerged of the inside of a jam-packed C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft. While the circumstances behind the photograph, and when and where it was taken, are unclear, the suggestion is that this is one of the recent evacuation flights out of Kabul. Though there are a very large number of people on board, it’s not clear if this is from the reported U.S. Air Force flight with 800 evacuees on board. It may also be of a heavily laden C-17A belonging to the United Arab Emirates that left Afghanistan’s capital yesterday. You can read more about both of those flights in The War Zone previous reporting here .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Any security perimeter or containment measures aimed at keeping U.S. aircraft and personnel safe at Kabul International appear to have failed. As thousands of Afghans flocked to the airport in a desperate attempt to escape the Taliban, they have now taken to the runway, in effect shutting down the evacuation operation. Make sure to review our rolling coverage on the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan here to get up to speed. All further updates will be made on this post. Video coming out of Kabul via Sowaibah Henifie shows huge crowds of Afghans swarming a C-17 that is taxiing while an Apache gunship flying just feet above the ground tries to push them away from the moving airlifter. These are clearly desperate measures. This all is happening as the Taliban are now flooding Kabul and setting up checkpoints around the airport. Gunfire is said to be near-constant around the airport’s grounds. We could be looking at an unprecedented crisis here, one that was far from unforeseeable. We will continue to update this page as new information comes available. Update 1:22 AM PST: It appears that Kabul is now uncontrolled. We don’t know exactly what this means for the evacuation operation, but this would mean that all commercial flights are on their own even if combat controllers are still controlling U.S. military aircraft. We don’t even know if that is the case. A larger question is also emerging—with Apaches, Chinooks, State Department helicopters, and other rotary-wing assets still operating out of the airport, how will they be airlifted out? That may be impossible considering the rapidly degrading security situation. We have seen HH-60 Pave Hawks at Kabul, as well, but they have in-flight refueling capability. One would imagine that they would be destroyed in place if there is no time or infrastructure for an airlift and if Pakistan is unwilling to host them and provide security for them and their crews. Very unfortunate situation. More importantly, we have no idea how many Americans or other people that are on the U.S. evacuation list are still left in Afghanistan at this time. Force protection components will still need to be removed, as well, which is the most dangerous evolution of all in these types of situations as they are the last to go. Update 1:40 AM PST: We cannot authenticate this video, but it appears to show two things falling from the wheel well of a C-17. Likely people who had hung onto a C-17 during takeoff and fell to their death: Update 1:55 AM PST: Another view of the Apache runway clearing operations: As suspected, this likely explains what we are seeing falling from the departing C-17: The runways are also now FOD’d, making movements dangerous on them by jet aircraft, and especially airliners. The question of how the final U.S. forces will exist is becoming more of a concern. The best option would be pulling them out via runway-independent aircraft like helicopters and V-22s, but there is unlikely to be anywhere near the capacity needed to do so. Update 2:45 AM PST: You can expand and read this tweet thread for my thoughts on the growing challenges of pulling the final security forces out: Another video has surfaced showing people clinging to a C-17. This is so dangerous for those around the jet and those onboard. Amazing seeing these videos in a terrifying way. Update 3:01 AM PST: Another video showing people falling from the C-17 on departure.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has emerged that appears to show U.S. troops at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul shooting into the air as they try to keep civilians off the flightline. Throngs of Afghans trying to flee the country are presently stranded at the airport, which is currently being run entirely by the U.S. military and has been closed to commercial aircraft. The airport has become an island of foreign control within the Afghan capital, which is otherwise all but entirely under de facto control of the Taliban. You can read more about the Taliban’s advance into the city and the U.S. and other foreign evacuation operations that have been going on all day in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting on the still-developing crisis here . The video clip in question, seen in the tweet following the satellite image below, was reportedly shot at Hamid Karzai International Airport earlier this evening. It is taken from the perspective of a crowd of Afghans. Right at the beginning, a burst of automatic weapon fire is heard, followed by what sounds like American troops shouting “get back” in English. It can be extremely dangerous to have people milling about like this on or along active aircraft movement areas, which can force aircraft to abort movements, damage aircraft, or worse. A satellite image of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 15, 2021., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Other video clips, as well as pictures, had already emerged earlier that showed large amounts of civilians milling about on the airport grounds, underscoring the increasing desperation among those trying to escape ahead of the Taliban’s imminent takeover. “The DOD has halted all incoming and outgoing flights on the civilian side of the airport,” an Afghan official told The Daily Beast about the frustrations felt by many of these individuals. “Women, children, and government workers with visas cannot get out of the country because the U.S. is blocking them.” Those frustrations, and the tensions that go with them, could easily grow as the U.S. military continues to try to help primarily U.S. diplomatic staff evacuate the country. Reports indicate that at least 500, and possibly more, U.S. government personnel have flown out on American military aircraft, as well as those belonging to the U.S. State Department, so far. The plan is still for U.S. military forces to eventually be able to help thousands of individuals get out every day, but the capacity to conduct operations at that scale is still reportedly days away from being in place. There has been talk about American forces assisting other third-party nationals leave, as well as helping to speed up the departure of Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) due to their work with the U.S. government. However, so far, there does not appear to be any serious discussion about any sort of massive airlift of all Afghan civilians fleeing from the Taliban. It’s not clear how long the people massing at Hamid Karzai International Airport will be able to remain there without guarantees of at least food and water. It’s also unclear how long the airport would be able to remain open to commercial air traffic in any case due to various issues, such as potential shortages of air traffic controllers and aviation fuel, let aircraft aircraft being swarmed by people on the ground. In the meantime, American troops, as well as forces from other countries, such as the United Kingdom, have begun to arrive at the airport to help provide security for the evacuations. At present, the U.S. military plans to deploy a total of 6,000 Marines and Army soldiers. The need to accommodate those personnel at Hamid Karzai International Airport could put additional strains on the facility. Other foreign personnel, including the bulk of the staff from the U.S. Embassy, are already now operating out of the airport, as well. Ross Wilson, the Chargé d’Affaires at the U.S. Embassy, the top American diplomat in the country, relocated to the airport, as did the U.S. flag that had flown over the Embassy, earlier in the day. How long the Taliban will be willing to accept foreign military presence at the airport, which has come under sporadic gunfire during the day remains to be seen. U.S. military officials reportedly met with representatives of the group at their political office in Doha, Qatar, to stress that any attacks on Americans would be met with swift retaliation. There were no other reported threats to otherwise intervene in response to any sort of malign Taliban activity elsewhere in Afghanistan. Whether or not the airport ultimately comes under serious attack, the situation there is already chaotic and could become more so soon if civilians there feel they need to take even more drastic and desperate measures to get out of the country. Regardless, unless contained, the airport will not be able to function with mobs of people running around its aprons and taxiways. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update 7:30 PM EST: CNN is also reporting that the last flight, at least for the immediate future, of Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) to the United States has left Afghanistan. President Joe Biden’s administration has reportedly curtailed those flights to focus its attention on getting Americans out of the country. Update 10:35 PM EST: We have a new story up on the C-17 that supposedly airlifted 800 people out of Kabul on a single flight, including some radio recordings of the shock of the person on the other end hearing the load number. Check that out here . The exact situation with the accessibility of Kabul International to commercial flights remains somewhat murky. The U.S. military is in control of the airport and says it is open to commercial flights, but that may not entirely be the case considering the situation on the ground. Airplane trackers have also seen flights being held from landing. So, exactly what capacity the airport has to support commercial evacuation flights remains unclear. Afghans continue to flood the airport in hopes of departing before the Taliban are firmly in control, which will only make the situation on the ground inside the airport much more dangerous: There is also the case of one fully boarded KamAir airliner that was apparently commandeered and de-boarded by “special forces.” These are not U.S., according to reports. It isn’t clear exactly what the situation is here. It could be that the plane will not be able to take off due to the security situation or something more nefarious, we just don’t know at this time. Update 2 AM EST: The situation on the ground at Kabul international has only gotten worse since the sun rose. The videos are not pretty: As you can see, flight operations under these conditions are not really possible and the situation could turn worse for the U.S. troops tasked with protecting military-led evacuations. A very tense time we are entering into here. The desperation of many Afghans is abundantly clear. Meanwhile, large columns of Taliban foot soldiers are now pouring into Kabul: Update 3:30 AM EST: Things are getting worse around Kabul International. Reports state that gunfire is now far more common and the Taliban are moving into the area en masse. Making things worse, movements at the airport may be totally at a standstill as reports state that Afghans have stormed the runway. This video below, which is stunning, shows just how far the security situation may have degraded, which is very alarming. We cannot authenticate the video below at this time, but it is very troubling: Update 4:14 AM EST: We have a new post up, which you can find here , and will be updating it going forward.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 19, 2021",Fall Of Kabul To Taliban Imminent As Surprised United States Races To Get Its People Out (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The situation is changing very rapidly in the Afghan capital of Kabul. The speed and effectiveness of the Taliban’s blitz to regain control of the country has taken the U.S. and its allies by surprise. Now, it appears that Kabul will fall before the United States and other foreign powers that have violently opposed the Taliban for two decades can safely get their nationals out of the country. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul is now all but shut down and smoke had been seen rising from the compound earlier in the day suggesting sensitive documents were being burned. A steady stream of helicopters belonging to the U.S. military and the U.S State Department has been seen ferrying American personnel to nearby Hamid Karzai International Airport, where other aircraft will then take them out of the country. All of this comes after the Taliban entered the city today and amid reports that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country after resigning as part of a deal to establish a new, interim, transitional government. A US State Department CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter flies over Kabul on Aug. 15, 2021. Also seen is a tethered aerostat “blimp,” which US forces use to conduct surveillance., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul Smoke rises from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, likely as diplomatic staff burns sensitive documents., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul Pictures and video coming out of the war-torn country have shown U.S. Army CH-47F Chinooks and U.S. State Department CH-46 Sea Knights flying to and from the Embassy compound. The War Zone had reported last month about how the latter helicopters, as well as other State Department aircraft , would be very important assets for moving Americans to safety if the security situation in the country continued to deteriorate. The Sea Knights had already long served as the primary mode of transportation for U.S. diplomatic staff and other U.S. government personnel between the Embassy and Hamid Karzai International Airport due to security concerns, as you can read more about here . The imagery of the evacuations in Kabul is already drawing comparisons to the fall of Saigon, then the capital of South Vietnam, in 1975, though the circumstances of the two events are significantly different in a host of aspects. The optics, however, are very similar. CH-47s, as well as Army UH-60 Black Hawks , have also been spotted conducting operations around Kabul, including firing off infrared decoy flares. There have not been any reports, at least as of yet, that any American helicopters have come under attack, so it is possible that these flares were part of a show of force to deter individuals, including members of the Taliban or other actors, on the ground in some way. There have been reports that ground convoys, which the Black Hawks could be helping to escort, have also been moving from the Embassy to the airport. It could also just be the standard protocol for helicopters flying the city at present given the increasing threat situation. A UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter fires flares over Kabul on Aug. 15, 2021., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul It’s unclear whether or not the State Department’s own Black Hawks have been involved in any of the evacuation operations so far. The War Zone reported last month about how those helicopters, as well as other State Department aircraft , could be very important assets for moving Americans to safety if the security situation in the country continued to deteriorate. Photographs of Hamid Karzai International Airport taken yesterday showed Chinooks and Black Hawks, as well as Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and U.S. Air Force HC-130J Combat King II rescue aircraft on the ground. As The War Zone had reported just days ago, online flight tracking data had already shown a U.S. military evacuation airbridge was forming that included various types of aircraft, including at least six highly specialized KC-135RT “receiver tanker” aerial refueling aircraft that can be refueled in flight themselves, which you can read more about here . The total U.S. military force posture in Kabul at present is unclear. Just yesterday, President Joe Biden announced that a total of 5,000 troops would help U.S. diplomatic staff and others evacuate. This figure includes 1,000 personnel already on the ground in the Afghan capital, plus the previously announced deployments of 3,000 Marines and Army soldiers, which began this past Friday, as well as an additional 1,000 personnel from the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division. Those elements of the 82nd are part of a larger contingent that was originally supposed to go entirely to Kuwait to be better positioned to provide additional support if required. Other countries are now moving to deploy their own rescue forces, as well. How many of these troops will ultimately deploy to Afghanistan remains to be seen given how rapidly the situation in the country is devolving. Just this past week, the Taliban were able to secure virtually all major population centers across the country and isolate Kabul, weeks before recent U.S. government assessments had predicted they would be able to do so. The group did so through a combination of military victories and negotiations with local power brokers that saw government-aligned forces defeated, driven from the battlefield, or simply convinced to abandon their posts or even defect . All told, it seems increasingly unlikely that the country’s current internationally recognized government will exist in any recognizable form in the next 24 hours. It’s not entirely unclear where talks between the existing administration in Kabul and the Taliban stand now, but Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal, Afghanistan’s acting Interior Minister, had already announced that a “peaceful transfer of power” was coming. A picture subsequently emerged purporting to show Afghan President Ghani embracing Taliban officials. There are reports that Ghani has now fled Afghanistan . Other reports had said that the expectation was that Ghani would resign and that former interior minister Ahmad Jalali will then take control of an interim, transitional government, with a Taliban-led government, possibly led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, then taking over. Mullah Baradar is the Taliban’s co-founder and head of its political wing, and has been involved in past negotiations with the U.S. government via an office established in Doha in Qatar. He also notably met with Chinese officials in July and China is among the countries that have reportedly been preparing for weeks now to recognize a Taliban government in Afghanistan if Ghani’s administration were to fall. It’s also not clear how this could impact the United States’ plans to try to help Afghans who worked with the U.S. military or parts of the U.S. government, who are now at serious risk of reprisals from the Taliban, evacuate the country. The New York Times has reported that the current operations to get people out of the Embassy have not included Afghans working there. There have also been reports that, at least until just recently, the U.S. government was still urging other Americans, as well third-country nationals, to leave the country themselves by any means available, raising questions about whether there are plans for a larger-scale noncombatant evacuation operation (NEO). Some commercial flights do still appear to be taking off from Hamid Karzai International Airport, but it’s unclear how long that will continue, and the Taliban effectively control all of the country’s major overland border crossings. Other options for where to stage evacuation flights are equally limited. The U.S. military notably turned over Bagram Airfield just outside of Kabul, which had been a major operational hub for American and coalition operations for years, to the Afghan government in July and it is now under Taliban control . This has also brought up questions about what options might be realistically available for regular Afghans, many of who are trying to flee Kabul ahead of the formal Taliban takeover. The group has issued statements promising limited disruptions in daily life in the country after it assumes power, but many are still reasonably fearful about the potential for all manner of freedoms to be severely curtailed, and worse, under a new hardline Islamic regime. Whatever happens next, the situation is already extremely embarrassing for the U.S. government, which had spent nearly 20 years conducting counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and otherwise leading an international coalition that was also committed to establishing a functional Afghan government and military. Thousands of American and coalition troops gave their lives in Afghanistan over the past two decades and tens of thousands of Afghan security forces and civilians have also died in the fighting. Still, despite the obvious seriousness of the situation the U.S. government continues to downplay the significance, on multiple levels, of what is happening on the ground. “Let’s take a step back. This is manifestly not Saigon,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said today , pointing to the impacts the U.S. intervention had on Al Qaeda, the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks, which prompted the entire affair in the first place back in 2001. “That message should ring out very strongly.” Of course, there is no guarantee that Al Qaeda, or another similar terrorist group, will not subsequently take advantage of the situation in Afghanistan now. It’s also important to remember that Al Qaeda founder and long-time public enemy number one of the United States, Osama Bin Laden, was ultimately killed in a raid on a compound in neighboring Pakistan , not in Afghanistan. Any future American intervention into Afghanistan would also be made more difficult by the experience the Taliban has gained over the past two decades and the substantial amount of U.S. and other foreign-supplied military equipment, which includes aircraft, artillery, and armored vehicles, it has now captured from the country’s security services. “The Taliban is not the North Vietnamese Army, they’re not,” President Biden had said back in July . “They’re not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There’s going to be no circumstance for you to see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan. It is not at all comparable.” “The likelihood there is going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely,” he added. If nothing else, that assertion has proven to be manifestly false. Overall, the current situation in Afghanistan would seem to reflect serious failures in the intelligence assessments about the Taliban’s capabilities and intentions, as well as those of the Afghan government, and as a worrying lack of appropriate planning for large-scale evacuation operations. It is hard to imagine a worse place to be in if the U.S. government now has to rely on the goodwill and mercy of the Taliban to complete the evacuation of Americans and any other individuals it is hoping to help get out of the country. We will continue to monitor the situation in Afghanistan as it continues to develop and will make updates as new information emerges. Update 1:15 PM EST: The U.S. State Department has issued two alerts in the last few hours, with the first telling all American nationals to shelter in place and warning that they should not attempt to get to Hamid Karzai International Airport as it appeared to be under attack. It also said that the Embassy had suspended consular services. The second notice did not say anything specifically about consular services or attempting to get to the airport. The exact present security situation at Hamid Karzai International Airport is unclear. There are separate reports that the bulk of American personnel from the Embassy have been relocated to the airport, from where they will continue to oversee the ongoing evaluation operations, among other duties. Ross Wilson, the U.S. Chargé d’Affaires, is reportedly among those at the airport now and may have the U.S. flag that had flown above the building with him. Wilson is not technically the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, a post that is currently vacant, though he has been acting in this role. The exact state of the U.S. evacuation plan, and who American forces expect to help leave the country, is also still murky. Only 1,200 Afghans who may qualify for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) had been airlifted out as of Friday. The plan for the transition to a new Taliban government also appears to be changing with the departure of President Ghani from the country. Former President Hamid Karzai has said that he, along with Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah, and warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, will lead a transitional council. There are also rumors that Ghani fleeing the country may have prompted the Taliban to adopt a more aggressive stance, and the group says it now plans to officially declare their new Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan soon. There are unconfirmed reports that the former Afghan President was supposed to take part in a ceremony to mark the transition of power, which would have given the process added legitimacy. Update 1:40 PM EST: Reuters is now reporting that Hamid Karzai International Airport has been closed to commercial aircraft, according to a NATO official. It’s unclear if this would include aircraft chartered by foreign governments. Video has also emerged showing what appears to be a mass of people loading onto a C-17A Globemaster III airlifter belonging to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Air Force at Hamid Karzai International Airport. It’s unclear when this clip was taken. Update 3:55 PM EST: VOA is reporting that unknown actors are still directing sporadic gunfire at Hamid Karzai International Airport and that US forces are “trying to take care of it.” Military evacuation operations are ongoing while civilians are also still trying to leave the country via the airport. Additional troops from the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division are now headed for Kabul to ensure the safe completion of the evacuations. Currently, around 6,000 American troops are expected to deploy to the Afghan capital, in total. The Taliban have also now held an exclusive press conference with Al Jazeera from the Presidential Palace. One of the group’s members told the outlet that he had been in the U.S. military’s detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba for eight years. We have concluded our updates to this story.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 24, 2019",Shadowy KC-135RT Special Ops Tankers Head Toward Afghanistan As Evacuation Airbridge Forms (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Online flight tracking software indicates at least three of the U.S. Air Force’s specially modified KC-135RT “receiver tanker” aerial refueling aircraft have flown non-stop to the Middle East, and possibly beyond, in the past 24 hours. The KC-135RT fleet, which is primarily tasked with supporting special operations missions, is extremely small, comprising less than 10 jets based on publicly available information. Their appearance in the region follows the announcement of an emergency surge of American troops into Afghanistan to help U.S. diplomatic staff and others evacuate the country. It also comes as the security situation continues to deteriorate with the Taliban looking increasingly poised to begin a push to capture the capital Kabul. You can read more about all of this in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting here . Flight tracking data available through ADS-B Exchange shows KC-135RTs with the serial numbers 58-0018, 58-0126, and 61-0293, departing McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas in the past day or so. McConnell is home to the 22nd Aerial Refueling Wing, to which all of the KC-135RTs are assigned. All three planes were using “Reach” callsigns, which are most often used by aircraft on long-distance operational airlift flights. Online flight tracking data showing the general route taken by KC-135RT, serial number 58-0018, during a non-stop flight from McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas to the Middle East on Aug. 12, 2021. At least two other KC-135RTs, with serial numbers 58-0126, and 61-0293, followed a similar route., ADS-B Exchange All three aircraft followed roughly the same route, according to the available data, going first northeast into Canada and then out into the North Atlantic Ocean, before turning southeast and then flying down across the United Kingdom and continental Europe toward the Black Sea. They then continued into Turkish airspace. After that, the data is less complete, but 58-0018 subsequently appeared in the Persian Gulf region and might have been headed out into the North Arabian Sea. That is the first part of a route that U.S. military aircraft routinely take to get from the Persian Gulf to Afghanistan, via Pakistani airspace. Exactly what has prompted the need for the KC-135RTs is unclear. Unlike standard KC-135Rs, these aircraft have their own inflight refueling receptacle on top of the forward fuselage right behind the cockpit, which allows them to make use of tanker support themselves to remain on station longer or to conduct longer-distance missions. The KC-135RTs also have an improved communications suite compared to normal KC-135Rs. While the exact capabilities of those systems are unclear, the Air Force has fielded the Roll-On Beyond line-of-sight Enhancement (ROBE) package, a roll-on/roll-off “gateway” that is able to receive and transmit information across various waveforms, on some of its KC-135Rs. The service has been developing additional systems that could turn those tankers, as well as other types of aerial refuelers , into even more powerful communications and data-sharing nodes, as well. You can read more about these receiver tankers and their capabilities in this past War Zone feature . The KC-135RT fleet has most often been associated with supporting special operations forces, with their crews actually referred to as special operations air refueling (SOAR) airmen. In keeping with that mission set, SOAR crews are cleared to fly at low altitudes, blacked out, and in environments that require the use of emissions control (EMCON) procedures, commonly referred to as “radio silence.” They also often operate “stacked up” up with traditional tankers, taking fuel from them and then passing it off to other, smaller platforms. These kinds of operations have involved providing gas to different variants of AC-130 gunships and MC-130 special operations transports, among others, and could be part of the reason they’re now in the Middle East or even over Afghanistan. An AC-130J Ghostrider gunship., USAF An MC-130J Commando II special operations transport., USAF AC-130s have been a key asset for providing continued close air support to Afghan security forces as they battle the Taliban, but these aircraft have been flying those missions to and from bases in the Persian Gulf. This involves traveling thousands of miles in each direction and can only limit the ability of those aircraft to loiter over areas of the battlefield for extended periods of time. The KC-135RTs could help keep those gunships on station longer. MC-130s have also been tracked flying in and out of Afghanistan recently and the receiver tankers could be supporting them, as well. The Air Force’s current MC-130H Combat Talon II and MC-130J Commando II aircraft are both capable, among other things, of acting as tankers for special operations helicopters and Osprey tilt-rotors , as well. The service’s HC-130 Combat King rescue aircraft also have similar aerial refueling capabilities. “stack” including those aircraft and KC-135RTs could provide the necessary support to get those platforms to and from Afghanistan from bases potentially thousands of miles away. Of course, the capabilities that the KC-135RTs offer could be applied to other contingency operations, as well. Reports indicate that the first elements of an expected force of approximately 3,000 troops are now on their way to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. The Pentagon is deploying these personnel ostensibly to help with a drawdown of personnel at the U.S. Embassy. Two Marine Corps infantry battalions, and another from the U.S. Army, will up the core of this force. A previous report that the Army contingent would come from 1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery, part of the Iowa Army National Guard, was incorrect. The unit in question is actually the 1st Battalion, 194th Armor Regiment, part of the Minnesota Army National Guard. At the same time, U.S. officials have insisted that there are no plans presently to abandon the Embassy entirely, or otherwise help U.S. government employees or other American nationals get out of the country en masse. American citizens have been urged to leave the country on their own as soon as possible. However, additional forces are already being positioned at forward locations in the Middle East for that purpose should the situation in Afghanistan devolve further. Other countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany , are now also following suit. Supporting any future large-scale evacuation operation would require a significant airbridge, but the U.S. military presently lacks access to bases in countries neighboring Afghanistan. It has been having to fly sorties of all kinds of missions to and from that country using established bases elsewhere, particularly in the Persian Gulf. As such, the receiver tankers could be very useful for supporting non-stop flights by various kinds of aircraft, including Air Force airlifters, which may now be coming in from well beyond this general region, even from the United States proper. Such an airbridge is already forming to support the deployments that the Pentagon announced yesterday. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said today that the expectation is that American forces will be able to help thousands of people evacuate per day, if required. All of this comes amid a string of major Taliban advances across Afghanistan in recent weeks, which includes the capture of multiple provincial capitals just in the past few days. These victories have been accompanied by the fleeing or surrendering of significant numbers of troops aligned with the government in Kabul, as well as the defection of at least some of them to the Taliban. In addition, the insurgents have continued to seize large amounts of weaponry and other materiel, including hundreds of Humvees and other military vehicles, as they gain ground. The capture of Afghan military bases in a number of major cities has led to the Taliban adding captured helicopters of various types, including U.S.-supplied UH-60 Black Hawks and Hughes 530F Little Birds , as well as small Scan Eagle drones , to its spoils. Many of those aircraft appear to be non-flyable, underscoring the steadily worsening state of the Afghan Air Force, which the U.S. government has continued to tout as a key force multiplier that Afghan forces have in their continued fighting against the insurgents. There are now reportedly concerns within the U.S. government that the Taliban could move to seize Kabul in the coming days. This would be even faster than the potential timeline in recent official assessments, which had said that the group could surround the capital within 30 days and might be able to capture it in three months or less. The was already a report from The New York Times yesterday that the U.S. State Department has been trying to seek assurances that the Taliban would leave the American Embassy in Kabul alone if it were to take the city. The fall of Kabul could also give the group control of other sites, including Afghanistan’s central Da Afghanistan Bank , which reported having over $9 billion in Gross Foreign Exchange Reserves last year. If things on the ground in Afghanistan get any worse, the exact need for the specialized KC-135RTs as part of the larger U.S. military airbridge that is forming now may become more apparent. Update 9:15 PM EST: Online flight tracking data now indicates that a total of six KC-135RTs, not three, have made their way in the direction of Afghanistan. There are also indications that additional MC-130Js, as well as other aircraft, have taken a similar route from the United States toward the Middle East.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 30, 2021",Here Is Why This Sailor Is Holding A Laser Fire Hose,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fires are no laughing matter, especially on ships and submarines , where various factors can make them spread rapidly and be very difficult to extinguish. The U.S. Navy is acutely aware of this reality after having had to scrap the former Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard following a massive blaze that raged on the ship for days last year, which the service has now accused a sailor of deliberate starting. So, it’s not surprising to see sailors conducting a firefighting drill on Bonhomme Richard ‘s sister ship USS Bataan , but it is unexpected to see a laser beam coming out of the end of the hose rather than a stream of water. The Navy released this picture on Aug. 11, 2021, which shows three sailors in full firefighting gear taking part in a drill in Bataan ‘s main hangar bay the day before. The ship is currently at its homeport at  Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. However, this isn’t about some new, sci-fi way of fighting fires. Rather than a real fire hose, the trio appears to be using the Attack digital fire training system from a company called Lion Group . The part of the Attack system we can see is the digital nozzle, which consists of a green laser built into a standard fire hose nozzle that can still be used to shoot water, as well. The laser beam is projected in a way that mimics the spread of an actual cone of water coming out of a hose. This nozzle can be attached to a weighted faux fire hose that simulates a real one full of rushing water. It also has a speaker that pumps out the noise you’d heard when using a real nozzle shooting water for added realism. The nozzle and hose are just two parts of the complete Attack system, which also includes panels that show fake flames and smoke generators, among other things. A page from a brochure showing various components of the complete Attack system., Lion Group “The nozzle emits infrared light and lasers that interact with the Attacks’s self-generating digital flames just as a water-based hose line interacts with a live fire,” according to Lion’s website . “When using the Digital Nozzle while the Attack is in laser mode, the fire will only be knocked down if the trainee uses proper hose line technique.” All of this enables the Attack system to be set up virtually anywhere and be used without having to douse anything in real water. This sounds like it would be particularly useful for training inside Navy ships, which are full of unusually shaped and often cramped spaces, and where it might be impossible to safely use actual water during firefighting drills for fear of damaging key systems. One would imagine that Attack is not a complete substitute for training with actual fire hoses spewing water, but that wouldn’t diminish the value of being able to practice fighting fires in areas of a ship that might otherwise be only accessible to less immersive firefighting training in the past. Sailors onboard the Austin class amphibious transport dock ship USS Denver train with a real fire hose., Petty Officer 1st Class Ross Taylor/USN The Bonhomme Richard incident also prompted the Navy to increase the requirements for routine firefighting training on ships, among other things . A system like Attack, which can be set up relatively quickly regardless of the exact scenario, could simply make it easier to run through these drills, but still do in a way that is highly beneficial to sailors. It’s interesting to note that this is far from the first time the U.S. military, among others , has used lasers for simulated training. Since the late 1970s, American troops have “fought” each other in exercises using various iterations of the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) system, which uses lasers to simulate the effects of small arms and other weapons. Now, this technology has evolved and migrated to help American sailors practice fighting an entirely different kind of battle—one against flames aboard warships.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 24, 2021",Emergency Troop Surge Now Needed For Afghan Withdrawal (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has announced that, starting in the 24 to 48 hours, it will deploy approximately 3,000 troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul to help American diplomatic personnel from the U.S. Embassy and others evacuate the country. This comes as President Joe Biden’s Administration continues to push ahead with a near-total withdrawal of American forces from the country, though this new development means that there will soon be more U.S. military personnel there than there were officially in January, before the withdrawal began. Amid the drawdowns, the Taliban have made substantial gains, capturing 12 provincial capitals just in recent weeks, reportedly leading to new U.S. government assessments that the group could surround Kabul in the next 30 days and potentially have complete control of it within three months. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby announced the impending deployments at a briefing today. While he did not identify the specific units that would be heading to Afghanistan, he did say that two infantry battalions from the U.S. Marine Corps and another from the U.S. Army would make up the bulk of the total force. They will join 650 personnel, primarily special operations forces, presently forward-deployed at Hamid Karzai International Airport. In January, the Pentagon said that there were only 2,500 American troops in the country, in total. Members of the US Army’s Immediate Response Force (IRF) board US Air Force C-17A Globemaster III airlifters at Pope Field in North Carolina for a contingency deployment in January 2020., US Army It’s not clear how these incoming troops will be accommodated within the confines of the airport, which is also still set to soon host a Turkish security force . In July, the U.S. military notably withdrew entirely under controversial circumstances from Bagram Airfield just outside of Kabul, which had served as a major hub for American and coalition operations in the region for nearly two decades. All of these troops will be under the command of U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Peter Vasely, a SEAL who is presently in charge of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (Forward). Earlier this year, as part of the ongoing withdrawal effort, the Pentagon shifted responsibility for day-to-day operations in Afghanistan directly to U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), and moved the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan headquarters to Qatar. That country is also now hosting the main office responsible for U.S. military cooperation with Afghanistan’s security forces and an Over-the-Horizon Counterterrorism Headquarters involved in coordinating ongoing operational support for those forces, to include airstrikes launched from the Persian Gulf region. Additional personnel will also move into the region to provide supplemental assistance and otherwise be on call should the security situation in Afghanistan deteriorate further. Around 1,000 troops will specifically go to Qatar to aid in the processing of Afghans who have worked with the U.S. government and are now eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) that would allow them to seek refuge in the United States. Getting those individuals, as well as Americans, out of Afghanistan could require a major airlift, as well. An Army infantry brigade combat team from Fort Bragg in North Carolina, almost certainly the brigade from the 82nd Airborne Division presently assigned to the Immediate Response Force (IRF), will also move somewhere in the region to be in a position to respond if needed. The IRF is an extremely high-readiness contingency response force that is on alert for deployment anywhere in the world, utilizing Air Force airlifters, at all times. Press Secretary Kirby has insisted that these deployments reflect a “narrowly-defined mission” and no constitute an official non-combatant evacuation operation, or NEO. That is the formal term the U.S. military uses for missions to pull out American nationals from countries experiencing some sort of disruption in their basic functioning, to include significant civil unrest or a major natural disaster. The U.S. State Department has separately insisted that the Embassy in Kabul will remain open, though it has already been operating with significantly reduced staff for months. Two official U.S. government travel alerts this week have already urged U.S. citizens to leave the country as soon as possible. The New York Times has also reported that American officials have been trying to secure guarantees from the Taliban that the group will leave the Embassy alone if it takes control of the Afghan capital, which seems like a preposterous proposition. Despite the official pronouncements, the reality certainly seems to be that something very akin to an NEO is now underway, driven by the reality of the Taliban’s rapid gains. Just today, the group claimed the capture of Herat, Ghazni, and Kandahar, the provincial capitals of the provinces of the same names, as well as Badghis province’s capital Qala-I-Naw, further solidifying its control over the country’s western, southern and northern regions. “I’d say is that no potential outcome has to be inevitable, including the fall of Kabul, which everybody seems to be reporting about,” Kirby had said yesterday , amid reports that U.S. officials were fearing that the Taliban could have Kabul isolated in 30 days and that they could very well have it captured within 90 days . “It doesn’t have to be that way.” Inevitable or not, and despite pleas from the U.S. government and others for the group to seek a negotiated end to the conflict, the Taliban certainly seems to believe that a victory through force may be finally within reach. Other countries in the region, notably China , appear to be increasingly preparing for the government in Kabul to fall. For his part, Press Secretary Kirby declined to speculate on what kinds of direct support, such as airstrikes, the U.S. military might provide for its Afghan counterparts after Aug. 31, when its current authority to continue to those types of missions runs out. With the security situation in Afghanistan so fluid now, and the Taliban only continuing to gain ground, these new U.S. troop deployments could turn into an official NEO soon. If that comes to pass, it could very well spell the complete end of the U.S. military’s presence in the country after almost 20 years, and a potentially very violent one at that. Update 8:50 PM EST: The Washington Post ‘s Dan Lamothe has reported that the three battalions headed for Afghanistan are 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment; 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment; and 1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery, Iowa Army National Guard. 1/8th Marines is part of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), which is currently in the Middle East as part of the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group. 2/1st Marines is forward-deployed in Saudi Arabia as part of the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Central Command ( SPMAGTF-CR-CC ). The mention of 1-194th Field Artillery is curious given that Press Secretary John Kirby had described the deploying units all as infantry battalions. This battalion is equipped, in part, with the Centurion Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system, which, as its name suggests, is designed primarily. to knock down incoming artillery rockets and shells, as well as mortar rounds, You can read more about this system here . It is unclear if 1-194th Field Artillery is heading to Afghanistan with its C-RAMs, which could be very valuable for protecting forces at Hamid Karzai International Airport from incoming Taliban fire. That group has used rockets and other artillery to attack the airport in the past. It is also possible given Kirby’s description of the battalions, though perhaps less likely, that this unit is being sent to operate as an infantry force, rather than as a C-RAM unit, something that has occurred with artillery elements in the past. What’s perhaps more notable, however, is that elements of 1-194th Field Artillery just returned home in July from various locations in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. If even a portion of this battalion is now headed to Afghanistan, this would suggest the personnel involved may now be looking at effectively back-to-back deployments. Update 8/13/2021: The report that the U.S. Army unit deploying to Afghanistan was 1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery Regiment was in error. The Washington Post ‘s Dan Lamothe has put out a correction to note that the unit in question is actually the 1st Battalion, 194th Armor Regiment, part of the Minnesota Army National Guard.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin’s famous Skunk Works advanced projects division has opened a new cutting-edge manufacturing facility at its campus in Palmdale, California, which is part of the U.S. Air Force’s Plant 42 . The company says that the technologies it will employ in this new “factory of the future,” blandly named Building 648, will help it drastically speed up and otherwise improve how it designs and produces advanced aerospace vehicles, including stealth fighters and drones, hypersonic missiles, and more. Beyond that, however, this factory is the centerpiece of a larger transformation going on within Skunk Works that could potentially revolutionize the development and production of even very advanced aerospace concepts, industrial capabilities that could be increasingly essential for the U.S. military to maintain its competitive edge. The War Zone was among a select group of outlets given an opportunity to visit Skunk Works and attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the 215,000-square foot Building 648, which Lockheed Martin representatives have described as an “intelligent, flexible, advanced manufacturing facility,” on Aug. 10, 2021, as well as tour other relevant portions of the overall facility at Palmdale. The factory is the “cornerstone” of approximately $400 million worth of investments the company has made to help expand its capabilities and capacity at what is formally known as Plant 10 in recent years, which has already led directly to the creation of 1,500 new jobs since 2018. A view of Building 648’s lobby., Lockheed Martin “While what we’re doing hasn’t changed, how we’re doing it has changed,” Jeff Babione, Vice President and General Manager of Skunk Works, to the reporters who traveled to Palmdale to get a briefing ahead of the ribbon-cutting ceremony. “So, for some time, Lockheed Martin, at the corporate level, and across the entire enterprise, has been focused on transforming virtually everything we do in the business, from writing requirements, to writing contracts, to designing and developing those technologies, to manufacturing technologies, to sustaining those technologies in the field. This is our digital transformation.” Building 648 is a prime reflection of these new processes and how Lockheed Martin plans to implement them inside and outside of Skunk Works. Though the factory’s shop floor was largely empty during the ribbon-cutting event, that is, in itself, a key aspect of Lockheed Martin’s plans for the high-tech facility. Over the years, Skunk Works has had to expend significant time and resources to simply set up workspaces for new programs within buildings across its campus in Palmdale. One Lockheed Martin executive quipped that the local companies who provide the chain-link fences that segregate the different areas within the various hangars at Plant 10 can expect reliable work given how often those spaces have to be reconfigured. Beyond just building those alcoves, new, dedicated tooling also often has to be procured and then moved into place, especially when it comes to manufacturing prototypes or carrying out limited production runs of certain designs. Lockheed Martin’s goal with Building 648 is to do away with a significant amount of the initial setup through increased automation, particularly with the employment of large, advanced robots from Electroimpact . Right now, the company has four such robots, known as Combined Operation: Bolting and Robotic AutoDrill systems, or COBRAs . These are, in their present configurations, capable of drilling and countersinking holes in various materials, including composites and titanium, as well as bolting and fastening structures together. These machines, one of which is seen in the background of the photo at the top of this story, could gain additional functionality as time goes on, as well. Building 648 itself also has very advanced climate controls, able to keep the interior temperature within plus or minus two degrees of a specific setting, regardless of the conditions outside, to support work using various, often environmentally sensitive materials. These materials often have to be fitted or even fused together, so controlling their expansion during manufacturing is key. Skunk Works has already used these robots and demonstrated some of their advanced capabilities on the X-59A Quiet Supersonic Transport testbed, or QueSST. This experimental aircraft is under development for NASA as part of a project to explore ways to mitigate the shockwave and associated noise from sonic booms. One of Lockheed Martin’s COBRA robots works on the wing of the X-59A., Lockheed Martin A company representative told The War Zone that the Electroimpact robots had drilled more than 7,519 holes in structures for the X-59A, at a rate of one hole every 21 seconds, and that only 23 of those needed to be redrilled. Improperly drilled holes can easily lead to delays and cost increases, especially when it comes to the production of stealthy aircraft, where these kinds of mistakes can impact the radar-absorbing and deflecting qualities of the design. This level of accuracy in machining also helps ensure uniformity in parts, including spares, which is important for sustaining systems as time goes on. Altogether, this is a major step up from building advanced aircraft largely by hand, as Skunk Work has done for decades. In addition to simply being able to quickly and accurately drill and fasten structures for advanced aircraft, the robots are capable of being programmed to perform this work autonomously, with a human operator present mainly to provide an additional margin of safety. The robots are mobile, which means they can go to where the work is, rather than the other way around. More importantly, that latter capability means that a single robot, using pre-programmed instructions, will be able to move relatively rapidly from one task to another, regardless of whether that involves drilling holes in something like the X-59A or bolting together parts for an advanced manned or unmanned aircraft. In turn, the hope is that this will significantly reduce the need for project-specific tooling, as well as make it easier to reconfigure spaces within Building 648, or any similar facility, when shifting from work on one program to another, giving the entire enterprise a very modular feel. There will be nothing, not even basic furniture, permanently nailed down on the floor of this new factory. The work that will go on in Building 648 will also leverage advances in both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), combined with advances in digital engineering, to further improve the manufacturing processes. What this means in practice is that personnel on the shop floor, as well as engineers elsewhere, will be able to check that physical parts being built or assembled look and behave structurally the way they were expected to when compared with digital models. If problems arise, or there is a desire to change certain things, individuals could use AR or VR to immediately begin exploring potential fixes or alterations without necessarily have to assemble or disassemble entire components first. AR and VR also allow the functioning of an entire system to be explored, and tweaked if necessary, without needing to have a complete physical article fully constructed. This means, for example, that engineers and technicians can check to make sure that access panels, and what’s behind them, are accessible to workers that will service the aircraft. Assembly of components of specific products can leverage AR, giving workers a far better context of how the operations should occur, which should increase manufacturing speed, streamline training, and enhance quality control. All of the technologies that Skunk Works plans to employ within Building 648 itself are, however, just one part of a much bigger picture. This is the over-arching “digital transformation” that Vice President and General Manager Babione spoke to ahead of the ribbon-cutting. It might seem innocuous, but building 648 will have wi-fi inside, despite being approved to work on projects at some of the highest levels of classification with the U.S. government, two things that are typically incongruous and something Babione said was a first for a Department of Defense contractor. Some 85 percent of everything that goes on at Skunk Works is classified. So, what that means is that data can be more readily and flexibly sent to and from the shop floor and engineering spaces elsewhere within Plant 10 without the need for physical links. This is necessary to enable Skunk Works’ vision of mobile robots moving seamlessly from one project to another across the factory and how reconfigurable the facility will be, as a whole. One Lockheed Martin representative stressed that the individuals involved in the various aspects of the design and manufacturing processes were not necessarily doing different types of work compared to what they had done in the past, but that the process is more vertical now than horizontal. What the means in practice is that, instead of different teams completing their portions of a project and then passing them off to the next group in a sequential process, they are now working more in parallel and are more actively coordinating along the way. This broader concept has been enabled in no small part through the development of digital modeling and engineering toolset called StarDrive . This builds on Skunk Works’ already long-established reputation as a pioneer in advanced and rapid prototyping capabilities, including high-fidelity modeling. Various elements of the StarDrive team have already been demonstrating what the toolkit, combined with advanced manufacturing capabilities now expected to be exploited to the fullest in Building 648, can do through various modeling and digitally-enabled manufacturing efforts. The X-59A program, one of Skunk Works’ few unclassified programs, has provided a useful springboard for StarDrive to test out its advanced processes. One demonstration effort conducted under StarDrive, known as Polaris, used the entire digital toolkit to produce a 1:1 copy of a section of the X-59A that included metal and composite components. In addition to demonstrating how all of this is work to produce a real, physical product, Polaris also showed how Lockheed Martin will be able to bring third-party suppliers right in at the beginning of the process. A picture of the X-59A under construction earlier this year. Polaris produced a 1:1 copy of a section of this aircraft spanning from around the area immediately behind the cockpit to the space in front of where the engine is mounted on top of the fuselage., Lockheed Martin Portions of the Polaris structure were built off-site by Spirit AeroSystems using digital design data provided by Skunk Works. In existing manufacturing processes, subcontractors typically send components to places like Skunk Works’ Plant 10, where they are then prepped for assembly, including the drilling of various holes, and then painstakingly fitted together. Using the StarDrive tools, Spirit was able to have its segments more or less ready to go before shipping them, greatly reducing assembly time. As an example, the pinning of the composite structures to the metal frame on Polaris, a process that Skunk Works representatives said involved fastening some 1,500 individual pins and that would typically take hours, was completed within approximately 30 minutes. Renee Pasman, the Director of Integrated Systems at Skunk Works, described the ultimate aim here as being to make the process akin to assembling extremely “high-quality Ikea furniture,” except that the final product doesn’t “wobble” at all. The name Polaris, the formal moniker for what is commonly referred to as the North Star, was specifically chosen to reflect its nature as a “pathfinder” program for future Skunk Works programs. The StarDrive team is already working on a separate initiative, dubbed Speed Racer , which will serve as a different kind of end-to-end demonstration of the process, taking a digital design and turning it into a flying prototype. A rendering of Speed Racer as seen in a Lockheed Martin video about StarDrive., Lockheed Martin capture The Speed Racer vehicle itself, which was first publicly disclosed in 2020 and that you can read more about here , is a small missile-like drone. During the events at Palmdale, Skunk Works disclosed that the name, which is an acronym, stands for Small Penetrating Expendable Decoy Radically Affordable Compact Extended Range, and that there is an as-yet-undisclosed customer for this air vehicle. It’s not clear if that entity is presently planning on acquiring Speed Racers simply for research and development purposes or has an eye toward eventually employing them operationally in some way. Skunk Works also provided some basic details on other StarDrive subprojects, including Sirius, which was focused on the “model-based systems engineering” of a notional tailless delta-wing fighter jet-type aircraft, and Charlie, a similar effort in some respects to Polaris, but that produced a smaller and less complex physical component. The digital toolset is also be used in work related to the modernization of the F-16 Viper fighter jet design. Earlier this year, the Air Force announced that it had hired Wichita State University’s National Institute of Aviation Research (NIAR) to create a very high-fidelity 1:1 digital model, or “digital twin,” of an F-16 to help support such efforts. Lockheed Martin’s StarDrive team has also been involved in that project. “Using a proven platform like the F-16 to advance digital twin data models allows our team to demonstrate a further reduction in lifecycle cost for sustainability while also introducing additional capability through digital thread continuity,” Aaron Martin, the StarDrive Program Manager at Skunk Works, said in a statement in June. “This project is indicative of how Lockheed Martin’s technology investments will allow us to make even faster progress on future programs.” StarDrive, together with the capabilities that Skunk Works plans to put into use in Building 648, are all intended to allow engineerings and technicians to get their various jobs done faster, more efficiently, and more effectively, even when dealing with very high-tech design concepts and materials. This, in turn, is expected to dramatically reduce the time it takes to develop those designs and build them, as well as the costs of doing so. While these benefits would be good in any context, they will be especially valuable if they can be employed effectively with regards to advanced aerospace projects, especially on military programs, such as future manned and unmanned stealth aircraft. Historically, those kinds of development programs have been extremely costly and time-consuming , often creating new problems down the road as demands emerge to integrate new, more up-to-date technology into those designs. A prime example of this is the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, which began at Skunk Works, and has faced significant development and production hurdles throughout its history already and is now facing worrisome growth in operational and sustainment costs . “We’re in a situation that bears some resemblance to one that I had earlier on, around Lot 4 or so, when there were a lot of design issues on a plane that hadn’t been resolved, and we were in the process of buying airplanes that were going to need extensive modifications,” Frank Kendall, who was just recently confirmed as Secretary of the Air Force, told Air Force Magazine about the Block 4 upgrade package for the Joint Strike Fighter in a recent interview. The Air Force, among other F-35 operators, see those improvements, which you can read more about here , as critical to the F-35’s viability in future high-end conflicts. However, it is unclear when they will find themselves integrated into the bulk of operational Joint Strike Fighter fleets. In recent years, the Air Force, in particular, has similarly been talking about wanting to find ways to upend traditional development cycles for advanced air vehicles, and achieve efficiencies similar to those seen in the commercial automotive and aviation industries. In 2019, Will Roper, then the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, first described the basic outline of one potential new, rapid, iterative design concept, called the Digital Century Series , which would rely heavily on digital engineering techniques and focus on small production runs. A facility like Skunk Works’ Building 648 could make this ambitious idea more plausible. U.S. military officials have also made it increasingly clear publicly in recent months that they feel traditional development processes are too slow to keep pace, capability-wise, with potential adversaries, especially near-peer opponents, such as China. “What I don’t know, and what we’re working with our great partners, is if our nation will have the courage and the focus to field this capability before someone like the Chinese fields it and uses it against us,” Air Force General Mark Kelly, head of Air Combat Command, said earlier this year , referring to his services Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. NGAD is a multi-prong advanced development effort that has produced at least one flying demonstrator design already. Artwork the US Air Force has released in relation to the NGAD program., USAF With all this in mind, it’s perhaps not surprising that the main StarDrive workspace at Skunk Works, also known as Area M, has a large version of the iconic skunk logo that visitors are encouraged to sign and included a signature with “NGAD SML,” printed underneath. It was not readily possible to determine who this individual was from their signature, but SML here likely meant “Subject Matter Lead.” There is, of course, also the possibility, that this refers to the U.S. Navy’s NGAD effort , which is similar, but separate from the Air Force program of the same name. Lockheed Martin’s new developmental and manufacturing processes would, of course, be of interest to both of those services, along with other branches of the U.S. military, as well as foreign allies that have close enough relations with the U.S. government to potentially take advantage of them. Of course, it remains to be seen whether or not Lockheed Martin’s plans for Building 648, or the rest of its company-wide digital transformation, will fully come to fruition. Though significant portions of the overall concept have already been demonstrated, it is still an ambitious undertaking and the company will need to prove that it can be scaled up, even on a modest level. As already noted, Building 648 is just one part of a large expansion of facilities to handle almost exclusively classified work in Palmdale. This includes plans to build an expanded solar farm at Plant 10 that will be 10 times the size of the current one, which is already very large, and will allow the new factory to operate “off the grid.” Other work at Palmdale includes the expansion of Building 638 to include an 8,000-square-foot hangar with the “capability to operate aircraft of varying thrust levels,” allowing engine testing to be conducted entirely inside the structure “to ensure external parties cannot see” what’s going on, according to a poster at the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The construction of thousands of additional square feet of storage space for classified articles was completed at Plant 10’s Building 645 and at Lockheed Martin’s Helendale Radar Cross Section Range , also in California just to the east Skunk Works’ main campus, earlier this year, as well. Work is expected to be finished on expanding Building 645, described only as a “secure classified intelligent facility,” in November. In addition, Skunk Works’ also has workforces now at Lockheed Martin’s manufacturing facilities in Fort Worth in Texas, home of the main F-35 production line , and in Marietta in Georgia. However, the company stressed that, at least for now, Building 648 at Palmdale will be a unique facility in terms of its capabilities. Lockheed Martin, as a whole, plans to spend around $2 billion over the next five years just in support of its digital transformation. So, all told, the company clearly sees these initiatives as potentially game-changing on a broad scale. If the results meet the expectations, this could very well help revolutionize advanced aerospace development and manufacturing in the United States—which is what Skunk Works, at its very core, has always been about. This, in turn, could help offer the Pentagon, as a whole, a critical avenue to support its own digital transformation , which it clearly sees as a strategic necessity.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 21, 2021",Strategic Command Boss Encourages People To Keep Looking For More Chinese Missile Silos,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The commander of U.S. Strategic Command has said he wants open-source intelligence communities to continue to look for new Chinese intercontinental ballistic missile silos , recent evidence for which has been provided to the public exclusively from non-governmental sources, rather than the Pentagon. This also seems to underscore assessments the U.S. military community has made in recent years about the fast-paced expansion and modernization of Chinese strategic nuclear forces, but for which it has provided limited evidence of itself. At the same time, this position points to the fact that open-source intelligence (OSINT) is in many ways changing the way that national governments go about this kind of work. Speaking at the Space & Missile Defense Symposium (SMD) in Huntsville, Alabama, today, the STRATCOM boss, Admiral Charles “Chas” A. Richard, made direct reference to the non-military OSINT experts who have, in recent months , discovered what they consider to be multiple new Chinese intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fields, in two different locations in the northwest of that country, that are large and appear to point to a considerable expansion of China’s nuclear arsenal. General Timothy M. Ray, Air Force Global Strike Command commander, showcases a B-52H Stratofortress to Admiral Charles A. Richard, U.S. Strategic Command commander, at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, last September., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Jacob B. Wrightsman “I usually have to pay someone to do that,” Richard observed, suggesting that those same independent OSINT analysts, and others, should continue to search for other Chinese silos, too. “If you enjoy looking at commercial satellite imagery or stuff in China, can I suggest you keep looking?” the admiral said , strongly suggesting that there are more silos yet to be found. In late June, the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies used imagery provided by private firm Planet Labs to identify what appears to be an ICBM field, with more than 100 silos, under construction in the Gobi Desert near Yumen in China’s Gansu province. Less than a month later, an apparent new field of silos, also under construction, was identified by Matt Korda and Hans Kristensen from the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). Seemingly destined to house 120 missile silos, it’s located near the city of Hami in the eastern end of Xinjiang province. The analysts responsible for finding the second silo field described it as “the most significant expansion of the Chinese nuclear arsenal ever.” KRISTENSEN/KORDA/FAS 2021 Just today, Roderick Lee from the China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI) appeared to have uncovered a third such ICBM site, under construction in Hanggin Banner, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, using images taken by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 mission. In the past, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) has relied upon a small force of around 20 silos for its liquid-fueled DF-5 missiles , the only operational silo-based ICBMs in its inventory. A handful of other silos are used for training and test purposes. With that in mind, the two new reported ICBM fields, and a possible third, suggest a fundamental overhaul of Beijing’s ICBM deterrent, apparently based around presenting enemies with a much more challenging target, should they wish to destroy it in a first strike . These new missile fields could also provide China with an expansive quick-launch ICBM capability the likes of which they didn’t have before. In his address today, Admiral Richard referred to the ICBM fields, as part of a pattern in the wider expansion of China’s military capabilities. “The explosive growth in their nuclear and conventional forces can only be what I describe as breathtaking,” Richard said , adding that, “frankly, that word ‘breathtaking’ may not be enough.” This kind of analysis is in keeping with warnings about China’s growing military might from the Pentagon last year in its report to Congress on the Chinese military and its capabilities. “The PLARF develops and fields a wide variety of conventional mobile ground-launched ballistic missiles and cruise missiles,” the report said. “The PRC [People’s Republic of China] is developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that will significantly improve its nuclear-capable missile forces.” Interestingly, however, there had been a degree of skepticism in the past about the scale of China’s nuclear ambitions as presented in the Pentagon’s own estimates . The latest revelations, especially the silo fields, support the Pentagon’s original assertions and also seem to have convinced some previous critics of those predictions. STRATCOM has also confirmed its belief that the evidence does indeed show ICBM silos under construction, rather than wind farms, as some — including in the Chinese media — have suggested. While the think tanks and OSINT experts continue to pore over publicly available sources for a better picture of China’s nuclear development path, it’s curious that STRATCOM, and the Pentagon as a whole, have effectively been deferring to organizations like Middlebury and FAS on this topic, rather than putting out findings from its own intelligence in some kind of declassified format. The tweet embedded below, which links to the New York Times report in which Korda and Kristensen of the FAS presented their findings, is a prime example of that tendency. There are, of course, examples of the Pentagon putting out declassified imagery to underscore its assertions, as in the case of Russian-supplied fighter jets that have appeared in Libya . With that in mind, it remains curious that they haven’t done the same in the case of recent Chinese developments. After all, the use of Google Earth imagery by FAS in the case of the construction work at the ICBM silo field shows that unclassified imagery is readily available if they wanted to release this themselves. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has even set up an initiative to do just this , including working directly with research institutes and think tanks. Annotated satellite imagery provided by U.S. Africa Command showing two Russian-supplied MiG-29s at Al Jufra Air Base, May 2020., AFRICOM Nevertheless, there have even been some tantalizing hints in recent days of potentially game-changing Chinese developments in this field. Also speaking at the SMD in SMD, Glen D. VanHerck, commander of U.S. Northern Command, said China “just demonstrated” a “very fast” hypersonic vehicle. Although no further details were provided, VanHerck said it would challenge current early warning systems. While this may be a reference to one of China’s previously disclosed hypersonic weapons , it could potentially be something altogether different. Either way, it is an example of the kind of information that the United States Intelligence Community clearly has access to. Whatever STRATCOM knows or doesn’t know about China’s strategic weapons, it’s clear that there is a wider acknowledgment that the country is accelerating the pace of its military modernization as well as looking at increasingly more sophisticated and plentiful nuclear delivery systems. At the same time, China’s growing nuclear capabilities have been a major point in the Pentagon’s argument for staying the course of hugely expensive nuclear modernization , too. But while they clearly want people to see evidence of this to bolster their case, so far, at least, this work has been left to non-government entities. It seems, for whatever reason, the Department of Defense is currently happy with this new paradigm in which the OSINT community can be left to carry out its work with satellite imagery while helping to bolster the Pentagon’s position. Certainly, this approach seems to be opening different avenues for applying pressure on international opponents to explain what they’re doing and to raise support for ongoing investments in strategic capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 16, 2021",Mysterious High-Altitude Airspace Closure Appears Alongside Nellis Range Complex,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A somewhat bizarre airspace restriction will go into place above one of the busiest flight corridors in the western United States on Thursday, August 12th, from 11 pm to 3 am Pacific time. The box-like altitude reservation (ALTRV), a high-altitude chunk of airspace from 45,000 to 60,000 feet, sits nestled between military operating areas (MOAs) that are part of the R-2508 range complex that surrounds Edwards AFB and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake to the west and the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) to the east. This box of sky sits above an alley-like corridor that streams of airliners travel through coming and going from Las Vegas and other major population centers in America’s Southwest. The airspace restriction was first noticed by our friend @thenewarea51 , who keeps a close eye on radio communications and aircraft movements. The altitudes involved are curious as even the lower end of the block can only be accessed by a limited number of aircraft—mainly high-end business jets, fighters, and RQ-4 and U-2 high-altitude surveillance aircraft. Normal airliner traffic passing through this area would usually be under 45,000 feet almost by default. It’s not like we haven’t seen strange airspace restrictions go up in this area of the U.S. before. Maybe most interesting are the high-altitude corridors set aside for something transitioning between the NTTR and the Pacific, which have come and gone. These were indicative of a secretive high-altitude drone or other test aircraft accessing the expanses of the Pacific for operational use or the SoCal range complex for testing. But those are clearly about going somewhere, this one, at least at first glance, is more like a holding box sandwiched between two of the most highly prized military training areas in the United States. Although, because of this, it could be used as a far shorter ‘bridge’ itself. In fact, it connects the R-2508 complex and the NTTR at their closest points. A very low-res image posted by Edwards AFB in the past shows the proximity of the R-2508 complex (lower left cluster) and the NTTR (middle right cluster). The ALTRV does seem to connect the two together at their closest point., USAF So there is always the possibility that this temporary airspace reservation could act as a small bridge between the MOAs around China Lake and the NTTR, supporting the movement of aircraft flying from one base, such as NAWS China Lake or Edwards AFB, into the NTTR and vice-versa. It would seem odd to do such a thing for normal manned combat aircraft, though. So this could be especially useful for transiting unmanned systems or other clandestine aircraft between the two range complexes. It’s worth noting that the NTTR houses Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport, among other special aviation testing locales. We have heard in the past that similar boxes of airspace in that same area have been set up for Red Flag exercise operations . Supposedly, aggressors would use them to hold before infiltrating towards the ‘blue team’ from a unique vector. This is likely something of a ‘wild card’ training tactic that helps challenge players to expect the unexpected. Yet from what we know, there isn’t a Red Flag ongoing at this time, with the last one just wrapping up on August 6th. That doesn’t mean the ranges won’t be used for very high-end training and testing events, and those evolutions could include similar surprise aggressor tactics. Even the Air Force’s most cutting-edge integrated testing events, such as Black and Orange Flags, have been combined on some occasions and use large force employment (LFE) wargame-like scenarios to maximize realism as new systems and tactics are pressed to their limit. You can read all about that in these past features of ours . Finally, it could also be an ideal spot for a high-altitude platform to orbit while linking aircraft flying in each range complex together via a communications gateway or supporting those activities with onboard surveillance systems. So, we really have no idea what the restriction will be used for in the witching hour on Thursday night, but whatever it is should be comfortable cruising above 45,000 feet.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Surface-Launched Version Of The Tomcat’s AIM-54 Phoenix Missile Nearly Armed Cold War Carriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Cold War-era AIM-54 Phoenix long-range air-to-air missile , the primary fleet air defense armament of its F-14 Tomcat interceptors for four decades, was also adapted for surface launch from warships. The little-known Sea Phoenix project also involved installing the F-14’s fire-control radar on a ship and progressed as far as missile test launches. The Sea Phoenix concept had emerged by the mid-1970s and was proposed as an alternative or a replacement for the early versions of the Sea Sparrow , which was another adaptation of an air-to-air missile for fleet defense. At that time, the air-launched AIM-54 was already in frontline use on the Navy’s F-14 fighters , coupled with the powerful AN/AWG-9 pulse-Doppler fire-control radar system as part of a sophisticated defense, primarily intended to defeat Soviet naval cruise missiles, and the long-range aircraft that carried them. The massive AIM-54A Phoenix on a ground handling trolley., U.S. Navy The origins of the Phoenix and the AWG-9 date back beyond the F-14 and can be found in the Navy’s Bendix AAM-N-10 Eagle and the Air Force’s Hughes GAR-9 , two similar, but ultimately abortive long-range air-to-air missile programs. Superseding these, Hughes Aircraft began development of the Phoenix in 1962, and a first full-scale test of the missile was achieved on September 8, 1966, from an NA-3A Skywarrior over the Navy Pacific Missile Range. The AIM-54A became operational with the Navy’s F-14As in 1974. The first launch of an AIM-54A Phoenix air-to-air missile from an NA-3A Skywarrior testbed, on September 8, 1966., U.S. Navy While Tomcats launched from the deck of aircraft carriers were intended to provide an outer layer of protection for Carrier Battle Groups, the Sea Phoenix would have been installed on the carriers themselves, providing a closer, but still long-range defensive ring against any aircraft or missiles that may have made it through. The plan was to install three launchers on each carrier so equipped, to provide full 360-degree coverage for each ship. Each of those systems would have been a standalone item , combining a fixed 12-cell launcher for Phoenix missiles, an AWG-9 radar, plus the various controls and displays required to operate it. The USN looked at the idea of a ship version of the AWG-9 /Phoenix combination.Test of the radar was done in the USNS Wheeling in 74 and a missile was fired in a ground test a China Lake. Three radars boxes each with 12 cell launchers was the setup for the big carriers. #aviation pic.twitter.com/kzeTMQQb1Y — The Shadow of the Eagle (@clemente3000) February 27, 2021 Installing the Sea Phoenix on a carrier, or on another warship, for that matter, was not expected to pose too many problems. According to Hughes Aircraft, responsible for building both the AIM-54 and the AWG-9, a full 27 of the 29 major components of the system could be added to a warship, with next to no modifications required. The advantages of the Sea Phoenix would have included the ability to engage multiple targets simultaneously. After all, the AWG-9 was capable of tracking up to 24 targets simultaneously in track-while-scan mode and then engaging six of these with Phoenix missiles. That number was limited by the six AIM-54s that each F-14 could carry (reduced to four missiles for routine carrier-based operations), but potentially more targets could have been engaged using the Sea Phoenix system with its greater ‘magazine depth.’ An AIM-54 Phoenix destroys a QF-4 drone in 1983., U.S. Navy The AIM-54 also offered very impressive performance for a missile at this time. In its original AIM-54A form, the weapon had an air-launched range of up to around 72.5 nautical miles and it could hit a top speed of Mach 4.3. However, this would have been reduced in surface-launched form, with the air-launched model gaining extra reach thanks to the speed and altitude of the launching aircraft. In comparison, the air-launched AIM-7F Sparrow has a range of approximately 38 nautical miles, which is slashed to around 14 nautical for the Sea Sparrow’s RIM-7P missile. Nevertheless, despite the range penalty of the surface-launched AIM-54, which weighed a hefty 1,000 pounds, it’s clear that its performance would have far outstripped that of the Sea Sparrow in terms of range. An RIM-7P Sea Sparrow missile launches from the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)., U.S. NAVY For shorter-range engagements, the air-launched AIM-54 employed active radar homing for the duration of its flight and this would likely have been the case for the shipborne version, too. The minimum engagement range for air-launch was around 2 nautical miles. The original plans called for the Phoenix/AWG-9 combination to be installed on warships with little changes made to them but, “at a later stage, the system could be further enhanced by applying missile modifications to optimize it for the naval role,” according to the 1977 edition of Jane’s Weapon Systems . Unconfirmed accounts suggest there was a plan to install an additional booster stage, to address the reduction in range after surface launch, and this might have been the modifications referred to. A Sea Sparrow shot from the USS Midway (CV-41) in the early 1980s. Note the manned missile director position, located on the lower corner of the flight deck, on the left of the photo., U.S. Navy Tests of the surface-launched Phoenix missile included a firing from what was then known as Naval Weapons Center China Lake, in California, during which a standard version of the missile traveled a distance of 13.5 miles in 90 seconds. This test, however, was less concerned with evaluating end-to-end performance than it was the separation of the missile from its launcher, as well as safety aspects. If they did occur, no other such tests appear to have been documented. Meanwhile, the 14th production example of the AWG-9 radar was installed aboard the missile-tracking ship USNS Wheeling , in 1974, where it “successfully detected and tracked multiple targets at both high and low altitude from the ship’s deck,” according to a report in the United States Army Combat Forces Journal . “In multiple target tests,” the report continued, “five aircraft were flown in the target area and successfully tracked.” USNS Wheeling (T-AGM-8), in a 1973 photo provided by the Pacific Missile Range Headquarters, Point Mugu, California., U.S. Navy Unconfirmed reports suggest the AWG-9 radar was also tested on land, in a container van setup, at Point Mugu, California. This was likely in relation to a possible land-based mobile version of the Phoenix, reportedly intended for the U.S. Marine Corps. Few, if any details about this program are readily available, although it could perhaps have provided a notably potent air defense capability for the service’s expeditionary operations. While the Sea Phoenix would also have offered much more in the way of anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense capabilities than the Sea Sparrow, it seems that its development was abandoned due to the high costs involved. In addition, while the Sea Sparrow provided an intermediate to close-range point-defense capability, the same was not the case for the Sea Phoenix, which was by no means a dogfight missile and would have been of limited value against close-in, maneuvering threats. The AWG-9 radars, mounted low on the carrier’s sides, would be severely limited at detecting low-flying threats over the horizon. It could also be argued that, with escort warships and F-14s already providing a robust outer defensive layer, there was not a pressing need for this same capability to be replicated aboard the carrier itself. An F-14A Tomcat of VF-201 fires an AIM-54 missile in 1987., U.S. Navy Still, had the Navy pursued the Sea Phoenix, the service could well have ended up with a very capable air defense system, the self-contained nature of which could have meant it would have been able to be added to existing warships fairly easily. It could have also provided a useful intermediate capability between the Sea Sparrow and other point-defense systems and the long-range Aegis system with its Standard missiles . Nevertheless, with Aegis around the corner, the value of the Sea Phoenix’s multi-target, long-range engagement capability was reduced accordingly. Meanwhile, the Sea Sparrow also gained a multi-target capability after the introduction of multiple illuminators and full integration with the ship’s combat system. Today, the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile is far more capable than the RIM-7, but leverages its same infrastructure. A manual Sea Sparrow missile director aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) in 1982., U.S. National Archives In the event, the Navy’s aircraft carriers were left with the Sea Sparrow to protect them against close-to-medium-range threats, with outer-tier defense left to other assets. As for the Navy’s air-launched Phoenix, it was retired from service in 2004, long after the apparent demise of the Soviet cruise missile threat. With all this in mind, the surface-launched sister missile to the AIM-54 remains little known but is certainly an intriguing case of “what might have been,” had the Navy chosen to pursue it.

Kevin Noonan,"Posted on Dec 21, 2020",Veteran S-3 Viking Crewman Breaks Down Everything Happening In This E-2 Hawkeye Carrier Launch Video,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It really is a dance. Mostly described as a ballet. But I think we think only of the movements of the flight deck crews and aircraft. No. The dance is also in the cockpit and back-seat aircrew positions. It is in the head of the pilot sitting upfront having to pirouette through years of training and checklists and procedures. It is in the cognitively processed verbalizations spoken through a routine connection from one brain to others—from one who sees to the others who cannot. This video is a tale told many times every day somewhere on the oceans of the world. A short, simple story of the movement of a machine and the men and women trying to safely make their way through well-orchestrated chaos while maintaining control of their aircraft and of themselves. While a video, it is mostly about spoken words—primarily the pilot’s monologue—over the ICS (Inter Communications System). The words are simple. But they are words designed to keep the crewmembers, who are a captive audience sitting in the back of the aircraft, aware of each movement and choreographed event that occurs, from the removal of chocks and chains to the separation of aircraft from the aircraft carrier. I have never flown in a Grumman E-2C Hawkeye . I have, however, flown many hours in the S-3 Viking . One day, on the way out to my own aircraft, I followed the crew of a Hawkeye who were also launching from the deck of the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71). With their permission, I took a moment to peek inside of this incredible airborne early warning (AEW) stalwart of Naval Aviation that has been flying since October of 1960. I am certainly not qualified to tell the story of this video from their perspective. I am, however, still able to remember the complexity, the intensity, the adrenalin, and the variety of emotions this crew is experiencing after having done so myself over 200 times. While viewing this short 10-minute and 46-second video, listen carefully to the words spoken. As you listen to those words, focus on the tones, the sounds, the attitudes, and the motive-power of what occurs when a naval aircraft makes its way from one point to the other across the flight deck of a bustling US Navy aircraft carrier. You are about to get a glimpse into a most incredible relationship that has been built on a 100-year-long foundation of ideas, of mishaps, of the loss of great men, and of late, women. A relationship also built of blood, sweat, and untold oceans of tears, resolve, trust—deep, deep trust—love of the profession, attention to detail, and devotion to the safety and care of fellow shipmates. Now for the video, let the dance begin: Okay, so the first thing you see is how the video is being shot from a GoPro camera attached to the helmet of the E-2C’s pilot sitting on the left side of the cockpit. Immediately obvious and a little disconcerting is the windscreen full of Super Hornet. Between the stubby nose of the Hawkeye and the sharp leading edges of the F/A-18E’s right-wing and stores’ pylons, a brilliantly colored “yellow shirt” flight deck plane director stands ready to initiate the dance. The first thing the pilot tells his captive, unseeing audience in the back of the Hawkeye is that the carrier’s yellow shirt has taken over from the squadron’s brown-shirted plane captain and has sent the brown shirt and possibly a squadron green-shirt (maintenance personnel) under the aircraft to “break down” the chains and pull the wheel chocks holding the E-2 to the flight deck. Once removed, and if the carrier deck is moving a lot due to the state of the sea, the backseaters’ stomachs might feel like that moment you first step out onto the ice with a pair of ice skates you haven’t worn since that winter a hundred years ago. Note the flow of the yellow shirt’s arms. This may or may not be the first launch of the day. But the Hawkeye is almost always first to get airborne. Back in my day, the S-3 tended to join her on one of the four catapults. The E-2, once at altitude, would paint an aerial picture for the carrier battle group while the Viking would paint a surface picture . Today, in the absence of the S-3 , the Hawkeye is the only aircraft in the carrier air wing with a powerful airborne radar capable of surveilling huge geographical swathes, which the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) now relies on to paint both the much-needed air and sea pictures. The cabin of the E-2 Hawkeye., USN I hope you catch the sometimes-jovial, sometimes-salty comments of the crew throughout the video. These guys and gals have clearly been doing this same type of flight for a long time (as you’ll hear). They are fighting boredom. They are fighting fatigue that comes with repetition and boredom—regardless of how many hours they may have slept. They are fighting a mental malaise of sorts that can kill all of them, and potentially many more on the flight deck, in an “aircraft carrier second.” The simplest thing can go wrong and might have gone wrong seven times before without sparking an emotion. But now, on its eighth occurrence, it will set one of the crew off on a brief ICS-tirade. The humor and anger are personality-driven. As with life all over our planet, we have and encounter all kinds of personalities. But there are those uncanny individuals who navigate the US Navy’s version of Bill Murray’s Groundhog Day with a strong sense of humor, dragging a reluctant smile out of even the sourest of sailors. It is these individuals who are the genuine heroes of the global war against boredom. Our pilot in this video is one such great soul. Then it happens. The pilot is instructed to release the brakes and the yellow shirt does the unthinkable—something that made my heart run up into my throat the first time I saw this video: he directs the Hawkeye forward ! Holy shit! They’re already parked danger-close to the Hornet. IT’S DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM! After my heart rate slowed to a reasonable rate and migrated back into my chest, I had to take into account that neither of the front-seaters made any protest, but simply complied with the yellow shirt’s directional commands. THIS is an aircraft carrier flight deck! As the E-2 creeps forward, the yellow shirt’s hands don’t demand the pilot put on the brakes to prevent the crunching of the two very expensive aircraft. Instead, he circles his hands then starts pushing the air back at the Hawkeye. What the…? Here is the second ‘holy shit!’ moment: as nonchalantly as if the pilot just ordered a double Frappuccino at Starbucks, he describes for the backseaters how he is being told to back the aircraft up. I had no earthly idea—even after four years on sea duty on three aircraft carriers—that an E-2 could go backward on its own! And I’m not the only one who is surprised. Narratively, the pilot points out that some of the flight deck crew were as dumbfounded as I. But everything is planned for on a carrier’s flight deck. Obviously, even with that cute side mirror, the pilots can’t see a damn thing when backing up. The yellow shirt, too, has limited vision and is relying on others to assist, providing a watchful eye from key locations around the aircraft, ready to signal an immediate stop. It is kinda funny, however, as they continue to be directed backward, how the crew comments on how long and far the aircraft is being sent in that awkward direction. Now, let me highlight something the pilot says here, perhaps the most critical of the vocalizations offered throughout his monologue: he tells the crew that they “ are backing off of Cat 2; looking like we’re going to Cat 1. ” The backseaters may have been made aware of where their aircraft was parked during the briefing in the Ready Room. This awareness would be reinforced when they came up onto the flight deck and walked to the aircraft. However, once they’ve climbed inside the cocoon-like fuselage of the Hawkeye and begin to conduct their individual preflights, equipment power-up, and operational checks, their very limited view and very limited perspective of a rapidly changing outside world only contribute to the depletion of their positional and situational awareness. Once, with our very whiny auxiliary power unit yelling insults into the night air, I was so engrossed in my internal avionics-tunnel preflight, which consisted primarily of watching our maintenance guys swapping out broken “black” boxes, I completely missed the fact that my aircraft had been towed from the bow to just behind the waist catapult jet-blast deflectors (JBD) on the angle-deck. An E-2C taxis on the USS Harry S. Truman. , USN So the pilot reminds them where they are and where they are probably going. This is so important in the event of an emergency. If you’ve seen any of the videos of aircraft crashes on aircraft carrier flight decks, routes of escape can quickly be marginalized and an unaware backseater needs to know precisely what is going on around them and exactly where they are in order to effect a successful egress and escape. For example, if I’m told we’re passing the carrier’s island to our right on the way to the bow catapults and an aircraft on Cat 3 explodes, engulfing my airplane in, initially, superficial flames, I know a ground egress through the S-3’s crew hatch (on the right front of the aircraft) will have me running in the direction of the island. Once at the island, I can then get behind it to protect myself from the conflagration, finish wetting my pants, and then, possibly, participate in fighting the fires as all good sailors should do. Another thing I want you to notice is that life doesn’t stop for the rest of the crew while the aircraft is taxiing to a catapult. Notice how a backseater asks the front seaters for some sort of input information, probably the GPS/Inertial Navigation System. Then notice, in the midst of the aircraft not only backing up, but backing to the left, which is swinging the nose of the aircraft to the right, how easily the right seat pilot complies with the request. Tons and tons of things are all going on at once, on the flight deck as well as in the minds of these crewmembers, yet their training, mental acuity, and professionalism allow them to perform layers of tasks in what is the genuine definition of “multi-tasking.” Such amazing souls. “Coming forward now. Heading straight toward the catapult one JBD… right turn, slightly more right turn heading toward an elevator. I’ve got a jet off to the right turning, so we’re going to get some exhaust…” This pilot is brilliant. He is describing even the smallest adjustments to the direction of the aircraft. “Getting a left turn setting us up for catapult one… we, upfront, are now crossing the JBD.” Now, there are two reasons why the pilot has made this important statement about crossing the “JBD” or Jet Blast Deflector—the large plate-like structure that rises behind an aircraft during launch to deflect the blast from its engines or propellers away from everything behind it. Think of it as a threshold point. Not quite a point-of-no-return, but an important escalation of flight crew awareness. The JBD is a huge slab of steel that flips up from being flush with the deck so as to block an aircraft’s dangerous exhaust during launch., USN First, crossing the JBD is a signal for the mindset to change, particularly the mindset of the crew in the back. It is a warning to finish up what you are doing, store those items that may become FOD in the cockpit (Foreign Object Debris—or what, essentially, could become a missile when your aircraft goes from zero to 120 knots in two to three seconds), and adjust your thinking to the potentially life-threatening catapult launch. I’m not sure what happens in the back of the E-2, so let me tell you what I would be doing at this point in the S-3: -INCOS tray (essentially a computer keyboard): stowed up and locked. -Body position: adjust to ensure I’m in the proper body position (although I should already be there) should we have to eject. -Harness: locked. -Shoulder straps/leg straps: pull, ensuring they are as tight as I can stand (ejection seat-slap can break a femur). -Helmet visor: down. -Flight gloves: on, if they aren’t already. The Nomex flight suit and gloves will protect an aircrew member from flash fire or the rocket motor of a simultaneously firing ejection seat. -ICS control: switch from hot mic to push-to-talk so when the aircraft goes to full throttle, the engine noise won’t bleed into my boom mic and over the ICS creating unnecessary confusion and noise in the cockpit at one of the most critical moments in aircraft carrier aviation. -Mouth: shut. They don’t need any unnecessary talking in their helmets. -Ears: wide open to listen (listening, intently, to the front seaters talk through checklists, weight boards, wing unfolding). The second reason why it is so important for the pilot to announce that the aircraft is crossing the JBD is that it might accidentally be raised as the aircraft is passing over it. JBDs are very quick, powerful, hydraulically actuated hunks of steel that will easily slice the fragile aluminum skin of an aircraft in half, rupturing fuel tanks as well as human flesh. Sadly, I have heard several stories of JBDs being lowered on unaware flight deck crew. E-2 moving into launch position aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. , USN “Here is our weight board person… weight board person should be showing us a five, four, zero, zero… zero. I see it; I like it.” The flight deck catapult weight board. It can kill you. It has killed. As a SENSO (Sensor Operator) in the S-3, I didn’t care about calculating the weight of my aircraft prior to launch. That’s that pilot shit that pilots do. Besides, I’m shitty at math. But I am deeply invested in knowing what our weight is and hearing my front seaters acknowledge that they see those exact numbers on the weight board. Notice I said front seaters—plural. Both of them need to agree that the aircraft carrier’s catapult crewmember has dialed in the correct weight (as the E-2’s right-seat pilot did). If the weight is too high, the power of the steam catapult may rip the nose gear off. If it’s too low, then the odds are very good that as the aircraft reaches the end-of-the-bow or angle deck, it is going swimming. A green shirt showing the weight board for an aircraft about to launch., USN As a result of this “cold cat” situation, the crewmembers of a Viking, for example, would be taking a rocket ride up and then parachute ride down to a swim of their own. In the case of the Hawkeye, the aircrew must wait for their bird to stop flying and begin swimming so all five can get the hell out through the top of the aircraft—there are no ejection seats. Even then , if every one of the flight crew is in agreement that the weight board is correct there is still no guarantee that the other flight deck catapult crewmember who enters the aircraft weight from the weight board into the power-setting of the catapult will do so correctly. Remember my point above about “trust— deep trust”? Our friend Ward Carroll with a bit more on Cold Cats if you are interested: As they’re taxiing up to Cat 1, note the almost mesmerizing hum of the Hawkeye’s engines. The Viking’s TF34s were very noisy, even through our protective helmet-headphones. One thing I noticed, as the E-2 is sitting there waiting for the launch process to happen, is how the pilots have their hands on the instrument panel glare shield and sometimes make gestures with them above it. It brought back to memory how my pilots repeatedly talked about how critical it was not to make any hand movements above the glare shield. These hand gestures might be interpreted by the flight deck catapult crew as a salute, inadvertently launching your aircraft when you are, in fact, not ready. Of course, this was a rule that came into play when the aircraft was at full power in catapult tension. Note, at this point of the video, how the yellow shirt straddling the catapult finishes her directions and then walks off to the left with her arms and hands tucked against her float coat. This is a sign of a great yellow shirt who knows any movement of her arms could be misinterpreted by the cockpit crew as a signal. “Alright, we’re lined up on Cat 1.” At this point you have heard the backseaters dealing with some problems related to their jobs as Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Airborne Early Warning (AEW) directors. In the S-3, we had two ICS channels (if memory serves). While the aircraft is on the flight deck we were all up on the primary ICS channel. So, I find it interesting that the backseaters are already flying the upcoming mission and it is “bleeding” into the pilot’s conversation up front. Now, there is a critical tone change. This change of tone is a rapid recitation of more items on the checklist to ensure that the aircraft is ready to fly. The tone change is equivalent to a Catholic school nun’s tapping of her ruler on the desk to get her student’s undivided attention. For the kids, divided attention means an aching welt on the upper surface of the hand. For the aircrew, divided attention could result in the loss of their lives. The pilot’s recitation is so rapid that, for me—three decades since, I can’t understand much of what he is saying. Back then, I would be hanging on every word, even though I’d heard it so many times before. “We should be getting a wingspread maybe…” “Yep… I’m clear on the left to spread.” “Clear, right.” Wing fold. That awe-inspiring, exciting and terrifying phenomenon of Naval Aviation. I never recall hearing my pilots call the area “clear” for the folding or unfolding of the S-3’s wings which were already high above the deck when fully spread. On the other hand, a Hawkeye’s wing fold/unfold configuration makes sense. Leroy Grumman’s fantastical wing folding system, which he purportedly designed while sitting at a table with a chalkboard eraser and paperclip in hand, is a sight to behold. Because of its range of motion, it makes sense that you hear the pilots check to make sure the area visible to them is clear. Notice how the pilot waits for the white shirts (final-checkers who sometimes have a black checkerboard painted on their white shirts) to give him a thumbs-up signal that the wings are locked. Apparently, the E-2 has an indicator on the leading edge of the wing fold point to indicate a locked wing, whereas the S-3 had two holes underneath each wing that the final-checkers could peer through to confirm that each wing was properly locked. Those holes were not originally there. As the tragic story goes, my squadron, the “Scouts” of VS-24, had a wing-fold-in-flight mishap shortly after a January 26, 1983, launch from the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) while in the Mediterranean Sea. Only one crewmember, Lieutenant Tim Dumbauld, the Tactical Coordinator (TACCO), successfully ejected and survived. It was fate: the left wing folded, causing the aircraft to rapidly roll off to the left and then tumble out of control. During the four-man ejection sequence, the backseaters go first, followed by the front a fraction of a second later. Because he was in the right-rear seat, he was on the top of the roll which kept his ejection seat in the envelope long enough for him to survive. The pilot, Lieutenant Commander Randy Dixon, the Co-Tactical Coordinator, Lieutenant Pete Moller, and the SENSO, AW2 Richard Lanzendorf, were all out of the ejection envelope and were killed. Because he survived, Lieutenant Dumbauld saved the lives of an unknown number of S-3 Viking crewmembers. He was able to tell investigators what had happened and after testing the mechanism, the holes were drilled in the aluminum skin to allow viewing of the locking mechanism. Remember my point above about “…mishaps; the loss of great men; of blood…”? E-2C unfolding its wings while moving into position on Cat 1. , USN I might have missed it, but I found the pilot’s “wipeout” peculiar. A wipeout is a checking of all of the Hawkeye’s control surfaces by moving the yoke in all directions. The E-2 pilot did it just after the wings were spread. My pilot normally did this when in catapult tension and at full power to ensure he felt that all the controls were working. Very odd. The final takeoff checklist items are recited. And then you hear a noticeable “Whhooooosssshhh!” try to overtake the pilot’s communication. Somebody’s hot mic starts bleeding over the ICS. Uhhhggg! That thing I hate. Notice how quickly they identify the problem and the guilty backseater assures the pilot: “Yeah, I’m trying to fix it.” “Looks like Mom has stabled out… two five zero-ish.” “Mom.” That’s what we call our aircraft carriers, with all the implied and intended affection. And that is what she is. Now the pilot is transitioning to mission mode. He is still fully invested in a successful launch, but now he is informing the backseaters that the carrier, which all along has been gently turning into the wind, has possibly settled onto a final bearing for the launch and recovery of her chicks. By informing them of the “250ish” heading, he is also providing tactical situational awareness for the crew as they fly off into their mission. The all-important “ish” is the pilot’s way of confirming that the boat might still be in search of that final bearing, however. The directing yellow shirt signals that the E-2 on Cat 1 is going into tension and passes off responsibility for the aircraft to the Shooter. “We’re going into tension…” The pilot pushes the throttle forward to full power. More checklist items are completed as they scan the instruments to ensure the engines are working and the aircraft is ready. “I like it.” “I like it.” “We like it in the rear.” Thumbs-up all around just moments before a Hawkeye gets catapulted off the deck., USN That final acknowledgment is absolutely critical. The backseaters are part of the team. They must “like it” as well if the aircraft is going to go flying. With the onset of full power, they may see, smell or hear things the pilots, at that moment, cannot. Smoke, fuel leaking, electrical sparking, or an odd sound of the engines or aircraft are all things they are in a unique position to experience and communicate to the front seaters. In the S-3, the “We like it…” wasn’t something we verbalized. Because of our proximity to the front of the aircraft, the CoTAC (or co-pilot) simply had to turn his head and see me and the TACCO holding a thumbs up to know we were ready and the back of the aircraft was good. “Giving him a salute. He [the Shooter] is looking around. He’s looking aft… He’s looking back at us. He’s touched the deck.” Damn! I love this guy! Complete, detailed information for the three blind mice in the back. Communication just doesn’t get any better! The salute is key. It tells the Shooter that your multi-million dollar, many-thousand-pound aircraft is ready to go flying. This is why I made that point, above, about keeping your hands below the instrument glare shield. At night, since no one can see much of anything, in lieu of a salute, the pilot will turn on the aircraft’s navigation and anti-collision lights to inform the Shooter that the aircraft is ready. I won’t take the time, here, to discuss what it’s like taking off and landing on an aircraft carrier at night, under EMCON (electromagnetic emissions control similar to radio silence) conditions… with NO LIGHTS allowed. I only did it once during flight ops in the North Atlantic under simulated wartime conditions. I will tell you, however, that it scared the shit out of me. Then, the joy ride—the one they pay you to take—begins. “Oh yeah!” An E-2 mid-cat shot., USN When you live and fly with the same, relatively small group of people over and over, you get used to their voices and the moods those voices can convey. 54,000 pounds of E-2 going down the relatively short distance of the bow of an aircraft carrier instills its own set of emotions. But, as a backseater, you’re scanning that tone of voice to detect the slightest hesitation, fear, concern… or joy because of another great catapult shot. I was used to hearing my pilots say: “Good shot!” Of course, after your first few shots, the feel becomes muscle memory and despite not being able to see much from the backseat, you do know it is good. “Oh yeah!” is a good sound to hear. Note, almost as soon as the aircraft is off the pointy end of the carrier, the pilot enters a “clearing turn.” After he is sure the aircraft is actually going to fly, he enters into either a right (when launching off the bow) or left turn (launching off the waist or angle) to ensure there are no mid-air collisions between aircraft that are launching simultaneously. If you don’t, the Air Boss will be reminding you, as only an angry father can, that you forgot to perform the critical turn. An E-2C gets airborne., USN Just a few other notes. Notice that the Hawkeye stayed relatively low until reaching the point of the escorting cruiser. I can’t speak to this mission, specifically, but we might have done so under EMCON conditions to keep an enemy radar from detecting a number of aircraft popping up on their screens from one specific locale which would give away the carrier’s position. Also, notice how quickly radar/IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) information started coming from the backseaters. Now, once airborne, it was our turn to help the pilots maintain situational awareness of the very busy and crowded skies they were flying us off into.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 22, 2021",These Contenders Are Vying To Replace The Navy’s T-45 Goshawk With A New Jet Trainer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is set to pick between options from at least three manufacturers as it seeks to replace its T-45 Goshawk with a new advanced jet trainer. Offerings from Boeing, Leonardo, and Lockheed Martin are all in the running for the Navy’s Undergraduate Jet Training System (UJTS), which is set to be introduced as part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way the service trains its Naval Aviators. Two U.S. manufacturers confirmed to Janes today that they would be competing to supersede the T-45, with Boeing pitching a version of the T-7A Red Hawk that’s been selected as the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation jet trainer . Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin will again team up with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to offer the T-50A . If either of those jets is chosen, the Navy will get its hands on its first supersonic advanced jet trainer. A T-45C Goshawk assigned to Training Air Wing 1 prepares to launch from the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) during a training exercise in the Atlantic Ocean. , U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Joseph E. Montemarano The T-7A beat the T-50A for the Air Force’s T-X requirement , which also saw the Leonardo M-346 Master rejected. Not surprisingly, the M-346 is the Leonardo entrant for the Navy trainer competition, the Italian firm’s bid being formally announced at the Sea Air Space 2021 maritime exposition, which took place from August 2-4, at the Gaylord National Convention Center, Maryland. After losing T-X, however, the T-50A received an apparent lifeline from the Air Force when the service decided to look at buying a small number of the jets off the shelf, as part of its ongoing studies into its future pilot training syllabus. That plan was then thwarted when the Air Force announced it would instead hold an open competition . According to a Boeing presentation circulating in the public domain, and dated April last year, the Navy’s Red Hawk is designated T-7B, by the company at least, and is intended to have a cost per flying hour of $7,200, compared to $10,700 for the T-45C. Changes that would be made compared to the land-based variant include increased internal fuel capacity, while there are options for wingtip stations to mount captive AIM-9X missiles or ACMI pods for adversary missions , as well as an internal infrared search and track (IRST) system. The cockpit would be reconfigurable to replicate the F/A-18E/F Block III or the F-35 , while a jamming pod would be another option for red air work. This information very well could have changed, but gives an overall idea of the transformative capabilities a Navy T-7 could provide. So far, it’s not clear what kinds of changes would be incorporated in the Navy version of the T-50A. However, a Lockheed Martin official told Janes that the company was offering “modest modifications to the baseline T-50A” to meet the requirements in the service’s request for information. Moreover, it’s possible that differences between the Navy’s chosen jet trainer and its land-based counterpart will be generally limited. After all, as The War Zone has discussed in depth in the past , the service is not looking for an aircraft that can perform catapult launches or arrested landings aboard aircraft carriers, as the T-45 can. Instead, the new aircraft is required only to perform touch-and-gos on flattops, to familiarize aviators with the basics of shipborne operations. Meanwhile, there could also be other potential candidates for UJTS, although realistically they only have an outside chance. The British manufacturer BAE Systems was responsible for the T-45 Goshawk design that was produced in collaboration with McDonnell Douglas ( later Boeing ) as a highly modified, carrier-capable version of the Hawk. BAE Systems still builds the Hawk, in its second-generation Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT) iteration. The Hawk AJT was not offered for T-X, BAE Systems instead deciding that the Air Force specification demanded an all-new design and, in the UJTS category, the British design is likely also unable to meet adversary performance requirements. Perhaps the most surprising apparent entrant in the UJTS competition is the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Light Combat Aircraft, or LCA, which is operated by the Indian Air Force as the Tejas. While the Indian Navy has already rejected a navalized LCA as a potential carrier-based combat jet, HAL has flown a two-seat LCA Navy prototype and the aircraft seems to have been offered to the U.S. Navy as a trainer, although its chances of success must be considered extremely slim. A two-seat HAL LCA Navy prototype takes off from the Shore Based Test Facility at INS Hansa, Goa, in 2014., Indian Navy With the U.S. Air Force having said it will buy at least 351 examples of the T-7A, and possibly up to 475, this option as the basis for UJTS could make the most sense fiscally. A significant production run planned at St. Louis, Missouri, would help with economies of scale and there would likely be a degree of commonality across synthetic training, maintenance, and logistics. However, the cost won’t be the only factor that’s under scrutiny. The request for information posted by NAVAIR on May 14 last year makes it clear that a non-developmental aircraft is required and that, while it won’t have to be fully carrier compatible, it will need to make touch-and-gos on deck, as well as perform Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) — essentially the same thing, but on a land-based airfield. How the aircraft deals with high sink rate landings, and lots of them, will be critical, but eliminating the stresses of arrested landings and catapult launches will greatly reduce the modifications needed for existing designs. Field Carrier Landing Practice is a fundamental part of naval training and not just for student aviators. Here an EA-18G Growler lands during an FCLP at an outlying landing field attached to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Marc Cuenca The Navy says it expects each UJTS aircraft to complete 400 flight hours each year, in the process recording around 1,200 FCLP landings ashore, as well as up to 45 touch-and-gos on actual carriers. Whatever option is selected for UJTS, it’s becoming increasingly clear that replacement of the T-45 is becoming a priority for the Navy. These jets, around 194 of which are in service, were once planned for withdrawal in 2018, before it was decided to extend their service life through 2042. In the meantime, readiness rates have worsened, and between 2016 and 2017, the jet also suffered a number of high-profile hypoxia incidents, the cause of which turned out to be a complex combination of factors . Boeing’s T-7A Red Hawk in U.S. Air Force markings., BOEING On the other hand, Boeing’s T-7B proposal from last year involves only a “partial T-45C replacement,” with the aircraft also being used for adversary air missions. The third part of its mission would be “tactical auxiliary” — downloading training hours from expensive-to-operate F/A-18s and F-35s and preserving these frontline combat jet’s precious airframe hours. The adversary portion of the UJTS program could also have a significant influence on the design that gets chosen. The demand for red air is only set to grow and the performance demands of adversary jets are increasing, too. This would seem to play to the strengths of the T-50A and T-7 in particular, both of which offer fighter-like performance, although the lower-performing M-346 is also already in regular use as an aggressor platform , too. Whichever jet is chosen, it could help eventually replace the Navy and Marine Corps F-5 fleet, despite fleet expansion and upgrades that are already in the works for those jets. In the meantime, to meet a voracious appetite for red air work in the community, the Navy is adding surplus USAF F-16s for adversary duties, too, a process you can read more about here . Currently, there is no publicly available schedule to indicate when the Navy might select a new trainer and when it might start purchasing them. However, the service has said it wants to start replacing the first T-45s around 2028. In its proposal, Boeing projects that it could deliver a first example of the T-7B to the Navy as early as June 2025. With that aggressive timeline in mind, we might not have to wait too long until a T-45 successor is selected. Editor’s note: Updated to mention Boeing’s plans for its Navy T-7 could have changed from the basic information in the public domain from last year.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 31, 2021",F-15 Uses New Infrared Pod To Shoot Down Target F-16 With AIM-120 Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s push to get Infrared Search and Track (IRST) systems to its F-15C/D Eagle cadre , and other jets in the future, hit a huge milestone on August 5, 2021, when an Eagle from Eglin Air Force Base’s 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron shot down a QF-16 Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) with an AIM-120 missile using its IRST for targeting. The Legion Pod-equipped F-15C has already proven itself in tests when employing the shorter-ranged AIM-9X Sidewinder, but not the AIM-120 AMRAAM , which is the Eagle’s beyond-visual-range weapon. Major Brian Davis, 85th TES Chief of Air-to-Air Weapons and Tactics, stated the following in an Air Force release: “This successful live missile test is significant because an F-15 equipped with an IRST-cued AIM-120 allows us to achieve detection, tracking, targeting, weapons employment, and verification of an intercept without being dependent upon RADAR energy… It’s also not susceptible to radiofrequency jamming or a target’s low observable design.” The testing of the F-15’s IRST has been ongoing for years, including at huge exercises like Cope North, as seen here in 2019., USAF The ability to detect, track, sort, and even identify aerial targets without using radar at beyond-visual-ranges is a massive upgrade for the mighty Eagle and comes at a time when stealthy aircraft and cruise missiles are beginning to proliferate around the globe . The Air Force is already rushing to modify its high-end training to confront this reality, but the IRST, with its detection capabilities uninfluenced by low-observable (stealthy) radar-evading designs, can’t come soon enough. The passive nature of the sensor—unlike radar, it gives off no electromagnetic radiation—also provides for a whole new set of tactics that can really challenge an enemy’s ability to detect and locate fighter aircraft leveraging the IRST, especially when paired with electronic warfare. The F-15C/D’s AN/APG-63V3 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) still provides the AIM-120 mid-course updates of target telemetry garnered from the IRST and sent via the datalink from the radar itself, but apparently, that is very hard to detect. The Air Force is already testing the Legion Pod-equipped IRST on its F-16s, which, combined with their new AESA radar, will give a major boost in air-to-air prowess to the aging fighters. F-16s have been playing with various iterations of the IRST21 sensor—the same one found in the F-15C/D’s Legion Pod—in podded form for about a decade, some of which has been done for clandestine research and development . An IRST capability also appears to be a primary sensor option for the Skyborg autonomous drone program. You can read more about this development here and here . Test F-16D equipped with the Legion Pod on its right chin intake hardpoint. , USAF The two together, AESAs and IRSTs, really are more than the sum of their parts as each sensor can support the other. For instance, the IRST may be able to detect a low-observable target long before the radar can, but once its bearing and elevation are known, the AESA can try to detect it with a very powerful and focused radar beam. Likewise, the IRST can help maintain tracking and provide identification for the AESA radar, and so on. Other sensors can be combined synergistically similarly, like advanced Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and Sniper targeting pod . And of course, this information can be shared via datalink to other platforms. So we are talking about much more than just a new independent sensor here. You can read in great detail just what advanced IRSTs bring to the fight and how they would be employed creatively in these past articles of ours linked here and here . Lt. Col. Jacob Lindaman, also of the 85th TES, adds: “This proves the capabilities of the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Air Force to lethally target an aircraft outside of the traditional radar electromagnetic spectrum…  Pairing that with the ability to also adopt the Legion Pod on any platform sets a precedent for what’s to come.” Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin While testing of the F-15’s IRST has been ongoing for years, getting to trial actual live-fire, full kill-chain, engagements against high-performance targets shows the system is maturing into an operational capability. The Navy is also rushing its IRST into service , which uses the same basic IRST21 sensor, but in a very different pod configuration and with a different backend. Regardless, both services should have this capability in a relatively widespread manner, fairly soon. This will complicate enemies’ ability to counter U.S. air-to-air tactics, as well as increasing overall lethality and awareness for U.S. fighter crews. We will continue to keep you abreast as to U.S. IRST developments, but suffice it to say that this long-awaited capability is finally coming in hot.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Nov 5, 2020",Watch The Meditative-Like Ritual The Blue Angels Go Through Before Every Flight Demo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “It’s Friday, March 26th, 2021, over Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, where the winds are 220 at 3, 10 miles viz, few at 25,000 [feet],” begins Commander Brian Kesselring, the Flight Leader and Commanding Officer of the U.S. Navy flight demonstration squadron, the famed Blue Angels , as he commences a pre-mission briefing with his six-pilot team. Already, Kesselring’s voice is sharp, professional, to the point. As his briefing continues, his voice becomes more animated, going through his radio calls exactly as he would in the air as he immerses himself and his team in what has to be the ultimate preparation for the flight ahead. It is this almost meditative ritual that has helped keep the Blue Angels at the absolute pinnacle of their profession for so many years. In a video recently posted on Twitter, we can experience edited portions of a rarely seen and very intimate Blue Angels pre-show briefing, ahead of a practice display at their home station. Kesselring sits with the blue-and-gold flight-suited team around a large table in the Ready Room at the team’s Pensacola headquarters on the beautiful coastline of the Florida Panhandle. What follows makes for remarkable viewing. Six U.S. Navy Blue Angels Super Hornets formate behind a KC-10 Extender tanker from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, during their flight home to Florida after participating in the Duluth Air and Aviation Expo on June 28, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Ariel Owings The pilots draw their respective show patterns on printed-out satellite images of the show venue as they mentally rehearse how Kesselring will lead them around the routine. Kesselring talks them through the moves, and each team member familiarizes themselves with his radio calls, often with their eyes closed, each with their hands simulating how they would be flying each maneuver. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow, Kesselring moves through his various radio calls in a unique form of soothing pilot speak, much of which is difficult for an outsider to interpret, but the team members know exactly what his instructions mean as Kesselring carefully walks them through what he calls a planned “Delta High Show” practice. Delta formation is the team’s signature six-plane arrowhead formation. The seemingly strange dialect spoken by the Blue Angels boss is not unique to Kesselring, it has been handed down throughout the decades and is learned by each new commanding officer that calls the elite squadron their own. “A little pullllll” continues Kesselring — who took command of the team for the 2020 season — as he imagines going up and over the top of a loop. The camera cuts to his hand on his blue flight suit as he squeezes imaginary throttle inputs. “Easing more powerrr,” he says, as his hand mimics throttling back the twin General Electric F414 engines of the Super Hornet. The timing and calls endorse what the team knows is coming in the show. His voice is exactly as they will hear it on the radio once in the cockpit. They are all in the moment, getting themselves “in the bubble.” The Blue Angels upgraded from the F/A-18C to the Super Hornet for the 2021 season , and Kesselring oversaw the transition to the new jets. The team had flown the F/A-18A/B/C/D Legacy Hornet since 1986 when it transitioned from the A-4F Skyhawk . The move to the Super Hornet was planned for the 2021 season, and so maintaining continuity in the pilot cadre was an obvious consideration. “A little ease… comes the pull.” The knuckles on Kesselring’s right hand are white as he clenches his fist and makes imaginary control stick inputs. The Blue Angels’ Super Hornets have received a number of modifications for their new role including the fitting of a spring to the control stick which means the pilot must constantly exert pressure on it, even in level flight. This modification was carried over from the “legacy” Hornet and it assists with smooth formation flying. The team doesn’t wear G-suits because the inflating of the bladders could throw off their finely tuned, always under pressure, stick inputs. A 2019 Blue Angels show complete with voice commands: “Smoke up push, gooooo diamond stinger.” The cadence in his voice, the way he speaks is all about giving voice commands that help the team to make their respective moves at exactly the right time. They know what’s coming, they know what he will say, but this is all about the exact timing. The Blue Angels pilots have flown the team’s show routine many times, they know it inside out and the show is highly scripted. Kesselring’s careful briefing is designed to get them all in the zone, in the right mindset for the forthcoming flight, and to mentally ‘fly’ the routine before ever even getting into the cockpit before actually doing so. The Blue Angels demonstrate just how close they can fly together., U.S. Navy No other team flies such a tight formation as the Blue Angels — their diamond formation is world-renowned for the way the jets fly just feet apart . While the pilots are intensely concentrating on their flying, Kesselring’s calm, animated voice is leading through every evolution. If something isn’t right, it could very well be the boss’s tone on the radio aligned with the precise moment of the show that is the first indication. The video is yet another reminder of the almost super-human level the Blue Angles are operating on and why the team leader in a flight demonstration squadron plays such an important role in all aspects of how a team like the Blue Angels performs. They are literally the voice inside their teammate’s heads. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Naval Aviation"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 21, 2022",New Light Shed On The Once Top Secret Tacit Blue Aircraft By Veteran Program Manager,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The fantastic 10 Percent True YouTube channel , the creation of Steve Davies , recently had Denny Jarvi on as a guest. Jarvi was an accomplished U.S. Air Force fighter pilot that found himself descending into the shadowy black projects world in the early 1980s to help run the top-secret Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX) demonstrator program, better known as Tacit Blue. In the interview, Jarvi gives a frank account of many of the finer details of what is understood to have been one of the most transformational secret aircraft test programs in known history, although it is often overshadowed by Lockheed’s Have Blue stealth demonstrator that came before it. Northrop’s “Whale” demonstrator, the centerpiece of the Tacit Blue program, is maybe most famous for its absolutely homely looks. “Wow, haha, this is not the prettiest machine I’ve ever seen,” was Jarvi’s first impression of the aircraft after setting eyes on it. Yet it was a product of the early days of the stealth revolution, which broke all traditions when it came to what a combat aircraft should look like. Tacit Blue aimed to prove that a surveillance aircraft could persist for long periods of time over the front lines of the battlefield while collecting very high-fidelity intelligence and survive to repeat the task the next day. This was a huge departure from past spy aircraft like the SR-71, which basically took a snapshot in time. With the help of stealth technology and highly tailored sensors and communications systems, Tacit Blue proved that an aircraft could deliver what would be akin to a constant feed of near real-time intelligence over or very near the most hostile places on earth. It was like going from taking a Polaroid picture at a birthday party to filming the entire party without anyone even knowing you were there. Simply put, Tacit Blue’s success represented a quantum leap in how intelligence could be gathered from the air and its accomplishments still reverberate throughout the U.S. military today. The video is well worth a watch in its entirety. Jarvi’s recollections are highly interesting and they help add color to what is, unfortunately, something of an obscure footnote in military aviation history. With that being said, here are some of the major takeaways from Jarvi’s discussion with Davies: While just one Tacit Blue “Whale” flew, there was another non-completed airframe in reserve just in case the first prototype was lost. Jarvi thinks this second airframe was likely destroyed after the program was shuttered. The first airframe was trucked from Northrop’s Hawthorne plant to Area 51 in partially assembled form. Tacit Blue was tested against an F-15 with its powerful AN/APG-63 radar and with a test pilot at the controls. The Eagle never saw the Whale on radar, at least until it was well within visual range. No other airplane detected Tacit Blue via its own RF emissions during testing despite it having a powerful radar and datalink system onboard. The Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) tactics employed by those systems worked to keep the aircraft concealed while flying very near threat systems and actively emitting RF energy. Tacit Blue’s notional concept of operations involved flying over or very near the forward edge of the battlefield at around 25,000-30,000 feet and orbiting overhead at 250 knots or so while its radar scanned the area below. The Whale looked like a completely different aircraft depending on the angle you were looking at it., Northrop Grumman The entire concept was meant to provide real-time reconnaissance on the movement of Soviet armor crossing into Western Europe, most notably around the Fulda Gap . Obviously, the same capability could have been useful for other mission sets post-Cold War. 135 sorties were flown, sometimes two sorties per day, but always during the daytime. The aircraft flew out of Area 51 and there were no mishaps during the program. The Hughes LPI radar with Ground-Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) capability measured three feet high by seven feet long. While the Tacit Blue demonstrator only had the radar on one side, if the aircraft were to have been refined for production, it would have had another array on the other side, as well. Multiple accounts state the aircraft was the most unstable ever flown at the time. It was so unstable, in fact, that it would end up being pointed backward in the wind tunnel during testing. It used an F/A-18’s fly-by-wire flight control system to overcome its lack of stability. Northrop Grumman There was a “brick wall” between Northrop and Lockheed and what each knew about stealth technology at the time. This isn’t new, but it is interesting that it continued on even as the F-117 was put into production. The fact that the Advanced Technology Bomber contract was underway certainly would have influenced this reality, as well. But even then, stealth capabilities were largely viewed as proprietary corporate technology. While the aircraft’s existence was known by a relatively small number of people, far fewer knew its performance in terms of low-observable capabilities, which was outstanding. During a radar cross-section pole test of a scale model of the Whale, radar technicians couldn’t figure out why it was so visible compared to the projections. Turns out an owl hand landed on it. Even during flight testing, small differences in the aircraft’s signature resulted in crews pouring over every inch of the plane to see if something was out of place, like a panel or a piece of radar absorbent material (RAM). Tacit Blue on flight test during the early-to-mid 1980s., Public Domain The program had a very small chain of command, which allowed them to do whatever they needed as long as it “didn’t break federal law.” The DARPA program at one time was managed from an anonymous office called XRJ at Wright Patterson AFB, but it largely reported to high-up officials at the Pentagon, including General Wilbur Creech, then the head of Tactical Air Command. William Perry was also a champion of the program, at least early on. General Creech was bullish on the Tacit Blue concept but was worried that a stray MiG returning from a cross-enemy-lines combat mission could stumble upon it by happenstance, visually acquiring it and shooting it down. Lighting and various camouflage were evaluated to help with visual stealth , but they did not have a solution for close visual encounters. Tacit Blue’s radar was nearly good enough to tell what type of vehicles it was detecting on the ground. This is quite an accomplishment for the era. More fine-tuning and the application of other advances would have allowed it to do that and much more. Public Domain Standoff radar-carrying aircraft that were anything but stealthy may have been able to survive over 100 miles or more away from the front lines, but their radar’s view of the battlefield would have been partially obstructed by terrain. Tacit Blue could look nearly straight down, where ground clutter and the shadows caused by hills and structures were not a factor. The aircraft’s Low Probability of Intercept datalink was one-way, feeding radar intelligence to ground stations. The idea is that Tacit Blue could have gone into production, creating a small number of evolved Whale aircraft that could execute the mission. One issue was that the data it gathered was so good, those not read into the program would have wondered where it was coming from. While the B-2 was so big it would have to be disclosed, an operational fleet of Tacit Blue aircraft wouldn’t have been. But how do you use it without giving away that it exists? This was an early debate regarding a potential production aircraft’s concept of operations. Infrared signature reduction was a big part of the design, with the deeply buried, dorsal inlet-fed twin Garrett ATF3 turbofan jet engines having a serpentine exhaust. This allowed the air to cool before exiting the aircraft and a specially treated ‘platypus’ tail allowed it to be cooled even more before leaving the confines of the aircraft’s planform. The duct and tail arrangement reduced thrust, but it was an easy trade considering the mission set the aircraft was designed to achieve. public domain The acoustic signature of the aircraft was also fairly low, with its engines being quiet by default, at least to the point that if people were working below or going about their lives around others they probably wouldn’t notice it up at 25,000-30,000 feet. A large part of the Tacit Blue program was coming up with the concept of operations in regards to how an operational version of it could be used in battle. The program was ended in May of 1984, but its findings could have been passed on to another secret program Jarvi says, but he doesn’t know anything about that—”who knows what took its place.” Some of the Tacit Blue program remains classified to this very day. Once again, these were just some of the most interesting points in Davies’ interview, and you should watch the whole thing in full. If you want to know what it was like flying the Whale, check out this previous piece of ours . Tacit Blue was declassified in 1996 and was taken out of storage, and then sat for over a decade in an unknown location , before being put on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright Patterson AFB. , U.S. Air Force/Ken LaRock The Whale’s exotic design was very much a harbinger of what was to come in terms of stealth technology. Its continuously curving surfaces, buried engines with serpentine ducts and platypus exhausts, widely splayed v-tail, and pronounced chine lines not only were adopted by the YF-23 , and to a large degree, the B-2, but to this very day, low-observable designs leverage these same features. In fact, even very modern aircraft and cruise missile configurations can look stunningly like the Whale . Still, it could be argued that some of those features were at least notionally established before Tacit Blue , but nobody had flown a manned aircraft that put them all together, let alone one that could carry big and powerful radar. In the years and decades that followed the Tacit Blue program, bolstered by more powerful computing and a better understanding of stealth technology, even Lockheed’s original faceted stealth concept gave way to the much more Whale-like ever-morphing curvilinear designs. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Jmlv3vOR5F0 In retrospect, it is amazing just how much Northrop got right on their second try at bringing a stealth demonstrator to life; you can read about the first try in this past piece of mine . Above all else, it proved that penetrating and persistent reconnaissance could be an absolute revolution in aerial surveillance. In that sense, it was the forebear to the abortive RQ-3 Darkstar program of the later 1990s and eventually the very much operational RQ-170 Sentinel . I believe it is very possible that something did come after Tacit Blue. A missing link between what the program proved in terms of the potential that penetrating and persistent aerial reconnaissance through stealth technology showed and the drones that followed later to accomplish a similar mission, albeit updated dramatically for the post-Cold War era. You can read more about that here . Maybe the biggest tribute to Tacit Blue could emerge on the horizon nearly 40 years after the Whale first flew. While the Pave Mover program did produce the E-8 JSTARS radar aircraft, that mission is likely going to be handed over to a distributed network of stealthy drones as converted airliners won’t be able to get safely within the distance of target areas for their radars to even be effective during a peer-state conflict, nor can they be as effective even if they could. The likely centerpiece of such a capability is the still-in-the-shadows “RQ-180.” This is a very stealthy, high-flying aircraft that can penetrate and persist in highly contested airspace while executing a similar, albeit far more advanced mission to that of Tacit Blue, one adapted for a new era of peer-state tensions. It is also almost certainly a Northrop Grumman product. You can read my full take on this aircraft here. To think that it all began on the bleeding edge of what was possible, out in the desolate expanse of Area 51 and in the bustling halls of Northrop, the Pentagon, and Wright Patterson AFB, among other locales, nearly four decades ago, thanks to highly dedicated and talented people like Denny Jarvi.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy recently conducted successful flight tests of a UAV carrying an aerial laser system designed to map the ocean floor in shallow water areas. While details are scarce, we know that the tests used a Light Detection and Ranging, or LIDAR, system aboard a small unmanned helicopter . While such a system could be an important tool for making detailed topographic maps of waterways and littoral areas, there could be other potential applications of well beyond general cartographic ones. The tests were conducted by the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research (ONR) in conjunction with Shiebel, makers of the CAMCOPTER S-100, the helicopter drone used in the tests. According to NavalNews .com , the tests took place on the commercial vessel Richard L. Becker off the coast of Pensacola, Florida. Hans Georg Schiebel, Chairman of the Schiebel Group, says this his company is proud to showcase the CAMPCOPTER’s capabilities to the Navy in the tests, adding that “we operate extensively on land and at sea and we are confident that our unmanned solution is also the right fit for the US Navy.” The CAMCOPTER S-100 used in recent U.S. Navy flight trials aboard the Richard L. Becker . , SCHIEBEL The LIDAR system used in the demonstration is the Pushbroom Imaging Lidar for Littoral Surveillance, or PILLS, made by defense contractor Areté . LIDAR is a low-power, eye-safe laser technology that measures the light reflected from short pulses in order to quickly and accurately make 3D maps of an environment. LIDAR systems are used in a wide variety of applications including surveying, laser guidance systems, and even in some self-driving cars. As early as 2000, the Naval Oceanographic Office was exploring airborne LIDAR for conducting surveys of underwater topography. More specifically, the Navy has been exploring using the PILLS LIDAR system aboard unmanned aerial systems for making seafloor maps since at least 2016, according to an ONR release . The service also conducted exercises in the Mississippi Sound in 2019 that featured “two unmanned aerial system-capable” LIDAR systems. As ONR’s release states, the capabilities offered by the PILLS system are needed because “remote areas around the world lack precise or updated topographic maps or bathymetric charts.” A seafloor map of the navigation channel into Pensacola Bay made using the PILLS system. The wreckage of the USS Massachusetts can be seen in the bottom left of the image., Naval Oceanography/Kaley Turfitt One of the principal downsides of using LIDAR for mapping underwater topography is the fact that a significant amount of a laser’s energy is lost in water due to refraction, scattering, and absorption. These effects can limit the depth at which measurements can be accurately made, as can water clarity. Despite these limitations, the Navy awarded Areté a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract in 2016 worth $1.4 million that would take the PILLS LIDAR and “adapt this existing system with an upgraded compact laser and perform the necessary development to operate the system in a high vibration and shock environment associated with ship launched and recovery unmanned aerial vehicles.” Promotional image of the CAMCOPTER S-100, Schiebel The unmanned aerial system chosen for this latest test of the PILLS system, the CAMCOPTER S-100 , is a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV featuring a standard helicopter configuration. CAMCOPTER S-100 arrived on the unmanned aircraft scene a decade and a half ago and has been evolving ever since. According to its manufacturer Schiebel, the unmanned platform can operate without a “prepared area or supporting launch or recovery equipment” and is capable of both day and night operation in any type of weather. Schiebel claims a beyond-line-of-sight range of around 125 miles over sea or land and a ten-hour endurance. The mini helo is highly transportable and can be operated in nearly any environment. Schiebel also says the CAMCOPTER can carry payloads up to 75 lbs, has a flight ceiling of 18,000 feet, and can be fueled with either aviation gasoline or kerosene-type jet fuel. The UAV is even claimed to be capable of operating in GPS-contested environments “with missions planned and controlled via a simple point-and-click graphical user interface.” The 10-foot helicopter has previously been used by the French Navy , among a growing list of other international customers, as well as for applications in the United States. In addition to LIDAR systems, the platform can carry a wide variety of sensors and communications gear, loudspeakers, or droppable cargo containers. Above all else, it has a proven pedigree as an optical and infrared surveillance platform. CAMCOPTERs delivered to the French Navy, Schiebel By using small UAVs to conduct LIDAR mapping of the ocean floor, the Navy could offer a new type of surveillance in addition to simply making more detailed oceanographic maps. If Areté and the Navy manage to develop an aerial LIDAR system capable of efficient and consistent underwater modeling, the potential applications could be wide-ranging. The CAMCOPTER’s ability to take off and land from unprepared areas means it could be well-suited to expeditionary operations using a forward arming and refueling point (FARP) or even just an open deck area on ships. The unmanned helicopters could be used to surveil areas around the numerous small islands of the highly contested Pacific , for example, using their LIDAR systems to scout for undersea sensors , small unmanned underwater vehicles , or naval mines . In a special operations application, they could provide very up-to-date intelligence on the littorals around target areas prior to swimmer insertions. The same could be said for preparing and scouting for larger amphibious operations. It will be interesting to see if this concept gets adopted to a wider degree, but considering the maritime challenges facing the U.S. military, it shouldn’t be a surprise if it does.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 27, 2021",Japan Wants To Detect Incoming Hypersonic Missiles With Unmanned Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Japanese Ministry of Defense is considering using unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with infrared sensors to provide early warning of potential attacks on the country by hypersonic missiles . Recent reports from the country indicate that the drone-based detection system has been proposed as one response to high-speed weapons developments in China and Russia and specifically to counter a new class of ballistic missiles carrying hypersonic glide vehicles . According to a story on the website of the Sankei Shinbun daily, the Japanese Ministry of Defense announced the plan on August 7 as part of what the newspaper described as Tokyo’s “rush to develop capabilities to counter the development of hypersonic weapons.” The Chinese Dongfeng-17 (DF-17) hypersonic weapon was displayed to the public for the first time in October 2019 during the National Day Parade in Beijing., CHINESE INTERNET The same report notes that the unmanned aerial vehicles would be equipped with an undisclosed but existing infrared detection system originally designed to identify ballistic missile attacks , “technology verification” of which was apparently completed in 2019. The “small infrared sensor” would be carried aloft by a drone that would “operate in an airspace closer to the enemy” and which would be able to remain aloft for long periods. The problem of detecting a hypersonic missile attack early enough to respond with any chance of success is one of increasing urgency, as more countries embark on the development of this class of weapon. Traveling at speeds of Mach 5 or above, hypersonic weapons fly at velocities broadly similar to ballistic missiles, but unlike them, they do not follow a predictable ballistic trajectory and are able to maneuver as they head toward their target, making them harder both to detect and to defeat by kinetic means. “The maneuverability and low flight altitude of hypersonic weapons could challenge existing detection and defense systems,” a Congressional Research Service report on hypersonic missile defense stated in June this year. “For example, most terrestrial-based radars cannot detect hypersonic weapons until late in the weapon’s flight due to line-of-sight limitations of radar detection. This leaves minimal time for a defender to launch interceptors that could neutralize an inbound weapon.” A schematic diagram showing a notional hypersonic glide vehicle flight profile compared to that of a traditional ballistic missile. Also shown is the flight path of a low-flying air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile., GAO The Japanese drone-based detection system would involve “multiple” UAVs continuously monitoring the airspace and transmitting their collected data to ground stations. The type of drone, or drones, envisaged for this surveillance mission are not specified, but unmanned aircraft is an area that the Japanese military is increasingly investing in, after an admittedly slow start . The Japan Air Self-Defense Force, for example, has ordered three RQ-4B Global Hawk Block 30 high-altitude surveillance drones, the first of which took to the air in Palmdale, California, in April this year . Able to fly at an altitude of up to 60,000ft and conduct sorties lasting more than 32 hours, the RQ-4 would be a suitable candidate for hypersonic missile detection, but a fleet of three vehicles would likely struggle to provide the degree of coverage required. Japan’s second RQ-4B Global Hawk, which made its first flight on June 24, 2021., Northrop Grumman Meanwhile, in the United States, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has been working on UAVs intended to detect hostile ballistic missiles, which could include those carrying boost-glide vehicles. The agency has conducted airborne sensor tests using specially configured MQ-9 drones, equipped with infrared tracking sensors and lasers, and precision tracking and discrimination algorithms. In one MDA trial, which took place off Hawaii in 2016 , a pair of MQ-9s detected and tracked a ballistic missile target during a test in the Pacific. A pair of experimental MQ-9s adapted with additional sensors for the missile detection mission., MDA In all likelihood, this kind of ability to detect and track high-speed threats and triangulate them is a similar model to what Japan is now envisaging. However, using two drones, at least, is a prerequisite of this type of scenario, in order to combine data from their sensors to create a stereo track and geolocate the threat. At the same time, two aircraft or more geographically separated drones would have to be airborne at all times to ensure coverage. Nevertheless, there is clearly potential for Japan to leverage at least some of this research and capability with the help of the United States, to help meet its own emerging requirements. MDA While there are also air-breathing hypersonic weapons at least under development, the primary concern for Japan appears to be boost-glide vehicles. The Sankei Shinbun daily specifically outlines the Chinese DF-17 and the Russian Avangard as threats that require new detection techniques. The DF-17 uses a ballistic missile to boost an unpowered DF-ZF hypersonic boost-glide vehicle to well over Mach 5 before the vehicle continues on a maneuvering path through the atmosphere to its target. This is a weapon that The War Zone has discussed in depth in the past . The Avangard similarly uses a ballistic missile to propel a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle to the appropriate altitude and speed, before it embarks on its terminal phase of flight, but, so far, at least, it’s limited to silo-launch, while the DF-17 employs a road-mobile wheeled launcher. The Avangard is known to carry a nuclear warhead, and the same option is thought to be available to the DF-17, alongside a conventional option. Both these weapons could reach targets in Japan . Launch of an Avangard missile., Russian Ministry of Defense However drones might be employed within this scenario, it seems likely that advance warning of a potential hypersonic missile attack against Japan won’t rely solely upon UAVs. After all, infrared sensors have certain limitations, including being affected by atmospheric conditions. Indeed, the Sankei Shinbun report suggests that these high-flying infrared sensors would just be one part of a multi-faceted approach that would also include new radar technology fielded aboard warships . The report also says the Japanese government is aiming to build a satellite constellation that will consist of a “large number” of small satellites in low-earth orbit as part of this larger surveillance network. Here there could be parallels with the American efforts to establish a multi-layered space-sensing network , or Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), with a possibility that Japan could receive some of that data, too. What is conspicuous by its absence from this report is a means to actually defeat the incoming hypersonic weapons once they are detected and can be tracked. Such defensive measures could include interceptor missiles, hypervelocity projectiles, laser weapons, electronic attack systems, or a combination of any of these. In the United States, for example, the MDA is working toward integrating the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) with the Aegis Weapon System, to provide a hypersonic missile defense capability by the end of this decade. Japan, too, is an operator of the Aegis system and could potentially seek to acquire the GPI, as well. Whatever path Japan chooses to take as it sets about bolstering its defenses against the emerging threat of hypersonic weapons, it seems that for now at least, potential aggressors with these kinds of weapons already in their arsenal hold an advantage. While the basic concept of hypersonic weapons is not new, technological advances mean that boost-glide vehicles capable of flying at Mach 5 or more are now real threats, even if their deployment is, so far, fairly limited. Air-breathing hypersonic missiles are potentially even more challenging to defeat, since their initial launch is even harder to detect, with no telltale large ballistic missile launch plume that could potentially be spotted by space-based surveillance assets. At the same time, Japan is working on its own secretive hypersonic weapons development programs, again with a focus on boost-glide vehicles. With a view toward deterring China, in particular, in the East China Sea , Tokyo has been working on a two-pronged approach to fielding such weapons, with reports in the past that an initial system could be ready for service by 2026. However, while fielding practical hypersonic weapons for offensive use is clearly feasible, the ability to develop effective counters to them is less certain. Not surprisingly, the sheer speed of these types of weapons has led some analysts to argue that an entirely new command and control architecture is required to defeat them. With that in mind, Japan may well require not only a diverse array of detection systems, and means of defeating the incoming weapons, but also an overarching C2 network in which these assets can be brought together and the entire engagement managed in a rapid, seamless manner. Ultimately, the cost to Japan of fielding such a comprehensive, multi-layered system to detect and then track hypersonic threats, and then defeat them in some way, is likely to run into tens of billions of dollars. That alone could be a serious hurdle to be overcome, but it seems that Tokyo is at least taking the threat seriously. Time will tell how successful this effort will be, and to what degree it will involve drones to aid detection.

Adam Kehoe,"Updated on Jun 28, 2021",Senate Intel Committee Strengthens Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force In New Bill,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, or SSCI, recently passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (IAA) on a unanimous vote. Among a range of priorities, the bill included provisions to significantly bolster the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF). Specifically, the bill mandates that the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense require their constituent elements to provide “data relating to unidentified aerial phenomena” to both the UAPTF and the Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center. The bill also requires that congressional defense and intelligence committees receive a classified quarterly briefing on UAP events from either the UAPTF or an entity such as the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Each briefing is to report any new incidents, as well as any incidents that have not been covered by previous briefings. The inclusion of past events that have not otherwise been reported to the UAPTF appears to create a potential historical mandate to review UAP incidents from sources that the UAPTF has not had access to or that have not been cooperative in furnishing info to the task force. The bill is notable for its inclusion of the Air Force via the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), which has been conspicuously absent from the dialog concerning UAP. Headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, NASIC describes itself as “the Department of Defense’s primary source for foreign air and space threat analysis.” Strangely, in recent years the Navy has taken the lead on the UAP issue, despite the Air Force’s clear responsibility for defending American sovereign airspace. Senator Marco Rubio has been the biggest proponent of looking more deeply into the UAP issue on an official and more open level, although future reports on the topic will likely be classified., AP These provisions come on the heels of a long-awaited report on UAP that was mandated by a previous request from SSCI. The report detailed 144 incidents involving “airborne objects [that are] not immediately identifiable.” Of those incidents, only one was successfully resolved by the UAPTF. While the report expressed a high degree of uncertainty about the incidents, it did assess that at least some UAP threaten flight safety, and potentially have national security implications. Offering few details, the report claimed that 18 incidents it examined involved a mixture of unusual movement patterns that included abrupt maneuvers and considerable speeds without “discernible means of propulsion.” It was unclear if multiple irregularities were observed simultaneously. The report ultimately cautioned that additional analysis would be necessary to “determine if breakthrough technologies were demonstrated.” With respect to national security, the report indicated that the UAPTF “currently lack data to indicate any UAP are part of a foreign collection program or indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary.” The report also stated that the UAPTF was unable to confirm if US assets accounted for any of the reported incidents. In a previous analysis of the report , we assessed the lack of confident conclusions indicated a deficit of access to all the relevant information and analytical capabilities the government has to offer. In fact, the report itself cited the need for “multiple teams or groups of technical experts,” strongly implying that they did not have sufficient expertise themselves. The UAPTF is largely understood to have been a few people, with relatively limited access, in the past. That is likely changing now. The issue of the Air Force’s compliance, or lack thereof, was also tacitly raised in the report, with a brief statement that the UAPTF is “currently working to acquire additional reporting, including from the U.S. Air Force.” This comment was followed by a curious remark that the Air Force data collection effort has been “limited historically” but that it had begun a pilot program in November of 2020 to collect additional data in the “most likely areas to encounter UAP.” It was not clear from the report how the Air Force could assess exactly which areas would be more or less likely to encounter UAP without a past historical analysis or data stream. Statements by Senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee respectively, underscored the need for additional information and clarity. Senator Marco Rubio stated “This report is an important first step in cataloging these incidents, but it is just a first step. The Defense Department and Intelligence Community have a lot of work to do before we can actually understand whether these aerial threats present a serious national security concern.” For his part, Senator Mark Warner said in a statement that “the frequency of these incidents only appears to be increasing.” He further remarked, “The United States must be able to understand and mitigate threats to our pilots, whether they’re from drones or weather balloons or adversary intelligence capabilities.” It appears that others within the government are also concerned about the Pentagon’s handling of the UAP issue. Last May, the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General announced it was opening an evaluation into “the extent to which the DoD has taken actions regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP).“ The exact focus or parameters of the evaluation are closely held, but may eventually shed additional light on the policy response of the Pentagon. Some early public evolution on UAP policy has already occurred, with Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks issuing a memorandum directing the formalization of the UAPTF’s mission. The directive came shortly after the release of the UAPTF report, and tasked the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security to develop a plan that would enhance and synchronize “collection, reporting, and analysis on the UAP problem set.” Additionally, the memorandum required the plan to establish recommendations for securing military test and training ranges. DoD In an extensive analysis of the issue, The War Zone ’s Tyler Rogoway focused specifically on the possibility that some of the UAP sightings may be due to intelligence collection efforts on the part of foreign competitors. These efforts may be explainable via relatively modest drone and balloon technology. In Rogoway’s argument, cultural stigma toward discussing UFOs has only exacerbated the Pentagon’s already lackluster response to identifying emerging threats, including operational concepts and technologies. The team at The War Zone has covered a wide range of stories on this issue. We previously detailed a prolonged series of episodes in which multiple drones converged on Navy vessels off the coast of Southern California in July of 2019. According to Chief of Naval Operations Michael Gilday , the identity of the drone operators was never discovered and an unspecified number of other incidents have happened near military assets. According to FAA records , dozens of incidents involving objects described as drones, quadcopters, and balloons have occurred near military training ranges and facilities. These incidents come on top of other similar reports of aviation safety hazards from both the Navy and the Air Force . In offering a policy prescription to this problem, Rogoway wrote, “We must fully fund a real intelligence fusion center to work these cases and demand that our military and intelligence apparatus funnel all new ones to the fusion cell… This investigative unit must have unfettered access to every relevant data source and intelligence product the U.S. military and the intelligence community have to offer.” The bill passed by SSCI would appear to move closer towards this approach. Indeed, it would give the UAPTF better access to information and to analytical talent than it has ever had. However, it is important to recall that while the bill saw strong support in the Senate intelligence committee, it will still need to be passed in the full House and Senate before being signed into law by the President. Alterations to legislative language are hardly unusual, so the exact parameters of the bill are subject to change. It is also worth noting that this new language does not include a mandate for any further reporting to the public on the matter. Regardless, for the time being, it appears that the Senate has decided to not only support the UAPTF but to improve its access to information while keeping Congress regularly informed of its findings.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 16, 2021",Watch This 2021 Ford Bronco Play Chase Car For A U-2 Dragon Lady Spy Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just over a week ago, a video emerged showing U.S. Air Force personnel apparently using a 2021 Ford Bronco as a chase vehicle for a U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane. While the new Bronco may be the ‘hottest car’ in America, it is a far cry from the kinds of vehicles the service typically uses to help pilots flying U-2s, which are notoriously finicky and even potentially dangerous to land, get back down on the ground. Since the clip appeared online, readers have been asking us about it, and here is what we have been able to find out. A screengrab from a video shot from a 2021 Ford Bronco speeding down the runway behind a low-flying U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane., Rob Holland Ultimate Airshows capture The video, shot by Rob Holland of Rob Holland Ultimate Airshows , was filmed at this year’s EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show, which ran from July 26 until August 1. The show, which is put on by the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), takes place annually at Wittman Regional Airport and the adjacent Pioneer Airport in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, though it was canceled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One of this year’s “Platinum Level” sponsors was Ford, who brought a number of examples of its recently rebooted Bronco — the first vehicle from the company to carry that name in 25 years — to the event. During the air show, a two-seat TU-2S trainer – only four of which are still in service following a crash in 2016 – from the 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base in California, the Air Force’s main hub for Dragon Lady operations , performed a fly-by, as well as a simulated landing approach. The plane never actually put its wheels on the runway, even for a touch-and-go, instead executing an option pass. A TU-2S Dragon Lady at Beale Air Force Base in California., USAF For the purposes of the show, one of the Broncos was made available to some Air Force personnel so they could drive it out onto the runway behind the TU-2S as a mock chase car for the simulated landing. In the video, the driver is seen wearing a hat with the logo of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division, which was responsible for designing the U-2 in the 1950s and is still deeply involved with the aircraft after more than six decades of service with the Air Force. You can catch glimpses of the Bronco trailing behind the TU-2S in the videos below, as well, which were shot from the sidelines at this year’s EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show. During a real U-2 landing, another U-2 pilot follows closely behind on the runway in a chase car, providing approximate altitude and other important information to the person actually in the cockpit via radio communications, as you can see in the video below. The Dragon Lady provides the pilot with limited downward visibility and has an unusual landing gear configuration, with just two pairs of wheels along the centerline of the fuselage. All of this, combined with its extremely efficient and very long wing design that provides copious amounts of lift, keeps the plane in the air even at relatively low speeds. As a result, it makes getting the Dragon Lady down and keeping her there challenging, as you can learn more about here . There’s no indication that the Air Force is considering adding Broncos to its existing fleets of chase cars to help with any real U-2 landings in the future. The War Zone reached out to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing for more information about the use of the Bronco at the show soon after the video appeared online, but has not yet received a response. The service has historically used high-performance cars, including types derived from police cars, for this purpose. Various models of the Dodge Charger appear to be increasingly the default platform for this job, though Tesla Ss , among other types, have been observed in use in recent years, as well. A pair of US Air Force Dodge Chargers used as U-2 chase cars., USAF Also, in the video, we see the Bronco hit a speed of 93, which may be moving quickly for an SUV, but it’s not exactly the type of high performance that is required when turning onto an active runway while accelerating and chasing down a flying aircraft. So, the Bronco is not the best vehicle for the job. Far from it, really. Here’s what The Drive ‘s Kristen Lee had to say about the Bronco’s on-road performance, which she described as “truckish,” overall, after having an opportunity to take one out for a spin earlier this year: I thought first and second gear felt particularly short, as the engine demanded I shift sooner and at higher rpms than I was used to in other manual cars I’ve driven. This is probably good for low-speed off-roading, but accelerating to 40 mph from a stoplight meant I was shifting a lot . … But there’s no getting around it: The two-door Bronco has an extremely truck-like quality to the way it handles the paved stuff. It drives like it’s big because it is. It rattles over bumps, dives during braking, and was rather ungainly on curvier roads. So, while the video from the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show is certainly cool to watch, if you’re a current owner of a 2021 Bronco, or are looking to become one, and was hoping to tell people about driving the same vehicle the Air Force uses to help U-2s land, you’re out of luck.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Feb 17, 2022","Preorders For This Electromagnetic Rifle Are Being Taken For $3,775","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy may have shelved its railgun program , but that doesn’t mean you can’t get a similar futuristic weapon for yourself. One ambitious company is offering what it is calling “the world’s first and only handheld Gauss rifle” for pre-order for the price of $3,375. The rifle is claimed to be capable of shooting a wide variety of metal projectiles using powerful magnets. Obviously, there are outstanding questions about how well the Gauss rifle works and how safe the system is, but the company’s CEO tells us that military and law enforcement agencies have already expressed interest in the weapon. The GR-1 Anvil Gauss rifle is made by Arcflash Labs, LLC, the co-founder of which, David Wirth and Jason Murray, are “Aerospace Engineers, former US Air Force officers, and experts in pulsed power supply development with 20 years of combined experience,” according to its website. The company says the weapon is “capable of accelerating any ferromagnetic projectile (under 1/2″ in diameter) to 200+ fps [feet per second]” and can produce up to 100 Joules of force, or 75 foot-pounds, similar to the muzzle energy of some .22 rifles, making it the “most powerful coilgun ever sold to the public, and also (very likely) the most powerful handheld coilgun ever built.” The Arcflash GR-1 Anvil, Arcflash Labs Gauss rifles, or coilguns, use electrified coils to generate a magnetic field that accelerates ferromagnetic projectiles to high speeds. This is a similar, but distinct concept from railguns, which, as their name implies, get their projectiles going using field generated between current-conducting rails. While many handheld coilgun designs have been shown off over the years, we’ve yet to see one that can deliver enough force to be useful in any type of military or security setting. Arcflash’s rifle measures 38 inches in length with a barrel length of 26 inches, weighs 20 pounds, and is powered by a 25.2-volt lithium-ion polymer battery (LiPoly) battery. From the images on the company’s website, the rifle’s stock appears to be 3D printed with some acrylic plastic sections bolted on. Close up of the rifle’s microcontroller unit., Arcflash Labs The manufacturer says the rifle uses an “advanced capacitor charging system” and a “dual Clamped Quasi-Resonant Inverter.” This allows the Gauss rifle to fire up to 20 rounds per minute at maximum power, or up to 100 rounds per minute while operating at half power. The rifle also features a novel trigger system that allows a user to pre-charge the system by depressing the trigger lightly before firing it with a full pull. Arcflash Labs As for actual ammunition, since the GR-1 accelerates projectiles uses magnetic fields, any iron-rich metal slug with a diameter between 11mm and 12.6mm and a length between 30 and 52mm could be fired from this handheld weapon, at least in principle. Arcflash Labs offers a range of standard “ armature ” projectiles that can be used, and notes that they are “NOT RESPONSIBLE for damage to the unit or personal injury caused by firing non-OEM armatures.” In addition to this warning, the rifle’s owner’s manual offers the following disclaimer: Unless otherwise agreed in writing by an authorized representative of Arcflash Labs at Arcflash Labs’ headquarters in Los Angeles, California, the products sold hereunder are not intended for use in connection with any military, law enforcement, nuclear facility or activity. If so used, in the event any damage, injury or contamination occurs, Arcflash Labs disclaims any responsibility of every kind, and the user of the products shall indemnify Arcflash Labs and hold Arcflash Labs harmless from any and all liability for any such damage or contamination whatsoever arising out of any such use, including liability in tort or strict liability. Arcflash Labs Arcflash Labs Co-Founder David Wirth says that weapons like the company’s Gauss rifle will become more common as these technologies develop and come down in price and weight. “It’s not a matter of if, but when gunpowder will be succeeded,” Wirth told The Firearms Blog . “It’s a one thousand-year-old technology. It works fine. But we think we’ve got something better. There’s tremendous potential here, but the technology is still in its infancy.” The War Zone reached out to Wirth, who previously worked for three years in the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), an organization well known for its work on advanced weapon systems and other high-tech research and development . The Arcflash founder said the company is currently “putting [the rifle] out there and saying ‘here’s what the technology can do.’ It’s kind of a technology that’s looking for an application.” “We’ve had some inquiries from military and law enforcement who want to use it for scalable effects, and of course from hobbyists who just want to mess around with it,” Wirth added. “We’re really just exploring the application space.” Wirth was unable to tell us which specific agencies approached his company, but says that most of the inquiries were about using Arcflash’s coilgun technology to fire non-lethal projectiles , such as rubber bullets or pepper spray balls. Since coilguns use electromagnetism to propel projectiles, these munitions would require ferromagnetic sabots or embedded iron shavings in order to be fired. A still from an Arcflash promotional video., Arcflash Labs via YouTube “The reason they’re interested in coilguns versus a CO2-powered thing is because with a coilgun, you can instantly change the power on it so you can dial it down if you’re close to a target so it won’t hurt somebody, or increase the power if you’re further away and get the effect you want,” Wirth told The War Zone . Obviously, a Gauss rifle with the muzzle velocity close to a .22 Short isn’t going to be hitting the battlefield anytime soon. Arcflash has sold other lower-powered models in the past. The Firearms Blog did describe the GR-1 as a “novel armament concept to circumvent the need for gunpowder, avoid firearms infringement and provide a new way to arm yourself.” This highlights how it might be possible to purchase this weapon without issue in jurisdictions in the United States, as well as elsewhere around the world, where there might be more stringent restrictions on the sale of traditional firearms. This could be an important selling point for these rifles on the civilian market, but how long a lack of regulation would actually last is up for debate. It’s uncertain if the manufacturer’s claims of being the only handheld coilgun on the planet are indeed accurate, but a video released last year by the Logistical Engineering University of the People’s Liberation Army claims similar weapons are currently being developed in China. Like the Arcflash labs GR-1, the weapons in the Chinese video appear low power. Wirth tells us that scaling up such a handheld weapon to higher levels of power would require much more weight, and would thus take the weapon out of the hands of personnel and would require it to be mounted on a trailer, tripod, or larger vehicle. Historically, coilgun, as well as railgun, concepts have been expected to need extreme amounts of power, and be very large as a result, to be viable military weapons. For instance, the U.S. Navy experimented with a high-velocity railgun intended for use aboard surface vessels for years, and was able to fire rounds at speeds greater than 4,500 miles per hour, or around six times the speed of sound, during land-based testing. Despite the progress made, the program was finally axed in this year’s budget . It’s unknown how much of the program’s research and development could have moved on to classified programs, if any, although now-retired Navy Admiral John Richardson, then Chief of Naval Operations, stated in 2019 that the service had “learned a lot [about] the engineering of building something like that that can handle that much electromagnetic energy and not just explode,” adding that “It’s too great a weapon system, so it’s going somewhere, hopefully.” Other countries, including China , are still pushing ahead with similarly-sized railgun concepts . So, while massive, ship-based railguns or high-powered Gauss rifles may be years away from deployment, if the Arcflash Labs’ claims prove true, you can at least get your hands on a very low-powered version for just a few thousand dollars.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 10, 2020",Austal’s Light Amphibious Warship Design Is A Throwback To WWII’s Tank Landing Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Austal USA has unveiled its design for a new Light Amphibious Warship , or LAW, for the U.S. Navy. The proposal, which recalls some of the classic tank landing ships of the past, is being pitched to meet a requirement for up to 35 new amphibious vessels that are intended to support the Marine Corps’ pivot toward distributed operations. The Austal design was presented at the Sea Air Space 2021 maritime exposition, which took place from August 2-4, at the Gaylord National Convention Center, Maryland. A model of the Austal LAW was shown on the company’s stand, revealing its bow ramp and a shallow draft, which would allow it to pull up onto the beach to rapidly offload its cargo, enabling rapid access to shore independent of any dock infrastructure. The ships also have a prominent flight deck at the rear. Previously, the Navy had been looking heavily into a roll-on-roll-off design with a stern ramp, although Austal seems to have opted for a more traditional landing ship design. A model of Austal USA’s Light Amphibious Warship concept., YouTube capture via Naval News “The Light Amphibious Warship provides the U.S. Navy increased flexibility for distributed operations and deployment of U.S. Marine Corps and special operations units to remote unimproved ports and beach fronts,” the company told Naval News . While its adaptations for beach assault recall World War II-era tank landing ships, the Austal LAW also features a host of adaptations for modern warfare, the company says, including comprehensive self-defenses, with gun mountings fore and aft visible on the model. Austal’s LAW is designed to have a range of 4,000 miles without refueling and to have good seakeeping to transit long distances across open oceans. Vertical replenishment will be possible, allowing the transfer of supplies by helicopter. In addition, the design is intended to be able to accommodate drones, apparently vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) types operated from the raised rear deck. A contractor-operated SA330 Puma helicopter, attached to the USNS Amelia Earhart (T-AKE-6), during a vertical replenishment aboard the guided-missile cruiser USS Vella Gulf (CG-72) in the Arabian Gulf in June 2020., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Andrew Waters In terms of dimensions, the ship is around 390 feet long, with a displacement of just under 5,000 tons. Around 10,500 square feet of deck space is available for vehicles and other mission cargoes, according to Naval News . The dimensions of the ship are therefore larger, but not necessarily by much, compared to the Army’s Logistics Support Vessel , or LSV, which is 273 feet long, with a 4,200-ton displacement. Derivatives of the LSV, known as Bacolod City class, are also operated by the Philippine Navy, and notably feature a helipad at the rear, as well. One of the US Army’s Logistics Support Vessels, or LSVs, the USAV Lt. Gen. William B. Bunker ., USAV The Republic of Philippines amphibious ship BRP Bacolod City (LC-550) steams ahead of the amphibious assault ship USS Essex (LHD-2) during navy bilateral training in the South China Sea., U.S. Navy Of the Army’s eight LSVs, the last two, which form a distinct subclass, feature much more hydrodynamic bows compared to the first six ships. This, combined with improved engines producing around double the horsepower of the earlier vessels, an onboard system to generate fresh water in significant quantities, and expanded living spaces, gives them increased performance on the open ocean and a maximum range of around 6,500 miles. It’s interesting to note that Austal’s proposed LAW design has a very similar bow. The US Army’s eighth LSV, the USAV Major General Robert Smalls , with its hydrodynamic bow clearly visible., US Army A comparison of the bow design of the last two Army LSVs (USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda seen here), at left, and that of Austal’s proposed LAW design, at right., US Army/YouTube capture via Naval News The Marine Corps describes the LAW as a vessel that can “fill the gap in capability between the Navy’s large, multipurpose amphibious warfare/ L-class ships and smaller short-range landing craft such as the Landing Craft Utility and the Landing Craft Air Cushion .” The first-in-class USS America (LHA-6), the type of big and expensive amphibious assault ship the Navy is now trying to move away from with its LAW concept., U.S. Navy “LAW is to be a low signature, beaching, shore-to-shore vessel with intra-theater endurance capable of operating independently or in collaboration with other surface ships, other LAWs, joint task forces, or coalition forces in contested environments in support of Distributed Maritime Operations, Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment/Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations across the competition-conflict spectrum,” the service adds. “LAW, whether operating in groups or on independent deployments, is key to implementing a new Marine Corps operational concept called Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO),” Austal added. The EABO concept has been geared around potential future conflict scenarios with China in the Western Pacific. It calls for the Marine Corps to have reinforced platoon-sized units that are able to maneuver around the theater, hopping from island to island, and also taking on non-traditional tasks such as launching anti-ship missiles and conducting anti-submarine warfare . Together with the Navy and other forces, the idea is to deny sea control to enemy forces. Specific details of how EABO is expected to work have been examined by The War Zone in the past, here and here . It’s worth pointing out that the U.S. Navy had operated Landing Ship Tank (LST) type ships for decades, which had front-opening bows and were capable of coming right up the beach. However, it decommissioned that last of those vessels, the members of the Newport class , which were substantially larger than what the Marines are interested in from the LAW, in the 1990s. Other countries, including Russia and China , continue to operate LST-type ships of various sizes. The Russian Navy’s Ropucha class landing ship Aleksandr Shabalin ., Russian MoD A Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy Type 072A landing ship., Russian MoD The Navy has so far issued concept design contracts to five companies , including Austal USA, and plans to release a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the detail design and construction contract in the second quarter of FY2022. The other companies involved in the concept design phase are Fincantieri, Bollinger, TAI Engineers, and VT Halter Marine. The last of those companies was notably responsible for building the U.S. Army’s LSVs and the Bacolod City class for the Philippines. Austal USA has its own history supplying vessels to the U.S. military, being the manufacturer of the U.S. Navy’s Independence class Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) and Spearhead class expeditionary fast transports . There are only four more Independences under construction or on order and three additional Spearheads being built or otherwise in pipeline, with no clear plans for the Navy to buy more of either type. As such, a LAW contract could be particularly important for the company. Under the LAW program, the Navy plans to buy a class of between 24 and 35 new amphibious ships to support the Marine Corps, particularly in implementing the new EABO operational concept. If all goes to plan, the first example of these new warships would be procured in Fiscal Year 2023, and the FY2022 budget requests $13.2 million in research and development funding for the program. A US Navy Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercraft unloads Marine Joint Light Tactical Vehicles on a beach. The Navy is looking for an amphibious assault craft to bridge the capability gap between large, multipurpose amphibious ships and smaller, short-range craft such as the LCAC., U.S. Navy The LAW ships, clearly, would play a significant role in these kinds of operations and would be sized to accommodate these smaller Marine units, delivering them rapidly between smaller islands, or wherever else they were required. As well as their essential utility to EABO in the Marine Corps’ mind, the LAW is also part of a more general push by the Navy to get away from its reliance on a relatively small fleet of larger amphibious warships, which you can read more about here . While the Navy’s current amphibious warships can also deliver smaller parties of soldiers and their equipment, these vessels are typically configured for larger assaults from standoff distances from the shore, are also much more expensive to procure and operate. The Navy wants to spend around $156 million on buying the first LAW, after which the unit price should drop to about $130 million. The cost of a brand-new America class assault ship , by contrast, is around $4 billion . What’s more, while the larger amphibious warships require bigger, specialist shipyards for their construction, LAWs could be produced more rapidly in smaller shipbuilding facilities, too, if the program needs to be accelerated. Whichever route the Navy takes, it seems the service is set on introducing an all-new type of amphibious vessel, and one that could well help revolutionize the way the Marine Corps goes into battle.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 2, 2021",Mysterious New Electronic Warfare System Spotted On U.S. Navy Aircraft Carriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In this day and age, a warship’s electronic warfare suite can be even more important than its kinetic capabilities—missiles and guns—when it comes to protecting it from enemy attacks. With America’s foes working harder than ever to create weapons that can put the U.S. Navy’s most prized vessels, its supercarriers, at risk , electronic warfare “soft kill” defenses are being rapidly enhanced. We have seen multiple new systems , which remain highly ambiguous in terms of their capabilities, appear on American destroyers and cruisers in recent years. Now a new system has emerged on two west coast-based supercarriers , the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Abraham Lincoln , which both recently headed out into the Pacific. The system in question is mounted at three locations around the perimeter of Nimitz class supercarriers to provide near-spherical coverage around the ship, just like the carrier’s other defenses. This includes an installation on the fantail and two on opposite sides, amidships. Another shot of the starboard side sponson installation of this new system., @SanDiegoWebCam The large enclosures appear to be able to swivel, at least to a limited degree, and feature a circular, domed radome covering. The carriers already have variants of the AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program ( SEWIP) electronic warfare system and some of them have also been equipped with the shadowy AN/SLQ-59 system , which may have been an interim application. So what does this discreet new system do? Our best guess is that it is a powerful active electronically-scanned array (AESA), potentially adapted from an off-the-shelf system like a fighter’s radar, which can execute pinpoint attacks on incoming threats that use radiofrequency (radar) homing or leverage the RF spectrum at all to accomplish their terminal attack runs. The other locations of the new system seen on the USS Abraham Linclon. , @CJR1321 via @Warshipcam Such a system could also have secondary capabilities, including working as a radar and communications node. The new SEWIP Block III, which you can read all about here , leverages its AESA arrays for these secondary purposes, as well. It’s also possible that one of those roles is the system’s primary function, with an electronic attack mode as an ancillary capability. The closest thing we can think of that looks similar to this new system is South Korea’s SONATA SLQ-200 , which includes a large cabinet-like enclosure with a pair of powerful arrays, each looking to one side , inside a round radome. This system is used for jamming incoming anti-ship missiles and conducting other electronic attacks. Of course, what we’re seeing could be some other type of system entirely. We can’t say for sure based on what we know now. Even a high-power microwave system is possible, but not nearly as likely due to the configuration we are seeing. While America’s flattops are constantly evolving in their configurations, sometimes dramatically so following a refit , and the addition of new defensive gear isn’t uncommon, the speed we are seeing electronic warfare capabilities hitting the fleet is. This particular mystery system is a major upgrade that required substantial modifications to the carrier’s outer mold line. So, whatever this system is capable of, it is clearly an important new addition.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 30, 2021",Everything We Just Learned About The Fatal Iranian Drone Attack On A Tanker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Central Command has released details from its investigation into a fatal drone attack on the Liberian-flagged, Israeli-operated tanker M/T Mercer Street off the coast of Oman last week. It says that debris and other evidence collected from that attack, as well as from two other previously undisclosed attacks on the ship that failed to cause any damage or casualties, shows that “Iran was actively involved.” The entire episode only further underscores the ever-increasing threat that small unmanned aircraft pose in this region , as well as elsewhere around the world , on and off the battlefield . Mercer Street was unsuccessfully attacked twice on July 29, 2021, according to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The third strike, which killed one British and one Romanian national onboard the ship, occurred on July 30. All three attacks were carried out using what the U.S. military is now increasingly referring to as “one-way attack unmanned aerial vehicles,” but which are also commonly referred to as “ suicide drones ” or “kamikaze drones.” A slide from a presentation CENTCOM released today providing details about the drone attacks on the M/T Mercer Street carried out between July 29 and 30, 2021., CENTCOM CENTCOM “An expert explosive investigative team from the [aircraft carrier] USS Ronald Reagan embarked the M/T to examine the evidence and interview the surviving crew members,” an official press release issued today, which accompanied a presentation detailing various findings so far, stated. The “Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team from USS RONALD REAGAN fast-roped onto MERCER STREET to ensure vessel security, verify no further explosive-related danger existed, facilitate vessel communications with Zodiac, and gather debris from the incident,” according to one of the presentation’s slides. A summary of the U.S. military’s findings regarding the attacks on Mercer Street last week., CETNCOM “The explosive detonation following the UAV impact created an approximately 6-foot diameter hole in the topside of the pilot house and badly damaged the interior,” the team subsequently concluded, according to CENTCOM. “Explosive chemical tests were indicative of a Nitrate-based explosive and identified as RDX, indicating the UAV had been rigged to cause injury and destruction.” CENTCOM CENTCOM CENTCOM CENTCOM CENTCOM CENTCOM CENTCOM “Explosives experts were able to recover several pieces of this third UAV, including a vertical stabilizer (part of the wing) and internal components which were nearly identical to previously-collected examples from Iranian one-way attack UAVs,” the press release continues. “The distance from the Iranian coast to the locations of the attacks was within the range of documented Iranian one-way attack UAVs.” CENTCOM CENTCOM CENTCOM says that experts from the United Kingdom and Israel were also provided access to the evidence it had collected and that “both partners concurred with the U.S. findings.” The U.S. investigative team said that it had “verified” that the debris leftover from the drone attacks on Mercer Street included components that were “identical to those identified on one of the Iranian designed and produced one-way attack ‘kamikaze’ UAV family.” In May 2021, Iran released video footage showing a demonstration of a larger example of one of these drones, which all have delta wing planforms, which is reportedly named the Shahed-136 . The remains of one of these drones had been recovered in Yemen last year. CENTCOM The Shahed-136 is an evolution of smaller Iranian delta wing unmanned aircraft designs, examples of which were used in the infamous drone and missile strikes on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia in 2019. Those strikes had already demonstrated the ability of the regime in Tehran and its proxies to use small drones to carry out attacks very far away from Iran itself. All of this only provides more evidence that the attack on Mercer Street was part of an ongoing shadow war between Israel and Iran that has seen both countries target each others’ commercial and military vessels . A number of other ships with links to Israel have also suffered attacks in recent months. However, the third attack on Mercer Street was the first of these tit-for-tat incidents to cause any fatalities and could prompt an escalation in hostilities between those two countries, as well as significant reactions from the other parties involved, such as the United Kingdom and Romania. “Israel is ready to attack Iran, yes,” Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz told the country’s Ynet news outlet yesterday in response to questions about the threats on multiple fronts posed by the regime in Tehran and its regional proxies. “We are at a point where we need to take military action against Iran. The world needs to take action against Iran now.” Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz speaks during a bilateral meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon in June 2021., AP Photo/Andrew Harnik “We are in very close contact in coordination with the United Kingdom, Israel, Romania, and other countries,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said on Aug. 2 in relation to the attacks on Mercer Street . “And there will be a collective response.” The new details we have now about the attack on Mercer Street also simply highlight how real the threat posed by small drones to military forces and civilian entities alike is now and how it could become more so in the future. The Shahed-136 and its predecessors alone have now been linked to two significant attacks on foreign commercial targets. Smaller countries, as well as non-state actors, are increasingly employing suicide drones, in general, a concept first pioneered by Israel , to great effect in military operations and terrorist attacks. Iranian-backed proxies, with aid from Tehran, are among some of the more prolific users of these kinds of drones and their activities underscore the relatively low bar to entry when it comes to fielding these capabilities. “Protecting U.S., Coalition and partner nation forces by countering the UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] threat remains a critical concern across the region,” Air Force Colonel Matt Dietz, the Director of Operations for Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT), said in a statement published just today regarding a counter-drone exercise his service conducted recently with its Saudi Arabian counterparts. “Our Saudi Arabian partners share that concern, and together we’re building on previous training to develop an effective, collaborative capability to protect our common interests.” That exercise consisted of a “combined training operation to evaluate their ability to collaboratively track and destroy a simulated invading UAS within regional airspace” and involved F-15 fighter jets from the U.S. Air Force and the Royal Saudi Air Force intercepting a mock group of hostile drones over the Red Sea. At least one U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) also took part, helping to cue the fighters to the incoming threats and otherwise coordinate the operation. The Royal Saudi Air Force has already accumulated a significant amount of experience in carrying out such missions as Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen routinely launch drone strikes into Saudi territory. Saudi F-15s, as well as Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries, are regularly employed to try to shoot them down. As Colonel Dietz made clear, this recent exercise in Saudi Arabia reflects the broader threat that unmanned aircraft increasing pose in the region, as a whole. The Air Force conducted a similar drill in cooperation with the United Arab Emirates in June that also involved at least one E-3 Sentry, as well as an EC-130H Compass Call electronic warfare plane and an E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft. It is known that the Air Force has employed EC-130Hs to knock down drones in the past, with the platform reportedly achieving the first such kill against an unmanned aircraft that ISIS terrorists were operating in Iraq in 2016. An EC-130H Compass Call electronic warfare aircraft prepares to take off from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates during a counter-drone exercise in June 2021., USAF As the attacks on Mercer Street show, the threat of small drones isn’t limited to targets on land, either. The swarming of U.S. Navy destroyers off the coast of southern California by still-unidentified drones in 2019 makes clear that this is a potential issue for vessels around the world, not just in global hotspots, too. “These small- and medium-sized UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] proliferating across the [area of operations] present a new and complex threat to our forces and those of our partners and allies,” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, CENTCOM’s commander, told members of Congress earlier this year, reiterating concerns he has been regularly highlighting since he assumed this position in 2019. “For the first time since the Korean War, we are operating without complete air superiority.” The U.S. military, among others, has been working to field a wide array of counter-drone systems in recent years. In addition to various aerial capabilities , this includes an array of ground-based and ship-mounted systems , ranging from man-portable jammers to more traditional short-range air defense systems to new directed energy weapons, including both laser and high-powered microwave systems. The attack on Mercer Street points to how non-military entities may increasingly have to take similar steps to mitigate this threat, as well. How the United States, Israel, and others now respond to the attacks on Mercer Street , especially now that the U.S. military has publicly disclosed this strong evidence of Iranian involvement, remains to be seen. Regardless, the incident is yet another alarm bell about how the threat of small drones is changing risk calculuses, even beyond traditional military operations.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 29, 2021",A-10 Warthogs Fly From A Michigan Highway (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Four U.S. Air Force A-10C Warthog attack jets have been operating from a strip of highway in Michigan today as part of a unique road-operations drill, the first time this has been done in the United States, at least as far back as anyone can remember. The event, which also involves C-146A Wolfhound special operations transports, is part of a renewed focus on dispersed operations , which would be expected to play a central role in any future peer conflict. You can read more about this unique training event in The War Zone ’s initial reporting ahead of this exercise . Videos posted online today by the Michigan Air National Guard’s 127th Wing and the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) show A-10s and C-146s landing on and taking off from a stretch of the Michigan State Highway M-32 near Alpena. The highway was expected to be closed off to traffic for five hours to allow the A-10s and C-146s to operate there. The drills are being organized by the Michigan Air National Guard and are taking place as part of the wider Exercise Northern Strike 21-2 . An A-10 Warthog on Michigan State Highway M-32., Michigan Department of Transportation capture In addition to the A-10Cs from the 127th Wing, which is stationed at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, personnel from the active-duty 355th Wing, based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, are also taking part in the highway drills. The C-146As, meanwhile, come from the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) at Duke Field in Florida. The Michigan State Highway M-32 is well placed for these activities, being just around the corner from the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center , which is also being used to support Northern Strike 21-2. It also makes sense for the Michigan Air National Guard to be running the highway portion of the exercise, since its 107th Fighter Squadron has accumulated plenty of experience in these kinds of austere operations during successive deployments from highways in Estonia. Michigan Air National Guard A-10s operate from an abandoned runway in Estonia, in 2018: As we have explored in the past, there is renewed interest within the Air Force, as a whole, in using austere airstrips , as a way of reducing reliance on potentially vulnerable established airbases, of the kinds that would likely be prime targets in any major peer conflict in Europe or the Pacific. During the Cold War, of course, flying from highways and other improvised locations had been a fundamental part of how the A-10 was expected to survive in a high-threat environment in central Europe. All told, while seeing these jets, and other Air Force aircraft, operate from a closed-off portion of a U.S. highway might seem like something of a novelty, the continuing changes to the Air Force’s concepts of operations mean that they could well become a more common feature of Stateside exercises in the future. Two A-10s from the 354th Fighter Squadron and two A-10s from the Michigan Air National Guard’s 127th Wing landed on a state highway as part of Northern Strike 21., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Alex M. Miller Update, 2:30 pm PST: The Air Force has published additional details about today’s highway exercise, involving two A-10s from the Michigan Air National Guard’s 127th Wing and two from the 354th Fighter Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. We now have confirmation that this was “the first time in history that the Air Force has purposely landed modern aircraft on a civilian roadway in the U.S.” The participation of the 355th Wing is described as having been part of the unit’s “continued effort to refine its Agile Combat Employment capabilities and Dynamic Wing concept, which improve its airmen’s ability to operate from austere locations with limited infrastructure and personnel.” An A-10C lands on a Michigan State Highway in Alpena, Michigan, August 5, 2021.

Miller “This proof of concept proves that we can land on any highway and continue to operate,” said Captain John Renner, 354th Fighter Squadron (FS) flight commander and one of the pilots who participated in the highway landing. “The A-10 allows us to land a lot more places to get fuel, weapons, and other armament so we can operate anywhere, anytime. This will allow us to get away from using built-up bases that our adversaries can target by moving much more rapidly.” “This is a small step toward increasing our confidence in operating from austere locations,” said Lieutenant Colonel Gary Glojek, 354th FS commander. “We are increasing the number of areas we can operate from to generate and deliver attack airpower by operating from dirt and pavement runways. Accelerating change is all about seizing every opportunity to move forward to increase your readiness.” “We are ready to get within striking range, and we are ready to go generate and deliver attack airpower from thousands of locations across the world,” Glojek added. “We are going to continue to get lighter, faster, more maneuverable, and more flexible as we do that.” Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Americas Around The Globe News & Features U.S. Homeland"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s lone WC-135W Constant Phoenix “nuke sniffer” aircraft flew an unusual mission over the Baltic Sea today. This plane is typically used to collect air samples to monitor for spikes in radiation levels in the atmosphere, but can also be employed after nuclear weapon tests and atomic accidents to help glean more information about those events and track the potential spread of dangerous radioactive material. The WC-135W, which has the serial number 61-2667, carried out the flight, using the callsign Jake 21, from RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom, according to flight tracking data from ADS-B Exchange . Constant Phoenix aircraft have regularly used Mildenhall, which also routinely supports operations involving the Air Force’s family of RC-135 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, as a staging point for missions in Europe for years.

Online flight tracking data indicates that the plane flew for at least a time over the Baltic Sea at relatively low altitudes between 5,000 and 6,000 feet. The jet cruised at between 20,000 and 30,000 feet on its way to and from the area. ADS-B Exchange’s data also shows that 61-2667 had left its home base at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska on July 28 and arrived at Mildenhall on July 31. The aircraft does not appear to have flown any other sorties before the one today since touching down in the United Kingdom. It’s unclear what the purpose of this Constant Phoenix sortie over the Baltic Sea today was. The War Zone has reached out to 16th Air Force, which includes the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), for more information. Personnel from AFTAC, a highly secretive organization, are the ones that actually operate the sensor systems on the WC-135W. The center’s primary mission is to help ensure that parties to the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty are still abstaining from above-ground nuclear testing, though, as already noted, it monitors for various other kinds of nuclear events, as well. Observers on social media were quick to point out recent activity in the region involving two nuclear-powered Russian vessels that might have been related to this flight, but this seems unlikely in both cases. The sortie does come nearly a week after the Russian Navy’s Oscar-II class nuclear guided-missile submarine Orel broke down while transiting out of the Baltic Sea into the North Sea via Denmark’s Great Belt strait. “It is always worrying when a vessel of this type has problems with propulsion,” Major Elisabeth Eikeland, a spokesperson for the Norweigan Armed Forces’ Joint Headquarters, told The Barents Observer after the incident. The Russian Navy’s Oscar-II class nuclear guided-missile submarine Orel after its apparent break down off the coast of Denmark., ROYAL DANISH NAVY THIRD SQUADRON VIA FACEBOOK Still, while the Russian Navy, like the Soviet Navy before it , is also no stranger to serious accidents involving nuclear-powered submarines , there is no indication one way or another that an issue with Orel ‘s reactor was in any way a factor or that there was any release of radiation, and the submarine was ultimately able to continue on its way under its own power after the still-unexplained loss of propulsion. It is also worth pointing out that, while 61-2667 had arrived in the United Kingdom the day after the boat’s break down, the aircraft had already been headed to Mildenhall days before that occurred. The aircraft’s route also took it over the Baltic Sea well to the northeast of the Great Belt. Sevmorput , one of just four nuclear-powered cargo ships ever built and the only one still in service, has also been observed on online ship tracking software sailing in the Gulf of Finland recently. In November 2020, Vyacheslav Ruksha, head of the Northern Sea Route Directorate at Russia’s state nuclear company Rosatom, disclosed that the ship was headed for dry dock in St. Petersburg after one of its four propellers broke for unknown reasons while it was sailing off the coast of Angola earlier in the year. Sevmorput in the Baltic Sea in February 2020., Kinburn via Wikimedia It’s unclear what the current status of Sevmorput is and it is possible that the ship’s current activities could be sea trials following the propeller repairs, but, again, there have been no reports of any issues with this vessel’s nuclear plant as a result of the damage it suffered last year. 61-2667’s flight also did not take it into the Gulf of Finland and the aircraft appears to have remained south of that body of water for the duration of its flight. Depending on the prevailing weather patterns, a flight over the Baltic Sea could have been intended to snoop for radioactive particles emanating from further to the north and east . Russia notably conducted at least some testing of its controversial nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missile, dubbed Burevestnik , at Nyonoksa on the White Sea to the northeast. A major radiological accident in the area in 2019 was all but certainly related to this work and may well have prompted a decision to move further testing to the Novaya Zemlya , an archipelago in the Arctic. This general region of Russia is also home to a number of naval bases hosting nuclear submarines, civilian nuclear powerplants, and nuclear waste disposal sites. Spikes in radiation have been recorded in the region in the past, including one just last summer , which have prompted concerns about potential accidents at power generation and waste facilities. Beyond all this, Constant Phoenix aircraft have been regularly deployed around the world over the years for routine collection sorties intended to confirm there have been no significant changes to ambient levels of radiation as part of AFTAC’s Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty monitoring mission. AFTAC insisted that this was the purpose of a Constant Phoenix flight over the Arctic in 2017, despite that flight taking place amid reports of elevated levels of radioactive iodine-131 in the atmosphere that appeared to be coming from Russia’s northwestern Kola Peninsula. Iodine-131 is a byproduct of certain nuclear fission reactions and a spike in concentrations could have pointed to a nuclear test or accident of some kind. Routine, or not, 61-2667’s flight also underscores the limited capacity the Air Force has to carry out “nuke sniffing” missions of any kind at present. As already mentioned, the Air Force only has one WC-135 of any type still in service, having retired its only other operational Constant Phoenix jet, a WC-135C with the serial number 62-3582, last year. Both of these aircraft were originally built in the 1960s in other configurations before being converted into Constant Phoenixes and have been increasingly difficult to operate and maintain for years now. Major Problems with 62-3582 had become so commonplace by the time of its retirement that crews had nicknamed it “ Lucifer’s Chariot .” 61-2667 was left stranded for two months at RAAF Amberley in Australia due to mechanical problems earlier this year. The Air Force is planning to turn three KC-135R aerial refueling tankers into WC-135Rs to provide additional capacity for the Constant Phoenix mission, but it’s unclear when the first of those aircraft might start flying in their new configuration. The service only moved to start converting the aircraft last year. The Air Force has also been working on podded systems that could enable other aircraft, including unmanned platforms, to carry out at least some of these missions. Still, 61-2667’s sortie over the Baltic Sea today was certainly intriguing and The War Zone will be sure to update this story with any new information we may receive about this flight.

Brett Tingley and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 27, 2021",Kratos Says Secret “Off-Board Sensing Station” Unmanned Aircraft Will Be Transformative,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking to field a new type of low-cost yet advanced drone to be used as an “Off-Board Sensing Station,” or OBSS. Details remain very limited, and the few publicly available Air Force Research Laboratory documents on the program state that specifics are only available to approved contractors. Still, according to Kratos, one of the companies involved with the effort, the new unmanned platform could potentially end up being as revolutionary as the firm’s stealthy XQ-58 Valkyrie has been. The remarks about the OBSS program were made by Eric DeMarco, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, during a company earnings call this week. DeMarco says that if the program is successful, the company believes it “could ultimately be as significant and transformational to Kratos as we expect Valkyrie to be.” The CEO added that the OBSS program is a signal that “the total addressable market opportunity for Kratos’ class of tactical drones is rapidly expanding and clarifying, as the Department of Defense strives for affordable force multiplier systems and technologies.” The first Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie demonstrator, serial number 15-8001., USAF According to a transcript of the call, when an investor asked DeMarco for more details about why he feels the OBSS program will be so transformational for the company, the CEO remained quite tight-lipped: Yes, there’s very little publicly out there on this opportunity. Very little. But it is an attributable [sic; attritable] low-cost system. And if we – this is very competitive – we are successful in receiving a contract on this. This has legs. This program has legs. And I really can’t say much more about it, […] because there’s only that one piece of paper out there on the program, but it’s expected to be awarded very soon now. We know Kratos is working on a handful of potentially major unmanned aircraft projects that remain classified. This seems to be one of them. Attritable, in this sense, refers to aircraft or other assets that are low-cost, reusable to an extent, but ultimately expendable. The term is most commonly used in the term “ attrition warfare ,” in which opposing forces attempt to wear one another down by forcing the other side to expend their resources and personnel until they can no longer fight. In the case of UAVs, this would mean imply aircraft that are designed to be able to be lost in combat without causing significant harm to the outcome of an operation. In other words, these are reusable systems that are advanced enough to make a major impact in the battlespace, but cheap enough to be used on high-risk missions where they could be lost. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) issued a statement of objectives (SOO) abstract and broad agency announcement (BAA) for the OBSS program earlier this year. Both documents are low on actual specifics of the program, and the BAA states that the full statement of objectives is only available to contractors approved by the Department of Defense. However, AFRL did say that the program aims to “develop and flight demonstrate an open architecture aircraft concept to achieve the goals of rapid time-to-market and low acquisition cost” and that the aircraft “will be designed for limited life in terms of years, not decades, with no depot maintenance and limited field maintenance considerations.” An XQ-58A Valkyrie launches at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground in 2020., USAF/SSgt. Joshua King Kratos’ DeMarco stated that his company’s “Ghost Works” division has been working on the platform “for the last several months.” There is little information on this sector of the company, but judging from the name’s similarity to Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works and Boeing’s Phantom Works , it is likely Kratos’ advanced design and prototyping division. The AFRL’s statement of objectives notes that “scalable and responsive manufacturing technologies” will be used to keep costs down for the OBSS program. Kratos’ flagship platform, the XQ-58A Valkyrie, was first developed using these manufacturing concepts as part of the AFRL’s Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology program, or LCAAT. Using these techniques, Kratos was able to design, build, and make a first flight of the XQ-58A after just two and a half years from the contract award. The objectives of that program included avoiding the “escalating cost trajectory of tactically relevant aircraft,” “designing and building UAS faster by developing better design tools,” and “maturing and leveraging commercial manufacturing processes to reduce build time and cost.” Kratos has been using the platform to shake things up when it comes to aircraft development, particularly when it comes to cost. A 2019 estimate projected that each XQ-58A unit would cost just $2-3 million . An Air Force slide outlining the scope of the LCAAT program., USAF The XQ-58 has become somewhat of an experimental testbed, having already been tested in a wide variety of roles such as serving as a datalink between an F-22 and F-35 , or even as a launch platform for smaller drones using its weapon bay. Kratos has also been selected to develop a UAV for the Air Force’s Skyborg initiative, and it’s likely the XQ-58 will serve as the basis for their offering. The Valkyrie can carry munitions such as the 250-pound class GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), meaning it could as an attritable unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV). While Kratos is now the only contractor to have publicly discussed the OBSS program, Inside Defense reported earlier this year that the AFRL aimed to award $18 million in contracts this month to two companies for a “one-year base effort,” with one company to potentially be awarded a $31.5 million, 15-month option effort following this initial contract. The Department of Defense’s SOO abstract states that any viable platforms to stem from the program will be ultimately owned by the U.S. government. “The Government envisions future variants that will be built from a common, Government-owned system architecture,” the abstract reads. “The ability to develop future variants from the common architecture will allow the Government to rapidly adapt to changing requirements.” An XQ-58A deploying an ALTIUS-600 UAV from a Common Launch Tube., USAF It’s not certain just how this OBSS aircraft will be used, or even what type of aircraft it will be, but judging from its name, any UAVs that come out of the program could be used as distributed sensing platforms . The Air Force has been moving towards using distributed sensor networks as part of its wider Advanced Battle Management System initiative. In such a framework, unmanned platforms of various types could be used to gather battlefield intelligence in high threat areas, and relay that information to other assets or command centers who can then act on it or share it with other forces . The OBSS platform could even potentially serve as a stand-in sensor for other assets operating outside of the reach of enemy air defenses. The Pentagon is developing a variety of new long-range missiles and other weaponry that are networked, meaning an aircraft or other asset can fire them from well outside of the range of the defense networks that protect their intended target or even target area, and then “hand-off” targeting duties to other systems operating within that contested territory. Even the weapons themselves can be networked together and would benefit from such assistance. It’s possible that attritable platforms like the OBSS operating in harm’s way could help fulfill this forward targeting role in the future, and/or simply act as more standard intelligence gathering and surveillance platforms. It’s also worth noting that by networking the OBSS-like drone systems together, massive amounts of territory can be surveilled in a short period of time, providing rapid intelligence collection and targeting capabilities. If one is lost, the swarm can optimize itself in real-time to compensate and maintain persistent surveillance. This distributed capability has been viewed as a game-changer in war games and is being pursued on multiple fronts. It’s important to note that we have no real sense of what the actual OBSS hardware will look like. We could end up seeing a much larger or smaller platform, or even something air-launched that could also extend the sensor capabilities of larger manned or unmanned platforms. Above all else, the Air Force’s initiative in fielding these platforms demonstrates the service’s ongoing commitment to fielding more low-cost, but highly-capable unmanned platforms in the near future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 9, 2021",Air Force Throws Millions At Startup Trying To Build Reusable Hypersonic Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has teamed up with venture capital firms to award a $60-million contract to Hermeus Corporation which should secure the flight testing phase of the company’s first reusable hypersonic aircraft, named Quarterhorse. This is the first of a planned family of high-speed aircraft from the startup. Although primarily aimed at commercial markets, the Air Force is eyeing the same technology for a future high-speed presidential transport , and potentially other applications, too. Hermeus announced today that it had secured the funding required for the Quarterhorse’s flight test program, which it says will provide “the fastest reusable aircraft in the world,” as well as the first to fly using a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) engine. The contract was awarded July 30 and is reportedly one of the most valuable ever of its type to be awarded to a startup. A slide from the company’s presentation about the Quarterhorse., Hermeus Corporation The TBCC powerplant is central to the company’s ambitions and its potential has alerted the Air Force. Essentially, a TBCC engine combines a high-speed ramjet or scramjet with a regular jet turbine to ensure the aircraft can also function at lower speeds. The advantage of this propulsion arrangement is that the aircraft is able to take off like any other jet, using existing infrastructure, accelerate to high supersonic or hypersonic speeds for the cruise portion of its flight, and then decelerate back down to land at its destination, again as normal. The company’s TBCC powerplant will include a General Electric J85 turbojet engine, as used in the T-38 Talon jet trainer, and will be validated in the Quarterhorse aircraft, three of which are planned. These unmanned test aircraft will be around 40 feet long with a 10-foot wingspan. A first test flight is expected in only around 18 months. According to the terms of the Air Force contract, Hermeus is required to flight test a reusable hypersonic propulsion system and then develop, build and test the three Quarterhorse concept aircraft, all over a three-year period. Further, the company is to “provide a payload integration guide for future hypersonic flight testing with Quarterhorse” and deliver “wargaming inputs for use in Air Force strategic analysis tools.” “When it comes to technology, we often hear the term ‘game-changing,’” said Major General Heather Pringle, commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory, in a press release from the service. “However, hypersonic aircraft and propulsion systems are truly game-changing and will revolutionize how we travel, just as automobiles did in the last century. We are excited to be part of this effort, and to help propel this important technology.” The company’s Mach-5 engine demonstrator., U.S. Air Force If successful, the Quarterhorse could provide “a stepping-stone to more intermediate products,” Skyler Shuford, one of the Hermeus founders and now its chief operating officer, told Defense One . Thereafter, the company hopes to embark on a larger passenger airliner, of the kind that could whisk paying passengers across the Atlantic or bring the President or high-ranking officials to meetings in potentially record time. The contract award has been made as part of the AFWERX innovation initiative , a technology incubator the Air Force established in 2017 to leverage commercial technology for the benefit of the military. Specifically, the budget is made available via the Strategic Funding Increase (STRATFI) program led by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Presidential and Executive Airlift Directorate . The latter organization is, in turn, responsible for the acquisition and support of the Air Force’s current and next-generation VIP aircraft, including the next Air Force One . The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is also involved in funding the Hermeus contract. The latest contract comes almost exactly a year after a previous Air Force Phase II SBIR contract , valued at $1.5 million, was awarded to Hermeus to continue its work on hypersonic travel after the company successfully tested a Mach-5 engine prototype in February 2020. Both contracts are part of a wider effort led by the Presidential and Executive Airlift Directorate to “fuel the burgeoning commercial resurgence of high-speed passenger travel,” according to the Air Force, in what it describes as the Vector Initiative. As well as Hermeus, the Presidential and Executive Airlift team has partnered with Boom Supersonic and with Exosonic , with a view to looking into different possibilities for high-speed travel. “Small business partnership is recognized by the U.S. Air Force as an important component to driving innovation,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Burger, the Vector Initiative program manager. “Reducing risk in high-speed transport technologies, as we are doing with this contract, provides near-term and long-term benefits to both the U.S. Air Force and the defense industrial base. We are very excited to see Hermeus translate their demonstrated successes in engine prototyping into flight systems.” A concept for a future hypersonic transport aircraft from Hermeus., Hermeus Corporation For its part, Hermeus says it’s confident that the relatively small sum of $60 million will be enough to flight test its TBCC engine “across the full flight envelope.” The firm says it will achieve this ambition by “leveraging autonomous and reusable systems, ruthlessly focused requirements, and a hardware-rich program,” but did not provide more details. Not only will the Quarterhorse be unmanned, but it seems at least some of the test specimens, or components of them, will be expected to be expendable, the company saying it will “push the envelope, sometimes strategically to the point of failure in flight test.” Ultimately, the aim is to run a higher-risk test program that can be wrapped up quicker, reducing overall program costs. Once the Quarterhorse aircraft have proved out the TBCC engine technology, the company hopes it will be able to further develop this for applications within both the commercial and military realms, or what the company calls the “dual-use space for hypersonic technology.” So far, Hermeus has talked of its ambition to fly a passenger aircraft from New York to London in just 90 minutes, flying at a speed of Mach 5, or roughly 3,000 miles per hour. Despite the promise of those rapid global connections, there is still the problem of sonic booms and the noise issue that saw a ban on commercial supersonic flight over land introduced in the 1970s. Brigadier General Ryan Britton, (right), Program Executive Officer of the Presidential and Executive Airlift Directorate, visits Hermeus Corporation last November for a demonstration of the company’s Mach 5 engine., U.S. Air Force “While this partnership with the U.S. Air Force underscores U.S. Department of Defense interest in hypersonic aircraft, when paired with Hermeus’ partnership with NASA announced in February 2021, it is clear that there are both commercial and defense applications for what we’re building,” said Hermeus CEO and co-founder, AJ Piplica. For the Air Force, while the Presidential and Executive Airlift mission is at the forefront of its stated interest in reusable hypersonic aircraft, there’s clearly also scope for the same technology, and in particular, the TBCC engines, to be used for other applications, too. “Ultimately we want to have options within the commercial aircraft marketplace for platforms that can be modified for enduring Air Force missions such as senior leader transport, as well as mobility, ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance], and possibly other mission sets,” said Brigadier General Jason Lindsey, the Program Executive Officer for Presidential and Executive Airlift. Tellingly, a slide from the company’s own presentation about the contract award mentions time-critical cargo and reconnaissance as possible missions for a planned “mid-size autonomous aircraft” that would follow the initial, small-scale demonstrators. The Pentagon has been increasingly looking at the challenge of delivering military cargoes to where they are required, much more rapidly, while a hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft is another topic that refuses to go away entirely. Hermeus Corporation All that is a long way off, however, and Hermeus will first have to prove that its TBCC engine is indeed a suitable powerplant for a reusable hypersonic aircraft. No doubt there are also significant challenges involved in maturing this technology, especially at the kind of price point that has been suggested for the initial development phase. In contrast, Lockheed Martin said it would cost around $1 billion to develop a fighter-sized combined-cycle demonstrator. Regardless, developing high-speed technologies, let alone hypersonic ones, traditionally requires considerable amounts of money. Clearly, however, the Air Force has confidence in the proposals from Hermeus and it will be interesting to see the next developments in this cutting-edge program.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 15, 2021",Ripsaw Unmanned Mini-Tank Sent To The Army’s Shooting Range For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army recently conducted the first live-fire testing with one of its prototype 30mm cannon-armed Ripsaw M5 unmanned mini-tanks , which are derived from a series of vehicles that have probably seen more time on movie screens than on the range. The service also demonstrated the ability to operate the vehicle from a control station installed inside a modified Bradley Fighting Vehicle , highlighting the potential for pairing M5s with manned platforms in the future. This sort of “loyal wingman” type role is one potential mission set the Army has said it is looking at for the Ripsaws, or similar future designs, which it has acquired are part of a broader effort to expand the use of unmanned ground vehicles across the service. A Ripsaw M5 unmanned ground vehicle at Fort Dix, New Jersey, during testing in 2021., US Army Personnel from two different components of the Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC), the Armaments Center at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, and the Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC) at the Detroit Arsenal in Michigan, together with contractors from Booz Allen Hamilton, joined together to carry out the live-fire testing. The actual shooting took place at Fort Dix in New Jersey on July 30. The service’s Next-Generation Combat Vehicle Cross-Functional Team (NGCV CFT), part of Army Futures Command, is overseeing all testing of the M5 as part of the Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) program. “To date, there hasn’t been any testing other than in the lab,”  Mike Mera, an engineer in the Remote Weapons Branch at the Armaments Center at Picatinny, said in a statement. “We want to look at the integration of a turret, which was provided as government-furnished equipment to the effort, onto the platform.” Norwegian defense contractor Kongsberg has supplied the turrets, which are Protector RT40 remote weapon stations, for use on the M5s. The RT40’s main armament is a 30mm XM813 automatic cannon and it also has a coaxially-mounted 7.62x51mm M240 machine gun . Launchers for smoke grenades, used to create protective smoke screens around a vehicle, are mounted on either side. The RT40, previously known as the MCT-30 , is the same turrets that the Army used on its XM1296 Stryker Dragoon 8×8 wheeled armored vehicles. In June, the service announced it had picked a different turret , from Israeli defense contractor Rafael, supplied in partnership with U.S. firm Pratt Miller, which is now a subsidiary of truck-maker Oshkosh, to arm hundreds of other Strykers as part of the Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS) program. An Army Stryker Dragoon 8×8 wheeled armored vehicle with an MCT-30/RT40 turret., US Army “We’re using high-speed cameras to look at the platform, cannon, and turret dynamics,” Mera, the Armaments Center engineer, further explained about the recent testing at Fort Dix. “We’ve got data collection systems downrange to collect the dispersion information, and we’ll evaluate both the performance and quality of the overall integration to make sure expectations are being met.” Making sure this turret, which is relatively large compared to the rest of the M5, works on the vehicle is key to Army’s entire vision for the RCV-M. The service has previously said that the unmanned vehicle would need to have sufficient “lethality to defeat some Tier I threats,” a category that includes hostile vehicles armed with medium-caliber guns , large recoilless rifles , or multiple anti-tank guided missiles . A tracer round fired from a Ripsaw M5 streaks toward a target during the recent live-fire training., US Army Howe and Howe Technologies, the Ripsaw’s manufacturer, now a division of Textron, has touted the M5’s ability to accommodate a wide array of potentially weighty payloads without the need for dramatic changes to the vehicle’s core design in the past. “Nobody has ever done that for the U.S. Army before, making it truly scalable, so you can say this mission set requirement is going to be we are going to need a payload of 6,000 pounds, it’s going to need this suspension package, it’s going to deliver this payload at this time,” Mike Howe, the Senior Vice President of Howe and Howe, told Military.com in 2019. “Or it’s going to need a 1,000-pound [remote weapons station] system, it’s going to use the same chassis, same suspension components with slight variations and you can scale it down.” The Army picked the M5 as the winner of its RCV-M competition in January 2020. However, it’s important to note that this was not the first time the Army has tested Ripsaw variants, including driver-optional versions. Examples have also made appearances in multiple Hollywood blockbusters, including G.I. Joe: Retaliation , Fast and Furious 8: Fate of the Furious , and Mad Max: Fury Road . The name M5 actually refers to the fact that this is the fifth generation of the Ripsaw design, which has often been characterized most by its high speed for a tracked vehicle. Early, stripped-down versions have demonstrated the ability to get up to 65 miles per hour on improved roads. https://youtube.com/watch?v=-Qsqggvlfqg https://youtube.com/watch?v=zAhjJYUdUeM While the M5, and its armament specifically, was the focus of the testing last week, it also highlighted how the Army might field a fleet of RCV-Ms in the future. Operators fired the weapons on the unmanned mini-tank remotely using a control station installed inside a Mission Enabling Technologies Demonstrator (MET-D) vehicle. The MET-D is a modified Bradley Fighting Vehicle designed to, among other things, provide a mobile control center for unmanned ground vehicles. Previous Army tests showed that personnel riding in the MET-D could control two other unmanned vehicles, modified M113 armored personnel carriers, and that the entire trio could operate a single team. The MET-D also has an array of additional capabilities, including an advanced communications and data-sharing suite and cameras positioned around the hull to improve situational awareness.

RCV-M is in the middle of the Army’s current three-tier RCV concept. The service has said it wants this medium unmanned system to be “durable” rather than “attritable.” The latter term refers to systems that are not, by design, expendable, but are cheap enough for commanders to feel more comfortable committing them to missions where the risk of losing them would preclude the use of a more exquisite platform. An Army briefing slide providing a general overview of the desired capabilities of each of the three RCV tiers., US Army The Army has said it wants the RCV-Light, or RCV-L, to be attritable. Pratt Miller and QinetiQ’s Expeditionary Modular Autonomous Vehicle (EMAV), which you can read about more here , won the RCV-L competition last year. So far, the service has not picked a prototype design for the RCV-Heavy, or RCV-H, component, which is envisioned as being closer to an unmanned light tank . The Army expects to begin integrating its ground fleet of unmanned ground vehicles into more routine training, which can only help the service refine its requirements and develop relevant tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing them, starting next year. “Here, we’re evaluating the armaments integration, but the overall expectation is to get these into the Soldiers’ hands and perform some experimentation as part of a regular training regimen down at Fort Hood, Texas, next summer,” Mike Mera, the Remote Weapons Branch engineer, said. All told, the Ripsaw, with its action movie pedigree, now seems to be moving closer and closer to real battlefields. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Drones"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 15, 2022",This Is What The Navy’s New Shipboard Electronic Warfare System Can Actually Do,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The battle to control the electromagnetic battlefield is jumping into warp speed and these capabilities are especially important for protecting warships against many types of threats , from ever more advanced anti-ship missiles to swarms of drones . The Navy is now on the precipice of receiving the most revolutionary upgrade in electronic warfare capability for its surface fleet in a very long time via the AN/SLQ-32(V)7 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program Block III, or SEWIP Block III , electronic warfare system. This system combines the advanced passive detection capabilities of SEWIP Block II with the ability to make active, powerful, and highly precise electronic attacks on multiple targets at once. Beyond its core functionality, it can do much more, as well, including acting as a communications node and even a radar system. It is also designed to be able to be upgraded for decades to come. So, we are talking about a quantum leap not just in defensive, but also offensive electronic warfare capability for the Navy’s surface fleet. SEWIP Block III concept art as well as the actual system undergoing testing., Northrop Grumman With all this in mind, we were fortunate to talk with Mike Meaney, Northrop Grumman’s Vice President in charge of the SEWIP Block III program, all about what this system is capable of, how its physically large form will be integrated onto destroyers, and potentially other ships, and much more. We covered an amazing amount of ground with plenty of new information. So without further ado, here is our exchange: Tyler: Can you tell us a bit about what SEWIP Block III actually is and the status of the program? Mike: SEWIP stands for Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program… And the Navy has procured it in three blocks. Block One, is some displays and processing upgrades they did. Block II, is an electronic support measures subsystem that is used to kind of surveil the RF [radio frequency] environment, to identify where the emitters are, and kind of identify what might be a threat to the ship. Block III, is what we produce, which is the electronic attack sub-system. And what it’s really designed to do is be that non-kinetic weapon that the ship’s captain and crew can use to defeat anti-ship missiles and any other RF threats facing the ship. That is such a key role, and as a non-kinetic weapon, you basically have an unlimited amount of ‘bullets’ you can use to defeat those anti-ship missiles. Again we can engage multiple targets simultaneously… It’s a true force multiplier. So when this threat comes at the ship, it can be a very lethal threat, so the ship’s crew and captain have a decision to make, “Do I take it out with a kinetic weapon, like a missile? Or do I allow my non-kinetic system to take it out with these non-kinetic bullets?” if you will… That’s the force multiplier effect that our SEWIP Block III system provides the Navy, it’s this unlimited magazine of ‘bullets.’ One of the many configurations of earlier SLQ-32 SEWIP suites seen on USS Gridley (DDG-101), at left, while the advanced passive detection SEWIP Block II was installed around three years or so ago on USS Carney (DDG-64), at RIGHT, and it now can be found on many other U.S. Navy DDGs., USN As we approach the design of our architecture for our SEWIP for Block III, we built in a couple of things that we think discriminate it from other systems of a similar nature. First is, we fully meet the Navy’s requirement for the advanced type of electronic attack techniques needed, not only against today’s threats, but against the future threats that we expect to face. We applied an open architecture to allow the system to be upgraded and to support technology insertions in the future. We also went with a software-defined, hardware-enabled type architecture. That allows us to rapidly respond as new threats come over the horizon in the next couple of decades, and we can address them by simply upgrading the software in our system… Lastly, we created our architecture based on our Integrated Topside future naval capability we developed for ONR, the Office of Naval Research. And in many ways, the ‘In-Top’ system is a prototype for our Block III system. What we had in that In-Top system was an inherent multi-function RF architecture, and we carried that over into our Block III design. So that means that in addition to successfully fulfilling the electronic attack mission of Block III, we also have the ability to take advantage of [the system’s] wide-band multi-function AESAs, Active Electronic Scanned Arrays . We could do any other RF function that’s needed, and so, for example, we can employ our system to provide Signals Intelligence or SIGINT, we can have it do some of the ESM [Electronic Support Measures) mission that’s currently being done by Block II. We could also have it be used to provide communication signals, and, in new and advanced communication waveforms and ways to connect not only to other ships but to other platforms… Then finally, we can even use our system for simple versions of radar, and use it for different types of radar functions, as well. So, as we looked at this architecture, and how to grow it further, we have been actively working on the insertion of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and this would allow us to rapidly identify unknown emitters and create jamming waveforms on the fly and actively adjust our waveforms to the point that they’re effective against these unknown systems. SEWIP Block III’s massive enclosure photographed during testing in an anechoic chamber., USN We also have demonstrated late last year, a new set of communication waveforms that can be employed with our system, and that could allow the SEWIP system to connect to other SEWIP systems, or to connect to other platforms—they could be airborne, they could be space-based. And this is a key enabler that can be used by the Navy to fulfill their Project Over-Match and Distributed Maritime Operations , or DMO—capabilities that they’re seeking to employ in the fleet… All of this is really a subset of the broader Department of Defense’s initiative in towards JADC2 [ Joint All-Domain Command and Control ]. Ultimately, we’re trying to interconnect sensors, platforms, and capabilities very tightly together to enhance the lethality of the force and also enhance the survivability of the force as we go forward. So by our ability to demonstrate the ability to rapidly insert and create advanced communication waveforms in SEWIP, we not only have the Navy meet their future mission needs, but it’s also a great way to just grow and demonstrate the true multi-function nature of what we’re fielding with the Navy. In terms of program status, this year, we delivered our Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) model to Wallops Island and the Navy is beginning land-based testing. They’ll be conducting an IOT&E (Initial Operation Test and Evaluation) using the system that we’ve deployed there for them. We also have two limited rate initial production systems in fabrication and test, as we speak. We’re going to deliver those on time this year and then they will be installed on Arleigh Burke -class destroyers. Then they will be deployed for sea trials… SEWIP Block III will first be deployed on Arleigh Burke class destroyers in the same general area where elements of the SEWIP Block II system can be seen on the USS Michael Murphy above, but it could also end up on carriers and amphibious assault ships., USS Michael Murphy Facebook Page We also have been hard at work on three systems that have been ordered as part of our follow-on production contract that goes beyond our LRIP (Low-Rate Initial Production) contract, and we have the contract set up for future orders as well over the next couple of years. The Navy has the ability to exercise production options for the next several years. They can continue to buy production systems from us. And that’s just a brief overview of not only the value of our Block III capability, but some of our unique aspects that we think differentiate our approach as well as some of our future growth and current program’s data. I look forward to your questions. Tyler: You mentioned the three Blocks and the different capabilities they have. Block III adds the active emitter component, instead of the passive system for Block II. I noticed there was Sidekick in the past, which was an active jamming system that worked with SEWIP. What does this new active component do? Obviously, it can counter certain missiles and things, but what does it really bring to the fight with its AESA array? Mike: That’s a really good question… So the power of the AESA array, and there’s a number of them that make up our system, the way I count it it’s 16 AESAs that make up our system, and we have four facing each quadrant of the ship, to provide complete coverage, 360 degrees around the ship, and two of them are used for receive, and two of them are used for transmit [for each four AESA quadrant]. So, we use the received AESAs to precisely locate where an enemy threat is, be it an anti-ship missile or an enemy radar system or whatever it is, and then using that precise angle and information of where they are and where they’re inbound towards us, we then use our transmit antennas to transmit that actual electronic attack waveform to attack the RF system that’s a threat to us… With an AESA, one of its key advantages is you can dynamically adjust and focus your RF energy and so instead of some of the legacy systems that have been fielded for EW they use very broad beams and just broadly place a beam in a very broad space of from where the ship is. It [the AESA] allows you to create a very tight beam. The EMD system representing the standard two-quadrant SEWIP Block III module that will be installed on the forward superstructures of Arleigh Burke class destroyers., Northrop Grumman Think of it as a ‘pencil beam,’ and by knowing from our receive antennas where the threat is, we can precisely put an enormous amount of RF energy directed at the threat… Since we can move and steer beams at computer speed at literally very small portions of seconds, we can put multiple beams out simultaneously and we can hit multiple things at the same time. So we can jam multiple threats simultaneously, we can dynamically scan them [the beams] and move them around quickly and do multiple functions simultaneously, as needed. So the AESA allows you to create these dynamically rapidly reconfigurable sets of beams, allows you to point them and then efficiently use all of the energy you have and point it directly at the threat systems that we’re facing, and then it also helps with emissions control (EMCON ), because we’re not blasting RF energy all over free space with very broadband antennas. So it’s harder to detect that we’re jamming and using that RF energy because we’ve so precisely controlled the shape of the beam and precisely pointed it only at the threat systems that we are targeting at the moment… Tyler: Is the system going to be able to be tied into other systems that exist? For instance, decoys? And I know SPY-6 and Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar are going to be fielded soon… Is this going to be a system that mainly stands on its own, or is it tied into the larger Aegis and or other ship’s combat system architecture? Mike: The way the Navy has architected the system, all of the soft kill or non-kinetic capabilities are integrated together and they have a soft kill coordinator system that manages all of the assets that are part of the non-kinetic options available to the ship’s commander… Threats will be identified, they’ll be engaged, those that can be engaged with our Block III electronic attack, they can also be engaged with decoys that are launched off the ship to seduce away those anti-ship missiles by pretending that they’re a ship and providing the RF signature of a ship and seducing the anti-ship missiles away that way. A Nulka decoy being launched of an Arleigh Burke class destroyer. Nulka’s hover in the air for a period of time and provide a more enticing target for radar-guided anti-ship missiles than the actual ship being attacked. , USN There are other non-kinetic capabilities available that are managed by that soft-kill coordinator system. It is all integrated into the overall Aegis Combat System. Obviously, with the SPY-6, the Aegis Combat System and that integrates more to what I call the ‘kinetic solutions’ available to the commander. This is where you can detect things and launch missiles against them, target certain missiles against certain threats, to manage your kinetic weapons that way. Ultimately, the fight is always going to be most likely a mix of kinetic and non-kinetic solutions that are applied by the crew. Tyler: Can SEWIP Block III also execute electronic attacks on the shoreline? Or, say, another ship? Something that is within line of sight, but maybe not a traditional air-breathing or ballistic missile type threat? Mike: In my comments, I’ve really kind of focused on the anti-ship threat, but really the system has been designed from the outset against a broad class of any RF threats that could face a typical Navy ship… We have a large suite of techniques that can be employed against the types of threats, you said other ships, enemy ships, radar systems, shore-based radar systems… that an Arleigh Burke class destroyer may need to engage in the course of its mission… Since the system is software-defined, we have this ability to create a library and it basically maps and identifies for the system—if you see this threat, this is the technique you use against it and here’s how the technique is going to go blast it out and counter and defeat that particular enemy threat or deny them the ability to acquire or track our ship or deceive them and put many targets out so they can’t identify exactly which one is ours. So there are all the typical traditional electronic attack capabilities, and we’ve optimized those for the most advanced threats that our Navy will face over the next several decades. Tyler: So one thing about the system I’ve noticed is, it’s quite large and I’ve seen renderings of it installed on an Arleigh Burke class destroyer’s superstructure. What type of structural modifications are going to be needed to install the system on such a destroyer? What is involved in getting it set up? And you say there are four separate systems, so I’d imagine they’d have to point in all four quadrants? Mike: Right, so we have pictures of our system, our EDM. And our EDM is one half of a ship, and so you’ll see that, and we call it a sponson… Basically, our two quadrants are installed into a sponson. The sponson is attached to the side of the Arleigh Burke , and then two sponsons are attached, one on each side, to provide the full four-quadrant coverage of the ship. So basically, ship installation is you attach a sponson to each side of the Arleigh Burke and then you populate the sponson with two quadrants of AESAs each. That’s what’s required to install the capability. Concept art showing how the system will be installed on a sponson under the bridge wings on an Arleigh Burke class destroyers. , Northrop Grumman The actual two-quadrant SEWIP Block III module that will be installed as part of the sponson. , Northrop Grumman Tyler: And then on a carrier, if it goes that route, it would go on a stand-alone structure, I’d imagine? Mike: Right, in fact, I’m glad you brought that up… One of the most recent actions that the government has done is they have awarded us a contract to scale up the SEWIP configuration we have and create for them a technical data package that can be used to procure a SEWIP Block III capability that would be usable on aircraft carriers and large deck ships like LHDs (amphibious assault ships). As part of our approach doing that, it’s basically the same building blocks, it’s the same AESAs, the same larger structures, we just have to adapt for the different configuration that exists on those large deck ships. So we’re making some changes in some cooling and power handling, but by and large, it’s the same building blocks that are installed or will be installed in Arleigh Burke class destroyers… With a larger deck, obviously, we’ll need to stretch and mount those quadrants of antennas at different locations, and that’s part of the development work we’re in the middle of. SEWIP Block III could very well find its way to America’s flattops that already use earlier versions of SEWIP., USN Tyler: Two major things that we always get asked about when it comes to EW and naval warfare: First is the UAS (Unmanned Aerial System)/small drone threat that’s out there , which is becoming much more palpable , specifically smaller swarming drones . Maybe they can not a sink a ship, but they could achieve a credible mission-kill and do a lot of damage. SEWIP Block III I’d imagine would be able to counter those types of attacks? Then there is also the anti-ship ballistic missile threat . Is that something that is also within the range of this new system? Mike: Yeah, so I can’t comment, specifically on either one, I can continue to reiterate that we have designed and developed this system to face the most advanced threat that Navy ships will be facing over the next several decades. Tyler: You mentioned how SEWIP Block III could sense potential unknown threats, or try to classify them and then maybe counter them. We’ve talked a bit about cognitive EW , is that what you’re talking about? Like a real-time reactionary capability to create new waveforms to try to counter a threat that might not be in the system’s threat library? Mike: Exactly, exactly. So I called it artificial intelligence and machine learning, it’s the same thing as cognitive electronic warfare… The way we’re approaching with our system, and it comes in a couple of different advantages that cognitive EW can provide, the first is the ability to rapidly characterize and categorize those unknown emitters that are out there in the environment. Every EW system designed and developed to date has a library that goes with it, and if it doesn’t have anything in the library for the RF’s pulse stream it’s assessing, it should be provided to the operator saying, “This is an unknown. I don’t know what it is, but there’s something out over here.” And so by adding cognitive EW algorithms to our software to allow the operators to more quickly identify things they would not otherwise be able to characterize or identify. Electronic warfare is more important now than ever before when it comes to protecting a carrier strike group., USN That’s step one, and we have been working on how to do this for SEWIP as part of a future technology insertion, and we have a number of different advanced cognitive EW algorithms we’ve developed and proven in other domains. In addition to that, for an electronic attack system, we’re also working on how do we use cognitive algorithms to create electronic techniques on the fly. This is a much more challenging capability because you have to not only create jamming waveforms you think will work but find ways to do real-time battle damage assessment electronically to make sure your waveforms are effective and denying the threat system information and/or deceiving it so it can’t find you in the battlespace… This dynamic is a very advanced form of cognitive EW. It’s something we’re working on, it’s not ready to field today, but since we’re a software-based system with rapid updates, it only means it’s something I see that will definitely be part of the future capability of the system. Tyler: Last question for you, we’ve seen real indications of the emergence of cooperative electronic warfare , potential architecture that’s out there, where instead of one threat being countered by one system, it’s a much smarter way of attacking the problem over a much broader area using multiple EW techniques and platforms to achieve common goals. Is networking a part of this capability where maybe this system on a ship in one place is used to counter a threat, that maybe another ship detected. Can you talk a little bit about the interlacing between other platforms in EW space and what the system will be able to provide within that ecosystem? Mike: I could say that’s an outstanding question, that means you’ve really been reading up on things, and I could then say I can’t comment any further.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Feb 24, 2021",Drone Makes First Autonomous Aerial Delivery Between Two Military Vessels,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Drone manufacturer Volansi has announced it has completed the first-ever autonomous ship-to-ship drone deliveries. In the demonstration, two vertical takeoff and landing-capable unmanned aircraft made three successful deliveries between a U.S. Navy ship and a U.S. Coast Guard vessel off the coast of Key West, Florida, marking a milestone in the Navy’s recent push for new unmanned logistics concepts to support its fleets. According to Drone DJ , Volansi says the deliveries mark the “first time ever that an autonomous drone has carried out such missions, carrying cargo between two moving US government vessels.” The deliveries were made by two separate Volansi models : the VOLY C10, capable of carrying payloads up to 10 pounds within a range of 42 miles and the VOLY M20, with a cargo payload capacity of 20 pounds, a range of 350 miles, and a top cruising speed of 75 miles per hour. The M20 can also carry a sensor payload weighing up to 10 pounds in addition to its cargo. A VOLY M20 used in the recent demonstration., Volansi Both models feature the same general layout, with a center fuselage suspended under a main wing and twin-boom configuration. A single pusher prop provides forward thrust in level flight for both the C10, which is all-electric, and the M20, which has a gasoline-powered main engine. Both types then also have a pair of small lift rotors installed on each boom, one in front and one behind the wing, for vertical takeoffs and landings. The VOLY C10 conducted two flights, flying 15 miles from a Spearhead class Expeditionary Fast Transport , or EPF, belonging to Military Sealift Command (MSC), to the Sentinel class cutter USCGC William Trump and back. The VOLY M20 took off from the Military Sealift Command ship and flew just one nautical mile, in 20 mile per hour winds, to a small Coast Guard skiff before returning to the Navy vessel. Volansi recently appointed Former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Will Roper to CEO after he joined the company just four months prior. Roper says that this recent autonomous delivery “signals a bright future for autonomous cargo delivery” and added that the deliveries were made using a single ground control station. The company is now working towards developing platforms capable of carrying heavier payloads and longer endurance. A Volansi VOLY 10 series VTOL drone carrying a cargo payload., Volansi Drone delivery concepts specifically have been explored by the U.S. Navy in recent years. In 2020, a small UAV was tested for use in replenishing Ohio -class submarines while they are at sea on nuclear deterrent patrols. In that demonstration, the drone was remotely piloted by a crew of two. A similar 2021 demonstration saw an autonomous drone carry equipment between the Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center (MARMC) at Naval Station Norfolk and the USS Gerald R. Ford while it was docked there. In a press release issued after the successful delivery, USS Gerald R. Ford’s commanding officer Capt. Paul Lanzilotta added that “Carrier logistics is a complex and diverse problem set” and that “Sometimes getting a small part delivered to the ship has a big impact on the availability of an embarked system or aircraft.” While the payloads of the VOLY drones sound small, small is sometimes what is needed most. The same press release claims that Navy data shows that warships placed on “non-mission capable” or “partially mission capable” status often do so due to minor logistical concerns, 90 percent of which can be remedied through deliveries weighing less than 50 pounds. Currently, these deliveries are made by Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors or the Navy’s own MH-60 Seahawk helicopters. Obviously, the fuel and operating costs of these aircraft are much higher than those of small drones that can accomplish the same deliveries. Also, these aircraft have other important tasks to perform. A VOLY 20 series unmanned aerial vehicle, designed to deliver time-critical intel, supplies and materials, is displayed at the 2021 Sea-Air-Space Exposition., USN/MC3 Kyleigh Williams Small VTOL drones like the Volansi models offer advantages when delivering cargo to small ships or submarines that lack a dedicated flight deck and can’t accommodate larger platforms. Additionally, platforms like the VOLY drones could be very valuable in future operations where traditional logistics support might be hard to come by. Contested logistics, or ensuring forward-deployed units are stocked with fuel and other supplies no matter where they are operating, has become a cornerstone of the Joint Chiefs’ new “Expanded Maneuver” concept , and it’s likely that autonomous unmanned deliveries could play a role within this framework in the future. In addition, using multiple small drones to make deliveries can fit into a larger concept of distributed operations , allowing larger, more traditional assets to bring large amounts of supplies to forward operating bases at which point fleets of cargo drones can distribute the cargo to more geographically widespread units and assets. Given previous Navy experiments with drone deliveries, it’s safe to say that these same autonomous platforms could be used for ship-to-shore applications (or vice versa). In addition, it’s likely that other services could be interested in the same capabilities. After its recent successful demonstration, Volansi issued a press release claiming that the company’s VTOL drones are well-suited for remote locations and austere environments thanks to “runway independence, a small operational footprint and, on some platforms, the ability to carry cargo and sensors simultaneously,” Drone DJ reports . Those specific capabilities have been a large part of the U.S. Air Force’s recent push for being able to operate from austere bases in forward operating areas without existing military infrastructure . Both the U.S. Army and the United States Marine Corps have also tested similar concepts for unmanned cargo drones in recent months These recent experiments in Volansi’s drone delivery concepts show that much like the rest of the Navy’s operations , logistical missions could be handled at least partially by unmanned systems in the near future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",F-35s Have Flown Their First “Red Air” Missions As Dedicated Stealth Aggressors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force F-35A stealth fighters have begun operating as red air aggressors during high-end training. The fifth-generation jets are currently making their debut in the latest edition of the Red Flag exercise at Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada, as part of a wider initiative to increase the service’s ability to mimic the kinds of stealthy threats operated by potential foes, primarily China and Russia. The Air Force has confirmed that, while F-35s have been used to augment dedicated aggressors in previous Red Flag exercises, they had not before been manned by dedicated aggressor pilots. That has changed with Red Flag 21-3, which is being run from July 19 through August 6 and that involves 15 different squadrons and more than 2,200 personnel drawn from across the United States. An F-35 crew chief from the 57th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron launches their jet for Red Flag 21-3 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, on August 3, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Zachary Rufus “Based on our focus toward great-power competition, we need to make sure that those [blue air] guys are ready, and we do that by presenting the best possible atmosphere we can,” explained Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Chris Finkenstadt, commander of the Nellis-based 64th Aggressor Squadron (AGRS). “At the end of the day, my job is not to give blue an easy day,” Air Force Colonel Scott Mills, commander of the 57th Operations Group, the parent organization of the 64th AGRS, added. “My job is to give blue the absolute toughest day that I can. And the way for me to do that is to bring the F-35 into the fight. And the F-35 is going to make it exceptionally difficult for blue to achieve their objectives. They’re going to need to take every bit of capability they have, every bit of integration they can, to achieve their intent.” The Air Force has otherwise not released many details — yet — of the performance of the F-35 aggressors in these latest war games. However, in a press release , the service says that the initial sorties, at least, involved “a lot of red air victories,” although that’s a common feature of aggressor training before key lessons are learned and is not necessarily a reflection of the stealth fighter’s dominance as an aggressor over the Nevada Test and Training Range. Confirming Air Force plans announced in 2019 , The War Zone was among the first to report on the service’s decision to reassign nine low-rate initial production (LRIP) F-35As to Nellis to the reactivated 65th AGRS, which will fly the stealth jets, as well as F-16s, a development you can read all about here . So far, that squadron has not been formally reactivated, so the F-35s involved in Red Flag 21-3 have been flown by 64th AGRS pilots and other staff from the 57th Operations Group. Pre-flight checks on an F-16C before a Red Flag mission at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, July 28, 2021. , U.S. Air Forc/Tech. Sgt. Robert Hicks “The goal for the aggressors has always been where we are essentially matching the aggressiveness of our global competitors,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Jan “Kuts” Stahl, the deputy commander of the 57th Operations Group, told The War Zone last year . “They are fielding technology at a rapid pace, and our goal has always been to match, and if possible exceed, that level of technological advancement. So, the threat that we are preparing the warfighter for locally exceeds anything that they’re ever likely to face in battle.” Ultimately, the 65th AGRS is likely to be in line for up to a dozen F-35s , which will have their onboard software adapted to make them better able to represent threat aircraft. That also provides a useful way of keeping older F-35s relevant, after the Air Force threatened to try and retire these earlier jets , judging it too expensive to upgrade them to the latest standards. High-end aggressor aircraft have been in particular demand ever since the Air Force closed down the previous incarnation of the 65th AGRS, flying F-15C/D Eagles out of Nellis, as a budgetary measure, in 2014. The results of this decision, and efforts to mitigate them, are discussed in detail in this primer on the Air Force aggressor program. Three F-15Cs from the 65th Aggressor Squadron refuel over the Upper Yukon area of the interior of Alaska., Master Sgt Keith Brown/U.S. Air Force Since then, of course, the increasing numbers of F-35s in the inventory mean that the requirement for aggressors has only increased. While this is being met, in part, by a range of contract aggressors , under the Adversary Air program, none of those operators fly stealth jets, which are required to challenge fifth-generation fighter pilots. While the contractors are increasingly able to provide a credible “mass,” meaning that blue air pilots can train against larger numbers of threat aircraft, they lack cutting-edge capabilities, such as low-observable features. Indeed, as well as the red air F-35s, Red Flag 21-3 also involves F-22s, as part of an altogether more capable aggressor package. Then there are the shadowy missions, also presumed to be some kind of aggressor work , that are being flown by the small fleet of F-117 stealth jets from Tonopah Test Range Airport (TTR) as part of the same exercise . An F-22 from Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, takes off during Red Flag 21-3 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, on July 23., U.S. Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Robert Hicks In the background to all this, of course, is the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS), which made clear the need to address near-peer threats, including the kinds of high-end aircraft that are now beginning to be fielded by China and Russia . The lack of suitable equipment to really challenge pilots at Nellis, and elsewhere, becomes all the more apparent when you consider that, until recently, many of the existing aggressor assets have lacked advanced radar, infrared search-and-track systems, radar warning receivers, and tactical datalinks. An F-22 Raptor pilot performs pre-flight checks before takeoff during Red Flag 21-3., U.S. Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Robert Hicks There seems little doubt, the addition of the F-35 to the Air Force’s aggressor fleet will provide a significant impact on the level of training that’s being offered. With that in mind, the F-35 looks set to be a key component of the USAF’s elite ‘red air’ force and we look forward to learning more about how the jet fares in its first formal red air assignment.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Mar 30, 2020",Russian Nuclear Submarine Broke Down In Danish Waters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Oscar-II class nuclear guided-missile submarine Orel had an unknown problem with its propulsion system on July 30 while transiting Danish waters in the Baltic Sea near Denmark’s second-largest city Aarhus, prompting the Russian Navy to prepare to tow the submarine before it eventually resumed operation. The details of the incident aren’t exactly clear, but Russian submarines have had some issues in recent years. The Barents Observer reports that Orel was sailing alongside the Udaloy class anti-submarine missile destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov from St. Petersberg to the Kola Peninsula when the issue occurred. The crew of the Orel could reportedly be seen on the forward deck wearing life preservers while the Russian Northern Fleet’s tug Altai approached with ropes. The Danish patrol vessel HDMS Diana also approached to offer assistance and attempted unsuccessfully to make radio contact with the stricken sub, but was answered instead by the crew of the Vice-Admiral Kulakov. The Orel was being escorted by the HDMS Diana when the incident occurred. The crew of the Orel waits on the top dock while the submarine suffered a propulsion system issue., Royal Danish Navy Third Squadron via Facebook There is no way in or out of the Baltic Sea that doesn’t cross through Danish or Swedish territorial waters, so foreign warships are typically escorted by these nations’ navies when moving through the area. These foreign ships are typically allowed to make such transits under international rules of innocent passage, so long as they meet the criteria established by Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Map of the Baltic Sea, including the Danish city of Aarhus., Google Maps In a Facebook post , the Danish Navy’s Third Squadron wrote that this particular escort “will go down in history as both dramatic and exciting as the nuclear-powered submarine Orel of the Oscar-II class had problems with propulsion and lay dead in the water at Sejerø, where it drifted at 1.5 knots towards the island.” The post adds that the Danish Navy offered assistance to the submarine, which was “politely but not surprisingly declined.” Once whatever issue with the submarine’s propulsion had been fixed enough to keep moving, the Russian vessels then sailed north into Skagerak, the waters between Denmark and Norway. Norway’s Joint Headquarters said that the submarine resumed its transit first on the surface, but is now once again submerged . So far, the Russian navy hasn’t offered any explanation of the incident, leading to some concerns about what the particular issue may have been. “It is always worrying when a vessel of this type has problems with propulsion,” Norway Joint Headquarters spokesperson Major Elisabeth Eikeland told The Barents Observer . The outlet adds that Russia’s Northern Fleet is prohibited from speaking directly with foreign media. However, an earlier press statement issued by the fleet noted that “During the inter-fleet transition to the permanent deployment bases, the ships of the Northern Fleet will perform a set of combat training missions as part of various naval formations, which will be formed for the purpose of conducting a number of tactical exercises.” The Orel, foreground, and the tug Altai. , Royal Danish Navy Third Squadron via Facebook The Orel and accompanying Northern Fleet vessels were in the Baltic Sea following a naval parade in St. Petersberg on July 25 to mark the 325th anniversary of the Russian Navy.

The former tanker, IRINS Markan , Iranian State Media In July 2019, a fire broke out on the shadowy Russian spy submarine Losharik , leaving 14 sailors dead and creating concerns over a possible nuclear incident. That same month, the 30-year-old wreck of the Soviet nuclear submarine Komsomolets was found to be leaking radiation into the Barents Sea near Norway’s Bear Island. Russia, and the Soviet Union before it, has been particularly tight-lipped about the accidents and mishaps which have impacted its submarine fleet. In 2000, the Russian Navy lost its nuclear-powered Project 949A Oscar -class submarine Kursk , killing all 118 personnel on board and leading to a major embarrassment for the country and President Vladimir Putin, who received widespread condemnation for his handling of the incident. It’s important to note that we still have very few details about the nature of the incident that led to the Orel nearly being towed out of Danish waters. Clearly, the submarine’s propulsion system was not working for a period of time, but we don’t know why. Incidents involving nuclear submarines, especially ones operated by Russia/Soviet Union, have long been a cause of potential international concern, particularly given how recalcitrant the Kremlin has been known to be in terms of offering information about them.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 20, 2020",India’s Indigenous Aircraft Carrier Has Gone To Sea For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. India has joined the select group of countries to have designed and built their own aircraft carriers , with its first Indigenous Aircraft Carrier, or IAC, named INS Vikrant , having begun sea trials today. While the program has suffered delays and cost overruns, the milestone is still a significant one for the Indian Navy and its air arm and is the next step toward India fielding its planned multiple-carrier force. With almost all the construction work on the warship now completed, Vikrant can commence at-sea trials, the propulsion and power generation equipment already having been tested while in harbor late last year. The new carrier was most recently expected to have gone to sea earlier this year, but that schedule was interrupted by the COVID pandemic. The first voyage will now be used to assess the performance of the hull, main propulsion, auxiliary equipment, and others. INS Vikrant leaves port in Cochin earlier today, to commence its first sea trials., Defense Minister of India Described by the Indian Navy as the nation’s largest and most complex warship, the Vikrant was built at Cochin Shipyard in Kerala and is a flagship of the “Make in India” initiative, which promotes indigenous projects to spur the country’s economic growth and technological know-how. According to the Indian Ministry of Defense, Vikrant has more than 76 percent indigenous content, but it’s been a long time coming — the Cabinet Committee on Security approved construction of the new carrier as long ago as 1999 and the planned commissioning date slipped from 2014 to 2018, and now to 2022. The new vessel has a reported top speed of 28 knots and an endurance of around 7,500 nautical miles, powered by General Electric LM2500 gas turbines. With a length of 860 feet, a width of 203 feet at its widest point, and a height of 194 feet including the superstructure, Vikrant is comparable in dimensions to the Indian Navy’s current aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya , a completely reworked Kiev class warship. That ship was first ordered from Russia in 2004, but suffered extensive delays in the conversion process, and was not commissioned into Indian service until 2013. The Vikrant also shares some other general design features with the Vikramaditya, particularly in that it is similarly equipped for short take-off but arrested recovery, or STOBAR operations. This means the warship lacks catapults, and instead it launches its fixed-wing aircraft off an angled “ski jump” ramp over the bow, before recovering them using arrester wires. However, the Vikrant is said to have introduced some notable advances over the older, Soviet-era design. For example, its crew of around 1,700 are provided with specialized cabins for female officers, and the level of automation is reportedly increased considerably, improving machinery operation, navigation, and survivability. INS Vikrant goes to sea for the first time, off the Malabar Coast., Defense Minister of India The introduction of gas turbine propulsion, in particular, should help address some of the earlier reliability problems and safety concerns that have faced the Vikramaditya , which is powered by steam boilers. While the aircraft-operating principles are broadly similar, it is also important to remember that the Vikrant was designed from the outset as a STOBAR vessel, while Vikramaditya was modified to this configuration after being completed as a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) carrier, with no ski jump. Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri served as a consultant for the design of the Vikrant ’s hangar and deck. Unlike on Vikramaditya , the ship has elevators installed on either side of the superstructure, these also being moved to the deck edges, on the starboard side, to improve aircraft handling and movements. The size of those elevators, however, could still be a problem, since they appear to be scaled more or less exclusively to the Russian-made MiG-29K/KUB Fulcrum fighter jet, potentially preventing any larger fixed-wing types from being deployed, at least without significant modifications. In terms of sensors and weapons, the Vikrant includes the Israeli-supplied IAI Elta EL/M-2248 MF-STAR , with four active electronically scanned radar arrays, which can be used for surface search as well as tracking aerial contacts. The defensive weaponry is a mix of Israeli and Russian systems, with Rafael Barak 8 surface-to-air missiles complemented by AK-630 Gatling-gun-type close-in weapon systems (CIWS). Arguably just as important as any new carrier is the carrier-based fighter that is intended to operate from it. Currently, the standard Indian Navy carrier fighter is the MiG-29K/KUB, which operates from the Vikramaditya. India ordered 45 examples of these multi-role jets in two batches. However, a successor is being sought under the Multi-Role Carrier Borne Fighter (MRCBF) competition, which calls for 57 new jets. These had been expected to operate from both Vikrant and the next indigenous carrier, although the elevator dimensions on the Vikrant could make that very difficult. In fact, it could mean that the Russian jet is the only feasible option for the Vikrant , which would potentially jeopardize the entire MRCBF effort . With the indigenous HAL Naval Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), a carrier-capable version of the Indian Air Force’s Tejas , having been rejected by the navy, the MRCBF is likely to be chosen from one of three offerings, the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , Dassault Rafale , or the MiG-29K. A carrier-based Gripen has been proposed, too, but is unlikely to displace any of the three off-the-shelf options, unless the Gripen is ordered for the Indian Air Force, too. Ironically, the unwanted Naval LCA would have been small enough to use the elevators on the Vikrant. A prototype of the HAL Naval LCA lightweight fighter takes off from the Shore Based Test Facility at INS Hansa, Goa, in 2014., Indian Navy With an eye on MRCBF, Boeing has been especially active in demonstrating that the Super Hornet can operate from a ski jump deck, with a series of trials using the ground-based ramp at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, which you can read more about here and here . As well as MiG-29K/KUBs, and the future MRCBF, the Vikrant is likely to embark, in the near-term at least, Kamov Ka-31 Helix airborne early warning helicopters, Ka-28 Helix anti-submarine helicopters, and HAL Chetak plane-guard and utility helicopters. On the Vikramaditya at least, the standard air wing comprises 16-24 MiG-29K/KUBs and a handful of Chetaks, with other helicopters normally embarked on escort vessels. An Indian Navy Sea King helicopter prepares to touch down on the deck of the Vikrant. , Defense Minister of India The Indian Navy is a long-term aircraft carrier operator, the start of sea trials for the Vikrant coming 50 years after a ship of the same name (a British-made Majestic class carrier) took part in India’s 1971 war with Pakistan. The original INS Vikrant (R11) with a Sea King helicopter during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971., Indian Navy Since then, the Indian Navy has operated the INS Viraat (the former HMS Hermes ), introduced in the mid-1980s, together with the Sea Harrier short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) fighter, and which you can read about in more detail here . The original Vikrant was decommissioned in 1997, but with the introduction of the Vikramaditya in 2013, India briefly had a two-carrier fleet again, until the Viraat and the Sea Harriers were decommissioned between 2016 and 2017. Once the new Vikrant is commissioned into service, planned for the middle of next year, India will once again possess two carriers, but its ambitions extend beyond that. The next indigenous carrier, or IAC-2, INS Vishal is planned to be significantly bigger , in the region of 65,000 tons, compared to 40,000 tons for the new Vikrant . Reflecting this ambition, India has looked to both the United Kingdom and the United States for potential collaboration on IAC-2, in particular in the fields of launch and recovery systems, propulsion, and overall design. This vessel is expected to enter service sometime in the 2030s and may well incorporate an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) in place of the ski jump, with the United States having approved the transfer of this technology to India. Once India reinstates its two-carrier force, it will, in theory, be able to have separate vessels for patrolling home waters (or training) and for out-of-area deployments, although this will also depend on maintenance requirements. Currently, the Vikramaditya is the Indian Navy’s flagship, but it has not been involved in any combat operations. Instead, the carrier has been used mainly for exercises across the Indo-Pacific region, including with the U.S. Navy and, most recently, with the Royal Navy’s Carrier Strike Group 21 . With India’s carrier capabilities now set to increase, it’s also possible that these warships will take a more active role in responding to geopolitical tensions in the region. A credible carrier force would certainly be a very valuable tool for India as it seeks to take a more active role militarily in the maritime domain in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly with an eye on China , one of its major regional adversaries. China has, of course, already been pushing ahead with its own carrier plans, with work on a third carrier underway and some observers claiming that Beijing ultimately plans for “10 or more” carriers in the long term. Whatever the truth in that assessment, China is now some way ahead of India in terms of carrier building, and that trend is likely to continue. India, like China , sees aircraft carriers, and the highly visible power-projection capabilities they engender, as being a fundamental part of its navy’s ability to match expanding national aspirations. Ultimately, however, India is very much in the process of establishing a modern carrier fleet and it remains to be seen just how effective it will be on a regional and global stage.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 3, 2021",Puzzling Hijacking Of Commercial Vessel In Gulf Of Oman Comes To An End,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. British authorities say the curious apparent hijacking of the Panama-flagged asphalt/bitumen carrier M/V Asphalt Princess is over and that it and its crew are safe, after armed individuals that had boarded the vessel left. However, the identities of these boarders and their motives remain unclear. Some reports have indicated that they were directing the ship to Iran, which has a history of seizing foreign commercial vessels, and this comes after multiple countries also blamed the regime in Tehran for carrying out a fatal drone attack on a Liberia-flagged, Israeli-operated tanker Mercer Street last week. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) organization, which is overseen by the U.K. Royal Navy, issued a notice on Aug. 4 stating that “Boarders have left the vessel. Vessel is safe. Incident complete.” At the time of writing, none of the statements from UKMTO, which first issued an alert about what it eventually categorized as a “Potential Hijack – Non Piracy” yesterday, have identified the ship involved in this incident. However, Oman’s Maritime Security Center did issue a formal statement regarding the situation yesterday that said that Asphalt Princess was the ship in question. A picture of M/V Asphalt Princess , then named Thalassa Desgagnes , in Canada in 2015., Hasenpusch/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images Details about the exact nature of the apparent hijacking, which occurred in the Gulf of Oman approximately 61 miles east of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates and that you can read more about in our initial reporting here , remain murky. Various reports say that between eight and nine armed individuals boarded the Asphalt Princess and then instructed the crew to sail to Iran. Why those individuals subsequently left, as well as how they were able to do so, is unclear. The U.S. military deployed unspecified forces to monitor the situation, according to the Financial Times newspaper in the United Kingdom, but there is no indication that they intervened directly. It’s is also unclear what types of assets, such as aircraft or ships, might have carried out this surveillance. In 2019, the United States did establish the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) in the region to help safeguard international shipping in the region. The U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan , along with the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Mitscher , did notably help escort Mercer Street as it headed to port after suffering the drone attack last week. Online flight tracking software had also shown an Omani Air Force C-295 maritime patrol plane orbiting the area during the incident involving the Asphalt Princess . The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Mitscher sails in the Persian Gulf in July 2021., USN It’s not clear if, whatever the intention of the armed individuals that stormed the ship, that Asphalt Princess ever made any significant movement toward Iran. The vessel’s position and status, based on the signal from its Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponder, was not consistently visible on online ship-tracking websites. The ship appeared to be situated halfway between Iran, to the north, and Oman, to the south, last night, roughly where the incident was said to have occurred, the Financial Times also reported. For their part, Iranian officials have strenuously denied any involvement whatsoever in this incident and even offered to help with the response yesterday. Still, the regime in Tehran does have a long history of boarding and seizing commercial vessels in the region, often as part of economic or diplomatic spats with other countries. While authorities in Iran typically announce such operations, there are interesting parallels between this incident involving Asphalt Princess and Iran’s seizure of the Panama-flagged tanker Riah , ostensibly over gasoline smuggling , in 2019. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) only announced it had taken control of that vessel four days after the fact. That also came two days after Iran’s Foreign Ministry had claimed that the tanker had broken down and that its crew had requested assistance, after which it was towed into the country’s waters for repairs. Prime Tankers, LLC, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was the operator of Riah at the time of its seizure and is also the current operator of the Asphalt Princess. The attack on Mercer Street , which killed one British and one Romanian national, and that officials in multiple countries have now said Iran was responsible for , had prompted speculation about Iranian involvement in the Asphalt Princess incident from the very beginning. However, that attack last week very much appeared to be the latest in a string of tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran on each others’ commercial and military vessels , a shadow war dating back to at least 2019 . There are no indications that Asphalt Princess has any links to Israel. The apparent hijacking of the Asphalt Princess also came on the same day as the inauguration of Iran’s new president , Ebrahim Raisi, a notable hardliner who has already taken strong stances against the United States on various issues. President Joe Biden’s administration has been seeking, indirectly, to negotiate with Iran about the U.S. government’s return to a controversial multi-national deal regarding Iran’s nuclear ambitions . Those talks had already stalled out before Raisi took office and Biden, among others, has warned that the current diplomatic window on the United States’ renewed participation in the Iran Deal may be closing. The United States and the United Kingdom have both said that they are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding what happened to the Asphalt Princess , so more information may well emerge about this still curious incident.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Oct 5, 2020",Watch This C-17 Engage Its Thrust Reversers In Mid-Air To Make An Extremely Rapid Descent,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The ever-impressive C-17 Globemaster III military transport aircraft has recently been the focus of The War Zone’ s attention when it comes to getting off the ground, in the form of an eye-catching short-field tactical departure . Now, thanks to the U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF), we’ve got the chance to see another of the big airlifter’s unique attributes — the ability to deploy the thrust reversers on its engines in-flight to provide a quick descent from its cruising altitude perch. The C-17’s thrust reversers are normally used to deflect the airflow from the four Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100 turbofan engines upward and forward when landing. By diverting the thrust in the opposite direction, it can reduce the distance required to come to a stop to around 3,000 feet or less, and provide access to smaller, austere airstrips . An RAF C-17 performing a ‘touch-and-go’ at its RAF Brize Norton base., Crown Copyright On the ground, with the engines running in reverse idle, the thrust reversers also keep jet wash away from the rear of the aircraft, which is especially useful when loading or unloading via the ramp. The Tweet below from 99 Squadron showcases the manuever: In fact, so effective are the thrust reversers that they can even be used to propel the aircraft backward on the ground, which can be ideal for reversing backward on shorter airstrips, for example. They can even push a fully loaded Globemaster up a two-degree slope if required. Another function of the thrust reversers is less well known, but thanks to a recent video from No. 99 Squadron, the RAF’s sole C-17 operator, we have a rare chance to see a “reverse idle tactical descent” during a seven-hour training sortie around the United Kingdom on July 29. In this particular procedure, the thrust reversers are engaged in flight to enable a maximum-rate descent. As the caption to No. 99 Squadron’s video explains, the C-17 seen here drops from a cruising altitude of 30,000 feet to 5,000 feet in just two minutes, although this is “not even close to max performance for this beast!” Flightpath of RAF C-17 ZZ174 on its July 29 training sortie. Reverse idle descents were conducted in the Norfolk and Cotswolds/Worcestershire areas, shown here in blue., ADS-B Exchange As the squadron goes on to explain, once the thrust reversers are engaged in flight, the pilots ensure that the C-17’s speed is maintained by adjusting the aircraft’s attitude. That can be seen in the video, with the dramatic relationship between the horizon and the angle of the wing. “The low nose attitude needed to maintain speed is part of what causes the massive rate of descent,” No. 99 Squadron explains, “Speed brakes are also used, for an even higher decent rate. Higher speed also means higher rates [of descent].” The unit goes on to state that the in-flight thrust reversal is primarily used for “Getting on the deck as quickly as possible” and it is “unlikely to be used in an emergency due to the highly dynamic nature of it, but you never know.” One can imagine how the maneuver could be useful for dropping from normal cruise to low altitude for penetrating into or near contested airspace or even landing at an airfield in hostile territory without flying low over dangerous areas that a normal descent could mandate. As for the physiological effect on the crew, this is reportedly limited to vibration felt through the aircraft: “From the cockpit, the amount the wings and nacelles shake with all four [engines] in reverse is also quite incredible.” Otherwise, the automatic cabin pressurization system ensures this maneuver is relatively kind on the ears and body, and the forces imparted are somewhere between 0.0 and 2.0G. The War Zone spoke to former RAF C-17 pilot Andy Netherwood about the reverse idle tactical descent, which he described as a “great party trick and fun to fly,” although noting that even without the thrust reversers engaged, the C-17 has a seriously impressive rate of descent. “There is no risk of stall and it’s fairly simple to fly,” Netherwood explained. “Idle, slow down, configure, idle reverse then chase the flight director as it drops off the bottom of the head-up display! The amount of ground in the windscreen is more than transport pilots are used to seeing, but otherwise, it’s straightforward.” While the maneuver could potentially be a vital tool to ensure the survival of the C-17 in a combat zone, it also speaks to the versatility of the airlifter, a hallmark that ensures its status as one of the most in-demand military transports among the air arms fortunate enough to operate it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 19, 2021",Retired Marine C-9B Jet Transport Is Getting Second Life As An Air Force Sensor Testbed,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has given a former U.S. Marine Corps C-9B Skytrain II transport plane a new lease on life. The service says it has taken ownership of the militarized McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airliner to use a sensor testbed. The Marine Corps officially retired its last two C-9Bs in 2017. However, planespotters, including those using online flight tracking software, had begun to spot the aircraft in question, which has the Bureau Number 161529, flying again by at least November 2020, still wearing its Marine Corps markings. Since then, it has been tracked flying in Colorado, Texas, Minnesota, and Kansas. A US Marine Corps C-9B, with the Bureau Number 160046, a cousin of the jet the Air Force recently acquired to use as a sensor testbed., USMC The War Zone reached out first to the Marine Corps’ main public affairs office, which redirected us to the Air Force. Ann Stefanek, an Air Force spokesperson, subsequently confirmed the service had acquired the aircraft and its new role. The Marine Corps first began flying the C-9B in 1976, three years after the U.S. Navy started using the type . The Navy originally acquired 161529, before transferring it to the Marines. Before their retirement some 41 years later, Marine’s Skytrain IIs were primarily used as VIP transports, including for the Commandant of the Marine Corps, as well as the Marine Corps Band. Later in their careers, the service employed them for more general passenger and cargo transport duties . The C-9B’s name is a reference to the iconic World War II-era C-47 Skytrain , a militarized Douglas DC-3 airliner that was an essential transport aircraft type for U.S. and other allied forces operating around the world. A close-up of the nose of a Navy C-9B., USN The U.S. Air Force had been the first to field a militarized DC-9 back in 1968, when it began flying the C-9A Nightingale. The C-9A, the name of which is a reference to Florence Nightingale , an English woman who lived from 1820 until 1910 and is credited with creating the idea of nursing as we know it today, was, unsurprisingly, primarily intended to be medical evacuation aircraft. The Air Force also employed it as a general passenger and cargo transport , as well, as did the Navy. The Air Force also had a trio of VC-9C executive transports, which were used for a time as what the service refers to as “distinguished visitor transports,” aircraft that are often referred to by the callsign “ Air Force Two ,” which they use when the Vice President is onboard. A US Air Force C-9A serving in the aeromedical evacuation role with a large red cross painted on the tail., USAF A VC-6C “Air Force Two” aircraft., Aktug Ates via Wikimedia The Air Force retired its last C-9s in 2011, while the Navy did the same in 2014 . The Air Force has since used a variety of other airlifters, including the C-130 Hercules and the C-17A Globemaster III , for aeromedical evacuation missions, while Boeing 757-based C-32As have largely taken over the distinguished visitor transport role. Air Force C-40 Clippers , based on the Boeing 737, also operate as VIP transports. The Navy and Marine Corps replaced their C-9Bs with variants of the C-40 , as well. That the Air Force has now pulled 161529 out of retirement to use as a testbed is interesting, but not entirely unprecedented. Though the Air Force has not said what program or programs the aircraft is expected to support, an airliner-sized jet would offer ample space to install a wide variety of sensors and other associated systems for various research and development and test and evaluation purposes. It wouldn’t be the first time that a C-9/DC-9 has been seen flying in this type of role. Four years ago, The War Zone looked into the case of another similar aircraft , which features a distinctive new nose section with could accommodate sensor packages, including radars and missile seekers. This plane, sometimes referred to as an NC-9D and Firebird II, also has a large number of antennas on top of and below the fuselage. The NC-9D testbed, seen here wearing an older U.S. civil registration code, N932ML. , JAMES O’REAR The aircraft is associated with the Navy, and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California, in particular, which is one of the service’s top flight test and general research and development facilities. In fact, the aircraft previously wore a U.S. civil registration code, N932ML, which was registered to the Navy itself. The exact current owners and operators of the plane, which also has past links to defense contractors BAE Systems and Raytheon and is now associated with the bogus U.S. civil registration code N879AD, are unclear. You can read more about this plane and its history here . Flight tracking data showing a route flown by N879AD just on July 26, 2021, a flight that was conducted from China Lake., ADS-B Exchange Last year, The War Zone also delved into the activities of a mysterious 737 with the U.S. civil registration code N712JM that the Air Force had acquired. Interestingly, that jet, just like 161529, had been tracked flying in and out of Colorado Springs Airport. This airport, which is adjacent to what is know called Peterson Space Force Base, previously known as Peterson Air Force Base, is home to a facility belonging to the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC). SNC is a premier aircraft “integrator” responsible for extensive conversions of existing planes , often for military purposes, including for various branches of the U.S. armed forces. When it opened its facility at Colorado Springs Airport in 2017, the company said it was part of its “Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) business area.” A photo of the Boeing 737 with the US civil registration code N712JM, which is publicly registered to the US Air Force., Reader submission The 737, which The War Zone has not seen much of in the past year or so, may also have been linked to the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO). RCO is responsible for running very advanced and high-priority projects and its current portfolio includes the B-21 Raider stealth bomber program and the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) effort, among other programs. This jet could be destined to become the next “RAT 55.” That callsign is commonly used to refer to a highly modified and top-secret Air Force 737, officially designated as an NT-43A , that is employed as a signature measurement testbed . The Air Force has also already disclosed that an unspecified business jet has been employed as an avionics risk-reduction testbed in support of the B-21 program. This is thought to be one of Northrop Grumman’s Gulfstream testbeds. ABMS is a major service-wide initiative that contains a large number of different sub-projects, including the development of advanced communications suites , low-cost unmanned aircraft , and networks of distributed sensors , among other efforts. It’s not hard to see how the Air Force’s ex-Marine C-9B could be used to support various portions of this larger program. Of course, the Air Force’s “new” C-9B could very well be intended to support the development of other sensors. There are various potentially relevant programs publicly known to be in the works now and more can only exist in the classified realm. Nothing would necessarily preclude the jet from being used a tested for multiple projects, either. “Sensors” is a broad category, as well, which can cover everything from radars to imaging systems to receivers designed to pick up electromagnetic emissions. We really can’t say for sure based on what we know now. What is clear is that this former Marine transport jet is headed for a second career with the Air Force and we may well be seeing this jet in very interesting places in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 4, 2021",Mysterious “Potential Hijack” Of Commercial Ship Ongoing In The Gulf Of Oman (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still emerging, but British authorities have issued a warning regarding a potential hijacking of a ship in the Gulf of Oman approximately 61 nautical miles east of the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. Online flight tracking software also shows an Omani Air Force C-295 maritime patrol plane circling the area. All of this comes just days after the Liberian-flagged tanker Mercer Street , operated by an Israeli company, struck by at least one explosive-laden drone off the coast of Oman, an attack that killed one British and one Romanian national and that multiple countries have now blamed on Iran . The United Kingdom Marine Trade Operations (UKMTO) organization, which is managed by the U.K. Royal Navy, issued an initial warning about an “incident – non-piracy” earlier today, Aug. 3. It subsequently issued another statement saying “incident upgraded to potential hijack.” UKMTO has not identified the ship in question. At the time of writing, the UKMTO website describes the incident as still ongoing and flight tracking data available through Flightradar24 shows the Omani C-295, an example of which is seen in the video below, still orbiting the area. Sky News , citing a “security source” has reported that the Panama-flagged asphalt/bitumen carrier Asphalt Princess had been boarded by “eight or nine armed individuals,” but, so far, there has been no further confirmation of this. The Times newspaper in the United Kingdom has cited its own anonymous sources as saying British authorities are “working on the assumption [that] Iranian military or proxies boarded the vessel.” The Associated Press has also reported that the Automatic Identification System transponders on at least four tanker ships – the Guyana -flagged Queen Ematha , the Hong Kong-flagged Golden Brilliant , the India-flagged Jag Pooja , and the Vietnam-flagged Abyss – in the general area of this reported incident are showing them “not under command,” when generally means a vessel has lost power and the ability to steer. Earlier reports had indicated that the Cook Islands-flagged asphalt/bitumen carrier Kamdhenu was also “not under command.” It is not necessarily uncommon for ships to show this status, which could simply indicate that they have shut down due to an accident or for a variety of other reasons. The presence of the C-295 overhead certainly further suggests that this incident is significant. UKMTO’s description of what is going on as a “potential hijack,” but one unrelated to piracy, is also curious. It is also worth noting that UKMTO initially reported what happened to Mercer Street as a non-piracy incident, as well, before issuing a new notice stating that it had been an “attack – non-piracy” hours later. Iran does have a history of boarding and seizing foreign ships, typically in reaction to a variety of disputes with other countries. It generally carries out such operations either in or very close to its territorial waters, especially in the narrow confines of the Strait of Hormuz , which links the Gulf of Oman to the Persian Gulf. However, Iranian officials also typically announce these seizures soon after they occur. For its part, the Iranian Foreign Ministry has described what is going on as “suspicious” and has warned against creating a “false atmosphere” regarding the involvement of the regime in Tehran. Unconfirmed reports had also earlier emerged, citing channels on the Telegram messaging and social media app with purported links to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), that one or more ships in the area might have been damaged by mines. However, so far, there have been no official statements from any relevant authorities in the region or elsewhere substantiating those rumors. There was a string of limpet mine attacks on tankers near Fujairah in 2019, which the United States, among others, subsequently blamed on Iran . Regardless, that this new incident has occurred so soon after the attack on Mercer Street , which was headed for Fujairah at the time, has already prompted speculation about Iranian involvement. “We are in very close contact in coordination with the United Kingdom, Israel, Romania, and other countries. And there will be a collective response,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said regarding that attack yesterday. At the same time, Mercer Street is operated by U.K.-based Zodiac Maritime, a firm owned by an Israeli billionaire real estate and shipping magnate, Eyal Ofer, and appeared to have been the latest victim of a tit-for-tat campaign between Iran and Israel. Reports have indicated that the two countries have been waging a shadow war against each others’ commercial and military vessels since at least 2019 and there have been multiple reported attacks on Israel-linked vessels in recent months. There are no indications as of yet that any of the ships that might be involved in this new incident have any connections to Israel. All told, the exact nature of this security incident in the Gulf of Oman, or even what ship or ships have been impacted, remains unclear. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update 3:25 PM EST: Private maritime intelligence firm Lloyd’s List says it has confirmed that the Panama-flagged asphalt/bitumen carrier Asphalt Princess is the ship at the center of this incident. It also blames Iran for the reported hijacking, but it remains unclear exactly what has happened and how the situation may be continuing to develop. “Iran’s naval forces are ready for help and rescue in the region,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh has now said , as well. He also denied Iran has been in any way involved in this incident. Update 7:50 PM EST: The Financial Times newspaper in the United Kingdom has reported that unspecified U.S. military forces had been dispatched to investigate the incident. “We are moving forces to take a look,” an American defense official told the outlet. “We’re looking into the situation. We are concerned. We’re consulting with international partners.” Separately, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters that this incident comes amid “a very disturbing pattern of belligerence from Iran,” but did not specifically say the regime in Tehran was involved. “When it comes to this specific incident, it’s too early for us to offer a judgment just yet.” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called the situation “deeply concerning” during a routine press briefing and said the United States was monitoring the situation and in contact with allies and partners.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is rebuilding the Littoral Combat Ship USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul (LCS-21) after a retrofit of a critical component in the ship’s propulsion system. The same issue that was repaired on the Minneapolis-Saint Paul affects the propulsion systems on all twelve of the other Freedom -class Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) that have been launched to date. The problem-prone ships are now facing a lengthy and costly design fix process in addition to some being decommissioned far earlier than projected. To make matters worse, the Navy announced this week that it will likely take years to make the planned fixes on the rest of the Freedom -class LCSs. This week, LCS deputy program manager Howard Berkof told USNI News that the retrofit as currently planned could take years to implement throughout the fleet. The issue aboard the USS Minneapolis Saint-Paul and other LCS concerns the bearings of a critical combining gear between the ships’ gas turbines and their diesel engines. The turbines can be used to provide extra power for the ships’ water jet propulsion systems, allowing them to reach speeds of over 40 knots , a core requirement of the ships during development. The ships can only reach between 10 and 12 knots with their diesel engines alone. The USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul in 2020., Lockheed Martin The bearings aren’t easy to replace due to the placement of the combining gear deep within the design’s architecture. “It’s a very complex fix to replace the bearings on the combining gear. It’s a very tight space, there’s a lot of interferences that have to be removed,” said Berkof this week, according to USNI News . The Navy, primary contractor Lockheed Martin, and the combining gear’s German manufacturer RENK AG have proposed three different methods of repairing the gear, one of which involves cutting through the hull in the middle of the ship. The method used to repair the Minneapolis – Saint Paul involved dropping the gear into the ship’s mission bay and removing it through a door in the aft of the hull. The ship will now undergo sea trials to determine the effectiveness of the design fix. The commissioning of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul has been delayed due to the defect, and a date has still yet to be set for the occasion. The Navy issued a statement earlier this year stating it would halt deliveries of Freedom-class ships until it solved the combining gear issue, and that it had already taken preventative measures to prevent damage to relevant LCSs already launched that are still awaiting the retrofit. Those measures seem to largely consist of restricting the ships to using only one of their two power systems, either the gas turbines or the diesel engines, but not both. It also remains unclear who will ultimately bear the brunt of the costs associated with replacing the bearings in the combining gears aboard the LCSs. Discussions between Lockheed Martin and the Navy are ongoing to determine the exact amount the service will contribute. However, the Navy’s Howard Berkof told Defense News that there is a “latent defect clause” in the contracts with Lockheed Martin that states that the costs would be shared on such fixes. “We are in discussions with Lockheed Martin about, here’s what the contract says, here’s what we believe is the situation, and we’re talking with them about how we come through that,” Berkof said. The USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul during acceptance trials in 2020., Lockheed Martin In the meantime, the issue has already become so severe that Navy has already laid out a timeline for decommissioning two relatively young Freedom -class ships, USS Detroit (LCS-7) and USS Little Rock (LCS-9), that have had particularly bad issues with their combining gears. The service plans to decommission the USS Freedom on September 30, 2021, while Fort Worth, Detroit, and Little Rock are slated for March 31, 2022. Congress previously approved the decommissioning of USS Freedom (LCS-1) and USS Independence (LCS-2), but blocked the Navy’s attempt to rid itself of USS Fort Worth (LCS-3) and USS Coronado (LCS-4). USS Independence was decommissioned on July 29, 2021, and the Navy is once again attempting to rid itself of LCS-3 and LCS-4 once again in addition to the troublesome Detroit and Little Rock . The first four LCSs do not share a common configuration with later ships, and the service is of the position that it is not worth the cost to bring them up to the latest standards. As a result, LCSs 1-4 have been relegated to training roles. LCS-21 during acceptance trials in 2020., Lockheed Martin The comments made by the Navy’s deputy LCS program manager this week are only the latest grief the service’s troublesome Littoral Combat Ships have faced. The LCS program, as a whole, has so far failed to live up to the promises the Navy made when it began, and has only led to ships that are exorbitantly expensive to operate despite their relatively limited capability sets. The upcoming sea trials for the USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul will likely help determine the fate of the beleaguered littoral combat ship as well as the rest of the Navy’s ill-fated Freedom- class ships, which have yet to prove themselves worthy of their price tags or fulfill even a portion of their hoped-for potential.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Oct 15, 2021",The Truth About The Air Force’s Biggest Changes To Pilot Training Since The Dawn Of The Jet Age,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force pilot training is in the midst of a revolution and a lot is on the line. Air Education and Training Command is pioneering a series of new concepts designed to modernize the way the world’s biggest air arm trains its new aviators. At the center of this effort is Major General Craig “Pulse” Wills, commander of the USAF’s 19th Air Force. Few people are better able to explain the reasoning behind these changes and detail the array of solutions that have been carefully crafted to offer at least the possibility of a versatile new pilot training approach that is tailored for a modern and high-tech air force, not one from the dawn of the jet age. With that in mind, we got the real story, in detail, straight from General Wills, about the service’s sometimes controversial initiatives to drastically rethink its long-held pilot-making machine. The USAF is facing a well-publicized critical shortage in pilots . Airlines are on the verge of a new round of pilot recruitment, and training new military aviators has never been more time-consuming and expensive. These are some of the principal drivers underpinning the need for a major overhaul in the way the USAF trains its new aviators. The world’s largest air force is experimenting with a range of new and innovative approaches to pilot training. This includes a simplified training process using mainly the T-6 Texan II for fighter pilots, novel fast-tracking programs, as well as a more aggressive approach to take advantage of skills that Airmen already possess, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. However, there is skepticism in squadrons that USAF leadership is looking to cut live flying hours, speed up training, and rely too heavily on simulator time . 1st Lt Steven Boger prepares for a flight in an F-35A during his nine-month Basic Course., USAF Greater use of synthetic training devices and cuts in flying hours is a catalyst for concern in the middle ranks. There have been some very vocal concerns over a potential lack of experience when new pilots hit frontline squadrons. However, the USAF says it must transform its training system if it is to meet these burgeoning requirements. The current training system was designed for the demands of the 1950s, and so USAF leaders are pressing for greater use of modern technology to create better pilots in a far more efficient and cost-effective manner, without compromising quality or safety. “The simple fact is that our pilot training systems really haven’t changed in six decades,” says Maj Gen Wills, who commands one of the most important elements of Air Education and Training Command (AETC) — the 19th Air Force — an organization that is tasked with training more than 30,000 U.S. and allied students annually. Wills is one of the most senior officers charged with the tough and controversial task of overhauling USAF pilot training. Maj Gen Wills meets personnel during a visit at Altus AFB., USAF Winds of change “If you take someone who went through F-100 Super Sabre training years ago and brought them back here to Randolph Air Force Base today, they would immediately recognize our syllabus. Maybe that’s because it’s perfect, or maybe it’s because we just got comfortable with the way we do things. I’d argue that it’s the latter. When students arrive for pilot training they are presented with the exact same tools as they have received for decades, an aircraft checklist, and a poster of the cockpit. We can do better in 2021!” The USAF has no alternative but to transform the way it trains aviators, embracing new technology, new processes, and ensuring every hour in the air is optimized. “We need a very crisp way of teaching. We don’t have room for five-to-10 sorties in a syllabus that students don’t need,” says Wills. “In our pilot training system, the average pilot training base needs to fly 250 to 300 sorties per day to stay on timeline! The scale of what we do is phenomenal. We had a huge winter storm this year and lost almost 8,000 sorties in two weeks of Undergraduate Pilot Training [UPT].” Heavy snow at Sheppard AFB, Texas, in February 2021 halted pilot training missions., USAF “The way we instruct has fallen into a certain pattern, so we are trying to take a fresh look at how we train, to build something from scratch that makes more sense. The big worry in our community is that we are going to trade live flying time for simulators — that’s everyone’s concern. But actually, the most important changes we are making are not about the technology, but actually about the adult learning models and instructional systems design.” Wills says that the current “assembly-line process” needs to evolve and break away from a one-size-fits-all approach. The USAF is working on some fundamental changes in its approach, leaning towards a coach-athlete relationship when it comes to pilot training. The mantra is “competence, not time” and Wills wants a system that is versatile, scalable, and able to adapt to overall air force needs. “Imagine a giant funnel with gears, a crank, and a chute out the bottom of it. You can pour almost anything in the top, turn the crank for 52 weeks, and out pops a new pilot. We’ve built a system that achieves that at scale. For example, you might drop a fully trained pilot into that funnel. Right now, if you show up with civilian training experience, we generally ignore that.” “Proficiency advance is an unpopular concept because there is a feeling of putting the student at risk. So we have started proficiency reallocation. If a student performs well in a certain phase they can advance faster, but we put those saved flights in the bank. If they struggle in another area then we can plug those sorties back in.” This is just one of many ways the USAF is breaking the mold, shaking off old norms, and taking a totally fresh look at how it trains . Instructor and student pre-flight a T-6 Texan II., USAF Pilot Training Transformation — what the Air Force did The broad effort is known as Pilot Training Transformation, and under it are a series of different efforts. Wills emphasizes that this wasn’t a panel of high-ranking Generals that worked out the plan, it was down to a group of officers of Lieutenant Colonel rank and below and their charter was to see if it was possible to train a pilot in half the time of the current system, meet the same standard, and potentially bypass parts of the legacy system where possible. “All over the world, people are teaching themselves to fly with desktop flight simulators . In contrast, in the military, we behave as if we are the only people who know how to teach people to fly. So we started by introducing immersive training devices for the T-6 Texan II. Initially, this was a gaming laptop, a monitor, a Virtual Reality [VR] headset, an off-the-shelf control stick, and rudder pedals. We spent between $8,000-12,000 and included in that price we invested in getting the right software for the T-6. Initially, it wasn’t great, the stick didn’t have any force feedback, but it was still light years better than a poster and a checklist. This is actually 10-year-old tech, and we are finally catching on.” A pilot temporarily assigned to the 559th Flying Training Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph flies a T-6 Texan II simulator during an immersive training device evaluation., USAF “Now we’ve evolved it to a point where the stick and pedals have force-feedback and we have motion included in one of the systems, so we are getting closer to an actual simulator,” explains Gen Wills. “Even this developed system cost us around $40,000-45,000 compared with a $26-million full-up simulator that we are more accustomed to. What we are building doesn’t replace that simulator because it doesn’t have a physical cockpit layout with all the right switches, but what it offers students to prepare for a sortie is phenomenal. It all lives in the cloud, which means Instructor Pilots [IPs] can put on their own rig and be “sitting” in the airplane with the student, no matter where they are located.” Organizations throughout the USAF are taking up the use of this kind of technology to help improve training procedures. New USAF A-10 Warthog pilots in training at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona are now training, in part, using Digital Combat Simulator World together with commercially available VR headsets to provide a low-cost way of augmenting more traditional training procedures. You can read more about this here . So what difference does this make and why does it matter? “In the old days, when you went for your “dollar ride” — your first flight in pilot training — it was widely acknowledged that the IPs looked forward to that sortie because they got to do most of the flying,” Wills explains. “The student would walk out to the airplane, follow the IP for the walkaround, who would show them everything, check they’re strapped in correctly, laboriously start the airplane, etc, and the student might do a little bit of flying. Today on the “dollar ride” students typically fly around 90% of the sortie!” “That’s because on their very first day of pilot training students can now visually recognize the traffic pattern references thanks to the 360-degree videos they have to practice with, with their VR rig they can “fly” the pattern to their heart’s content. It means that on day one they know their way around the airfield, which for me was about 10 sorties when I went through training.” Virtual reality training systems are being installed near students’ dormitories to allow them 24-hour access to training resources., USAF The VR set-up has been enhanced with a service known as Pilot Edge. This enables the USAF to link live Air Traffic Control (ATC) into the training. “In the old days we had tape on the floor, and the students would walk around the makeshift pattern and learn how, when, and where to make the radio calls,” Wills says. “Now, we can have up to seven students in a virtual pattern while a real ATC controller talks to them. They know how to talk on the radio, which means they are leaps and bounds ahead even before they start live flying.” “When I went through aircrew training to be a Weapons Systems Officer initially, my class got delayed. They wouldn’t even give me my flying suit or my boots. The reasoning behind that was that if I had my boots I might start shining them early and that would give me an unfair advantage. They wouldn’t give me my books — I might learn more and leave as a better navigator!” “We had this old adage; you can teach a monkey to fly if you throw them enough bananas. There’s no doubt that there should be time pressure and a higher standard in military pilot training. The problem with that philosophy though is that the monkeys are expensive and the bananas are cheap. Seamless access to content isn’t unlimited tries or extra bananas — we are saying why wouldn’t we let you practice, we will send you an iPad and access to certain modules to complete before you arrive. Everything is in the cloud, it’s all connected, all the data and simulators, it’s all right there. The IPs can see all the data in exactly the same way as all the students can. If I’m flight commander I want to see if you’ve been practicing well, now I can go and check.” While there is a clear imperative to speed up pilot production, Wills is adamant that this is about better training with the available resources. “We’ve made the T-6 phase longer, adding 100 hours of immersive training into the T-6 syllabus to make the students better. We’ve also added extra sorties into the T-6 course, so actually, the live flying hours go up.” A T-6A from Vance AFB., USAF The new T-6 course The broad Pilot Training Next (PTN) effort was a big experiment. It has led to a number of initiatives, with the principal one now known as UPT 2.5. This is applying some of the key lessons from PTN at both the 12th Flying Training Wing at Randolph as well as at the 71st Flying Training Wing at Vance AFB. UPT 1.0 is seen as being the T-37 Tweet and T-38A Talon era, with 2.0 being what the USAF runs today, the T-6A, the T-1A Jayhawk, and the T-38C. “What we are doing right now with UPT 2.5 is very much an interim step,” explains Wills. The USAF is eagerly awaiting the new Boeing T-7 Red Hawk that will ultimately replace the T-38 in the advanced jet training role and Wills says this aircraft will eventually give rise to the ultimate UPT 3.0. The USAF ran three experimental PTN classes, with an aggressive plan to accelerate and improve some of the existing standards in pilot training. One of the initial aims was to evaluate if students could train on the T-6 and then go directly to a Basic Course (B-Course) on a frontline type at a Formal Training Unit (FTU). The first two PTN courses flew the T-6A, however, the USAF’s 20-year-old Texans are suffering from avionics obsolescence issues, with no Head-Up Display (HUD), no Flight Management System (FMS), and they are considered to be in desperate need of an avionics upgrade. So for the third class, the Air Force borrowed T-6Bs from the U.S. Navy, which feature a fourth-gen fighter cockpit layout and a HUD. “We upgraded the software in the T-6Bs so we have a radar emulator, radar warning receiver, and a moving map, so the T-6B cockpit looked much like a Strike Eagle cockpit. Class three flew that airplane. We have now graduated 42 total students out of PTN, the last few are just finishing up their FTUs and the first graduates have been in operational units for just over a year,” explains Wills. https://youtube.com/watch?v=lfuErmS2aFM “Broadly speaking, the graduates have done well. Some finished at the top of their follow-on training class, some in the middle, and some near the bottom. One quit and one washed out. Typically, the grads that go to fighters have a pretty steep learning curve at the beginning of the course. The very first PTN guys that went to fighters got 11 rides in an F-16 before they went to their respective FTUs. The second and third classes went cold turkey, straight from the T-6B to their fighters, F-35s and F-15Es — they didn’t fly the T-38 or F-16 at all, they just adapted.” “If you really pin the FTU instructors down, they will say they were behind the power curve and behind the class in the beginning, but caught up by the end of the course. We don’t have absolutely pristine data yet on how many extra sorties they had to fly, and whether they would have performed better if they’d flown the T-38, but we are analyzing this. I’m not arguing that there’s no benefit to the T-38, none of that. If the question is “can we do it this way,” then the answer is yes we can, we can have a T-6-only pilot training system and adapt.” “What we’ve done is prove lessons from Pilot Training Next,” Wills explains. “This includes the quality of our instructors and the acceptable IP-student ratio, the use of immersive technology to provide better training tools, and the transition to a learner-centric mentality, with seamless access to content.” A pilot in a T-38C simulator., USAF “The next question we faced was whether we could apply the Pilot Training Next program at scale, and what we found is that you couldn’t precisely scale the experiment, [mainly due to a lack of suitable T-6s]. Instead, we looked to apply the primary lessons from the program at scale.” These included the acceptable IP to student ratio, the immersive technology, the transition to a learner-centric mentality, seamless access to content, and the introduction of human performance programs to UPT. PTN led directly to UPT 2.5, which is now gathering pace, marking its one-year anniversary at Randolph and Vance on July 15, 2021, as the first steps towards full implementation. Wills says that currently, the majority of pilot trainees are still going the old route, but UPT 2.5 is here to stay. For fighter pilots, most are still going through the traditional pipeline — T-6, T-38, Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF), then on to the FTU. “Out of 700-800 graduates that have gone to fighters over the last two years only 15-16 were T-6-only graduates,” says Wills. Unlike in the past, students in UPT 2.5 are graded under a system that gives credit for more complex tasks. “If they are willing to stretch themselves then they are going to get credit,” explains Wills, adding that gone are the days of praying for no strong winds or trying to get a sortie to the closest Military Operating Area (MOA). “The T-6 final check-ride is now a two-day event. There’s a three-hour ground evaluation with general knowledge of the aircraft, a four-hour mission planning cycle, then the next day they do a formation departure, fly some formation work, undertake individual aerobatics, then recover to a divert base for instrument pattern work. They land, debrief, plan the next sortie, then get back in the aircraft and fly a navigation leg home.” “We’ve been misquoted in the past that we are building a self-paced pilot training program. The truth is that the whole system works at a certain pace, but if you can walk faster, then we are trying to build a system where you can do that. Our first UPT 2.5 graduate graduated two classes away from where he started because he was flying well, the weather was good, and he just kept going. That compares with a previously written rule that said all students in a class needed to be within three or four days of each other to keep them together for graduation ceremonies.” One of the biggest changes under UPT 2.5 is that pilots now earn their wings after graduating from the T-6. Some may see this as a controversial move. “If you look at the attrition rate for students failing training, we lose around 7.7% in the T-6 phase, just 1.5% in the T-1, and 0.9% in T-38s. The reality is that historically once you pass the T-6 phase, the vast majority of students earn their wings. We believe that the increased complexity in UPT 2.5 will result in shifting the historical attrition from T-38 and T-1 training to the T-6. Thus far, we’re seeing wash-out rates of approximately 17% in the new program. All UPT 2.5 students will earn their wings at the same point, so culturally it’s a unifier, not a divider.” The T-1 Jayhawk is currently used for training new aircrews for large aircraft such as transport and special mission types., USAF Mitigating a possible T-1 Jayhawk retirement One area in training where there has been a big change is related to a pending decision on whether to retire the Beechcraft T-1A Jayhawk . Wills says: “The T-1 has been with us since 1992 and the type has never had depot-level maintenance. It needs re-engining and over the next five years, it would cost us $1.1 billion to operate. The success of Pilot Training Next combined with the impending recapitalization bill on the T-1 has us planning for a future without the T-1.” Pilots earmarked for Air Mobility Command (AMC) or heavy Command and Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) types undertake the UPT 2.5 T-6 course and then go through a three-month simulator-only T-1 course. “Students will undertake a course focused on preparing them for air mobility and crew aircraft. They will learn crew coordination, threat and error management, complex emergency procedures handling, en-route navigation, ICAO [International Civil Aviation Authority] procedures, and the many other complicated aspects that our AMC crews must master to be successful. The goal is that when they arrive at FTU, the instructors will notice a clear improvement in their level of preparation and readiness to move into the air mobility world.” Reforge could change things further While a T-6-only course has been proven to work by PTN, retaining a fast jet element in training is the ultimate goal — the jump from the T-6 to a modern fighter is acknowledged as being a big step. However, the ambition in the near term is to eliminate the pilot training element of the T-38 course and make it all skewed toward Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF). “I want fighter pilot students to learn like a fighter pilot from the very first day of flying the T-38,” says Wills. “IFF has always been a gap filler to the FTU, but it’s the IFF part that really matters. The T-38, and eventually the T-7 Red Hawk , prepares the student for the FTU. The big issue right now is the lack of fighter pilot instructors in the T-38 phase, and actually a real shortage of fighter pilots in UPT overall.” Some new pilots destined for the F-22 fly the T-38A alongside their new mount to gain insight into the way the Raptor operates., USAF Reforge is an Air Combat Command-driven proposal that could have a profound effect on the fighter pilot training process. AETC may retain some sort of T-7 qualification phase, but essentially the new Reforge concept would effectively migrate IFF over to Air Combat Command (ACC), but undertaken in T-7s that are attached to the FTUs. “Students would fly a version of the T-7 for 12-14 months and learn how to be a fighter pilot, and once they reach the 250-300 flight hour point they would do a transition course to their respective fighter type,” Wills says. “Essentially, it would mean that the T-7s would migrate to the FTUs, enabling new pilots to learn basic fighter pilot concepts in an airplane that costs considerably less to operate than a frontline fighter type.” “Co-locating the T-7s with the fighters means those young students will have the chance to fly with and against the fighters that they will ultimately fly. They’ll be working in the same briefing rooms, learning F-22 tactics, for example, the entire time. It’s about experiencing people at the right price point. We still have work to do with our partners at ACC to determine the best way forward with the T-7s to ensure we’re training the best pilots for our combat air forces we can.” The T-38 was built to train pilots for Century Series jets and Wills calls it “very unforgiving,” adding that it takes a lot of time to learn the basics of operating it. “The T-38 taught you how to do a lot of the mechanics of flying yourself, so to become a great F-15C pilot you need to learn how to handle the radar, handle the sensors manually, and process the communications.” The new Boeing T-7A is aimed at realizing fundamental changes in the way the USAF trains new pilots., Boeing “A type like the F-35 automates a lot of that. I mean, an F-35 Basic Course from Luke Air Force Base just went to Red Flag at Nellis and slayed the opposition. The T-7 should allow us to get past the basics quickly and pull more FTU tasks forward. It means that when we release someone to the FTU they will be really ready. It should also allow those FTU courses to be the same length, but we can add more of the really advanced tactics.” In turn, it should allow a pilot to become combat-ready far quicker once they reach their operational squadron. “The experience and airmanship are really important,” Wills enforces. “The question is would you rather get people to their frontline unit faster so they can build experience in the airplane they are going to go to war in, or do you build experience in an airplane that they’re not going to fly again for some time. No one will argue that hours in the air is the gold standard, but it can be effectively coupled with simulators and immersive training aids. We need to find the right balance between synthetic and live flying, and we will adjust that balance going forward.” “Everyone wants what the T-7 brings, but where you put it in the training flow and in the commands is up for debate. Boeing needs to show up with a jet that’s relevant, not one that’s based on a vision from 10-15 years ago. The T-7’s immersive training devices need to be in the $25,000 region and available in a student’s dorm room, and they need to be good — we are moving at a pace now!” The results are in So how have the T-6-only students fared? Anecdotal evidence suggests those fighter pilots destined for fifth-gen fighters do better than those headed to F-15s and F-16s for example. That reflects how the fourth-gen fighters rely on the skillsets imparted in the T-38 course. “We have had instances where students initially struggled in big airplanes like the C-5, and this underlines how big a jump it is from the single-engine turboprop to a huge jet like the Galaxy,” said Wills. “The T-1 has been a remarkable success story for AMC and the USAF and so our partners in AMC are working with us closely and monitoring the results of these efforts. They have made a huge investment in pilot training transformation and they expect us to deliver, which is quite fair.” Maj Gen Wills and Chief Master Sgt Kristina Rogers talk with Col James Miller, 433rd Operations Group commander, in the cockpit of a C-5M Galaxy., USAF AETC decided to retain the T-1 simulators, training devices, and instructors for the Air Mobility Fundamentals (AMF) course. Wills says there was some early discussion over moving to a 737-type simulator, but it was decided to stick with the existing T-1 infrastructure. “So now we wing the new pilots as they graduate from the T-6, we then put them through a simulator-only T-1 course, and then over to the respective heavy aircraft FTU. Ultimately, we’re looking at whether we should move AMF to the FTU, so that we can teach mission planning, crew coordination, formation flying, aerial refueling, etc, on the aircraft type the students will actually be flying.” When it comes to fighters, Wills says that it’s not practical to adopt a system where all pilots go from T-6 to FTU at this time. Right now, AETC doesn’t have the right T-6 for the task. “If we had T-6s with a glass cockpit and modern tools, we’d be more likely to say “let’s do this.” Given the worldwide pilot shortage and chronic lack of fighter pilots, it’s certainly in our interest to find new ways to meet requirements, and our T-38 fleet is increasingly difficult to maintain. That said, the system right now can’t accommodate such a move. Speed matters a lot, and it doesn’t make sense to add a training burden to our FTUs if we can avoid it. I’m convinced that with the top third of the class you can train with just about anything, but for the majority of the students, the time is not right and the tools just aren’t there yet.” Wills attributes PTN’s success in part to a one-to-one student-instructor ratio. “Not having a new class beating down their door every few weeks made a difference, and therefore adding the chance to do bespoke pilot training” was another major plus, but he concedes “that’s not the model when we take this to scale.” Other initiatives Alongside the main efforts of the Pilot Training Transformation are a series of other initiatives that are designed to bring new approaches into the pilot training system. Comprehensive Readiness for Aircrew Flying Training (CRAFT) is all about making a new pilot both mentally and physically ready for the job. Wills believes that human performance will be a key differentiator in future air force capability. Therefore the USAF is using a range of new approaches to help teach its personnel how to deal with stress, and make better decisions at what Wills calls “the speed of sixth-generation warfare,” using science to help it fight better, measuring the performance of its people, using nutritionists and strength coaches to keep personnel at the peak of personal fitness and able to perform at the highest level. Maj Gen Wills at the Human Performance Initiative facility at Eglin AFB, Florida, learning about physical fitness, physical therapy, and chiropractic care., USAF Accelerated Path to Wings (XPW) is a program to train pilots in UPT solely in the T-1 Jayhawk. Students fly 17 hours in the Diamond DA20-C1 at the Initial Flight Training Center at Pueblo Memorial Airport in Colorado, before moving directly to the T-1. The first class took eight students, six of whom were brand new to aviation, while two already owned a Private Pilots’ License. The first phase in XPW includes academics where students learn general aviation terminology, after which they go directly to the T-1 aircraft, skipping the traditional route of flying the T-6. At the 12th Flying Training Squadron’s simulator branch, the students developed extensive training profiles, allowing them to practice and be certified as proficient in the aircraft. Once students make it through the required simulator training, they go on to fly in the T-1 under the guidance of the 99th Flying Training Squadron team. 2nd Lt Kassandra Fochtman was one of the graduates, and headed to McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas, to fly the KC-135 Stratotanker. “It feels amazing to have endured the last seven months of pilot training to reach this point, it’s all been worth it, I’m extremely proud. I can’t wait to begin flying around the world,” she said. The first graduates from the Accelerated Path to Wings course., USAF “Fundamentally, in seven months versus the usual 12 months we graduated seven of the eight, and the last student will graduate imminently,” Wills explained. “They look exactly the same as any other T-1 student pilot, except they didn’t fly the T-6 at all. They flew really well, although as you would expect their airmanship and experience were lacking at the beginning of the program. They caught on really quickly and by the end of the program, our check pilots reported they were indistinguishable from an ordinary T-1 pilot who had previously completed T-6s. With UPT 2.5 we have been able to create T-1 capacity in the short term. Two more of these classes are on the way, and we really believe in the program. A lot of students have civilian flying experience when they join the air force, and this is the perfect way to accelerate them through training, and this program is especially good for the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserves when the students have existing pilot experience.” “We also have what we call the Civilian Path to Wings. This is about bringing a student on board and applying an assessment methodology to determine whether they have the competencies we need and then vector them according to scale. We have broken it down as Qualified, Well Qualified, and Extremely Well Qualified. We teach them Air Force Fundamentals, some simulator work, and vector them for the heavy aircraft , not for fighters. So far we have found five Extremely Well Qualified applicants, and not surprisingly they are existing airline pilots and now in the Air National Guard or Reserves, and previously trained by the USAF.” Alternate Path to Wings aims to partner with Aviation Accredited Bureau International (AABI) schools such as Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, although the USAF is not exclusively partnered with any specific schools at this time. The USAF is developing plans to assess these students upon completion of their flying school. If they meet the required competency level, they would proceed to an Air Force fundamentals course and then straight to the Formal Training Unit for a Mobility Air Forces, Special Operations, or Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) platform. Some new airlift pilots have completely bypassed the T-6 Texan II., USAF “Traditionally, we make well-trained civilian pilots repeat every day of pilot training,” said Wills. “It doesn’t make sense to do that when you are facing a pilot shortage and you have a highly qualified pilot who wants to serve.” The USAF is overhauling its rotary-wing track too. Traditionally, students have flown the T-6 before moving to helicopters, but Helicopter Training Next ultimately accelerates their path to training on helicopters at Fort Rucker in Alabama. Experiments have been run with sending students straight to the TH-1H Huey at Rucker, and other groups have trained with a civilian contractor before heading to the TH-1. “We have five courses in varying states,” comments Wills. “Those who went straight to Rucker and had no other experience and no T-6 rides had very little clue when they arrived, but after six months they were pretty good. The guys that went through the civilian school showed up at Fort Rucker, flew a check-ride, and on that very first ride, five of the seven passed! We are showing that we can train new pilots in lots of different ways. The beauty of these helo paths is that we can free up 60-80 UPT fixed-wing slots a year — that’s not small chicken. Not putting people through every single day of T-6 training saves huge amounts of money and time, but more importantly allows us to train a world-class helicopter pilot while freeing up fixed-wing training slots.” Lt Gen Brad Webb, commander of Air Education and Training Command, tries out a virtual reality simulator used in Helicopter Training Next., USAF There are a whole host of other initiatives running across USAF pilot training now. The Air Force is even tapping into previous instructors in order to help get its manning levels right. With all these immersive training devices being stored and run in the cloud, the USAF is finding ways to work remotely with skilled instructors who might be at a distant location or living away from its training centers. Remote simulator instruction is in the concept phase but is ideal for some former Air Force instructors who are still happy to teach. “They might have finished their time with the Air Force and don’t want to be all that expeditionary anymore. They might fly for an airline and be on a layover. We provide them with the right tools, it’s all in a bag and with an internet connection they can work with our students.” The USAF started its UPT 2.5 initiative at Randolph as the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020. Such was the success that the UPT 2.5 effort at Vance AFB kicked off a year earlier than originally planned in the summer of 2020. In 2018, prior to Wills taking up his current post, the USAF made quite a few syllabus cuts. He says that the big problem with the T-6’s On-Board Oxygen Generator System (OBOGS) in late 2018 meant AETC lost two months of flying with no T-6 sorties — that’s a whopping 13,000 sorties. “The pilot training pipeline became hugely backed up,” says Wills. “Following the OBOGS crisis, we attempted to introduce innovative ideas we thought were ready and in the process streamlined several of our syllabi. These changes were hugely unpopular in the frontline squadrons. It’s a wary and skeptical crowd out there.” Synthetic training aids are designed to supplement and improve the quality of live flying, not replace it., USAF ”A couple of years ago we adjusted the length of the FTUs to get back to about a six-month course which matches the historical course length. The majority of our fighter force is pretty young and remembers a B-Course that was nine-to-10 months long.  Unfortunately, with our current challenges, we can’t experience the force if the FTU is almost a year long. We’ve got to get people through pilot training in about a year, and through FTU in about six months to keep a healthy flow of well-trained pilots to their operational units, and ultimately back to fill the training and institutional requirements needed to keep our Air Force strong.” “We rolled out our major innovation efforts in 2018 at the same time we were trying to streamline our syllabus and jump-start the pipeline in the wake of the OBOGS crisis. As a result, many of our pilots see “innovation” as code for “syllabus cuts.” We’re trying to change that perception. Lt Gen Webb, the AETC commander, has been crystal clear that quality is our goal. Over the past couple of years, we’ve steadily added hours and simulator events back to our syllabi along with introducing immersive technology and virtual hours. The T-6 syllabus, in particular, has grown in both flying hours and virtual training.” The bigger picture It takes deep knowledge of the subject to be able to create effective, safe, practicable solutions, and a lot of breaking down walls to effect change. While some of the PTN approaches have been seen as radical, out of this has come some sensible adaptations, embracing new technology, new approaches, designed to ultimately transform USAF pilot training and make it a better fit for the current and future realities of combat aviation. While there are skeptics in the frontline squadrons, and they certainly have every right to be concerned considering the stakes, there is much more going on here than just the idea of increasingly trading time in real cockpits for the simulator. These changes are not only focused on solving the Air Force’s towering pilot shortage — an existential crisis for the service in itself — but also training new aviators smarter, more economically, and doing so leveraging modern advances in instructional aides, some of which would have looked like science fiction just a decade or so ago. All while not sacrificing the quality of the end product. Successfully and positively making changes to arguably the most deeply ingrained institution in the Air Force is without a doubt a massive challenge, one that has cultural impacts within the service as well as technical and readiness ones. But considering that the Air Force still flies almost entirely with humans in cockpits at the controls, failure is truly not an option.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 23, 2021",Lasers Destined For Fighter Jets Are Now Being Tested In The Air Force’s Wind Tunnels,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ahead of putting experimental directed energy weapons onto its fighter jets , the U.S. Air Force is testing how these systems will operate at high speed and high altitude, by trialing them in wind tunnels. Equipping fighters with directed energy, or DE, weapons, which use high-energy lasers or microwaves to engage threats, is a long-standing Air Force ambition , but one that has suffered from some well-documented delays . The latest wind tunnel work may help address some of the problems encountered so far. The Air Force has announced that recent DE systems tests have taken place in the four-foot transonic wind tunnel, or 4T, belonging to the Aerodynamics Branch of Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee. By experimenting with a DE system in a wind tunnel of this type, it’s possible to assess how the weapon behaves when it encounters shockwaves left by the aircraft carrying it, as well as other disturbances that might affect the weapon’s energy beam and prevent it from engaging the target properly. Dr. Rich Roberts, chief of the Aerodynamics Branch Store Separation Section of Arnold Engineering Development Complex, looks at a directed energy (DE) system turret in the four-foot transonic wind tunnel at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee, in March., U.S. Air Force/Jill Pickett Using the 4T, engineers should be able to explore what happens to a DE weapon in the airflow when the host aircraft is operating at speeds of up to Mach 2.0 , as well as at simulated altitudes ranging from sea level up to 98,000 feet. It’s unclear what parameters have been tested so far, but the Air Force has confirmed that the 4T has already been used to simulate a laser-toting fighter jet flying at supersonic speeds. “Integrating the DE systems on aircraft has obvious benefits but also creates challenges, especially at higher speeds,” admitted Dr. Rich Roberts, chief of the Aerodynamics Branch Store Separation Section at Arnold Air Force Base. Nevertheless, with the Air Force still hopeful of migrating DE systems onto high-performance fighters in the not-too-distant future, the service is hoping to iron out problems in the wind tunnel before integrating these systems onto actual aircraft. The effort so far has taken around eight years, according to the Air Force, and has focused on the Aero Isolation Measurement System, or AIMS, which allows this kind of DE testing in wind tunnels. Close-up of a DE system turret in the 4T wind tunnel at Arnold Air Force Base, with a simulated laser glow., U.S. Air Force/Jill Pickett “Simply put, this system transmits a laser to the model, uses a miniaturized optical bench of sorts inside the model, then uses fiber optics to pipe the data to a wavefront sensor system,” Roberts explained. “From there, we can analyze data that tells us how the laser was impacted by the tunnel flow field around the model.” In particular, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is keen to reduce the impact of high-speed flow over a turret armed with a DE weapon, in what is described as “flow mitigation.” Computational fluid dynamics simulations for a DE pod, showing pressure loading on the pod and airflow features under supersonic conditions., MZA Associates Corp. So far, the Air Force has developed an “aerodynamic fence” that protects the DE system from the turbulent airflow over the turret that contains it. The result was, according to Roberts, “a significant improvement in beam quality.” Beyond the AIMS equipment, the AEDC is working on the Integrated Directed Energy Aero-Optical Surrogate, or IDEAS, which will provide a 1:4-scale model of an F-15 fighter that will be used to test laser pods in a wind tunnel. Acceptance testing for IDEAS hardware is due to begin later this year. Two images from high-speed wavefront tests of the DE pod, showing a shock over the pod aperture (left) and computational fluid dynamics-predicted optical distortion formed over the aperture for similar flow conditions (right)., MZA Associates Corp. While this all furthers the ambition of Air Force fighters mounting DE pods capable of defending them against incoming missiles, it should be recalled that, not so long ago, it was anticipated that a full-scale F-15 would be flying with a demonstrator weapon of this type in 2021. That pod was the Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator program, or SHiELD , which has now been delayed by two years, with flight testing aboard an F-15 now planned for 2023. Part of the reason for this delay was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there were also technical challenges that proved hard to overcome in the original timescale, not least of which includes fitting the laser and the beam control equipment into a single, fairly small pod. On top of that, while deploying an effective laser may be a challenge to overcome in still air, using adaptive optics , at high speed in a fighter, it is even more difficult. The pods themselves also have to be robust, able to withstand constant buffeting and heavy G loads, without damage to any sensitive internal equipment. Members of the SHiELD program and a Boeing contractor team inspect a SHiELD pod, earlier this year., Boeing A year ago, the influential Will Roper, then the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, stated that he envisaged lasers might be best used to counter small unmanned aerial vehicles. He pointed to the high costs of using missiles against potentially low-cost drones and suggested that high-end fighter jets might not be the most obvious candidate to field DE weapons, at least at first. Meanwhile, there has been some progress made by using a ground-based solid-state laser known as the Demonstrator Laser Weapon System (DLWS) as a surrogate for SHiELD. In this way, DLWS has proved its ability to shoot down a number of air-launched missiles over the White Sands Missile Range in News Mexico. Although ground-based laser systems are generally more mature than their airborne counterparts, it’s worth noting that the DLWS is described as being in the “ tens of kilowatts class ,” while Lockheed Martin has already delivered a 60-kilowatt-class laser weapon system to the U.S. Army. The Demonstrator Laser Weapon System (DLWS), acting as a ground-based test surrogate for the SHiELD system., U.S. Air Force Separate, earlier efforts to develop airborne podded laser weapons seem to have made greater strides, however, with the Army having flight-tested a podded solid-state laser on an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter in 2017. Back in 2014, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), together with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Lockheed Martin, also tested a turreted laser on a modified Dassault Falcon 10 business jet as part of the Aero-Adaptive, Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) program. Outside of smaller podded systems intended to provide defense against incoming missiles, like SHiELD, there have also been difficulties in maturing the laser technology required for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to shoot down ballistic missiles during the initial boost phase of flight, too. Last year, Michael D. Griffin, the then Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, questioned whether putting a directed energy weapon of this type onto a drone would actually result in a platform able to shoot down or disable enemy ballistic missiles as originally intended. An artist’s rendering of an Air Force F-16 armed with a SHiELD pod., LOCKHEED MARTIN With both the SHiELD pod and the MDA’s efforts to develop an airborne missile defense laser apparently faltering, the last few months have not been particularly positive for these types of DE weapons. Dr. Rich Roberts is optimistic that work at Arnold Air Force Base could benefit plenty more programs, too. “As more DE systems are developed and integrated onto aircraft, we’ll be able to help with design decisions, creating employment envelopes, defining adjacent weapons load-outs and other things routinely needed by program offices and manufacturers,” Roberts said. Hopefully, this wind tunnel testing helps the SHiELD pod move towards the live flight test phase. But the new ability to perform initial tests of these kinds of weapons in wind tunnels could provide a significant boost to a whole range of airborne directed energy programs.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 20, 2021",Bell Unveils VTOL Aircraft Concepts That All Feature Fold-Away Rotors For Jet-Speed Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Bell has revealed part of its vision for a future High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing, or HSVTOL, aircraft, a type of platform that U.S. Special Operations Command has recently been taking a particular interest in . The company’s initial HSVTOL concepts aim to combine the “hover capability of a helicopter with the speed, range and survivability features of a fighter aircraft,” according to the company. These designs could potentially lead to a replacement for the Air Force’s CV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, as well as other types. Three different, but similar, HSVTOL concepts were unveiled by Bell today, one of which is apparently unmanned. All of them utilize a propulsion concept in which wingtip rotors are used for vertical lift, then these rotors fold away to reduce drag while turbofans provide thrust for the high-speed, forward flight. The same concept is something that we have seen before in earlier Bell patents for a new-generation “convertiplane.” An earlier Bell HSVTOL design study., USTPO (TRADEMARK AND PATENT OFFICE) Future “convertible engines” could eventually provide HSVTOL designs with a powerplant that can switch between turboshaft and turbofan modes, eliminating the need for separate lift and cruise engines. With no air intakes visible on the wingtip nacelles, this could also suggest some form of hybrid-electric propulsion for the rotors, as well, which would use the main jet powerplant to provide gobs of electrical power to drive the rotors during terminal flight modes. The first two aircraft in Bell’s concept artwork appear to be manned, with cockpit transparencies and access doors into the main cabin, while the last seems to be unmanned. While they all seem to share the same propulsion concept, the three Bell designs otherwise differ in more minor details, including engine intake arrangement and tailfins. In addition,, the airframes all look to incorporate basic low-observable features, suggesting that they are designed to offer some degree of stealth, at least when their rotors are folded away. “Bell’s HSVTOL technology is a step-change improvement in rotorcraft capabilities,” said Jason Hurst, vice president of Bell’s Innovation division. “Our technology investments have reduced risk and prepared us for rapid development of HSVTOL in a digital engineering environment, leveraging experience from a robust past of technology exploration and close partnerships with the Department of Defense and research laboratories.” Exactly how the aircraft are expected to work, from a propulsion point of view, has not been revealed, but Bell does mention “emerging propulsion technologies,” which could well be a reference to convertible engines. In addition, the company has detailed aspects of the broader capabilities of its HSVTOL design concepts. These will include the ability to hover while producing limited downwash ( unlike the CV-22B , for example), jet-like cruise speeds of over 400 knots, runway independence and hover endurance, and scalability to suit a range of missions from unmanned personnel recovery to tactical mobility. Finally, Bell says that its HSVTOL aircraft are planned to have gross weights ranging from 4,000 pounds to over 100,000 pounds, suggesting that there are other, similar, designs in the works, in addition to these three. By way of contrast, the CV-22B tilt-rotor has a gross weight of 60,500 pounds. The first design on the left appears larger than the Osprey, while the second looks similar in size. The third unmanned concept looks smaller still, which makes sense. So this is clearly a highly scalable concept. It is interesting to note that Bell’s concept art shows the larger of the two manned designs wearing a tail flash of the kind that airlifters, as well as aerial refueling tankers, assigned to Air Mobility Command typically wear. The smaller of the manned concepts has shark mouth nose art and features a sensor turret under the fuselage, and looks overall to be more of an assault transport in the vein of the CV-22B. The unmanned type looks like it could have the ability to carry weapons and could be envisioned as operating in an escort role, accompanying the larger HSVTOLs to a target area, among other mission sets. A close-up of the larger of Bell’s manned HSVTOL concepts, this one with a dorsal intake. Note also the US Air Force markings on the airframe, including a tail flash of the kind typically used on the service’s cargo aircraft, as well as aerial refueling tankers., Bell Another close-up, this time of the smaller of the manned concepts, with its shark mouth nose art and sensor turret under the fuselage., Bell The unmanned HSVTOL concept is seen in this close-up., Bell In its press release, Bell also mentioned its particular pedigree in the high-speed vertical lift aircraft technology, pointing to a wide range of previous VTOL configurations such as the X-14, X-22, XV-3, and XV-15, which the company developed variously for NASA, the U.S Army and the Air Force. Today, of course, Bell, together with Boeing, is responsible for the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor. Emerging from a 1951 joint U.S. Air Force-U.S. Army initiative, the Bell XV-3 was the world’s first successful V/STOL tilt-rotor aircraft., NASA In April this year, Bell received a $950,000 contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to research its HSVTOL concept. A month later , Air Force Colonel Ken Kuebler, Special Operations Command’s Program Executive Officer for Fixed Wing, confirmed that the Bell design was among those the command was looking at to meet the emerging HSVTOL requirement. In addition to Bell, which is perhaps the established high-speed VTOL player, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, and the AFWERX technology incubator are also looking at smaller companies who might be able to contribute “groundbreaking ideas” to HSVTOL. The AFWERX “ challenge ,” submissions for which closed last month, has been for other concepts that could offer “optimal agility in austere environments .” While AFWERX wants to explore various different concepts so it can better understand what sort of speed, range, survivability, payload, and size might be required for potential future HSVTOL requirements, it seems Bell is already working on options that offer widely varying sizes, at least. Above all, HSVTOL is likely to embody far more ambitious performance requirements than the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program, but will have a timeline to match. In the meantime, AFWERX has already identified what it calls “critical mission profiles” for the HSVTOL — infiltration and exfiltration of special forces and equipment, personnel recovery, aeromedical evacuation, and tactical mobility — but applications could well extend beyond these and incorporate a range of missions currently flown by different fixed-wing and rotary-wing platforms. Meanwhile, in the background to this is Air Force Special Operations Command’s efforts to start planning a replacement for the CV-22B, one that will be able to fly at speeds in excess of the 280 knots that the Osprey can reach. Indeed, AFSOC’s commander, Lieutenant General James Slife, has spoken of a desire for “jet speed,” which would seem to be a closer fit to Bell’s HSVTOL concepts. A CV-22B Osprey receives fuel off the coast of Greenland from an MC-130H Combat Talon II., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Laura Yahemiak There are other designs, too, dating back as far as the early 1980s, that reveal just how long the Department of Defense has been looking at exotic vertical-lift platforms, including stealthy ones and high-speed ones. The War Zone has looked in detail at some of these in the two-part feature series linked here . While a short takeoff and landing (STOL), rather than a VTOL concept, the Air Force’s Speed Agile Concept Demonstrator, or SACD, similarly aimed to achieve high speed. It featured a four-engine configuration and was also intended to move larger and heavier payloads. A wind-tunnel test model of the Speed Agile concept., U.S. AIR FORCE Some of these earlier concepts have been unmanned, too, like the initial Bell HSVTOL concepts. Lockheed Martin’s VTOL Advanced Reconnaissance Insertion Organic Unmanned System (VARIOUS) is one example of this line of thinking. Then there is DARPA’s VTOL X-Plane , another program seeking to exploit the advantages of fixed-wing and rotary-wing concepts, albeit with a planned top sustained flight speed of 300-400 knots. That same program yielded the XV-24A LightningStrike , another unmanned VTOL concept developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) by Aurora Flight Sciences, now part of Boeing, together with Rolls-Royce and Honeywell, but later canceled. While a high-speed VTOL design would offer more rapid deployment and enhanced survivability, the freedom from conventional runways and infrastructure also aligns with the Pentagon’s increasing focus on so-called distributed operations , especially the kinds of campaigns that might be expected in a peer conflict in the Asia-Pacific region. It may not be entirely coincidental, therefore, that China, too, is looking at similar kinds of concepts, including an exotic-looking model of an apparent hybrid gas turbine-electric manned combat rotorcraft appearing earlier this year. As in the Bell concept, at least some of the prop-rotors on the Chinese design incorporate a folding mechanism to reduce drag while in forward flight. Undoubtedly, actually realizing the promise of true high-speed VTOL flight will involve considerable technological challenges ahead. However, it’s becoming increasingly clear that this is a goal that a growing number of branches of the military, in the United States and elsewhere, are now intent on achieving.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on May 21, 2021",First Live-Fire Test Of The Navy’s New Long-Range Anti-Radiation Missile Was A Success,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy recently announced its first live-fire test of the new AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range, or AARGM-ER . A Naval Air Systems Command press release states that the missile was launched from an F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and met all of the objectives set for this test. The new AARGM-ER is intended to give the service’s carrier air wings the ability to more safely operate in areas containing integrated defense networks , but its capabilities could make it a formidable all-around air-to-surface weapon featuring advanced guidance technologies. The test took place on July 19, 2021 off the coast of the Point Mugu Sea Test Range , according to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). Captain Alex Dutko, program manager for NAVAIR’s Direct and Time Sensitive Strike Weapon ( PMA-242 ), said the test represents “a major step to providing our fleet with the most advanced weapon system to defeat evolving surface-to-air threats.” The test reportedly validated overall systems integration and the missile’s propulsion system, and confirmed some of the simulations run on the missile prior to the live-fire test. A mock-up of the AARGM-ER, Joseph Trevithick NAVAIR stated that this is only the first in a planned series of tests to confirm other objectives. A PMA-242 program co-lead stated that the missile, which is designed to provide an “advanced capability to detect and engage enemy air defense systems,” is now expected to meet Low Rate Initial Production this summer. Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the AGM-88G, issued its own press release saying that the live-fire test took place three months earlier than expected and demonstrated the “long-range capability of the new missile design.” The AARGM-ER is a derivative of the AGM-88E AARGM, which already offered “expanded target set, counter-shutdown capability, advanced signals processing for improved detection and locating, geographic specificity providing aircrew the opportunity to define missile-impact zones and impact-avoidance zones, and a weapon impact-assessment broadcast capability providing for battle damage assessment cueing” compared to earlier variants of the AGM-88, according to the Navy . “While this event serves as a validation of this hard work, it more importantly gets us one-step closer to making our fleet more lethal,” said Felipe Jauregui, Anti-Radiation Missile Technical Project Office at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division in China Lake, California. “Our engineering and test teams have worked tirelessly with their counterparts across the enterprise and government teams.” The AARGM-ER and earlier AGM-88 variants are in a class of weapons known as anti-radiation missiles, which are designed to seek out and home in on radiofrequency emissions. Most of these missiles are intended for air-to-surface use against ground-based radar systems, although there have been air-to-air variants and air-to-surface anti-radiation missiles, as well. These missiles are typically used in the early stages of conflicts to suppress and destroy enemy air defenses ahead of incoming strike aircraft and missiles. To accomplish this, AARGM-ER contains a multi-mode guidance package containing a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system, as well as a millimeter-wave radar that can locate targets even if they stop emitting radiofrequency or other signals or even begin to move. The missile’s guidance and datalink package also have the capability to network with off-board sources , meaning a launching aircraft can fire the weapon without even having acquired a target’s emissions, instead relying on other platforms’ data to target and prosecute an attack. The anti-radiation missile can also reportedly relay data in its final moments to confirm whether or not it successfully struck its intended target. USN The Navy has been tight-lipped about the AARGM-ER’s exact specifications, but according to information released by its designer , the AARGM has a range of nearly 80 miles and can reach a top speed of Mach 2 during its terminal phase. The Extended Range version is reported to be faster and, as its name implies, has a longer range than its Hight-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) predecessor. It also features a much sleeker overall design that incorporates a new rocket motor and moves all of the control surfaces to the tail. USN The entire package of capabilities, especially its onboard radar seeker, as well as its new warhead, could give the AARGM-ER an improved general air-to-ground capability, in addition to its ability to perform specifically in the anti-radiation role. This, in turn, could give the Navy and other operators a highly capable and precise air-launched weapon for engaging targets on the ground at standoff ranges. U.S. Navy Airman, assigned to Electronic Attack Squadron 140 at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, load an AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile on a EA-18G Growler, USAF/A1C  Dwane R. Young The AARGM-ER is currently being integrated on the Navy’s F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft, and eventually deployed aboard each of the F-35 variants in the future. Flight tests with a captive carry prototype missile began in June 2020 , while a “separation test vehicle” was tested in May 2021 . The U.S. Air Force, meanwhile, is developing a derivative of the missile as part of its Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) program, which you can read more about here . This weapon will feature a different warhead and fuze than Navy versions and “provide strike capability to defeat rapidly relocatable targets that create the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environment,” according to USAF budget documents. A model depicting a containerized launch system for the AARGM-ER, Joseph Trevithick A ground-launched derivative of the AARGM-ER, now dubbed the Advanced Reactive Strike Missile (AReS), which will be able to strike targets on land and at sea, is also in development . This missile could make use of launcher that fits inside a standard shipping container that Northrop Grumman had unveiled in 2018 as part of a proposal for a land-based version of the AARGM-ER, which The War Zone was first to report on . With the successful completion of this live-fire test, the AARGM-EM missile continues to move closer to deployment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 2, 2022",Electronic Warfare System On Air Force F-16 Gets Capability Update In Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it recently demonstrated the ability to send software updates for the electronic warfare system onboard an F-16C Viper fighter jet while that aircraft was in flight. The service also says that this test was an important first step toward developing a more expansive capability, which could feed into a broader concept known as Cognitive Electronic Warfare, or Cognitive EW, which you can read more about in detail here . Cognitive EW is centered on using advances in artificial intelligence , or AI, as well as machine learning , to much more rapidly develop and deploy improved electronic warfare capabilities, including new countermeasures, in response to emerging threats, possibly in real-time. The Air Force announced the test on July 31, but did not say specifically when it had occurred. It did say that it was conducted recently from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada as part of a larger demonstration of advanced capabilities being developed under the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) program. ABMS is a major service-wide initiative focused primarily on developing improved networking, remote targeting, and other associated capabilities, including advanced communications packages , as well as and low-cost unmanned platforms to carry them, and distributed networks of sensors to support various mission sets , among other things. A US Air Force F-16C Viper fighter jet., USAF This recent electronic warfare test involved personnel at the Software Integration Laboratory at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, which is situated some 375 miles northeast of Nellis, sending an updated Mission Data File for the Countermeasures Signal Processor in the AN/ALQ-213 Electronic Warfare Management System (EWMS) on the F-16C from the 84th Test and Evaluation Squadron. The Viper, which was airborne at the time, received the new software via an unspecified, existing beyond-line-of-sight satellite communications system on the aircraft. The software for the jet’s Center Display Unit was modified for the test, but the Air Force says that no hardware changes were necessary. “The ingenuity and skills of the Flight Test and Program Teams enabled a Viper to land with better capabilities than it took off with,” Air Force Colonel Tim Bailey, the service’s F-16 System Program Manager, said in a statement about the test. “This techno-marvel was done with existing systems in much of the Viper fleet, with no hardware mod. required. This is a significant first step!” The AN/ALQ-213 is a central control system for the entire electronic warfare and countermeasures suite onboard an F-16. Depending on the exact configuration of the jet, this can include missile approach warning systems, radar warning receivers , towed expendable decoys , decoy flare and chaff launchers integral to the aircraft, as well as podded electronic warfare jammers . The EWMS can be set to an automatic mode, wherein specific available countermeasure capabilities are immediately employed after sensors linked to the control unit detect certain kinds of threats, such as incoming radar-guided missiles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=J43SYKK0l28 However, the system can only do that if the threat in question is one that it knows how to categorize based on the information in its internal database. Beyond the issue of dealing with previously unknown signal types, that library of information could also have a hard time identifying known signals that are being sent out a novel way or are simply muddled together with other emissions. That’s why this new remote updating capability, which the Air Force says began as “a bar-napkin idea,” is so important. “This proof-of-concept test demonstrated the ability for a pilot to properly correlate a previously unknown electronic threat in near real-time,” according to the Air Force. “We believe this is the first time a fighter aircraft has received a software update and gained new capability all while in flight,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Zachary Probst, the commander of the 84th Test and Evaluation Squadron, said in a statement about the test. “This is a big deal. There’s a tactical need to be able to rapidly update software, especially mission data files because that’s what ties into our ability to identify, find, and defend ourselves against enemy threat systems.” It’s hard to overstate how significant this new capability could be. Potential adversaries, including possible near-peer opponents, such as China and Russia, are constantly developing new air defense systems and associated sensors , as well as electronic warfare and cyber warfare capabilities . Some of those systems are then made available for export , though often with somewhat reduced functionality . Altogether, it is not hard to imagine a scenario in which U.S. combat aircraft would fly into combat and be faced with previously unseen or otherwise little understood air defense and electronic warfare threats that existing countermeasures systems are not immediately capable of responding to. That’s where Cognitive EW comes in. One envisioned near-term capability that is part of this broader concept is the ability for a wide variety of platforms, including aircraft, as well as various assets down below, to feed data about new threats into a larger electronic warfare ecosystem. Analysts and engineers can pick them apart and develop new or improved countermeasures, with advanced in artificial intelligence and machine learning helping to accelerate the process. A US Marine Corps graphic that offers a good, but a very general overview of the US military’s over-arching electronic warfare ecosystem., USMC Since electronic warfare relies heavily on detecting and interpreting an enemy’s electromagnetic emissions and then sending out other signals to disrupt or otherwise confuse them, much of this work can be done entirely through software. This, in turn, opens up the possibility to send out upgrades for countermeasures systems digitally, including to deployed platforms, such as aircraft in flight. The hope is that this process could eventually move so rapidly that, for example, combat jets on a mission could detect a new kind of threat, feed that information into the larger Cognitive EW network, and then get relevant updates for a system like the AN/ALQ-213 or the other components tied into it, all before returning to base. This could give American warplanes, as well as other assets, an immense advantage over opponents, who might see the effectiveness of their most advanced air and missile defenses and electronic warfare suites and tactics diminish very quickly. The absolute “holy grail” of this concept is developing capabilities that would allow AI-driven electronic warfare systems to do much, if not all of this work themselves. This could eliminate the need for off-board support, such as remote updates, and enable electronic warfare packages to quickly start adapting, in real-time, to whatever new threats might pop up. Real-time software updates for aircraft in flight, as well as the networks that would be necessary to support them, open up a path toward integrating other novel capabilities, as well. “The next step is to integrate high-speed internet into the F-16 thereby allowing F-16 pilots access to data from a classified cloud,” according to the Air Force. The Air Force has already demonstrated similar in-flight updating capabilities on a U-2S spy plane, as well as the ability of one of those aircraft to remotely leverage off-board computer processing capacity to more efficiently exploit intelligence data. The Air Force has also previously announced its interest in integrating Cognitive EW capabilities into the Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS . The service is in the process of upgrading its existing F-15E Strike Eagles with EPAWSS, which is also a feature on its new F-15EX Eagle II aircraft . Some members of Congress are also pushing for the Air Force to explore a new, more robust tactical electronic warfare capability utilizing components of the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) system that the U.S. Navy is currently developing. The F-15EX would be one option for an Air Force platform to carry podded NGJ variants and an “EF-15” configured in this way could be even more capable with the addition of Cognitive EW capabilities. The Navy, as well as other branches of the U.S. military and certain American allies and partners, could very well be interested in the Air Force’s work in this vein, as well. Australia, for instance, is already directly involved in the NGJ program. It is, of course, important to remember that the infrastructure to support a true Cognitive EW capability, at least initially, will rely heavily on the Air Force being able to also demonstrate new and improved networking capabilities that are not only robust enough to handle updating a potentially large number of aircraft in flight remotely, but that are also secure and reliable enough to do so when it matters most. Traditional beyond-line-of-sight satellite communications, among other space-based capabilities , are already increasingly vulnerable to a variety of Russian and Chinese anti-satellite capabilities . In the meantime, this recent test involving an F-16C shows that the Air Force is already laying the groundwork necessary to make potentially game-changing Cognitive EW capabilities a reality.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 30, 2021",U.S. Threatens “Appropriate Response” After Blaming Iran For Drone Attack On Tanker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Officials from the United States have called for a proportional, coordinated response to the attack on the Israeli-operated product tanker M/T Mercer Street in the Gulf of Oman last Thursday, which killed two crewmen , and which has now been formally blamed on Iran by several nations. The countries of the two victims — Romania and the United Kingdom — have issued statements putting the responsibility on Tehran and have also spoken of responding accordingly. Israel, too, has formally accused Iran of being behind the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett claiming there was “evidence” of this, without providing any more details. Iran, for its part, has denied any connections to the incident. In a statement yesterday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken condemned the attack on the Mercer Street , adding that the U.S. Department of State was “confident that Iran conducted this attack […] using one-way explosive UAVs.” The latter seems to be a new term for what have been commonly referred to as “ suicide drones .” These are unmanned aircraft that carry an integral warhead and are intended to strike targets via slamming into them and detonating, a class of weapon that increasingly blurs the distinction between traditional missiles and armed drones. M/T Mercer Street photographed in 2016., JOHAN VICTOR VIA AP “We are working with our partners to consider our next steps and consulting with governments inside the region and beyond on an appropriate response, which will be forthcoming,” the statement from the Secretary of State added. Blinken has now also spoken with the Israeli Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid to discuss the attack. While there has been a spate of attacks on mainly commercial shipping in the region in recent years, part of an apparent tit-for-tat campaign waged by Iran and Israel, the Mercer Street incident is the first known attack of this kind to involve fatalities. Photos, seen in the Tweets below, have also now emerged purportedly showing damage to the tanker, suggesting that whatever the weapon or weapons employed were targeted the bridge of the vessel. That is in keeping with some of the earliest reports of the incident, which described “several unmanned Iranian drones that crashed into living quarters underneath the ship’s command center.” Today, the U.K.’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office announced that it had summoned the Iranian Ambassador to the U.K., Mohsen Baharvand, to discuss the situation, while the U.K. Minister for the Middle East, James Cleverly, called for Iran to “immediately cease actions that risk international peace and security, and reinforced that vessels must be allowed to navigate freely in accordance with international law.” Experts and observers have pointed that the fact that Cleverly, a minister, rather than a permanent secretary, was involved in the meeting likely reflects the perceived seriousness of the situation. In a previous statement, the U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced his government’s judgment that the attack was a “deliberate, targeted [and] clear violation of international law by Iran,” and that it was “highly likely” that one or more drones had been used to hit the tanker. “The U.K. is working with our international partners on a concerted response to this unacceptable attack,” Raab added. The British citizen killed in the attack was an employee of the British maritime security firm Ambrey, who also issued a statement of their own. The U.K. government also held a Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR), or “ Cobra ” meeting over the weekend, during which officials would likely have discussed possible responses. These meetings are reserved for government responses to significant overseas events as well as national or regional crises. In the meantime, there are reports that a British special forces team has been sent to “help with the tanker investigation.” The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meanwhile, issued a statement that confirmed that the Romanian national killed in the incident was the ship’s captain. “Regarding the fact that the attack was deliberate and, respectively, coordinated by Iran, Romania requests the explanation […] by the Iranian authorities, without delay, and reserves the right to act accordingly, together with its international partners, for an appropriate response.” While flying the Liberian flag and owned by a Japanese company, the Mercer Street is operated by Zodiac Maritime, a London-based company that belongs to the Israeli Eyal Ofer, a billionaire real estate and shipping magnate, and a philanthropist. It’s unclear what kind of response Romania, the United Kingdom, and the United States might have in mind, but there are increasing indications that it might be some kind of coordinated effort. A spokesperson for Secretary Blinken confirmed that his office has “agreed to work with the United Kingdom, Romania, and other international partners to investigate the facts, provide support, and consider the appropriate next steps.” The U.K. Chief of the General Staff, Sir Nick Carter, is also known to have recently been in contact with his Israeli counterpart, Lieutenant General Aviv Kohavi, to discuss “recent events in the region and common challenges.” As we have discussed in the past, Iran and Israel are already engaged in a shadowy campaign that targets each other’s maritime interests, against a backdrop to long-running hostilities that have also included alleged assassinations and mysterious attacks on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure . It’s unclear what hard evidence connects Tehran to the attack on the Mercer Street , although the use of suicide drones is certainly within the country’s capabilities and there seems to be an established pattern targeting Israeli-linked maritime traffic . An Iranian-supplied suicide drone that was captured from Houthi forces, which have used these weapons against Saudi Arabia., Conflict Armament Research There is, however, the potential complicating factor that the attack last week was conducted by Tehran via one or more Iranian proxies, of which it has many in the region, a number of which have carried out different kinds of attacks on military and commercial targets on land and at sea, including with suicide drones . This would, at least, provide Iran with a potential argument based on plausible deniability. Regardless, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the United States have all been quick to identify Tehran as the purported culprit and that could be followed up with more diplomatic actions. While a direct military retaliation against Iran or Iranian interests may be a remote prospect, the incident could drive the United Kingdom, in particular, toward a more defensive posture as regards maritime traffic in the Gulf of Oman. In 2019, the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero was seized by Iran for two months after allegedly breaking maritime rules. A lethal drone strike, however, presents a significant escalation and may call for improved protection, perhaps in the form of an expanded Royal Navy presence in the area. While there is already a U.S.-led International Maritime Security Construct ( IMSC ) in place specifically focused on protecting international shipping from attacks like that inflicted on the Mercer Street , it is almost impossible to provide an overarching defense against these types of drone strikes, which could be launched from the land, or from the water . Ultimately, even operating in convoys and providing a frigate for anti-drone area defense would not provide a guarantee of safety. A U.S. Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallion flies above the amphibious transport dock ship USS San Diego (LPD-22) during a routine transit patrol in support of the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) in the Arabian Gulf. , U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Desiree King With that in mind, the United Kingdom, at least, may seek to bolster its commitment to the IMSC, of which it’s already a member, although actually finding available Royal Navy vessels for that won’t necessarily be straightforward , especially with important commitments in the North Atlantic , the Mediterranean , and, increasingly, further afield . Should the drone threat be considered serious enough, there is also the possibility of deploying anti-drone detection and jamming systems on warships in the region, a tactic that has already been successful in knocking down Iranian drones in the past . But even these systems have very limited range and their effectiveness is far from guaranteed, especially against a multi-drone attack. Finally, with Romania and the United Kingdom both being NATO members, there exists the possibility of appealing to the bloc for support. Article 4 of the NATO Treaty, for example , allows any ally to call for consultations if the security of any of them is threatened. Turkey, for instance, had the alliance deploy Patriot air defense systems to protect it from Syrian missile threats, as the result of an Article 4 consultation. It could also be the case that the hawkish words from the American side are part of an effort to force Iran’s hand in the negotiations around the nuclear deal , which appear to have stalled for the time being. With that in mind, it’s possible too, that Iran’s apparent decision to escalate its actions against commercial shipping could also be tied to the nuclear deal. Whatever the kind of response the various parties have in mind, it seems clear that the shadowy maritime campaign involving Iran and Israel has now expanded to involve other countries, too, regardless of whether they were the original targets. Perhaps the incident will serve as a wake-up to the international community; after all, Iran has been prosecuting similar attacks in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea and it was, perhaps, only a matter of time before one of these proved to be fatal.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) and USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) are both currently docked at Naval Air Station North Island, which sits right across the bay from downtown San Diego. While it is not rare to see two, or even three, supercarriers in port at North Island, what is rare is seeing two of these massive warships sitting side-by-side with their entire air wings embarked. The terrestrial photos come to us courtesy of our friends @Warshipcam and @CJR1321 . Most of the time, during training, aircraft will fly out to the carriers in smaller groups and then fly back to land once the training is completed, but when the carriers spin up prior to deployment, the entire air wing will be embarked aboard the vessel for an extended period of time. This is necessary to complete advanced integrated training not only with the air wing, which has member squadrons scattered across the country, but also for the entire carrier strike group , including the carrier’s numerous escorts. It is getting all the pieces to work as a single team that gives the American carrier strike group capabilities that are far more than the sum of their individual parts. This advanced integrated training includes more extreme threat scenarios that aim to tax the strike group’s abilities and prepare them for what may come as they sail into unfriendly waters on deployment. @cjr1321 USS Carl Vinson. , @cjr1321 USS Abraham Lincoln. , @cjr1321 As it stands, the USS Carl Vinson is set to deploy at any time. It has been executing advanced drills for some time now, including being dispatched to Hawaii for training, but also to deter Russia’s own naval task force that came within a very short distance of the island state’s shores. CVN-70’s deployment will mark a number of firsts, including the first deployment of a Navy F-35C squadron and of the CMV-22 Osprey carrier onboard delivery (COD) aircraft. The USS Abraham Lincoln also totes an F-35C squadron, but in its case, it is a Marine unit (VMFA-314, the Black Knights). The carrier returned home from a grueling deployment in the winter of 2020 before going through an extensive maintenance period at North Island. It appears to be preparing for another deployment which could occur very soon, or at least it will be available to do so. July 31st, 2021 image of loaded-up CVN-70 and CVN-72 at North Island. , PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION There have been some highly interesting movements of American airpower in the Pacific as of late, as well as some puzzling strategic signaling with America’s undersea arsenal . This may be part of that, but it would come as a byproduct of the reality that two Pacific-based carriers could deploy immanently, at least if need be. It’s also worth noting that there is no American carrier strike group operating in the entire Indo-Pacific theater at this time, either, although that could and probably will change very soon. The HMS Queen Elizabeth is in the region and the majority of the F-35Bs aboard are from the USMC and she has a U.S. escort, as well. One could speculate that the Carl Vinson or Lincoln will operate side by side in the Pacific with the British flagship as part of her inaugural deployment. So there you have it, two supercarriers loaded up with their own air forces parked next to each other in San Diego an impressive and rare display of America’s naval might. Update: Some have mentioned that maybe the two fully loaded carriers in port at North Island are a prelude to Large Scale Exercise 2021. The exercise, which was already delayed due to the pandemic, is highly ambitious and is said to tie together multiple carrier strike groups and amphibious ready groups, as well as other assets. Back in late 2020, it was stated that the exercise would start in early August 2021, although we have no idea what assets are slated to participate, their location, or if that date for the exercise remains accurate. Regardless, it is a real possibility and this exercise would be a good reason why the Carl Vinson , in particular, has not deployed yet. Here is a passage from a USNI News article dated December 3rd, 2020, about the potentially revolutionary exercise: The chief of naval operations and commandant of the Marine Corps said today that Large Scale Exercise 2021 would be the first major live test of the Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO), Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment (LOCE) and Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) concepts that are driving the bulk of their ongoing budget and acquisition decisions. “We want to take a deeper look at DMO, LOCE, EABO and how they tie together. And so that’s important for us conceptually to ensure those concepts in a way we can visualize whether or not we need to course-correct, whether or not we’re headed precisely in the right direction,” CNO Adm. Mike Gilday said today while speaking at the U.S. Naval Institute’s annual Defense Forum Washington event. Gilday said he couldn’t publicly talk about which units would participate or exactly how many ships and personnel would be involved. But he said that the event, which will take place in the summer, will involve multiple carrier strike groups and multiple amphibious ready groups – putting this exercise at a scale not seen in recent history. … “We wargame and we study logistics all the time, but we never have developed really a plan for sustaining the fleet in a fight. And so that’s an important project for us in 2021, to actually develop a plan for how we sustain a fleet – not just logistics, but battle damage. We just, we haven’t been forced, we haven’t forced ourselves to take a deeper look in terms of a plan, and we need one,” the CNO said. The last quote is alarming, although we do know this is becoming a priority—to understand and mitigate shortfalls in addressing battle damage and sustainment of the Navy’s fleet during a major conflict. So, while we can’t say for certain, the Navy may be on the precipice of one of its most important wargames in a long time. Update: A release from the Navy’s European-based 6th Fleet confirms that the exercise will start on August 3rd, 2021. Based on some additional research, it seems the exercise will truly be global in scale. A Military.com article from May states: Tens of thousands of sailors and Marines will participate in the biggest U.S. naval exercise in a generation to test how the services will fight across vast distances as they prepare for possible conflict with China or Russia. Aircraft carriers, submarines, planes, unmanned vessels, and about 25,000 personnel will participate in Large Scale Exercise 2021, which will begin in late summer. The massive exercise will span 17 time zones with sailors and Marines in the U.S., Africa, Europe and the Pacific joining. Live forces will participate in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. “LSE is more than just training, it is leveraging the integrated fighting power of multiple naval forces to share sensors, weapons, and platforms across all domains in contested environments, globally,” said Adm. Christopher Grady, commander of U.S. Fleet Forces, told Military.com in an email. We still don’t know if both of these carriers will be involved or in what capacity, but the timing does seem to fit.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 26, 2021",Highly Modified Air Force Test Pilot School F-16 Is Now An X-Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has redesignated its NF-16D Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft, or VISTA, as the X-62A. This new X-plane nomenclature, something typically applied to purely experimental aircraft and other aerospace vehicles , is meant to better reflect this aircraft’s current role as a multi-purpose test platform as the service prepares to make new modifications to it so that it can support the Skyborg program. Skyborg is focused on developing a suite of artificial intelligence-driven technologies and associated systems that will together form a “ computer brain ” able to fly “loyal wingman” type drones and potentially migrate to other designs, including fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles , or UCAVs. The public affairs office for the 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base in California announced the designation change on Friday, July 30th. The Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards, in cooperation with Calspan , operates the VISTA jet. This highly modified, one-of-a-kind F-16D Viper fighter is also now part of a newly created Research Division within the Test Pilot School. USAF “The VISTA is currently in the midst of an upgrade program which will fully replace the VISTA Simulation System (VSS),” according to the Air Force. “The upgrade program will also add a new system called the System for Autonomous Control of Simulation (SACS) to support autonomy testing for the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Skyborg program.” “The redesignation reflects the research done on the aircraft over the past almost 30 years, as well as acknowledges the major upgrade program that is ongoing to support future USAF autonomy testing,” Dr. Chris Cotting, the Test Pilot School’s Director of Research, said in a statement. Calspan, in cooperation with the original manufacturer of the F-16, General Dynamics, began devising the VISTA conversion in the late 1980s, Initially, the focus was on modifications to support work on multi-axis thrust vectoring technology for the Israeli Air Force. The U.S. Air Force also subsequently joined the project, with the Israelis then dropping out in 1992. The converted F-16D flew that year in its new configuration for the first time. Since then, VISTA has supported a wide variety of research and development projects. Its existing VSS means that it “can be configured to fly like almost any aircraft type,” according to the Air Force , enabling it to act as a surrogate for a wide variety of platforms. VISTA’s “systems provide an outlet to safely simulate environments not available with any other airframe or system,” according to Calspan . “We have found ways to use VISTA that were not envisioned by the original designers, so we were running into frustrating limitations,” William Gray, the chief VISTA test pilot at the Test Pilot School, said in a statement. “The modifications will address these limitations and profoundly improve our ability to quickly and safely test an almost unlimited variety of radical control law configurations.” The F-16 VISTA’s cockpit with its center-stick and side-stick., Tyler Rogoway From the Air Force’s announcement about the X-62A, it’s not immediately clear how the aircraft will be employed in support of the Skyborg program. It is worth noting that VISTA has been employed as a surrogate for a loyal wingman type unmanned aircraft, a term for drones designed to worth networked together with manned platforms, in the past. The modified Viper took part in at least two such demonstrations , dubbed Have Raider and Have Raider II, in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Lockheed Martin, the current manufacturer of the F-16 , led these tests. During Have Raider, the aircraft flew autonomously in formation with another F-16D, before breaking off to fly along a pre-determined route, and then flying back into formation with the other jet. Have Raider II saw VISTA autonomously carry out simulated strikes on ground targets and modify its route based on information it received about mock threats. In both cases, VISTA had pilots onboard as a safety precaution. VISTA flies with another F-16D during the Have Raider demonstration in 2015., Lockheed Martin VISTA could also act as the manned wingman for testbed drones that Kratos, General Atomics, and Boeing are supplying for the Skyborg program. In addition, there has been talk in the past about how the technologies developed under this program could be integrated into manned aircraft, providing an artificial intelligence (AI) “copilot” that could help human pilots perform various tasks faster and more effectively, reducing their workload and adding additional margins of safety. Separate demonstrations of similar technologies have also indicated that this could provide a pathway to turn manned aircraft into pilot-optional ones. Skyborg is, of course, just one of a number of current Air Force research and development efforts exploring advanced autonomous capabilities supported by AI and machine learning technologies. Other similar work is also being conducted elsewhere within the U.S. military . VISTA could easily use its forthcoming modifications to support those projects, as well as to continue supporting other flight testing unrelated to autonomous systems. Calspan has already begun to modify an L-39 Albatross jet trainer to accommodate a separate autonomy package as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DAPRA) Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program. USAF “For more than two decades VISTA has been a vital asset for the USAF TPS [Test Pilot School] and the embodiment of our goal to be part of the cutting edge of flight test and aerospace technology,” Gray, the chief VISTA test pilot, said. “It has given almost a thousand students and staff members the opportunity to practice testing aircraft with dangerously poor flying qualities, and to execute risk-reduction flight test programs for advanced technologies.” Now designated the X-62A, VISTA looks set to continue assisting a variety of advanced aerospace projects, including the Air Force’s Skyborg program, for years to come.

The U.S. Air Force’s B-52H Stratofortress bomber has recently posed for photos behind an impressive display of its still-expanding weapons and stores options. Although it first took to the air almost 70 years ago, the adaptable “BUFF” still keeps pace with developments in precision-guided ordnance and it also carries some important weapons that are unique to it in the Air Force inventory.

At the front, in the center, is perhaps the most sophisticated weapon in the B-52’s quiver, the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM, a low-observable cruise missile that we have looked at in-depth in the past . The JASSM is an absolutely critical weapon to the B-52. Now that the conventional variants of the Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), the AGM-86C and D versions , have been retired, it is the only non-nuclear standoff land attack weapon presently certified for use with the aircraft, including on Common Rotary Launchers (CRL) that fit inside its bomb bays. The B-52 added JASSM capability on its CRL in 2016, boosting the number of these weapons it can carry from 12 (previously carried just on its wing pylons) to 20. While the AGM-86B/D are gone, another variant of the ALCM, the nuclear-tipped AGM-86B, does remain in use. This weapon is presently only certified to be carried by B-52Hs, which are no longer approved to carry nuclear bombs . A new nuclear-armed cruise missile, the Long-Range Stand-Off (LRSO) missile, is now in development to replace the AGM-86B. In the photographs from Barksdale, there are eight AGM-86B seen loaded on a CRL in front of the bomber’s nose and 12 more are loaded six each on pair pylons that can be carried on each of two underwing hardpoints. Fully loaded, a B-52H can carry 20 of these weapons, each one of which has a so-called “dial-a-yield” warhead with multiple settings reportedly between 5 and 150 kilotons . When fitted, these underwing clusters are located between the fuselage and the inner engine nacelles, rather than between the engine pods, where they are positioned in these photos. A weapons load crew prepares to load inert AGM-86B ALCMs on a B-52H at Barksdale Air Force Base, in August last year., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Lillian Miller On the far left of the picture is another high-tech store, not an offensive weapon this time, but the ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoys, or MALD, essentially a mini-cruise missile, which serves to distract and deceive an enemy air defense system to help the B-52s and their weapons to reach their targets. Next to the MALD, from left to right, are what appears to be a 500-pound class Paveway laser-guided bomb without its front fins and a 2,000-pound class Paveway minus its front guidance section. A 2,000-pound GBU-10 Paveway II munition is prepared for transport and loading on a B-52H Stratofortress during a Combat Hammer exercise at Barksdale Air Force in March., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Jacob B. Wrightsman Over on the right is a trio of different Joint Direct Attack Munitions , or JDAM, with a larger 2,000-pound class JDAM on the left, then a 500-pound class Laser JDAM (LJDAM), and finally a 500-pound class JDAM. These all-weather strike weapons, whether hauled by the B-52 or by a host of other tactical platforms , have become a signature weapon of successive campaigns in Afghanistan and the Middle East, offering GPS/INS guidance as standard, plus a laser seeker for the LJDAM variant. Typically, the 2,000-pound class GBU-31/B is reserved for larger or more hardened targets, while the 500-pound GBU-38/B is used for close air support and other strikes on smaller targets. Twenty JDAMs of various types can also be carried by each B-52 and a mix, as seen in the video below, is not uncommon. Yet more JDAMs are arranged in a semi-circle on both sides of the bomber, these all being 500-pound class weapons without the front fins and fuzes. You could be mistaken for thinking these were freefall dumb bombs, but each one has the signature gray-colored JDAM tail kit. On the topic of dumbs bombs, this is a category of weapons missing from this otherwise fairly complete weapons inventory, and we know that B-52s have still been dropping these unguided weapons in combat in significant numbers in recent years. An airman aligns a Mk 82 bomb for a previous weapons display in from of a B-52 at Barksdale., U.S. Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Robert J. Horstman Another “missing” category of weapon is naval mines, which remain an important, if often-overlooked part of the bomber’s repertoire. The B-52 can carry the Quickstrike series of mines , essentially Mk 80 series general-purpose bombs with added modifications, plus a ballute or folding-fin tail kit to slow their fall. The latest versions of these weapons can be fitted with JDAM-ER guided wing kits, enabling mines to be sown at standoff range, which you can read more about here . A B-52H is loaded with Quickstrike mines at RAF Fairford, England, during a 2017 deployment to Europe., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Randahl J. Jenson Other, more niche stores, that we don’t see in these shots include a pair of psychological warfare “bombs,” the PDU-5/B that dispenses tens of thousands of paper leaflets, and the Cold War-era M129E1/E2 that is no longer in production, but which is retained in service and performs a similar role. With the future of the B-52 seemingly secure until at least 2050 , the variety of weapons that it can carry is only going to increase. Chief among these is a new breed of hypersonic weapons, for which the Stratofortress has been identified as the ideal launch platform . First off, the B-52 is being used to test these exotic weapons, but operational versions of some of these should provide the veteran bomber with a new lease of life, including a much-needed survivability boost, allowing them to launch their weapons further still from enemy air defenses. U.S. Department of Defense When the Air Force provided a briefing on the future “roadmap” for the B-52, back in 2018, the presentation included no fewer than seven different new weapons, four of which were hypersonic weapons, all of which you can read more about here . Only yesterday, the Air Force confirmed that it had performed a second (unsuccessful) test launch of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic missile, or ARRW, from a B-52. To these weapons can be added future podded systems and perhaps even air-to-air drones of the type being developed under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s LongShot program that would provide a standoff means of engaging enemy aircraft. Members of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon Instrumented Measurement Vehicle 2 test team make final preparations prior to a captive-carry test flight of the prototype hypersonic weapon at Edwards Air Force Base, California, in August last year., U.S. Air Force/Kyle Brasier With that in mind, should the Air Force repeat this photo opportunity in 2050, say, the types of weapons that might be arming the B-52 then could look very different indeed.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Challenge coins have emerged for sale online that appear related to a secretive cadre of F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack jets still operating from the Tonopah Test Range Airport . Despite the Air Force officially retiring these aircraft more than a decade ago, a number of them have continued to fly , ostensibly for research and development purposes. In recent years, they have been increasingly spotted acting as “red air” aggressors during a variety of exercises , as well. There are currently at least two listings for these challenge coins on eBay. The coin’s design features a scroll motif along the bottom edge on both sides with the words “Dark Knights” in black letters outlined in red. If the coins are indeed authentic, that phrase, plus other details, points to the elements of the Air Force that continue to operate the F-117. Both sides of the “Dark Knights” challenge coin, examples of which have emerged for sale online., eBay One side has the Latin phrase “Licentia Ex Dominatus,” meaning “freedom from tyranny,” again in black-and-red letters inside another scroll at the top. In the center, there is a diamond-shaped shield with an American flag motif, with 13 stripes, but only eight stars, and what appears to be a bird of prey in the center. Along the top edges of the shield are what look to be a pair of yellow lightning bolts. Along the left bottom edge is a blue skull wearing some form of classical military helmet, while there is a dagger or short sword on the opposite side. The “Licentia Ex Dominatus” side of the coin., eBay The other side of the coin has a different Latin phrase in the scroll at the top, “Ex Preteritus Ut Posterus,” which appears to mean “from the past to the future.” One seller on eBay also suggested it could mean “learn in the present from the past.” The center features the blue bird again, but also depicts a full skeleton-faced warrior from the other side of the coin, holding the star-spangled diamond shield, this time with only four stars, and holding the dagger or short sword. The “Ex Preteritus Ut Posterus” side of the coin., eBay The coins do not expressly mention the F-117 or show silhouettes of the plane. However, the birds of prey on both sides are very reminiscent of hawk logo seen on Nighthawk program patches and ones associated with units that subsequently flew the aircraft during its official operational career. An F-117A Nighthawk patch with a distinctive hawk motif., militarypatchesandpins.com The official unit insignia of the 4450th Tactical Group, a unit that operated F-117 Nighthawks, showing the same hawk as the program patch., USAF An unofficial patch for the 415th Tactical Fighter Squadron, which operated F-117s, also featuring a hawk motif., airforcecollectables.com The four stars on the shield on the one side might also be a reference to the first flight of the F-117, which occurred on June 18, 1981. This year marks the 40th anniversary of that milestone and these coins only just recently appeared online. Challenges coins are often produced for and distributed at special events to mark important achievements or other milestones, among other occasions . The “from the past to the future”/”learn in the present from the past” Latin motto on the one side of the coin would also fit well with how the Air Force is using its pocket fleet of still-flying F-117s. As The War Zone has highlighted multiple times in the past, the F-117, while now a dated design, still offers a very valuable stealthy dissimilar target to train and test new sensors against , among other things. In addition, an F-117 was spotted flying over the Mojave Desert in 2019 with “Dark Knights” written on a flash on its tail. It was unclear at the time what the exact meaning behind this might have been, but The War Zone noted, among other things , that the 9th Fighter Squadron, a former Nighthawk unit, had the nickname the “Flying Knights” and had previously been known as the “Iron Knights.” F-117 pilots have near-exclusively used “Knight” callsigns for years, well before the appearance of the tail flash. In addition, it is worth noting that there is a unit at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, the 338th Training Squadron , which is officially nicknamed the “Dark Knights,” but that is a non-flying unit responsible for training airmen in “radio frequency transmission, airfield systems, ground radar, and cyber transport.” Perhaps the most significant link between these coins and the still-operated F-117s were crests seen painted just behind the right engine intakes on two Nighthawks that Joerg Arnu, who runs the great website Dreamlandresort.com , photographed flying near Coyote Summit in Nevada earlier this month . There are very strong visual similarities between what we can see of those logos in the pictures and the design of the “Licentia Ex Dominatus” side of the coins. A comparison of the “Licentia Ex Dominatus” side of the “Dark Knights” challenge coin and crests seen on two F-117 Nighthawks that were photographed flying near Coyote Summit in Nevada earlier this month., eBay/JOERG ARNU/DREAMLANDRESORT.COM This all adds further evidence that the Air Force has formally re-established a unit of some kind dedicated to the continued operation of at least some of the remaining F-117s in the aggressor, research and development, and other support roles. That would be in line with other evidence that the service has significantly expanded the use of this “post-retirement” Nighthawk fleet, including clearing them earlier this year to refuel from any standard KC-135R tanker, rather than force them to continue to rely on a very small number of NKC-135R test tankers . In addition, satellite imagery that The War Zone obtained last year showed evidence of a major event at Tonopah in September that looked to include photoshoot in front of an F-117. This could have been arranged in order to get a commemorative group shot of personnel assigned to Air Force’s current Nighthawk unit. An F-117 during its operational career. , USAF The remaining operational F-117s might be part of a larger airborne signature evaluation entity, too, which could also include the Air Force’s secretive NT-43A flying signature measurement aircraft . The NT-43A, also commonly referred to by its callsign “RAT 55” is a heavily modified Boeing 737-200 that is known to routinely operate from Tonopah, as well as Area 51 . “The Air Force retired the F-117 from active service, but pilots from the Air Force Test Center still fly them for limited research activities,” the service had told The War Zone in a statement earlier this year. This was effectively identical to what we were told back in 2019 when we were first to report on who was still flying these jets and why, at least officially. As more information about Air Force’s ongoing activities utilizing the F-117 continues to emerge, hopefully, we will learn more about the “Dark Knights” unique story.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 30, 2019",The Pentagon Is Experimenting With Using Artificial Intelligence To “See Days In Advance”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) recently conducted a series of tests known as the Global Information Dominance Experiments, or GIDE, which combined global sensor networks, artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and cloud computing resources in an attempt to “achieve information dominance” and “decision-making superiority.” According to NORTHCOM leadership, the AI and machine learning tools tested in the experiments could someday offer the Pentagon a robust “ability to see days in advance,” meaning it could predict the future with some reliability based on evaluating patterns, anomalies, and trends in massive data sets. While the concept sounds like something out of Minority Report , the commander of NORTHCOM says this capability is already enabled by tools readily available to the Pentagon. General Glen VanHerck , Commander of NORTHCOM and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), told reporters at the Pentagon this week that this was the third test of GIDE, conducted in conjunction with all 11 combatant commands “collaborating in the same information space using the same exact capabilities.” The experiment largely centered around contested logistics and information advantage, two cornerstones of the new warfighting paradigm recently proposed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A full transcript of VanHerck’s press briefing is available online . A Starlink antenna deployed during the Global Information Dominance Experiment 3 at Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Alpena, Michigan, July 15, 2021., USAF/TSgt. Peter Thompson VanHerck told reporters that this AI-enabled decision making could actually allow for a type of proactive forecasting that sounds truly like the stuff of science fiction: The machine learning and the artificial intelligence can detect changes [and] we can set parameters where it will trip an alert to give you the awareness to go take another sensor such as GEOINT on-satellite capability to take a closer look at what might be ongoing in a specific location. […] [W]hat we’ve seen is the ability to get way further what I call left, left of being reactive to actually being proactive. And I’m talking not minutes and hours, I’m talking days. The ability to see days in advance creates decision space. Decision space for me as an operational commander to potentially posture forces to create deterrence options to provide that to the secretary or even the president. To use messaging, the information space to create deterrence options and messaging and if required to get further ahead and posture ourselves for defeat. Gen. VanHerck says this most recent experiment, GIDE 3, was a way of testing “a fundamental change in how we use information and data to increase decision space for leaders from the tactical level to the strategic level — not only military leaders, but also gives opportunity for our civilian leaders.” The NORTHCOM and NORAD Commander claims that GIDE shifts the Department of Defense’s (DOD) focus “away from pure defeat mechanisms for homeland defense towards earlier, deter-and-deny actions well outside a conflict” and will allow faster, more proactive decision making. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ux-KZEY_wrg To do this, the experiment used artificial intelligence tools to perform real-time analysis of data gathered by a network of sensors across the globe including “commercially available information” from unnamed partners. That information, VanHerck says, could be shared via cloud-based systems to allies and other partners in real-time, should NORTHCOM decide to. The tests also included support from the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and Project Maven , a DOD project that leverages AI to sift through massive amounts of persistent surveillance imagery and rapidly identify useful information. The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army have already been testing similar concepts which are exploring the convergences of real-time data collection and artificial intelligence in order to enable faster and more informed decision making. VanHerck says the GIDE 3 experiments were different, however, in that NORTHCOM isn’t looking to create new tools or concepts, but instead use what is already available to give the highest levels of military leadership a new level of awareness: The primary [difference] between what I’m doing and what the services are doing is I’m focused at the operational to strategic level. Taking data and information that is available today. That’s key. We’re not creating new capabilities to go get data and information. This information exists from today’s satellites, today’s radar, today’s undersea capabilities, today’s cyber, today’s intel capabilities. The data exists. What we’re doing is making that data available… and shared into a cloud, where machine learning and artificial intelligence look at it and they process it really quickly and provide it to decision makers, which I call decision superiority.” This gives us days of advanced warning and ability to react. Where, in the past, we may not have put eyes on with an analyst of a GEOINT satellite image, now we are doing that within minutes or near real-time. That’s the primary difference that I’m talking about. U.S. Northern Command Commander U.S. Air Force General Glen D. VanHerck speaks during a press briefing about the completed global information dominance experiment (GIDE) 3, at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., July 28, 2021., DOD/SSgt Brittany A. Chase The types of global cloud services, data fusion, and other concepts used in the experiments aren’t anything new per se , and VanHerck says that NORTHCOM has simply “stitched everything together to make this happen” on a military level. “I wouldn’t think of this as a thing or a- you know, a gadget we’re going to buy and move forward,” the general told reporters. “This is a software-based capabilities [sic] utilizing technology that is readily available today.” While the systems used in GIDE 3 are still being tested and developed, VanHerck used the metaphor of “building the bike while we ride it,” which he elaborated on earlier this month in a War on the Rocks op-ed . USAF personnel align a Tampa Microwave Satellite Terminal to receive signals while supporting a combat camera team during the Global Information Dominance Experiment 3., USAF/SSgt. Sean Carnes VanHerck also added that United States Space Command (SPACECOM) was “intimately involved” with the experiments, stating that the experiments explored options to hold competitors’ space-based and land-based capabilities at risk, while also considering the fact that potential adversaries would put our own space assets at risk in any conflict. In his remarks, the NORAD commander obliquely referred to Russia and China, claiming that the United States currently has “two peer competitors, both nuclear-armed, that are competing against us on a daily basis.” When a reporter then asked the general to elaborate about the GIDE 3 exercise, the Pentagon wouldn’t name a specific simulated adversary but noted it was “focused on a peer competitor.” Air National Guard personnel monitor aircraft at Tyndall Air Force Base during the Global Information Dominance Experiment 3 on July 14, 2021., USAF/SSgt. Nicholas Byers The Pentagon’s third Global Information Dominance Experiment is just one more signal that future conflicts could largely be determined by which forces can deploy the best artificial intelligence systems and leverage information the fastest. Given the rate and scale at which data flows around the world thanks to modern communication networks, satellites, and other technologies, it could be in the very near future that battlefield decisions will be dominated by suggestions from AI tools, and eventually, left to AI themselves, as they can make decisions much faster than a human could. But for now, just being able to better predict the future is of extreme interest to America’s top military leadership. Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com Brett Tingley"
Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 2, 2021",Fatal Attack On Tanker Off Oman Blamed On Suicide Drone: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two individuals on board Israeli-operated oil tanker have been killed in what may have been a drone attack on the ship in the Gulf of Oman. Details of what happened aboard the M/T Mercer Street are still emerging , but, if this was indeed an attack, the deaths of a British and a Romanian national onboard the vessel would represent a significant escalation over previous incidents involving commercial shipping in the region in recent months. Many of these attacks are at least widely suspected to be the work of Iran or its regional proxies, and appear to be part of a shadow war on commercial and military ships between Israel and Iran. According to online ship-tracking data, the M/T Mercer Street had departed from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania on July 21 and was heading to Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates when it came under attack at around 6:00 pm Coordinated Universal Time on Thursday, while it was 152 nautical miles northeast of Duqm, Oman. The M/T Mercer Street off Cape Town, South Africa, in 2016., Johan Victor via AP The oil tanker, at 28,400 gross registered tons, sails under the Liberian flag and has a Japanese owner. It is operated by Zodiac Maritime, a London-based company that belongs to the Israeli Eyal Ofer, a billionaire real estate and shipping magnate, and a philanthropist. According to the Jerusalem Post , there was no oil or other cargo aboard Mercer Street at the time of the attack. While Zodiac Maritime initially described the attack as a “piracy incident,” the company since seems to have stepped back from that, removing the statement from its website, while the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), a body that monitors maritime security in the region, has said stated that it was a “non-piracy” attack. The company has also said it is not aware of anyone else on the vessel being injured in the incident. Though the exact nature of the incident remains unconfirmed, according to Associated Press , a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity said the attack appeared to have involved several drones, including a “one-way” drone — which was presumably responsible for pressing home the attack itself. The official said it wasn’t immediately known who launched the attack. Separately, Dryad Global, a maritime intelligence company, reported that an unspecified unmanned aerial vehicle deployed flares in the vicinity of the tanker, triggering a first advisory notice from the UKMTO. A second event, according to Dryad Global, resulted in an explosion on the vessel, but it did not provide further details. Of those killed, the British national was a security guard working for Ambrey Ltd , a company that describes itself as offering a “fully integrated, intelligence-led maritime security service solution.” The Romanian national appears to have been a member of the ship’s crew. The UKMTO has said that an investigation into the incident is currently underway and that regional search and rescue authorities and coalition forces have been tasked to assist the vessel. Meanwhile, Zodiac Maritime says that the ship is “sailing under the control of her crew and under her own power at 14 knots to a safe location with a US naval escort.” There is U.S.-led maritime security construct in place, which includes a multi-national naval task force , in the region specifically focused on protecting international shipping from the kinds of attacks that Mercer Street was reportedly the victim of. Mercer Street is not the first Zodiac Maritime-linked vessel to come under apparent attack this month. A fire that broke out aboard the CSAV Tyndall , in the northern Indian Ocean, on July 3, was blamed by Israel on an Iranian attack during which it was struck by an “unknown weapon.” This ship had previously been owned by Eyal Ofer’s firm, but had been sold several months previously. In April, there had also been a reported attack on the Israeli-owned cargo ship Hyperion Ray , which may also have been carried out using a drone of some kind. The month before that, another Israeli-owned vessel, the container ship Lori , was reportedly the victim of a missile attack in the Gulf of Oman. In both cases, Iran, or its proxies, was suspected of being responsible. In February, Israeli officials had again blamed Iran for an attack on Helios Ray , a sister ship of Hyperion Ray, which was also sailing in this same general region, Iranian authorities, in turn, accused Israel of carrying out a false flag operation. Iran had also been linked to a string of attacks in 2019 on foreign tankers involving limpet mines placed on their hulls, likely by combat swimmers or personnel in small boats . While the use of a drone in this reported attack on Mercer Street , as well as other incidents in recent months, is unconfirmed, Iran operates a number of different drones that would be capable of carrying out such a strike, technology that it has also passed on to proxies across the Middle East . Iran has also previously touted the ability to launch certain types from small boats at maritime or coastal targets. There has already been the suggestion that an Iranian delta-wing Shahed-136 unmanned aircraft, a type close associated with the drone and missile strikes on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia in 2019, which have also been blamed on Iran, may have been use in the apparent attack on Mercer Street . However, there is, so far, nothing to confirm that report. Regardless, an attack on Mercer Street would be in line with this uptick in reported Iranian attacks on Israeli-linked shipping around the Gulf of Oman in the past few months. As well as the targeting of Israeli ships, there have also been reported attacks on Iranian vessels in recent months, indicating that a tit-for-tat maritime campaign is now underway. In March, the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel had targeted at least 12 ships bound for Syria, most of them transporting either Iranian oil or weapons. Among the high-profile Iranian victims of apparent attacks is the M/V Saviz , reportedly targeted in the Red Sea in April. This vessel has been alleged to have been used by Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps uses to assist Houthi rebels in Yemen and conduct other covert activities in the region. The incidents have spiked amid growing tensions between the two countries related to the Iranian nuclear deal, which President Biden’s administration has been seeking to rejoin after President Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018. Israel has remained firmly opposed to the deal and has launched preemptive military action against suspected nuclear facilities in Iraq and Syria. Iran has also blamed Israeli for an attack on Iranian soil, targeting the Natanz nuclear site, in April. Again, the nature of the attack remains unclear, with some reports suggesting a cyberattack and others saying the attack was carried out using an explosive charge . The exact details about many of the reported attacks on Iranian and Israeli shipping in the Gulf of Oman and beyond are, by their nature, murky and have been subject to dispute on both sides. However, if this new incident involving the Mercer Street is indeed linked to this broader campaign, the fatalities would represent a clear and serious escalation that could demand more forceful responses from various parties. So far, there has not been a formal comment from Israel or Iran, but we will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy will begin preliminary hearings to determine if it will bring arson charges against a sailor accused of starting the 2020 fire that damaged the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6) so extensively it had to be scrapped . During the Article 32 preliminary hearing, an officer will review all of the available evidence before determining whether or not charges should be formally referred against the accused. The sailor has not yet been identified. A media statement issued to Task and Purpose ’s Jared Keller from Commander Sean Robertson, spokesperson of the U.S. 3rd Fleet, reads: On July 29, charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice [UCMJ] were brought forth against a Navy Sailor in response to evidence found during the criminal investigation into the fire started on USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6) on July 12, 2020. Evidence collected during the investigation is sufficient to direct a preliminary hearing with due process under the military justice system. The Sailor was a member of Bonhomme Richard’s crew at the time and is accused of starting the fire. Vice Adm. Steve Koehler, commander, U.S. 3rd Fleet is considering court-martial charges and has directed a preliminary hearing at which an impartial hearing officer will make determinations and recommendations required by the UCMJ prior to any further trial proceedings – including whether or not there is probable cause to believe an offense has been committed and to offer a recommendation as to the disposition of the case. Sailors prepare to board the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) to fight a fire at Naval Base in San Diego, Calif. on Tuesday, July 14, 2020. , USN via AP Officials told the Navy Times they expect the hearing to be held by the end of this summer. 85 crew members were living aboard the ship when the fire broke out last July. The fire caused an explosion and then raged for four days before Navy crews fighting the blaze alongside the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department were able to extinguish it . By the time the fire was out, sections of the flight deck were warped by the intense heat and parts of the island superstructure had collapsed. 63 sailors and civilian firefighters were injured fighting the fire. Helicopters and firefighting watercraft attempt to douse the flames aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard ., USN via AP After reviewing the extent of the damage, the Navy determined it would be too expensive to attempt to repair the ship or convert it to another use. The decision was then made to decommission and scrap the Bonhomme Richard at a cost of $30 million . The damaged vessel was towed through the Panama Canal on its way to Texas for dismantling. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) began an investigation into the arson in August 2020. Earlier this month, emails from the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department obtained by the Navy Times revealed that the service was consulting with legal counsel, suggesting that charges could be brought. The emails also revealed that several other smaller fires broke out aboard three other San Diego-based ships in the 15 months leading up to the fire that eventually saw the Bonhomme Richard scrapped: a March 2019 fire on the USS Boxer (LHD-4) Wasp -class amphibious assault ship; one aboard the Avenger -class mine countermeasures ship USS Champion (MCM-4) in November 2019; and a March 2020 fire on the USS Harpers Ferry (LSD-49), the lead ship of the Harpers Ferry class of dock landing ships. It’s unknown if the suspect in the Bonhomme Richard fire was in any way involved with those other fires. We will continue to update our reporting as more information becomes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery has emerged that indicates that the U.K. Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is underway in the South China Sea while the Chinese Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Navy flattop Shandong is also in these waters, though the two ships look to be sailing on opposite sides of the disputed body of water, at least for now. The appearance of the British flagship in the South China Sea had been anticipated, but it still carries a significant message as the United Kingdom and its allies look to further challenge Chinaâ€™s expansive territorial claims in this region. Using satellite imagery provided by the European Space Agency and NASA/U.S. Geological Survey, Twitter user @duandang appears to have located the two aircraft carriers in the South China Sea, separated by around 580 nautical miles of water. The Shandong looks to be underway just south of Hainan Island, where it is home-ported within a huge Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) base. Meanwhile, the imagery indicates that HMS Queen Elizabeth is somewhere between the coast of Vietnam and the island of Borneo.

Meanwhile, HMS Queen Elizabeth is embarking eight F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) stealth fighters from the U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF). There are another 10 of these jets onboard the ship from the U.S. Marines Corpsâ€™ Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211, the â€œ Wake Island Avengers ,â€ which is currently under British command .

Other helicopters are assigned to the U.S. Navy and Dutch Navy destroyers within CSG21, too. At the same time that CSG21 appears to be underway in the South China Sea, these same waters are also hosting a U.S. Navy Surface Action Group , or SAG, which is drawn from three U.S. 7th Fleet task forces and includes the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Kidd and the Independence class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) USS Tulsa . This is, according to the Navy, the first time a deployed LCS and a guided-missile destroyer have joined to form a surface task group, with the LCS having had a notably troubled service career so far. Although unconfirmed, there are meanwhile reports of PLAN maneuvers underway around Hainan, which could involve the Shandong . This is Chinaâ€™s second aircraft carrier, constructed in China along very similar design principles to the former Kuznetsov class carrier Liaoning , and which has been in service since late 2019. If it is taking part in an exercise of significant size and scope, the Shandong would also be accompanied by its own support assets. When the carrierâ€™s sister vessel, Liaoning , was underway in Japanâ€™s Miyako Strait earlier this year, it was reportedly joined by two Type 052D Luyang class destroyers, one Type 055 Renhai class destroyer, one Type 054A Jiangkai class II frigate, and one Type 901 Fuyu class fast combat support ship. That CSG21 would enter the South China Sea had long been expected, as part of the 26,000-nautical-mile cruise that plans to take in visits to 40 nations, as well as various bilateral and multinational exercises. In a statement in April, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said: â€œWhen our Carrier Strike Group sets sail next month, it will be flying the flag for Global Britain â€” projecting our influence, signaling our power, engaging with our friends and reaffirming our commitment to addressing the security challenges of today and tomorrow.â€ HMS Queen Elizabeth transits the Suez Canal in convoy with the UK Carrier Strike Group, en route to the Indo-Pacific., Crown Copyright Although not making specific reference to the South China Sea, before the departure of CSG21, the U.K. Ministry of Defense also noted that the deployment was â€œintended to bolster already deep defense partnerships in the Pacific region, where the UK is committed to a more enduring regional defense and security presence.â€ The arrival of CSG21 is part of a wider uptick in U.K. interest in the South China Sea, and the Royal Navy plans to permanently assign two Offshore Patrol Vessels , HMS Spey and HMS Tamar , to the Indo-Pacific region from August this year, as well as contributing a Littoral Response Group (LRG) in the future. The permanent assignment of these two ships marks a step change in our relationship with the Indo Pacific region. In the coming years they will be joined by a Littoral Response Group as the UK works ever more closely with our allies and partners. @RoyalNavy @hms_tamar @HMS_Spey pic.twitter.com/zEM8NurgKD — Chief of the Defence Staff ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ (@AdmTonyRadakin_) July 23, 2021 The United Kingdom, alongside the United States and other allies, both regional and interregional, have been keeping a close eye on developments in the South China Sea, where the waters have long been disputed, with competing territorial claims from China as well as Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. In particular, the island chains of the Paracels and the Spratlys , home to significant natural resources, are subject to claims by different nations, while there are also territorial disputes over a variety of atolls, sandbanks, and reefs, including the Scarborough Shoal , which is subject to a dispute between the Philippines and China. As part of its wide-ranging claims in the region, manifested in the â€œ nine-dash line ,â€ China has embarked on efforts to build and arm artificial islands , as well as stepping up naval patrols by its warships and aircraft. A map of the South China Sea, with the â€œnine-dash lineâ€ marked in green., CIA In response, the U.S. Navy, in particular, has sent military vessels and aircraft on â€œ freedom of navigation â€ operations, or FONOPs, in the South China Sea, demonstrating its commitment to keeping access open to vital shipping and air routes. With a variety of vessels and aircraft involved, CSG21 is now well placed to carry out similar operations, with the option for elements of CSG21 to break away and potentially take part in their own FONOPs, as HMS Daring and HNLMS Evertsen did recently in the Black Sea . Earlier this year, the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group and the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) conducted a coordinated exercise in the South China Sea, while the Liaoning and its carrier strike group were in the same waters. At the same time, China and the Philippines were involved in a dispute as more than 200 Chinese vessels occupied an area in the West Philippines Sea known as Whitsun Reef. As the U.S. State Department expressed its concern about Chinaâ€™s maritime activities, Chinaâ€™s foreign minister spokesman Zhao Lijian responded accused the United States of â€œinciting quarrels and sowing discord.â€ The PLAN has also been increasingly assertive recently in enforcing its disputed claims in the region, including reports from Beijing that its military chased an American warship out of the South China Sea. While that is disputed, the potential risks for anyone conducting FONOPs are clear. Against the backdrop of these developments, and accusations of militarization of the South China Sea from different parties, itâ€™s not surprising that many analysts have identified the area as a potential flashpoint and one which could have enormous repercussions. All in all, the strategic and economic significance of the South China Sea is beyond doubt and itâ€™s now clear that the United Kingdom, too, is increasingly willing to show its presence in these waters, within which it has been estimated that up to a third of all maritime trade passes, by volume.Â Before it arrived in the South China Sea, CSG21 had taken part in Exercise Konkan with the Indian Navy in the Bay of Bengal. As it passed Singapore, heading east, there was a chance to take part in drills with the Republic of Singapore Navy, which provided the Formidable class frigate RSS Intrepid , the Independence class littoral mission vessel RSS Unity , and the Endurance class landing ship tank RSS Resolution .

While in the Mediterranean, the Carrier Strike Group also attracted attention from Russian Navy assets based in Syria, while Russian warships were in turn shadowed by the carrierâ€™s F-35Bs. So far, CSG21â€™s activities in the South China Sea have been low-profile, but that may well change, and it also remains to be seen just how Beijing will respond to this new development. July 30: China has now issued a formal response to operations by CSG21 in the South China Sea. â€œThe action should never try to destabilize regional peace, including the latest military collaboration between the UK and Japan,â€ Wu Qian, a spokesman from Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Defense, said. â€œThe Chinese navy will take any necessary actions to counter-measure such behavior.â€ Meanwhile, Chinaâ€™s Global Times has issued a report declaring that â€œthe very idea of a British presence in the South China Sea is dangerous.â€ The report warns that â€œIf London tries to establish a military presence in the region with geopolitical significance, it will only disrupt the status quo in the region [â€¦] And if there is any real action against China, it is looking for a defeat.â€ Last night we also passed close to the resting place of the previous Prince of Wales and Repulse.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 6, 2021",Second Attempt To Test The Air Force’s First Hypersonic Weapon Fails,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A second attempt to carry out a flight test of a prototype of the U.S. Air Force’s AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic missile, or ARRW, has failed. The weapon separated safely from the B-52H bomber carrying it, but the rocket motor did not ignite. This follows the first unsuccessful attempted flight test in April , in which the missile did not even leave the wing of the B-52H it was attached to. The Air Force announced the outcome of the test, which occurred on July 28 over the Point Mugu Sea Range in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California, today. The service had previously announced that it would conduct this flight test event before the end of July . The 419th Flight Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base in California and the Global Power Bomber Combined Test Force participated in this new attempted launch. An AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon test article under the wing of a B-52H bomber during an earlier test., USAF “The missile cleanly separated from the aircraft and successfully demonstrated the full release sequence including GPS acquisition, umbilical disconnect and power transfer from the aircraft to the missile,” an Air Force press release said. “The missile also demonstrated fin operation and de-confliction maneuvers which ensures a safe operation for the aircrew. Following the safe separation maneuvers, the rocket motor did not ignite.” The Air Force insists that this abortive launch still provided valuable test data and “demonstrated several first-time events as the program continues to track toward fielding a hypersonic capability in the early 2020s.” Last week the service had confirmed to The War Zone that the overall test plan had been the same as it had been for the initial failed Booster Test Flight 1 test, or BTF-1, in April. The BTF-1 test had been intended to focus on validating the performance of the missile’s rocket booster and demonstrating the simulated separation of the weapon’s unpowered boost-glide vehicle payload. The prototype missile would carry a frangible surrogate for that vehicle that would disintegrate after release. The ARRW, as designed , is intended to use its rocket booster to accelerate a wedge-shaped unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle sitting inside the nosecone on top of the missile and loft it to a desired altitude and speed. Once there, the nose cone breaks away and the vehicle is released, after which it glides along atmospheric flight trajectory at hypersonic velocity toward its target. Hypersonic speeds are defined as anything above Mach 5. An artist’s conception of an AGM-183A right before releasing its hypersonic boost-glide vehicle payload., Lockheed Martin The boost-glide vehicle is designed to be highly maneuverable, which, combined with its speed and flight profile, make it ideal for penetrating through dense enemy air defenses to strike at time-sensitive and other high-value targets. Those performance attributes give opponents less time, overall, to react to the incoming threat, making it extremely difficult for them to relocate assets or otherwise seek shelter. It’s also interesting to note that comments from Mark Lewis, the Executive Director of the National Defense Industry Association’s (NDIA) Emerging Technologies Institute, and John Venable, a Senior Research Fellow for Defense Policy at The Heritage Foundation think tank, earlier today had suggested that the Air Force might have tried to conduct BTV-1b, or a similar test, earlier this month, but had scrubbed it for unspecified reasons. Lewis and Venable had been participating in a virtual Heritage Foundation event regarding hypersonic weapon developments. All of this also follows Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor working on ARRW for the Air Force, disclosing a $225 million loss on a classified aerospace development project during a call with reporters about the company’s earnings for the second quarter of this year. It is unknown whether or not this is, in any way, related to AGM-183A’s struggles. Lockheed Martin, of course, is involved in a number of publicly acknowledged, but still top-secret aerospace programs and is all but certainly engaged in a number of undisclosed development efforts , as well. It remains to be seen how this second unsuccessful flight test will impact the Air Force’s plans for ARRW. As noted, the service still says it expects to reach at least some kind of initial operational capability with this weapon in the early 2020s. In the past, it had said that hoped to use un-expended flight test prototypes to field an early operational capability . However, the Air Force is now at least seven months, if not more, behind in its flight test schedule, having originally expected to carry out the first live-fire launch by the end of 2020, and has lost one prototype. “Developing first-of-its-kind weapons is difficult business and this is why we test,” Air Force Brigadier General Heath Collins, the Air Force’s Program Executive Officer for Weapons, said in a statement regarding the most recent attempted ARRW launch. “This is a critical capability for our Air Force and we have the very best team working to figure out what happened, fix it and move out to deliver ARRW to our warfighters as quickly as possible.” Hopefully, the Air Force will be able to use what it has learned from this unsuccessful launch to keep moving forward on what is still slated to be its first operational air-launched hypersonic weapon. The service continues to stress that this is a capability that is critical to how it expects to prosecute future high-end conflicts , especially against potential near-peer adversaries, such as China. We will keep you informed of new details about the failed test if they become available. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 9, 2021",New Swarming Capability Planned For The V-Bat Vertical Takeoff And Landing Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Artificial intelligence firm Shield AI will pair its powerful autonomy technology with the V-Bat drone , which takes off and lands vertically without the need for special infrastructure, potentially leading to a significant leap in the unmanned aircraft’s capabilities, including its ability to operate as part of a swarm. The V-Bat has already been tested extensively by numerous branches of the military, and this latest news could signal that its role is set to grow as a versatile platform perfect for expeditionary missions. The news came in a recent announcement that Shield AI had acquired the V-Bat’s manufacturer, Martin UAV. Shield AI says that their proprietary Hivemind AI system is well-suited to enable unmanned aircraft to carry out a wide range of missions, and specifically lists “infantry clearance operations” and “breaching integrated air defense systems with unmanned aircraft” among them. Shield AI’s autonomy systems have already been used aboard smaller quadcopter drones by U.S. Special Operations Command since 2018 . A V-Bat drone and its portable command center., Martin UAV “Shield AI will integrate its combat proven autonomy software, Hivemind, into the V-BAT, reinforcing Shield AI’s leadership position in defense-focused edge autonomy,” the company’s news release reads. “The acquisition of Martin UAV complements a deliberate strategy to integrate Hivemind onto unmanned systems for defense and commercial applications.” In the release, Brandon Tseng, Shield AI cofounder and former Navy SEAL, describes the V-Bat in three words: “Expeditionary. Intelligent. Collaborative.” Tseng says that the combination of Shield AI’s autonomy technologies and the V-Bat’s unique capabilities represents “the future of unmanned aircraft,” allowing unprecedented levels of coverage even in “high-threat environments” and enabling the drones to “make their own decisions to execute commander’s intent to accomplish missions.” This latest press release also claims that Shield AI’s proprietary autonomy system will ”enable GPS- and communications- denied operation.” Reuben Martin, CEO of Martin UAV, elaborated on what that could mean for the battlefield of the future, noting that “GPS and communications on the battlefield are no longer assured . A great aircraft without an AI to make intelligent decisions will be sidelined against China, Russia, and an increasing number of adversaries who are fielding electronic warfare and anti-air systems .” On Shield AI’s webpage for their Hivemind AI system , the company goes further, stating simply “No GPS, No Comms, No Problem,” claiming the AI system can “Remove the need for human operators, GPS, and RF [radiofrequency] links.” The Army Futures Command’s Future Vertical Lift cross-functional team is seen here conducting V-Bat flight tests in February 2021 at Leyte West Airfield, Fort Benning, Georgia., US Army/Luke Allen The V-Bat measures just nine feet in length with a wingspan of just under 10 feet and combines the low footprint required for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations with the high efficiency of a fixed-wing platform. The drone can take off or land in a nine-square-meter area independent of special infrastructure, making it perfect for crowded urban environments, expeditionary operations in austere areas, or the decks of surface ships . Being able to operate UAVs and other aircraft in GPS-denied environments is becoming a larger priority for the Pentagon , as is the ability to operate in austere or unprepared locations , both of which the VTOL drone aims to do. The V-Bat can be transported in the bed of a pickup or inside a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter and weighs just 125 pounds. A two-person crew can have the UAV up and running in less than a half-hour. A laptop-based user interface built into a portable hard case rounds out its impressive portability capabilities. The drone runs on a 183cc two-stroke engine powering a ducted-fan propulsion and control system, enabling it to reach a top speed of around 90 knots and altitudes as high as 20,000 feet . Martin UAV claims the V-Bat has an 11-hour endurance and can carry payloads up to 25 lbs, making it well-suited to carry a wide variety of multi-spectral sensor systems , electronic intelligence gear , radar systems, electronic warfare suites , and communications packages . The truly modular nature of the V-Bat makes it quite useful for swarming operations, as different drones could be configured with various payloads to give an entire swarm the flexibility to carry out multiple missions and be rapidly reconfigured. It’s unknown if there are any plans to arm the drone, but considering its payload capabilities, it’s possible the VTOL platform could become an optionally reusable cruise missile or loitering munition in the future. A line-of-sight datalink gives the V-Bat roughly 50-mile range, although that is largely impacted by terrain. Its range could potentially be augmented with forward-based ground control stations or through relay links to other airborne craft. When operating in a fully autonomous mode, these lines-of-sight datalinks wouldn’t be as much of a factor and would allow the drones to travel even farther. Even connecting V-Bat with operators via a basic low-bandwidth satellite datalink, so it can provide simple updates for monitoring and accept simple commands, could be an option. USN The V-Bat has already been used in counter-drug operations by the U.S. Navy, while the Marine Corps has been testing the VTOL drone for future use to replace aging UAV systems. The unique UAV was also recently chosen as a finalist in the Navy’s Mi2 Challenge , which seeks to “accelerate the identification and evaluation of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) capable of operating in austere deployed environments without ancillary support systems.” The U.S. Army, meanwhile, is eyeing the V-Bat for future use as part of its Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment which seeks out “concepts and capabilities at the lower tactical echelon in support of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).” The drone is competing against three other UAVs to replace the Army’s RQ-7 Shadow, which is rapidly approaching obsolescence and does not have anywhere near the capability set the V-Bat does. Shield AI also recently acquired Heron Systems , makers of the AI systems that went undefeated in the AlphaDogfight virtual air combat trials against human pilots. It was just recently announced that the same AI “pilot” would be integrated into an L-39 Albatros jet trainer for real-world air combat testing. It’s unknown if that same AI, or some version of it, will be integrated into the V-Bat in the future, but Shield AI’s announcement states that the AlphaDogfight “AI pilot” system would be incorporated into various unmanned aerial systems. Above all, the capability to launch and land swarming drones of substantial size and capability with minimal infrastructure could really be a decisive factor in future conflicts. Drones like the V-Bat that offer such a unique blend of capabilities could create a near-impenetrable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance network over areas of the battlefield, enabling new levels of situational awareness and data sharing.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 6, 2021",A-10 Warthogs Are About To Operate From A U.S. Highway For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time in recent history, the U.S. Air Force is going to take its aircraft out onto highways in the United States for an exercise. Four A-10C Warthog attack aircraft and a pair of C-146A Wolfhound special operations transports are due to take part in the road-landing drill, which is a part of the wider Exercise Northern Strike. As well as being a unique event in the United States, the upcoming highway deployment reflects the ever-increasing importance of dispersed operations for the U.S. military, including as part of the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment (ACE) initiative. The highway exercise will take place on August 5 and is being run by the Michigan Air National Guard. With the help of the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). A stretch of the Michigan State Highway M-32 near Alpena will be closed off for five hours, as the A-10s and C-146s touch down there. An A-10C from the 107th Fighter Squadron, Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan, conducts close air support training at Grayling Aerial Gunnery Range in Waters, Michigan, in 2019., Master Sgt. Scott Thompson “This is believed to be the first time in history that modern Air Force aircraft have intentionally landed on a civilian roadway on U.S. soil,” said U.S. Air Force Colonel James Rossi, Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center commander. “Our efforts are focused on our ability to train the warfighter in any environment across the continuum so our nation can compete, deter, and win today and tomorrow.” The highway drills will be conducted by the Michigan Air National Guard’s 127th Wing, which flies A-10Cs from Selfridge Air National Guard Base. Also involved is the Air Force’s 355th Wing, which also operates A-10Cs, as well as combat search and rescue assets from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, Finally, there is participation by the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), from Duke Field, Florida, which is responsible for the C-146A, among other platforms. This particular stretch of highway has been chosen due to its proximity to the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center that’s one of the facilities being used for Northern Strike 21-2, described as “one of the National Guard’s largest joint, readiness producing exercises.” The maneuvers will be run out of Michigan’s National All-Domain Warfighting Center (NADWC), a huge training range where sea, land, air, space, and cyber capabilities can all be put to the test. Here, flying assets have around 17,000 square miles of special-use airspace in which to train. For its part, the Michigan Air National Guard will also bring useful expertise to the highway drill, A-10s from the 127th Wing’s 107th Fighter Squadron having operated from austere locations in the past, among them various deployments from highways in Estonia , including as part of the multinational Saber Strike exercise in 2018. An A-10C assigned to the 104th Fighter Squadron, Maryland Air National Guard, takes off for a training mission during Saber Strike 15 from Ämari Air Base, Estonia, in 2015., Air National Guard/Tech. Sgt. Christopher Schepers What’s more, the A-10 was designed to be able to undertake just these kinds of missions as part of its requirement to keep fighting on the Cold War-era battlefield. It’s optimized for short takeoffs and landings and its landing gear boasts low-pressure tires for operating from highways and even rougher non-standard surfaces. While much of its work is cloaked in secrecy, the C-146, which is a militarized Dornier Do 328, is also known to operate from austere locations with some regularity, fulfilling tasks such as discrete movements of special operations forces teams in different hotspots around the world. It is not clear if the two types will be operated independently, or if the C-146s will be used in support of the Warthogs, for example bringing in maintenance personnel and flight-line equipment. In the past, AFSOC MC-130J Commando II special operations tankers have been used to set up forward arming and refueling points (FARPs) for tactical fighters, so this kind of synergy is not altogether new. A C-146A Wolfhound from the 919th Special Operations Wing taxies on the Duke Field flight line., U.S. Air Force/Dan Neely It’s also not clear how much preparation work will need to be done to the highway itself before it accepts these jets, but, as we have explored in the past , standard highway strips sometimes require fairly significant changes to be made, such as removing crash barriers, power lines, signage, and lighting. We do know that to facilitate the exercise, traffic will be detoured, with route signs to help redirect road traffic. The electrical power supply will also be temporarily shut down for residences immediately surrounding the landing area. The highway exercise is certainly in keeping with the Air Force’s emerging operational concepts, especially Agile Combat Employment (ACE), which aims to ensure that airpower can be sustained even without access to regular airbases, which are likely to be high-priority targets for the enemy in any peer conflict, whether in Europe or the Pacific . While both these areas of operation have hosted ACE exercises, sometimes including the use of austere airstrips , practicing for these contingencies in the Continental United States is new. An F-16C assigned to the 555th Fighter Squadron lands during an Agile Combat Employment exercise at Amendola Air Base, Italy, in February this year., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Ericka A. Woolever Interestingly, just last week we reported that the United Kingdom was considering undertaking snap exercises in which its fighter jets operate from civilian airfields and perhaps even stretches of highway. This is all part of a move toward dispersed operations in times of tension, moving precious aircraft away from vulnerable established airbases. For the U.S. Air Force, this kind of approach could also be relevant, especially in Europe and Asia, where aircraft are increasingly concentrated on a small number of sprawling airbases. Other aspects of this year’s Northern Strike exercise also stress some of the tenets of ACE, including the rapid insertion of an Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) into a bare-base environment, testing the ability to move airpower assets rapidly and then set up operations in an unfamiliar setting. In this case, the 127th Wing will deploy from Selfridge ANBG to the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center. An A-10 taking off from Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center with a live AGM-65 Maverick missile, while other jets are loaded with the same weapons on the flight line., U.S. AIR FORCE Once at Alpena, the 127th Wing will “establish logistics and communications in order to receive follow-on forces, generate mission employment including the austere landing on M-32, and project combat power across all domains,” said U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Bryan Teff, Michigan Air National Guard adjutant general for air. “Michigan’s NADWC is uniquely postured to provide ample training airspace and facilities to accommodate training for the future high-end fight,” Teff added. “Michigan is integral to the joint fight and future warfighter. The joint force cannot execute without training as we fight.” While ACE concepts, including highway operations, might be becoming more commonplace across the Air Force, there’s no doubt that having jets land on Michigan State Highway M-32 will be a unique milestone for the service, in the CONUS at least. We will continue to bring coverage of this historic training event once it kicks off next week.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2020",Can The President Order Troops To Get The COVID-19 Vaccine? (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Joe Biden is expected to announce that federal employees will be subject to new rules regarding being vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus tomorrow, but those provisions are reportedly not set to apply to military personnel. At present, the Department of Defense is not mandating uniformed or civilian personnel get one of the available vaccines under established rules that allow individuals to refuse such medications that have not been formally approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The President does have the authority, at the request of the Secretary of Defense, to waive this right to refuse on national security grounds. However, the highly politicized nature of the pandemic means that this would almost certainly be a controversial decision. Reports say that Biden’s new guidelines for federal employees will require them to either get vaccinated or submit to more rigorous routine testing and other measures to mitigate their potential to contract and spread COVID-19. This week, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommended that even Americans that have been vaccinated, but that are living in areas seeing a spike in cases amid the emergence of new strains of the virus, particularly one referred to as the Delta variant , start wearing masks again when indoors. A member of the US Army receives a COVID-19 vaccination., US Army Military personnel will not have to follow these new guidelines, according to reports . However, the U.S. military, roughly 48 percent of which is presently fully vaccinated, including personnel assigned to reserve and National Guard units, with more partially vaccinated, has also adopted new mask rules . The Department of Defense’s new mask guidance, issued on July 28, 2021., DOD “We anticipate that this [the COVID-19 vaccines] will be approved using Emergency Use Authorization [EUA], not a fully-licensed FDA vaccination, and as such, the department’s policy will be voluntary for everyone,” U.S. Army Lieutenant General Ronald Place, the Director of the Defense Health Agency, explained in December 2020 , before Biden’s inauguration . “So there’s no if, ands, or buts about it – doesn’t – doesn’t matter. Voluntary for everyone.” That policy remains in place, though senior U.S. military officials have encouraged servicemembers to get vaccinated. Just in May, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Air Force General John Hyten issued a memo outlining ways to incentivize people to get their shots. The document recommended focusing on four key areas: accessibility, education, personnel policy, and engagement at the lowest level of the chain of command. A Department of Defense memo regarding ways to incentivize personnel to get vaccinated against COVID-19., DOD However, Department of Defense Instruction 6200.02 , titled Application of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Rules to Department of Defense Force Health Protection Programs, says plainly that the Secretary of Defense can ask the President to waive the ability of service members to refuse EUA medications under certain circumstances. “In the event that an EUA granted by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs includes a condition that potential recipients are provided an option to refuse administration of the product, the President may … waive the option to refuse for administration of the medical product to members of the armed forces,” it says. “Such a waiver is allowed if the President determines, in writing, that providing to members of the armed forces an option to refuse is not in the interests of national security. Only the Secretary of Defense may ask the President to grant a waiver of an option to refuse.” “Combatant Commanders, through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other heads of DoD Components may recommend to the Secretary of Defense, through the ASD(HA) [Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs], that the Secretary request a Presidential waiver of an option to refuse administration of an EUA product,” the instruction adds. The section of Department of Defense Instruction 6200.02 outlining the ability of the President, at the request of the Secretary of Defense, to waive the option to refuse EUA medications on national security grounds., DOD At the time of writing, there have been a total of 312,892 confirmed COVID-19 cases across the U.S. military, and 373 fatalities, since the pandemic began, according to the Pentagon . In one particularly infamous instance, an outbreak of the virus sidelined the U.S. Navy supercarrier USS Theodore Roosevelt last year, an incident that subsequently exploded into a political firestorm after the captain of the ship at the time, Brett Crozier, raises serious concerns about the potential danger to his crew, which then leaked to the media. The Delta variant is even more contagious than the strains originally identified and has demonstrated an ability to infect even vaccinated individuals. However, vaccines, so far, have also been credited with limiting the severity of those so-called “breakthrough cases.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=dnMOmsrOoMc All told, it’s not necessarily hard to envision a national security justification for making vaccinations against COVID-19 mandatory. Hicks and Hyten’s memo bluntly states right in the first sentence that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has repeatedly declared the virus to be “the greatest proximate challenge to our Nation’s security.” At the same time, given the political dimension of the pandemic in the United States, it is equally difficult to see how the Biden administration would not court controversy, and potential legal challenges, by making such a decision. Making the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory could be controversial even after they are formally approved by the FDA and the U.S. military has faced such issues in the past, even before the current pandemic. In 1997, President Bill Clinton’s administration made a vaccine against anthrax, which had received limited FDA approval, mandatory across the U.S. military. Members of Congress , as well as the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a congressional watchdog, subsequently raised questions about its efficacy and safety. A formal legal injunction in 2004 halted compulsion anthrax vaccinations in the military. The FDA issued an EUA for the anthrax vaccine in 2005 and re-approved it later that year. The Department of Defense began administrating it again in 2006, but on a more limited basis. At present, FDA-approved vaccines against both anthrax and smallpox are not universally mandatory across the U.S. military. A section of Department of Defense Instruction 6200.02 discussion anthrax and smallpox immunizations. CJCS stands for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. CCDR stands for Combatant Commanders., DOD Biden’s expected exemption of the military from the new vaccine rules, together with Hicks and Hyten’s memo, makes clear that, at least for now, the Department of Defense would prefer to use non-compulsory incentives, rather than mandates to increase vaccination rates across the services. However, there could be growing calls to change that position as time goes on, especially if the Delta variant or new strains continue to present a significant danger to unvaccinated individuals, and even certain people who have gotten their shots. Update 7/29/2021: The Associated Press has reported that the Biden administration has asked the U.S. military to develop a plan to make vaccinations against COVID-19 mandatory. However, details are still limited regarding how it might proceed in doing so. As expected, President Joe Biden rolled out new rules regarding COVID-19 vaccinations, and what unvaccinated individuals will need to do going forward, today, but those rules are not set to apply to members of the U.S. military, at least not yet. There are reports that a vaccine mandate for the U.S. military could be coming soon, but that could likely be tied to formal FDA approval of one or more of the existing vaccination options. Army Times reported earlier this month that a U.S. Army directive had indicated that the FDA could sign off on at least one vaccine by Sept. 1. “I believe that when it’s [a COVID-19 vaccine] formally approved, which we expect pretty soon, we probably will go to that [a mandate], and then that question will kind of be moot,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral John Nowell, the service’s Chief of Naval Personnel, said during an online town hall in June.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2021",Lawmakers Are Skeptical About The Services’ Focus On Next Generation Fighters Over Existing Designs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about potential shortfalls in available fighter jets across the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps in the coming years. Lawmakers on the committee have also expressed worries that potential gaps in fighter capacity across these services could be exacerbated by efforts to scale back purchases of in-production designs in favor of new advanced development programs, primarily the Air Force and Navy’s parallel , but independent Next Generation Air Dominance efforts. The House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces included a request for a new review of “tactical aircraft capability and capacity requirements and forecasted shortfalls” across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps in a report accompanying proposed changes to a draft of the annual defense policy bill, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2022 Fiscal Year that was released on July 28, 2021. The Comptroller General of the United States, who is head of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, will be responsible for getting the final version of this report together no later than April 1, 2022. US Navy F-35C Joint Strike Fighters., USN “The report should assess the extent to which the services’ tactical aircraft acquisition and modernization investment plans, including NGAD efforts, are likely to meet those requirements and address the shortfalls,” the Subcommittee’s report says. “The Comptroller General should, as appropriate, provide the congressional defense committees with periodic briefings on preliminary findings and pertinent information during the compilation and drafting of the final report.” “Despite billions of dollars of investment in developing and acquiring tactical fighter aircraft over many years, the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps will likely continue to face capability and capacity shortfalls over the upcoming decades,” the report adds. “The committee understands that each of the services has begun reevaluating its tactical aircraft force structure requirements and capability needs, with the Air Force and Navy simultaneously planning to heavily invest funding in the upcoming years to develop and field advanced Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) capabilities.” The subcommittee’s report itself does not specify any particular actions that the Departments of the Air Force or the Navy – the latter includes the Marine Corps – have taken that have prompted concerns among lawmakers. However, at a press briefing yesterday, an aide to the committee specifically raised points about the Navy’s plans to stop buying F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and shift focus to NGAD, as well as continued purchases of F-35C Joint Strike Fighters . A Navy F-35C Joint Strike Fighter, at top, flies alongside an F/A-18F Super Hornet, below., USN The service announced last year that it would not buy any more Super Hornets starting in the 2022 Fiscal Year and its budget request for that fiscal cycle, which it released earlier this year, looks to put that plan into action . It is worth noting that the service still expects its carrier air wings to have a mix of F/A-18E/Fs and F-35Cs for the foreseeable future. However, “as it relates to the Navy’s plans to truncate Super Hornet procurement to focus on SLM – their service life modification program for their existing hornets as well as NGAD – if you look at the current execution of their SLM line, they can’t meet their cost or schedule that they’re planning to. They’re trying to put through Hornets within a year time frame at a cost of about $7-8 million; right now the time frame is nearly double that, as well as the cost,” the House Armed Services Committee aide told reporters . “So basically the Navy is not executing their SLM program as they’re currently planning for in the future.” The Navy has around 540 F/A-18E/Fs in service now, in total, and expects to put a significant number of them through a major upgrade program in the coming years that will bring them up to the advanced Block III standard, which you can read more about here . This includes the SLM, which will extend the service life of Block III jets to around 10,000 flight hours, a 50 percent increase over existing Block II aircraft. Other concerns about the progress of the Block III upgrade effort have emerged, as well, including the revelation in January that the Navy was considering removing conformal fuel tanks from the package, despite previously touting them as a key improvement . “We’re aware that the Navy wants to focus more resources and funding on NGAD,” they continued. “But if you recall eight or 10 years ago, they tried to do the same thing when F-35C was in development. They truncated the Super Hornet line to focus more on F-35C, and they found out, as the F-35C kind of struggled, the Navy had to go back to procuring more Super Hornets.” The Navy is and has been aware of the potential for fighter shortfalls, especially with regards to the F-35C. Earlier this month, Rear Admiral Andrew Loiselle, the head of the Air Warfare Division within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, informed members of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces of a plan to increase the size of squadrons flying these jets, a move that is expected to close this gap by 2025. “We are kind of you know scratching our heads on how the Navy moved up their analysis in terms of eliminating their shortfall by about five years,” the subcommittee told reporters yesterday. “One, they didn’t reinstate the 36-aircraft Super Hornets that they were going to procure in ’22, ’23, ’24 [2022, 2023, and 2024 Fiscal Years]. They also took out about 104 aircraft out of their service life modification program.” At the same time, the timeline for the Navy’s NGAD plans remains largely unchanged, the aide added. The service has classified its existing and projected spending on NGAD in its last two budget requests. The last time NGAD-related budget figures were made public, in the Navy’s proposed budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which was released in 2019, the service asked for around $20.7 million in funding and expected to seek approximately $50.5 million, $111.26 million, $255.59 million, and $371.9 million for the program in the next four fiscal cycles, respectively. Concept art Boeing has previously released of a notional future carrier-based manned fighter jet for the US Navy. The Navy has not yet released any artwork of its own regarding any notional fighter designs it might be presently exploring through its NGAD effort., Boeing “We’re cautious about the Navy’s approach to truncate a hot production line while they focus on a new development program. And given the technology they’re trying to integrate into NGAD, it’s probably not going to be any easier than what F-35C was,” the subcommittee aide explained to members of the press yesterday, highlighting a well-known reality that the development, in general, of advanced, stealth combat aircraft has historically been a costly and time-consuming proposition. “So just taking lessons learned from the past, we’re just keeping an eye on how the Navy is going to move forward with trying to manage and mitigate their strike fighter shortfall.” The Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces’ demand that the GAO’s new review of tactical airpower shortfalls also investigate the Air Force’s plans makes clear that its concerns and skepticism are not limited to the Department of the Navy’s efforts, either. The House Armed Services Committee had notably looked to slash the Air Force’s request NGAD budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year in half, though the cut ended up being much smaller. The Air Force ultimately received just under a billion dollars in that fiscal cycle, as well as in the 2021 Fiscal Year, for this project, which has already produced at least one demonstrator airframe of some type. The service is now hoping to get another $1.5 billion in NGAD funding in Fiscal Year 2022. Notional artwork the US Air Force has released in relation to its NGAD program., USAF “I was surprised at how well it’s doing,” Air Force Lieutenant General Clint Hinote, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategy, Integration, and Requirements, told Air Force Magazine earlier this year about the NGAD demonstrator. Hinote also said he had personally shown this aircraft to members of Congress and that they were “at a minimum, fairly impressed.” At the same time, the Air Force, which is in the midst of a major review of its tactical airpower plans, has publicly announced its intention to pursue what has been described as a “ four plus one ” strategy in the coming years. This plan entails consolidated tactical fleets around four core types, the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter , the F-16C/D Viper , the F-15EX Eagle II , and an aircraft developed through NGAD, while also maintaining a number of A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft. The Air Force had also raised the possibility of acquiring examples of a clean-sheet fighter design to replace its F-16C/Ds earlier this year. The Air Force has been trying to start retiring its A-10s for years now, but has been consistently blocked from doing so by Congress, which looks set to stymie those plans again in the 2022 Fiscal Year. The four plus one concept could also accelerate the divestment of the service’s relatively small and often troublesome , but extremely capable fleet of advanced F-22 Raptor stealth fighters . A picture showing examples of the main tactical jets that the US Air Force current operates, front to back, the A-10 Warthog, F-22 Raptor, F-35A Joint Strike Fighter, F-15C Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, and F-16C Viper., USAF Concerns about whether these plans will exacerbate potential fighter shortfalls, especially in the near term, are only compounded by persistent and serious sustainment challenges facing the F-35A fleet, including a recent serious engine shortage that has grounded dozens of these aircraft. The projected costs to operate and maintain these stealth jets have also prompted renewed discussions, including within the Air Force itself, about scaling back future purchases of Joint Strike Fighters and shifting focus to future development efforts, such as NGAD. The House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Readiness has separately demanded that the Comptroller General put together multiple new reports regarding the readiness issues impacting all F-35 variants, including the Navy and Marine Corps F-35B and C models. What conclusions any of these reports ultimately arrive at and what recommendations they make, not to mention how the Air Force, Navy, and Marines implement them, or don’t, remains to be seen. It’s worth noting that the fighter jet shortfall report is due after Congress is likely to have passed the NDAA for the 2022 Fiscal Year and approved the actual defense spending plan, which is almost certainly why members of the House Armed Services Committee want regular updates on what the Comptroller General turns up in the course of its work between now and then. “The committee notes that the tactical fighter aircraft shortfalls facing the military services did not suddenly appear. As far back as 2010, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted in its report ( GAO-10-789 ) that the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps were projecting tactical fighter aircraft shortfalls beginning in the 2020 timeframe,” the subcommittee report points out. “GAO concluded that the services needed to gain a clearer and more comprehensive portfolio-level understanding of their tactical fighter aircraft requirements and forecasted shortfalls in order to ensure that they made well-informed tactical fighter aircraft acquisition investment decisions.” All of this, of course, also comes as the U.S. military as a whole has been working to reorient itself to be better positioned to conduct higher-end operations, including against potential near-peer opponents, especially China . Robust and advanced tactical airpower capabilities, and the capacity to bring them to bear on a broad scape, would be key components in any such future conflict. At the same time, there are also questions about exactly how relevant fighter jet-type aircraft, which generally have relatively limited range capabilities , might be in such contingencies, especially those requiring them to fly across extended distances, particularly in the Pacific region. How GAO assesses the issue of current and future fighter shortfalls across the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, as well as what they might be to doing to mitigate them, could still have significant impacts on their future tactical airpower plans.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly a year after the first sighting by airliners and multiple FAA and FBI investigations , the “Jetpack Man” continues to appear to aircraft flying around the Los Angeles area and especially to airliners on final to Los Angeles International. The latest occurrence, which was first reported by ABC7 , happened at around 6:15 PM this evening in its most usual spot, right off the final approach to LAX. The ATC audio was quite lively following the spotting, although it is bizarre how much more familiar the situation seemed than it did a year ago. The exchanges include asking if the pilots saw “the UFO” and what appears to be a new trend of referring to LA’s mystery Jetpack Man as “Iron Man.” You can also tell the pilot who called it in, a 747 pilot, knew he had to, but really didn’t seem too excited about the circus that would go with it. Check out the exchanges for yourself below (audio via the awesome folks at ATCLive.net ): If you told me a year ago that I would have produced six stories on this crazy deal without any sort of closure, I would never have believed you. But these are strange times . So strange, in fact, that pilot reports of a Jetpack Man flying around one of the world’s busiest airports really doesn’t seem all that jarring anymore. Regardless, one thing is becoming quite evident—something really is going on. It is getting very hard to discount these encounters as a fluke or some errant trick of the light. There is something around LAX that is capable of flight that looks like a dude in a jetpack. Maybe it’s a balloon or a drone (make sure to read this before rolling your eyes! ), but it is flying where it shouldn’t, including apparently pretty far out over the water . So someone has to be behind it. We will update this story when more information comes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 16, 2021",Watch This C-17 Make A Bonkers “Tactical Departure” From Portland International Airport (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The C-17 is just about as visceral a manifestation of design tradeoffs between payload, speed, range, and short-field performance as one can imagine. The “Moose” is also the backbone of America’s strategic airlift capabilities, with roughly 222 in service. With the production line shuttered for years , there won’t likely be any more of them, either. Considering these big jets have to get in and out of airports, and even austere landing strips, surrounded by potentially hostile foes , minimizing exposure to enemy fire is key. Hence the use of short field ‘tactical departures,’ which appears, at least to our eyes, to be what a C-17 executed on Wednesday out of Portland International Airport. The dramatic takeoff occurred at the beginning of a mission where it acted as prey for the 142nd Fighter Wing’s F-15C/Ds that sit quick reaction alert. Aviation photographer Sean Phillips, who goes by the handle @big_seans_aviation on Instagram , caught the non-standard departure off PDX’s runway 28R on July 21. As you can see below, the McChord AFB-based C-17 makes an abrupt pull-up off the runway after a very short ground roll, before quickly leveling out. It then flies flat out down the runway at low level, rapidly gaining speed, and then enters into a steep climb at the end of the runway. The C-17 then levels out after climbing a couple of thousand feet into the air and proceeds to head out to be intercepted by the Eagles , according to Phillips. We provided the video on youtube as well as Instagram as some have trouble loading the Instagram video: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sean Phillips (@big_seans_aviation) Once again, it looks to us like we are seeing a short-field tactical departure-like maneuver here. As noted, such operations can be critical to the survival of the aircraft in war zones. In fact, they can also be useful here at home. Air Force One famously executed a very similar maneuver when leaving Sarasota Airport into the unknown on September 11th, 2001. If anything, this awesome video is another reminder that the big C-17 is actually a remarkably nimble beast. We have reached out to some of our C-17 friends for more information (see update at the bottom of the article!).

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 29, 2021",C-17 Pilot Who Made That Intense Takeoff From Portland Explains The Maneuver,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last week we posted a story about a video showing a C-17A Globemaster III making a uniquely impressive departure from Portland International Airport before being chased down by resident 123rd Fighter Squadron alert F-15s for training. The video came to us from our friend @big_seans_aviation and drew a lot of interest. At the time we speculated that the crazy-looking takeoff was practice for executing short-field tactical departures in hostile areas. Now the pilot who was actually at the controls has given us unique insights into exactly what we are seeing in the dramatic video. Lt. Col. Bruce Cohn, a C-17 Instructor Pilot with the 97th Airlift Squadron out of McChord Field, located just outside of Tacoma, Washington, told The War Zone the following about the high-performance takeoff in question: In the video you’re seeing a combination of two takeoff capabilities of the C-17. First, you’ll notice that the aircraft rotates well before the A3 taxiway on runway 28R, resulting in a takeoff distance of less than 2500 feet – demonstrating the short field takeoff capability of the C-17. Secondly, you can see that we level off just above the runway, accelerate and then initiate a short but steep climb prior to the departure end. This is a demonstration of a low altitude tactical departure, used for negating a small arms threat near an airfield. This is one of several types of tactical departures C-17 pilots are trained to perform. The type of tactical departure used is dependent upon the threat the crew is defending against. Tactical departures such as this one were used regularly in Afghanistan and Iraq. Like most flight events, there is a training currency associated with this one. C-17 pilots must log a minimum of 2 tactical departures every 6 months. It sounds like our original assessment was pretty spot on, but this adds a lot of great detail. Cohn also described the unique relationship between his unit at McChord and Portland’s Eagle squadron, as well as what it’s like being intercepted by them for training: The partnership between the Redhawks (123rd Fighter Squadron) and the three Reserve C-17 squadrons (446th Operations Group) at McChord is a home-grown collaboration that has been superb. The F-15s have a multitude of training requirements that go with their alert commitment and with the C-17 we are able to provide a platform that can mimic various targets of interest for them. On our end, the ability to take part in tactical scenarios with friendly escorts (Blue Air) and be targeted by hostile fighters (Red Air) is invaluable to our training and preparation for future encounters. The proximity and capabilities of our squadrons make this partnership something we plan to continue and build upon. The Redhawks are outstanding hosts! Obviously flying and mixing it up with the F-15s is great training but it’s also a lot of fun too. So, if you live in the Portland area don’t be surprised to see a McChord C-17 show up from time to time. So there you have it, straight from the C-17 Instructor Pilot’s mouth!

Brett Tingley and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 26, 2022",Navy’s New Jamming Pods For EA-18G Growler Eyed For Air Force Fighters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States Air Force could be regaining the ability to conduct electronic warfare operations with its own tactical aircraft. A proposal before the House Armed Services Committee, if approved, would require the Air Force to determine whether or not it could integrate variants of the Next Generation Jammer family of electronic warfare systems aboard its platforms, greatly expanding the Air Force’s capabilities in this regard in support of larger missions and operations. While the Air Force is currently exploring a wide range of electronic warfare systems that are primarily defensive in nature , the capability set offered by the Next Generation Jammers could give the USAF a true tactical electronic attack aircraft, something it presently lacks. In a House Armed Services Committee (HASC) press release issued on July 28, 2021, the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces announced a proposal to include a provision in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would require “an assessment of Air Force airborne electronic attack capabilities and the feasibility of integrating the ALQ-249 Next Generation Jammer on Air Force tactical aircraft.” A Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band (NGJ-MB) Engineering Development Model pod seen after arriving at Naval Air Station Patuxent River for testing., USN/Liz Wolter As we’ve previously reported , the NGJ family isn’t actually one pod, but three: a low-band one, mid-band one, and a proposed high-band one. The Mid-Band version, or NGJ-MB, also designed the AN/ALQ-249(V)1, and the Low-band version, or NGJ-LB, are currently in development. The Department of Defense, through the U.S. Navy, has been leading the developing the pods alongside the Australian Ministry of Defence. In July 2021, Raytheon was awarded a $171 million contract to begin producing an initial run of production NGJ-MB units to be completed in October 2023. It’s unclear which version of the pod is being proposed by the HASC for use aboard USAF aircraft, but since the MB and LB pods work in tandem, any proposed integration plan could likely include both. The Navy’s EA-18G Growler is already slated to receive both pods . A graphic illustrating how the EA-18G can operate as an escort flying safely outside of the known range of enemy surface-to-air missiles while jamming enemy air defenses alongside other attack aircraft and EW assets., GAO Raytheon describes the capabilities of the NGJ-MB on their website, stating the jammer “offensively denies, disrupts and degrades enemy technology, including air-defense systems and communications” and uses “the latest digital, software-based and Active Electronically Scanned Array technologies” in order to “non-kinetically attack significantly more targets and at greater distances.” Raytheon’s product page adds that the NGJ-MB can attack multiple targets simultaneously, be rapidly upgraded through a modular architecture, and can be scaled to fit a variety of missions and platforms. You can read all about the pods and their capabilities in this prior reporting of ours. The Air Force currently operates a small fleet of its aging EC-130H Compass Call aircraft which have a relatively wide array of EW capabilities, but that platform is a high-demand, low-density asset and is not meant for contested airspace. The USAF hasn’t had a dedicated electronic attack jet since it retired the EF-111A Raven, or “Spark Vark” in 1998. Since then, the Navy alone has provided that capability with its EA-18G “Growler” aircraft, having itself retired the EA-6B Prowler in 2019. An EA-18G Growler carrying NGJ pod., USN There is also the possibility that the USAF does have stealthy drones capable of penetrating denied airspace and conducting electronic attacks . The concept has been discussed for years, but rapidly maturing unmanned technology, and even the disclosure of platforms that could host such a mission set , have made the capability all more attainable. Just over 10 years ago, a ‘penetrating stand-in airborne electronic attack’ capability was openly referred to as a key underway initiative. Since then, references to it have gone dark. But even if the type does exist, it wouldn’t be in significant numbers. Obviously, their clandestine nature would limit their use and deployability, as well. A 2010 USAF slide stating the need for a Penetrating Stand-In Airborne Electronic Attack (P-AEA) platform over a decade ago., USAF Those unknowns aside, it’s clear the Air Force has a gap here. Due to its lack of a dedicated tactical EW jet platform, the USAF has previously sent some of its pilots to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in order to train them on electronic attack systems and concepts, and the capabilities of the EA-18G in particular. As part of current efforts to expand EW support, NAS Whidbey Island recently built a facility devoted exclusively to testing, maintenance, storage, and shipping of NGJ pods. The language that HASC is looking to include in the 2022 Fiscal Year NDAA wouldn’t require the Air Force to consider any particular platforms to integrate NGJ pods onto, but the F-15EX would seem to be the most logical platform given its payload capacity and performance capabilities , and there have already been developments in terms of expanding the Eagle II’s own EW capabilities . These aircraft will already feature the Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS), an extremely capable and expandable electronic warfare and electronic support measures suite. You can read all about EPAWSS here . F-15EX., USAF The F-15EX’s future, in terms of capabilities, is largely undefined, but that is going to change as an open call exists for industry to come up with possibilities to leverage its unique abilities and open architecture systems. Adding a high-end jamming support capability would be quite an attractive and relevant option. It’s possible the NGJ pods could eventually be integrated into the EPAWSS system, but that is uncertain at this time. It’s also worth noting that F-15E is getting EPAWSS too, so it could potentially be tapped to employ the NGJ variants, as well. Exploded view of the NGJ-MB pod., USN The development of the NGJ series comes as the DOD has been working towards developing more capable EW systems for its tactical aircraft in response to new air defense systems and improved sensors developed by near-peer opponents. Potential high-end conflicts against advanced adversaries such as Russia or China would test the EW capabilities of U.S. air assets. Existing stealthy aircraft will increasingly rely on additional standoff jamming support for their survival in very high-threat environments. Even the F-117, which was something totally new for its time, relied heavily on external EW support. The one time it wasn’t there, one was shot down . As such, you can see how clawing back organic electronic attack capabilities would be quite attractive for the USAF. The Navy will have its hands full in the next conflict, especially one in the Pacific where the battlespace will be massive and far less centralized than in past operations. As such, being able to increase electronic attack capacity and distribute it more evenly throughout the services, and the future battlespace, will be key. The reality is that the type of jamming offered by the Next Generation Jammer is just one facet in what a complex EW ecosystem that features a wide variety of EW capabilities , from small drones acting as stand-in jammers to increasingly capable EW-enabled towed decoys and even ground systems meant to jam enemy satellites . Even having some of these EW assets work together cooperatively via networking represents a quantum leap in capability that is far more than the sum of its parts. If the HASC committee proposal is approved, the addition of the NGJ would greatly expand the Air Force’s ability to carry out electronic warfare missions and potentially expand the role of the F-15EX, and possibly even the existing F-15E Strike Eagle . In the increasingly complex electronic warfare-enabled battlefield of today, these capabilities can have a huge impact on whether battles are won or lost.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 29, 2021",The First XQ-58A Valkyrie Is Already Headed To A Museum (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first of the U.S. Air Force’s XQ-58A Valkyrie stealthy, affordable unmanned aircraft is being prepared as a museum exhibit, after completing its flight-test career after just four public missions. Originally developed by drone-maker Kratos under the Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology program, or LCAAT, the XQ-58A in question suffered a mishap in late 2019 while completing its third flight, but was subsequently repaired and flew again. The Air Force Research Laboratory, or AFRL, which developed the XQ-58A together with Kratos, announced yesterday that Valkyrie serial number 15-8001, which took its first flight in March 2019, is now headed to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. Preparations to transfer “Tail Number 1” to the museum were underway as of last month and the press release suggests it may already be there, albeit not yet on display. The first XQ-58A Valkyrie demonstrator, serial number 15-8001., U.S. Air Force “Kratos manufactured this aircraft and AFRL conducted flight tests with it four times,” explained Dave Hart, the chief engineer for the Autonomous Collaborative Platforms program, in an Air Force press release. “Transferring it to the Air Force Museum helps to show the world what AFRL is capable of, and it truly tells the AFRL story.” “The XQ-58A Valkyrie represents a sea of change in the way the Air Force can approach the design, development, production, and operation of unmanned aircraft,” added Steve Fendley, the President of Kratos Unmanned Systems Division. “The Valkyrie is the first Department of Defense aircraft system to break the historical cost per weight parametric, and it is the first UAV designed to operate with fourth and fifth-generation manned aircraft.” The same press release also notes the collaborative nature of the XQ-58A program so far, pointing out that AFRL’s Aerospace Systems Directorate was responsible for “critical turbine inlet integration, structural testing, and evaluation of the XQ-58A’s electrical and control subsystems.” Kratos designed, built, and demonstrated the first XQ-58A with only two and a half years between contract award and first flight, with this rapid prototyping effort being a fundamental aspect of the program, at least at the outset. The manufacturer describes the first of the 30-foot-long XQ-58A drones as “a pre-production system with substantial operational capability, not simply a proof-of-concept flight demonstrator.” The second flight of the initial XQ-58A, on June 11, 2019., U.S. Air Force/2nd Lt. Randolph Abaya After suffering damage in a crash landing in October 2019, 15-8001 was repaired and returned to the air the following January, for a fourth flight, although it’s not understood to have flown again after that. It should be pointed out, however, that there’s no sign that the accident contributed to the drone’s very brief flight-test career. In just four flights, 15-8001 has provided data for the LCAAT program, which has, in turn, helped inform the Skyborg project , an initiative that’s working to develop the technologies required for semi-autonomous “ loyal wingman ” type drones and, ultimately, pave the way to fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). Kratos is one of three companies now working to build a prototype drone that will be equipped with Skyborg systems and one of its UTAP-22 drones has already been used as a testbed for Skyborg. Whether directly related or not, the fact that it’s now been determined that the first XQ-58A will no longer be a part of the LCAAT program or other test work might even speak to the fact that the drone was always at the core of the Air Force’s work on attritable platforms. Essentially, drones that are low-cost enough that they can be employed in high-risk situations that might preclude the use of a more costly asset. In the case of the XQ-58A, Kratos has in the past mentioned a unit cost of around $2 million, under full-rate production. At the same time, the XQ-58A fleet at large has rapidly racked up important milestones. https://youtube.com/watch?v=QJV_yMIKM1g The second of these drones, 15-8002, has been used to explore attritable drone concepts of operation, as well as a testbed for new communications gateways to help different stealthy aircraft “talk” to each other. Meanwhile, the third, 15-8003, was used for the first stores release from the drone’s internal payload bay, dropping an example of the much smaller ALTIUS-600 drone during a flight at the U.S. Army’s Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, in March this year. That was only the sixth flight in total for the XQ-58A program and you can read more about its implications here . At the same time, the XQ-58A fleet has been used to expand the type’s operating envelope, flying increasingly faster and higher, while Kratos is engaged in building at least another nine Valkyries. The third XQ-58A demonstrates the separation of the ALTIUS-600 small unmanned aircraft system in a test in March., U.S. Air Force In the past, The War Zone has looked at the kinds of missions that a production version of the XQ-58A, or a further evolved stealthy, attritable drone might perform. As well as flying more hazardous sorties, such as those pertaining to electronic warfare, or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), within contested airspace, there is scope for the drones to work as loyal wingmen or even as networked swarms in a host of other scenarios. They could even be used as advanced cruise missiles. With the ability to launch payloads including other drones, the scope of its potential missions is increased even further. It’s also worth noting that the XQ-58A is being developed to be runway independent, further boosting the utility of any future production versions of the drone. Kratos has, in the past, shown a model of a launcher for the Valkyrie that can be accommodated inside a standard shipping container. That would make the drone even more suitable for distributed operations of the kind that are growing in importance under the Pentagon’s emerging warfighting strategy . As already noted, the Valkyrie was designed from the outset to be a low-cost yet advanced drone, ensuring that, in the future, unmanned loyal wingmen can not only venture into more hostile environments from which they may well not return but also serve to increase the “mass” brought to bear on a potential enemy. This would be especially important when drones are being used to overwhelm or confuse hostile air defenses, for example. With that in mind, it’s perhaps fitting that the first of the XQ-58As — representing what could well be a paradigm shift in air combat — will now see out its days on public display at the National Air Force Museum. Update, 14:30 pm PST: A tweet from Aviation Week Defense Editor Steve Trimble confirms that the retirement of the first XQ-58A Valkyrie drone to a museum was, for the most part, a result of its baked-in attritable nature. Trimble provides an email correspondence with an Air Force public affairs officer that he received today, in which they explain that the decision was taken not to spend any more on the first XQ-58A, since “extensive upgrades or repairs” are not applicable to these kinds of attritable platforms. In contrast to the AFRL press release, the PAO said the first XQ-58A only ever completed three flights, being retired after its crash landing in October 2019. Total flight time was around three hours and, in all, the three Valkyries have now completed seven flights. The correspondence concludes with confirmation that the XQ-58A is due to begin Skyborg-related test flights later this year and in 2022.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 17, 2022",What It Takes For U.S. Jets To Keep Fighting In Afghanistan From “Over The Horizon”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the Taliban continues to make significant gains against government security forces in Afghanistan, the U.S. military has indicated that it will continue to support the latter with airstrikes indefinitely, despite previously saying it would halt these operations by the end of August. However, the ongoing drawdown of American forces in the country, which has included completely vacating major air bases , has raised questions about how difficult it may be to provide robust and persistent airpower from “ over the horizon .” Now, an official U.S. Air Force news item has offered specific details about the significant logistical hurdles to carrying out such strikes going forward. In April, approximately half of the 494th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, which flies F-15E Strike Eagles , deployed from an “undisclosed location” to Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates with the help of KC-10A Extender aerial refueling tankers from the 908th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron. The undisclosed location that the F-15Es deployed from is almost certainly Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan, which has hosted rotating contingents of Strike Eagles for years. An F-15E Strike Eagle assigned to the 494th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates earlier this year., USAF The purpose of this movement was to “support the Resolute Support mission set and improve the defensive posture in the Arabian Peninsula,” U.S. Air Force Captain Trey Pollard, an F-15E fighter weapons systems officer with the 494th said in a statement . Resolute Support is the official name of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan. It also served to “highlight the 494th’s ability to project power forward into the AOR [area of responsibility] utilizing the Agile Combat Employment concept,” Pollard added. This is hardly the first time that KC-10As, which have a significant, if often unappreciated secondary cargo-carrying capability , have been used to facilitate rapid movements of aircraft, as well as associated ground personnel and materiel, between bases in the Middle East. The Air Force has been working to make these kinds of missions, broadly, more routine as part of the Agile Combat Employment (ACE) concept. ACE is heavily focused on ways to increase flexibility and reduce predictability , with a particular eye toward helping to limit vulnerability to enemy attacks on established bases during operations. “Without the KC-10 to help, they were hard pressed to make the trip all in one go,” Air Force Major Austin Bentley, an operations officer with the 908th, explained in a separate statement . “They would have had to load the cargo and passengers on another grey tail [another cargo aircraft] to get the equipment and maintainers and ground personnel back, and would need a KC-135 , or even two, to get enough gas to the fighters to make the trip.” A KC-10A takes off from Al Dhafra Air Base., USAF Bentley’s comments underscore the general framing of the Air Force news item about this deployment of F-15Es to Al Dhafra, which lasted 66 days in total, as an example of the value the 908th’s KC-10As offer, specifically, and of the operational benefits that the ACE concept provides. The highlighting of the Extender’s capabilities is somewhat interesting given that the Air Force began retiring these aircraft , which first entered service in the 1980s, last year. Beyond that, the details about the operations the 494th’s F-15Es carried out over Afghanistan with the support of those tankers show just how complicated it is to launch strikes in Afghanistan from other existing bases of operation in the region. “We support dragging the fighters stationed at ADAB into country and remain with them as a dedicated tanker, or we fly into country and support specific tanker contracts with the F-15s from other bases to ensure they can accomplish their mission without divert,” Bentley explained. “Dragging” refers to tankers flying with contingents of other aircraft, typical combat jets, to a destination, refueling them at multiple points along the way. The most direct route between Al Dhafra and Afghanistan that is available to American combat aircraft involves flying out over the Gulf of Oman and into the North Arabian Sea, before turning north, traveling first over Pakistan. It’s a round trip that’s easily over 2,000 miles long, regardless of where in Afghanistan the aircraft are actually headed. A map showing the general locations of Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan, to the west, and Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, in the center, in relationship to Afghanistan in the east., Google Maps All of this limits the amount of time aircraft can remain on station and creates the potential for lag between when a request for air support is received and when strikes actually occur, something that could be a matter of life and death during a firefight . It also limits the ability to respond to other kinds of time-sensitive tasking and negatively impacts the ability to provide any sort of persistent air support coverage across the entire country. The overall distance increases the potential for serious fatigue, especially for the crews of single and two-seat combat jets. Those pilots and back-seaters are stuck in their ejection seats with, at best, limited options to even go to the bathroom , which can impact operational effectiveness. Flying these grueling missions on a regular basis also increases the strain on the aircraft themselves. All of this is important to consider in the context of discussion not only whether or not the U.S. military will continue to provide air support to Afghan government security forces for the foreseeable future, but what any such air support will actually look like. “I’m just not going to be able to comment about the future of U.S. airstrikes after Aug. 31,” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), who is now also the top officer directly in charge of American operations in Afghanistan, told reporters at a press conference after meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul on July 25. “For the days and weeks ahead, we will continue with our airstrikes in support of our Afghan partners, and that’s all I’ll be able to give you.” Just today, McKenzie said that the U.S. military had stepped up airstrikes in Afghanistan, but offered no new update on plans to continue those operations after Aug. 31. More than a dozen American strikes were carried out using manned and unmanned aircraft in the past week, according to the Associated Press . It’s worth noting that this is a very small number of strikes compared to peak periods of U.S. air activity over Afghanistan in the course of the past two decades or so of operations in the country. Regardless, the realities that the 494th’s F-15Es faced when conducting operations over Afghanistan from Al Dhafra earlier this year may, at least in part, help explain why the majority of U.S. airstrikes in the country in the past month or so appear to have been carried out by unmanned aircraft. While it’s unclear where they have been flying from to conduct operations over Afghanistan, many drones, such as the MQ-9 Reaper , have the ability to remain on station for very long periods of time with operators on the ground, likely thousands of miles away, working in shifts. “Over the past 30 days, the U.S. military has launched about 10 airstrikes in Afghanistan, mostly with drones rather than fixed-wing aircraft,” according to a report from Task & Purpose that was published on July 24. Of the sorties carried out by fixed-wing aircraft in that same time frame, it is likely that a significant number were conducted by B-52H bombers flying from the Persian Gulf region. As of May, there were six of these aircraft deployed to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. In the past week, video and pictures have emerged online purportedly showing B-52Hs flying low enough over Kabul and Kandahar to be plainly visible, potentially with the hope of also having a deterrent effect . B-52Hs, which have much greater range and payload capacity than combat jets like the F-15E, have been employed over Afghanistan on many occasions over the past two decades , generally flying in from the Persian Gulf. They’ve even made marathon flights to the skies over the country from the island of Diego Garcia more than 2,500 miles away in the Indian Ocean B-1Bs were also heavily employed in the past for the same reasons. Both of these bombers can also loiter over a portion of the battlefield for longer periods than smaller jets, but they still have to make the same lengthy trek to and from forward bases before and after missions. There has been discussion about U.S. military forces potentially operating from bases in neighboring countries after the completion of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which could allow aircraft to be positioned closer to the ongoing fighting. However, Pakistani officials have publicly stated that they have no intention of hosting American troops, and countries in Central Asia, so far, seem disinclined to assist, as well. Earlier this month, Russia, which has significant influence in that region, publicly warned against the deployment of U.S. military personnel to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. A more recent unconfirmed Russian media report has suggested the Kremlin might have quietly changed its position amid growing concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan. In addition, despite laudatory statements about the abilities of Afghan government security forces, there are significant concerns about the ability of the Afghan Air Force to help fill any resulting gap in close air support and strike capacity after Aug. 31. Last week, a group of Afghan lawmakers said that a third of all of the aircraft in the country’s air arm was non-flyable and that it had completely run out of laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets, a very capable low-cost precision-guided munition . A lack of precision-guided munitions available to the Afghan Air Force could be one of many factors contributing to a significant rise in reported civilian casualties in Afghanistan. After two decades of American and other foreign assistance, the Afghan Air Force remains heavily reliant on foreign contractors for maintenance and logistics, as well as training support. The departure of a significant number of those contractors has reportedly led to at least some maintenance training being conducted remotely , via Zoom calls. On top of that, the Taliban have been actively pursuing a campaign of assassinating Afghan pilots with a clear goal of hampering the government’s ability to conduct air operations of any kind. All of this has prompted questions about whether the Afghan Air Force has sufficient pilots and other personnel to operate and maintain what aircraft it has that are flyable, especially as new planes and helicopters are being delivered. “We have the pilots, the maintainers, but we … need the support, continuous support to continue the mission,” an Afghan official told Reuters earlier this month. There’s also the matter of coordination between American forces flying in from outside the country and Afghan forces on the ground, who won’t have embedded U.S. advisors or otherwise be paired up with U.S. troops. Efforts have been made over the years to try to train more Afghan troops on the ground to be better able to direct airstrikes. Conducting strikes without being able to closely communicate with Afghan personnel down below could be dangerous, if not deadly to both those forces or innocent bystanders . It will also lead to less effective implementation of close air support. Airstrikes were key to the ousting of the Taliban from power following the initial U.S.-led intervention in the country in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. American warplanes subsequently became essential to keeping that group at bay. The U.S. military had until very recently continued to meet the vast majority of aerial combat capacity demands, as well as provide the ability to project that power on a persistent basis across the entire country, day or night . As such, all of this can only raise additional concerns about the future of Afghanistan’s central government. “A significant amount of territory has been seized over the course of six, eight, 10 months by the Taliban, so momentum appears to be — strategic momentum appears to be — sort of with the Taliban,” U.S. Army General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters last week , though he pushed back at the idea that a Taliban takeover of Kabul was inevitable. American airstrikes, or the lack thereof, are likely to be an important factor in whether the Taliban can maintain that momentum going forward. Having to carry out those missions from very far “over the horizon” will only further affect the impact that they will have on this new stage of the conflict in Afghanistan.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 20, 2021",General Atomics Unveils New “LongShot” Aircraft-Launched Air-To-Air Combat Drone Rendering,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, or GA-ASI, has revealed for the first time an artist’s impression of a missile-carrying air-to-air combat drone that it is developing as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s LongShot program . GA-ASI, as well as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman , is working on this project, which calls for an unmanned aircraft that can be launched in mid-air from a manned aircraft before flying into potentially more hazardous environments and engaging aerial threats using its own missiles. The latest artwork, seen at the top of this article and initially revealed in a recent article on the GA-ASI website about small unmanned aircraft systems , or SUAS, shows a stealthy-looking drone with a prominent chine around the center of its fuselage, the line tapering to meet a high-mounted fixed wing that apparently has only moderate sweep. There is a prominent V-shaped tail and we can see a weapons bay on the side of the rear fuselage, with two doors, but it’s not clear if there’s a symmetrical one on the opposite side. A previous DARPA concept showing one LongShot concept. , DARPA It’s hard to gauge the size of GA-ASI LongShot, although it’s clearly big enough to accommodate radar-guided air-to-air missiles, including what appears to be an AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile , or AMRAAM. With that in mind, it’s notable that the LongShot concept artwork from DARPA and Northrop Grumman both showed what appeared to be new, smaller-sized AAM designs . Various panels around the airframe could be meant to represent conformal antennas for onboard sensors, but it is hard to say for sure. The powerplant cannot be immediately determined, but it would appear to be a rear-mounted turbine. This would reflect DARPA’s own LongShot concept art , showing a stealthy cruise missile-like vehicle, with pop-out fins. Overall, however, both the GA-ASI and Northrop Grumman LongShot concepts depict drones that are much more “aircraft-like” than the DARPA artwork, which seemed to have more in common with a cruise missile or remote carrier. GA-ASI also provides more details about how the company expects the LongShot to be employed in combat, describing a “small system” that “will help clear the way through the skies,” and that will “charge into hostile airspace armed with its own air-to-air missiles, able to fire on enemy targets if it were so commanded.” “It could initiate a fighter sweep ahead of a strike wave without putting a human crew in danger, or it could join an attack alongside the vanguard with human-crewed warplanes.” All this certainly fits in with our understanding of the LongShot thus far, as a means of extending the reach of the launch platform in aerial combat, while also reduce its vulnerability to hostile aircraft or air defenses. Northrop Grumman’s LongShot concept, revealed earlier this year., Northrop Grumman The company mentions that LongShot could be launched from either a manned aircraft or from a larger drone and that one option would be for it to be carried by bombers, providing them with a “potent new anti-air capability.” In the bomber-launched scenario, the LongShot is described as being launched after “allied battle networks” detect hostile fighters, rather than its launch necessarily being commanded based on what the bomber’s own sensors ‘see.’ In this way, the LongShot would stand in for a manned fighter escort, protecting the bomber and allowing fighters to be tasked with other missions. While adding LongShot to legacy bombers, such as the B-52H , is a clear goal, also integrating it with the upcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber , and making it so that it can fit in its weapons bay, would also be very beneficial. The Air Force has already talked about its forthcoming B-21 as potentially having air-to-air capabilities , but exactly in what manner remains undisclosed. One option could be the use of a counter-air drone system like LongShot. The Raider will have optionally manned capabilities , which could also be leveraged if it were to be employed as a possible LongShot launch platform. The most recent concept art of the B-21 Raider., USAF The LongShot program is still relatively new, DARPA only having announced the contract awards back in February, after it had been included in the Pentagon’s budget request for the Fiscal Year 2021. Before that, however, there was also work on the Flying Missile Rail (FMR) program, which aimed to explore similar technologies, with a separate focus on advanced manufacturing and rapid prototyping concepts. The LongShot entry from the 2021 Fiscal Year budget request., DOD As for LongShot, there remain many question marks around it, not least of which is what kinds of air-to-air missiles will arm it. It’s conceivable that the drone might be capable of carrying the long-range AIM-260 that is now under joint development by the Air Force and Navy, and/or a smaller-sized design like the Lockheed Martin Cuda or Raytheon Peregrine , which should allow a greater quantity of weapons to be carried, as well as the AIM-120. Considering another aircraft has to carry LongShot, size and weight will certainly be a factor, so limiting its ability to carry larger weapons may be a necessity. Regardless, the idea is that an AAM can be combined with the standoff LongShot to engage targets not only much further away from the manned aircraft or drone that launched it but also to counter different threats from a variety of vectors and leverage new and more deadly cooperative tactics. As we have discussed before , the fact that the LongShot can launch a missile closer to the target means the weapon retains a high level of energy, making it harder for the target aircraft to escape. Having these hard-to-detect systems flying in a counter-air role will also greatly complicate the enemy’s ability to defend themselves in an aerial engagement. One can imagine how it could give an aircraft like the F-15EX a massive capability boost, with the jet working as a ‘quarterback,’ as well as a sensor and communications node, with the LongShots heading into more deeply defended territory to take out enemy aircraft. Concept art of the Long Range Engagement Weapon, or LREW, another advanced air-to-air weapon program that Raytheon has been working on., DOD How the LongShot will actually cue its missiles onto a target remains unclear, but it’s highly probable that datalinks would provide targeting data, either supplied from the launch aircraft/drone, or from a wide variety of sensor-equipped platforms. On the other hand, the artwork at least does raise the possibility that the LongShot could be equipped to carry some kind of sensors of its known, but there is no confirmation of this. All in all, LongShot seems to offer a variety of options to enhance the air combat capabilities of manned and unmanned aircraft alike, potentially with a comparatively low price tag, although so far we don’t know to what degree it’s expected to be attritable, or if, like some of GA-ASI’s other SUAS concepts , it’s actually expected to be recovered and reused. Whatever the case, the program certainly has momentum behind it, at least for now, and GA-ASI’s latest artwork provides a glimpse into exactly what this intriguing concept could look like.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 25, 2020",This Is Our First Look At How General Atomics’ Sparrowhawk Drone Will Get Caught In Mid-Air,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly a year after unveiling its Sparrowhawk unmanned aircraft , General Atomics has given us the first look at how this drone is designed to be recovered in flight. The company has also offered other details about the expected performance and capabilities of the Sparrowhawk, which is also intended to be air-launched from larger aircraft, including unmanned platforms, such as the MQ-9 Reaper . General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., or GA-ASI, recently released a detailed look at Sparrowhawk and the current state of its development, along with an accompanying promotional video , as part of a larger overview of various advanced unmanned projects the company is pursuing. The firm had first publicly disclosed the existence of Sparrowhawk in September 2020. A rendering of a Sparrowhawk drone in the middle of the process of being recovered in mid-air., GA-ASI capture “GA-ASI has developed one game-changing SUAS [small unmanned aircraft system] known as Sparrowhawk, which an aircraft such as the MQ-9 can carry under its wing as it might a traditional payload like a sensor pod or a fuel tank,” the company’s official news item says. “But when the MQ-9 reaches an area of interest on a mission, it can do something few remotely operated aircraft have ever done – launch the smaller UAS and then recover it in mid-flight.” “The Sparrowhawk might surveil an area and turn back to rendezvous with the aircraft that launched it,” it continues. “In a safe area, well away from hostile warplanes or anti-air systems, the larger UAS can snatch the Sparrowhawk out of the sky and continue its mission.” The official video includes a computed generated sequence showing how this recovery process is supposed to occur. The mothership aircraft, an MQ-9B Skyguardian is depicted in this case, deploys a relatively thin line with an orange-colored sphere at the end of it. The Sparrowhawk then approaches the line, “catching” it in the joint between the front of its left wing and its body. You can watch the full GA-ASI Sparrowhawk video presentation here . A flap that opens outward from the left side of the drone’s body helps steady the line. With the line in this position, a second flap in front of the first one then opens, and the unmanned aircraft banks slightly to the left. The orange ball at the end of the line gets caught between the two flaps, which then close, locking it in place. Sparrowhawk’s wings, which are actually a single-piece assembly that swings out 90 degrees when deployed, then return to their stowed position parallel to the drone’s body. The mothership aircraft then reels it back in. The entire process is conducted with a high degree of autonomy, according to GA-ASI. A screen capture from the GA-ASI video showing a test of the recovery concept with the line positioned between the two flaps., GA-ASI capture Another screen capture showing the flaps closed, locking the orange sphere at the end of the recovery line in place., GA-ASI capture It is worth noting that the promotional video shows the line extending directly from an underwing pylon, but a clip of actual “reel dynamics testing” shows an aerodynamic model tethered to a pod that is then attached to the pylon. It’s not clear if GA-ASI expects the final Sparrowhawk design to be able to be deployed straight from a specialized pylon or use some sort of podded arrangement similar to the one seen in the testing. The company had previously released a picture of captive carrying testing showing a test article attached directly to a pylon under the wing of an MQ-9. A screen capture from the GA-ASI video showing the computer-generated rendering of the line extending straight from the pylon, with an inset showing a clip of actual testing using a line extending from an underwing pod., GA-ASI capture A Sparrowhawk captive carry test article under the wing of an MQ-9 Reaper drone., GA-ASI The Sparrowhawks themselves, the final iterations of which are expected to be just under 11 feet long and have a wingspan of 14 feet, will be able to fly for at least 10 hours, with a maximum range of around 500 nautical miles, depending on how fast they’re going, according to GA-ASI. The drones will be able to hit speeds up to 150 knots, but could also cruise at speeds as low as 80 knots. The unmanned aircraft will feature a hybrid-electric propulsion system that uses a JP-8-fueled motor to provide power to two electric fans, one on either side of the rear body in front of its v-tail. Compared to the larger mothership aircraft, “the smaller, nimbler, swifter Sparrowhawk is difficult for an adversary to spot as it sprints low along its route,” according to GA-ASI. “It does, via connection to its big brother, what remotely operated aircraft have been doing all along: Sends back vital information about what’s taking place, without the cost and risk of involving a human aircrew.” “A SkyGuardian could release a Sparrowhawk with the intention of searching for hostile anti-air systems without needing to worry about the safety of the pilot. Indeed, an air commander’s goal might be to send Sparrowhawk to probe a denied environment so that it could report back about the radar or other systems that powered on or detected it – where they were, what type, and how many,” the official news item offers as an example of a potential mission profile. “Once Sparrowhawk is secure, the larger aircraft can return to base – or, relying on its ability to stay aloft for many hours, continue its patrol and even launch another Sparrowhawk elsewhere later from its other wing station.” GA-ASI has stressed that Sparrowhawks will not be limited to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, only. The front end of each one of these drones is a modular bay offering ample space and that is able to accommodate up to 60 pounds of payload, in total. The promotional video specifically mentions radar imaging systems, electronic and signals intelligence packages, and electronic warfare jammers as possible options. A cutaway rendering of the Sparrowhawk showing the modular payload bay in the drone’s nose., GA-ASI capture “Sparrowhawk could respond with an electronic attack of its own to clear the way for other aircraft coming in behind it, jamming an enemy radar to deny its ability to sense a strike package passing through the area,” GA-ASI explains. “Or the small aircraft could support missions focused on the suppression of enemy air defenses.” Though not specifically mentioned in GA-ASI’s release, there is the potential for Sparrowhawks to operate in networked, fully autonomous swarms, as well. The company has said in the past the drone was derived from its submission to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Gremlins program , which is also focused on the development of air-launched and air-recoverable small unmanned aircraft with swarming capabilities. A swarm of Sparrowhawks could include individual drones with different payloads, further expanding the capabilities and flexibility of the entire group to conduct a variety of missions. Swarms, by their very nature , also simply have an inherent ability to confuse and overwhelm enemy air defenses. GA-ASI capture While GA-ASI is among the companies crafting potential replacements for the MQ-9 in response to a U.S. Air Force effort dubbed MQ-Next , it has also been actively promoting Sparrowhawk as a way for non-stealthy unmanned aircraft, especially its own designs, like the MQ-9 Reaper and its derivatives, to remain relevant in future higher-end conflicts, including those against potential near-peer adversaries, such as China. You can read more about General Atomics’ overall vision in this past War Zone piece . When it comes to Sparrowhawk, as it stands now, GA-ASI says it has completed the design, built the first prototype fuselage, and conducted captive carry tests using representative test articles. The first flight and demonstration of the aerial recovery capability, among other things, are now on the docket, though the exact schedule for these flight test events is unclear. Regardless, it’s very exciting to get a glimpse of General Atomics’ master plan for the Sparrowhawk and we will certainly be on the lookout for new details about the drone’s development.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 10, 2021",Joint Chiefs Seek A New Warfighting Paradigm After Devastating Losses In Classified Wargames,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are rethinking the United States’ warfighting concepts after failing “miserably” in a wargame that simulated a variety of scenarios. Many of the Pentagon’s core strategies for conducting warfare proved themselves futile in the face of modern threats and capabilities, forcing the Joint Chiefs to explore a warfighting concept known as “Expanded Maneuver.” While the overall concept is new, many of the ideas in Expanded Maneuver build on the overarching focus on distributed operations and information-sharing networks the Pentagon has been pursuing in recent years. The Expanded Maneuver concept was described by General John Hyten , the 11th Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in reporting by Defense One ’s Tara Copp . The specifics of the wargame that prompted Hyten to rethink warfare are classified, but an unnamed defense official told Copp that one of the scenarios simulated a battle for Taiwan . While Hyten didn’t reveal much about the wargames themselves, he did state that the simulated U.S. forces were swiftly and thoroughly dominated. “Without overstating the issue, it failed miserably. An aggressive red team that had been studying the United States for the last 20 years just ran rings around us. They knew exactly what we’re going to do before we did it,” Hyten said this week during a launch event for the National Defense Industrial Association’s Emerging Technologies Institute . A recent Joint All-Domain Command & Control System demonstration at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, USN/MC2 Michael H. Lehman One of the issues that compounded the blue forces’ losses in the wargame was the fact that U.S. forces concentrated together in one area in order to combine firepower and reinforce one another. “We always aggregate to fight, and aggregate to survive. But in today’s world, with hypersonic missiles, with significant long-range fires coming at us from all domains, if you’re aggregated and everybody knows where you are, you’re vulnerable,” Hyten said. Another decisive factor was that the “blue team,” or simulated American forces, lost their ability to use networked communications from the outset of the wargame. “We basically attempted an information-dominance structure, where information was ubiquitous to our forces. Just like it was in the first Gulf War, just like it has been for the last 20 years, just like everybody in the world, including China and Russia, have watched us do for the last 30 years,” Hyten said according to Defense One . “Well, what happens if right from the beginning that information is not available? And that’s the big problem that we faced.” General John Hyten, DOD Prior tabletop wargames that also portrayed China as the central adversary had similar outcomes and prompted similar discussions within the Pentagon. Earlier this year, Air Force Lieutenant General Clint Hinote, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategy, Integration, and Requirements, stated that “we should never play this war game scenario [of a Chinese attack on Taiwan] again, because we know what is going to happen. […] The definitive answer if the U.S. military doesn’t change course is that we’re going to lose fast.” Hinote even added that the F-35 would essentially be useless in such a conflict, and that “Every fighter that rolls off the line today is a fighter that we wouldn’t even bother putting into these scenarios.” The new Expanded Maneuver concept outlined by General Hyten contains four key directives for the services to integrate in order to better compete on the battlefield of today: contested logistics, joint fires, Joint All-Domain Command and Control, and information advantage. These aren’t necessarily new ideas, and in fact, build on initiatives that have already been in development. Contested logistics in this sense refers to finding new concepts for keeping warfighters stocked with fuel and other supplies no matter where they are operating. This would also include being able to defend logistics assets and requiring logistic units to possibly have to fight their way to forward areas. Several initiatives along these lines are already in progress. The U.S. Army, for one, has explored new ideas in recent years that would see combat brigades be able to operate for a whole week without resupply . The Air Force is also pursuing a “Rocket Cargo” concept that aims to be able to put 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth within an hour using rocket technologies already available on the commercial market. U.S. Marines from Combat Logistics Battalion 8 work together with Navy personnel during an Expeditionary Logistics Wargame in 2012., USMC/Sgt Anthony Ortiz Hyten also expanded on how the concept of joint fires is integral to his Expanded Maneuver vision. “You have to aggregate to mass fires, but it doesn’t have to be a physical aggregation,” Hyten said. “It could be a virtual aggregation for multiple domains; acting at the same time under a single command structure allows the fires to come in on anybody. It allows you to disaggregate to survive.” Hyten admitted that joint fires is “unbelievably difficult to do.” Still, this concept has been explored in the past. The Marine Corps, for one, has eyed using combat units spread out in small boats as opposed to using centralized larger ships, largely based on lessons learned from wargaming . The Air Force has also tested using F-35s to cue artillery strikes , allowing it to remain undetected by not engaging threats directly while still using its sensors to identify and mark targets. Larger, more distributed live-fire tests of similar concepts have been conducted involving assets simultaneously on the ground, in the air, and in space. Hyten’s third directive, Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2, is an attempt to connect sensors and communication networks from across the services into a singular architecture. Essentially, JADC2 would create a digital cloud-like environment for sharing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data, as well as other information, across the DOD’s vast system of communications networks in order to enable faster decision-making. The Air Force, in particular, has tested a wide variety of systems that could eventually fall under the larger JADC2 umbrella , including some that utilize joint fire concepts . Assets like the shadowy RQ-180 could fit into this architecture, serving as long-endurance, survivable information gateways in contested environments. A demonstration of the Command Post Computing Environment which combines warfighting functions into a common user interface, reducing the training burden on Soldiers and accelerating the integration of new capabilities. , US Army The concept of information advantage Hyten describes as part of Extended Maneuver is essentially a sum of the other three concepts, enabled by real-time information and data sharing across the entire military enterprise. Hyten says that if these concepts could be successfully deployed throughout the services, “the United States and our allies will have an information advantage over anybody that we could possibly face.” While Hyten didn’t specifically mention machine learning or artificial intelligence, other military leaders have signaled in the past that these systems will play a huge part in establishing and maintaining information advantage in the future. As the Center for New American Security’s Becca Wasser notes on Twitter, sometimes the integration of new concepts like Hyten’s Extended Maneuver can be hindered by what she calls a “broken” process of developing new military strategies and visions. Hyten has been particularly vocal about this broken process in the past, claiming that what worries him most is that America’s defense-industrial complex has lost the ability to “go fast,” meaning bureaucratic red tape can often hold back progress when it comes to military innovation. https://youtube.com/watch?v=3m691gCJWME There is always a push-and-pull struggle between the interests of each branch of the services, the military-industrial complex, and the true realities of joint capabilities. Getting the vast enterprise that is the U.S. military to coordinate and work together on massive paradigm shifts in terms of concepts of joint operations is not easy, to say the least. Many past joint networking concepts over the last few decades have failed, leaving some to wonder if the new push for JADC2 will succeed or succumb to inter-service competition, technological roadblocks, and recalcitrance. Simulated U.S. “blue team” forces losing in wargaming is nothing new, and past wargames have likewise shown that some current concepts of joint operations would lead to devastating losses . Still, the fact that this latest classified wargame directly simulated a battle over Taiwan – a prospect which seems more and more likely, based on some recent developments – could give military leadership pause to rethink entrenched warfighting and developmental concepts. The Joint Chiefs’ General John Hyten may not be introducing completely novel ideas with his Extended Maneuver vision, but given that Hyten says the simulated U.S. forces “failed miserably” should be enough for the Joint Chiefs to reevaluate current warfighting capabilities and tactics in light of potential adversaries’ rapidly advancing capabilities and growing ambitions.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 12, 2021",China Increasing Its Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Silos By A Factor Of Ten: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent satellite imagery shows that China appears to be building another major intercontinental ballistic missile , or ICBM, silo field, the second of its kind to have been identified by analysts in the space of a month . This is a major development, with the analysts responsible for locating it describing it as “the most significant expansion of the Chinese nuclear arsenal ever.” However, while Beijing now seems to be rapidly building up a previously neglected arm of its strategic missile forces, exactly why it is doing this now remains something of a mystery. The new field of silos was identified as such by Matt Korda and Hans Kristensen from the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) and it’s located near the city of Hami in the eastern end of Xinjiang province, in the northwest of China. The analysts’ findings were first published in the New York Times . Kristensen/Korda/FAS 2021 The new missile silo field near Hami is around 240 miles northwest of the one that was revealed earlier this month, near Yumen, in Gansu province. While imagery of the Yumen field seems to reveal that construction is underway on 120 missile silos, work that started in February, the one near Hami is less far advanced, with work reportedly having begun there only this past March. Since then, however, the telltale dome-like shelters that analysts have identified as being associated with the building of silos have appeared over at least 14 individual sites at Hami, with preparations noted at 19 others. In all, Korda and Kristensen expect that the Hami field could accommodate around 110 silos, arranged in a fairly dense, grid-like pattern, with the silos apparently less than two miles apart. In the past, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) has relied upon a small force of around 20 silos for its liquid-fueled DF-5 missiles , the only operational silo-based ICBMs in its inventory, with a handful of other silos used for training and test purposes. Now, presuming that the FAS analysis is correct, and it’s hard to see another explanation for this construction activity, China is on its way to boost its silo-based ICBM force to around 250 silos in total. As Korda and Kristensen point out, that would provide China with more silo-based ICBMs than Russia and more than half the number fielded by the United States . China, like Russia, also operates road-mobile ICBM launchers , with around 100 thought to be in the active PLARF inventory. The road-mobile DF-41 ICBM., KYODO VIA AP IMAGES Were all the silos at Hami to be filled with missiles, each carrying a single warhead, China would, at a stroke, increase its deployed ICBM warheads from around 185 warheads today to as many as 415 warheads, according to FAS projections. The mathematics becomes even more worrisome should China deploy missiles with multiple independent reentry vehicles , or MIRVs, which could triple the number of warheads on each missile. That remains uncertain, however, as is whether China will actually fill each of the silos with a missile of any kind. Nevertheless, the latest developments at Hami, especially taken together with those at Yumen, seem to confirm previous Pentagon assessments regarding increasing numbers of Chinese warheads and ICBM silos, as well as a different type of deterrence posture. In total, FAS assesses China as having around 350 nuclear warheads of all types, today, although not all of these are fully operational. The Pentagon, meanwhile, puts the operational nuclear warhead figure in the “low-200s,” as stated in last year’s Annual Report to Congress on Chinese military and security developments. The overall figure has, for some time now, been predicted to grow, with Admiral Charles Richard, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, stating earlier this year that he expected China’s nuclear weapons stockpile “to double (if not triple or quadruple) over the next decade.” When the previous missile silo field was uncovered at Yumen, some analysts, including Dr. Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on missiles and nuclear weapons at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, suggested that it might indicate that China was about to introduce a “shell game” strategy, something that The War Zone considered at the time . In this, potentially large numbers of silos are filled with perhaps only a few functional missiles, providing potential enemies with much more complicated targeting requirements, should they wish to wipe out all the silo-based ICBMs in a first strike. Once again, it’s possible that the Hami missile silo field will be expected to work in the same way. Furthermore, the fairly close proximity of the two new large-scale silo fields might also point to this being the plan. As to the potential reasons why China has apparently chosen to pursue an ICBM silo-building program as the means to increase its strategic nuclear arsenal, there are many, with FAS suggesting that there are likely a number of complementary contributing factors that have driven this policy change. All of these possibilities also have to be seen against the backdrop of wider strategic weapons developments — both offensive and defensive — currently being pursued by India, Russia, and the United States, all of which are strategic and/or regional rivals to China. At the same time, these countries are also pursuing new types of weapons that could have the ability to tip the strategic balance, such as hypersonic weapons, now under development in India , Russia , and the United States . With this in mind, rapidly adding a significant number of new ICBM silos could be a simple statement of national ambition, helping signal that Beijing is narrowing the gap with its superpower rivals, although each of these countries still possesses far more nuclear weapons in total than China, which probably has less than a fifth of the stockpiles of either Russia or the United States. This theory has it that the new ICBMs are primarily about a demonstration of economic, technological, and military prowess. However, the additional ICBMs may also reveal that China is moving away from its previous “minimum deterrence” posture, in which relatively small numbers of missiles are kept on alert. Should all the new silos be filled with ICBMs, that would clearly mark a move away from that posture and toward a much-expanded nuclear strike capability that can hold more targets at risk. Among the other, more specific possible reasons for the development are China’s need to improve the survivability of its ICBM silos to ensure it can launch them against an aggressor if required. The more ICBM silos that are available, the higher the chances that at least some of these might survive a first strike. While the missiles at both the new silo fields might be grouped closely together, which would apparently make them more vulnerable, it may also be significant that the two new installations are located deeper within China’s boundaries, putting them out of reach of attack by conventional missiles, like the stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile , or JASSM. Here again, the “shell game” strategy could potentially come into play, making it yet more complicated for a potential aggressor to wipe out China’s ICBMs pre-emptively. Adding dummy missiles into the mix could further enhance this. As nuclear policy expert Ankit Panda has observed, the “shell game” could also be a good starting point in the short term, while China continues to build up its ICBM forces, filling all of the silos over the longer term. The move may also be linked to developments in U.S. missile defenses, as part of a wider initiative to add more Chinese ICBMs, of all kinds, to increase the chances that these will defeat the Ground-based Midcourse Defense missile defense system, or GMD, for example. However, it should be noted that this system is primarily meant to help protect the United States against limited ICBM strikes, such as those that could be launched from North Korea or Iran . FAS also points to the possibility that Beijing might be about to change the way it puts its ICBMs on alert. While FAS assesses that China’s silo-based missiles are likely fielded without their warheads fitted, at least during peacetime, the new silo fields could suggest that this might in the future be switched to a launch-on-warning (LOW) posture, in keeping with those fielded by Russia and the United States and offering a significantly faster response time. Launch-on-warning would provide the option for a “retaliatory” nuclear strike by launching missiles when an incoming nuclear missile attack was detected, but before any of the incoming warheads had actually detonated. It would, however, potentially demand a more robust and reliable early warning system. As the 2020 Annual Report to Congress on Chinese military and security developments stated: “New developments in 2019 […] suggest that China intends to increase the peacetime readiness of its nuclear forces by moving to a launch-on-warning (LOW) posture with an expanded silo-based force.” There are also factors of modernization at play, above all the continued move away from liquid-fueled ICBMs like the DF-5 toward solid-fueled missiles. These are not only more reliable but can be deployed much more rapidly, without the need to fuel them in advance, in turn making them more survivable. MIRVed DF-5B intercontinental ballistic missiles during a parade in Beijing in 2015., AP/Voice of America Lastly, FAS raises the possibility that the apparent expansion of China’s silo-based ICBM force should be seen as a means of balancing the overall nuclear deterrent force, which has previously been weighted in favor of road-mobile launchers, although these would, at first glance, seem to offer a number of significant advantages over their silo-based counterparts, not least in terms of survivability. Whatever the reasons, it’s clear that China is fast moving away from its “minimum deterrence” posture, with significant developments also underway in its road-mobile ICBM arsenal , as well as continued modernization of its ballistic missile submarine fleet and, it’s presumed, a new manned bomber also imminent. “The silo construction will likely further deepen military tension, fuel fear of China’s intentions, embolden arguments that arms control and constraints are naïve and that US and Russian nuclear arsenals cannot be reduced further but instead must be adjusted to take into account the Chinese nuclear build-up,” the FAS report concludes . Korda and Kristensen also make the case for arms controls as the most realistic way of slowing the expansion of China’s nuclear arsenal from this point on, although they note that efforts in this direction have been fraught with difficulty in the past. This includes an unsuccessful attempt by President Donald Trump to bring China within the New START treaty , which puts upper limits on Russian and U.S. intercontinental-range nuclear weapons. China, for its part, is already well below the limits outlined by New START. “Bringing China and other nuclear-armed states into a sustained arms control dialogue will require a good-faith effort that will require the United States to clearly articulate what it is willing to trade in return for limits on Chinese forces,” FAS suggests. Moreover, even with significant increases in China’s ICBM force and nuclear stockpile, these are both likely to remain smaller than those of Russia and the United States, which implicitly presents challenges for arms control dealing in terms of flat reductions, parity, etc. One potential tradeoff for China could involve a limit imposed on U.S. missile defenses, a topic that is already controversial, not least because of the enormous cost involved in fielding missile interceptors, the utility of which can be simply eroded by an enemy building more missiles to overwhelm them — by adding another ICBM silo field, for example. At the same time, China would still have significant room to grow its nuclear arsenal and still be within New START limits. The move could, however, reflect that China is increasingly aware that, sooner or later, it too will become involved within international arms control negotiations , in which case the additional silo capacity could be a useful trading card. Relatively simple and less expensive to deploy than mobile-, submarine- or air-launched strategic nuclear weapons, Beijing could be willing to sacrifice these new silos at a later date, if it felt it was advantageous and that Russia and/or the United States was compelled to respond in kind.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 4, 2022",Air Force Tweet Showing F-35As Protected By Lightning Rods Asks “Which Lightning Strikes Harder?”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nellis Air Force Base’s official Twitter account has posted a great picture of a pair of U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, also known by the official nickname Lightning II , protected by lightning rods as actual lightning striking in the background. The Tweet, which asks “which lightning do you think strikes harder?”, comes just days after the U.S. Marine Corps revealed that a pair of their F-35Bs were grounded in Japan with millions of dollars in damage after being hit by lightning during sorties earlier this month. Air Force F-35As have also infamously been banned, at least in the past, from flying anywhere near thunderstorms due to concerns about the potential for their fuel systems to explode if they are struck by lightning . The picture in the Tweet shows a pair of F-35As from Hill Air Force Base in Utah, home to the 388th and 419th Fighter Wings , both of which are equipped with Joint Strike Fighters. The jets are at Nellis, which is situated on the outskirts of Las Vegas, Nevada, taking part in the Red Flag 21-3 exercise , which began on July 19 and runs through Aug. 6. “These F-35 Lightning IIs from @hafb were parked on the @NellisAFB flight line during last night’s #Vegas storm,” the Tweet reads, in part. “Today, they’re ready to rumble for #RedFlag 21-3.” Red Flags are run multiple times each year out of this base and are conducted over the adjacent sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR). They are major air warfare exercises that typically involve a wide array of different Air Force aircraft types, as well as elements from the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps . Foreign allies and partners often take part, as well, though Red Flag 21-3 appears to be entirely, or almost entirely, an American event. Red Flags with limited international participation usually coincide with the employment of more advanced capabilities. F-117 Nighthawk stealth combat jets have notably been participating in this current exercise. Despite all of the remaining F-117s having been officially retired, and what’s left of the fleet ostensibly destined to be placed in museums or scrapped , a number of them have been flying as “red air” aggressors in support of various exercises for some time now. The Tweet is certainly meant to be lighthearted, but the prompt “which lightning do you think strikes harder?” is also ironic given the current state of the two Marine F-35Bs based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan. Last week, the Marine Corps confirmed that both jets were struck by lightning during a flight on July 13, but that they were thankfully able to land safely and that neither of the pilots were injured. “After conducting our standard reporting and assessment procedures, the weather-related incident was labeled as a class ‘A’ mishap due to the combined projected repair costs exceeding two and a half million U.S. dollars,” U.S. Marine Corps Captain Marco Valenzuela, a spokesperson for Marine Air Group 12 at Iwakuni, said in a statement to Marine Corps Times . “The safe operation of our aircraft and the readiness of our squadrons are vitally important to us in order to continue supporting our allies, partners, and joint forces in the region.” A US Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighter at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan., USMC In the U.S. military’s system for categorizing aviation mishaps, a Class A incident is the most severe and is any accident that results in at least $2.5 million in property damage, leads to the total loss of the aircraft, or leaves one or more individuals dead or permanently disabled. Marine Corps Times’ report does not provide specific details about the damage to either F-35B. However, past contracting documents have outlined how the stealthy composite material skin on all F-35 variants “does not provide inherent passive lightning protection,” unlike metal-clad aircraft. The potential risks posed by lightning strikes exist on the ground, as well as in the air, and the F-35As seen in the picture from Nellis are notably seen parked next to mobile lightning rods for their protection. F-35A Joint Strike Fighters sit beneath lightning rods at Volk Field in Wisconsin during Exercise Northern Lightning 2020., USAF In addition, there have been concerns previously about the potential for lightning strikes to damage electronic systems on the jets, including the onboard components of the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which form the aircraft’s “computer brain.” By 2019, ALIS had reportedly received “support for lightning protection,” according to the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E. Then there is also the matter of the F-35’s fuel system, which features an Onboard Inert Gas Generation System (OBIGGS). As a Joint Strike Fighter guzzles gas, the OBIGGS pumps nitrogen-enriched air into the fuel system to prevent dangerous gasses from building up in the empty space. If flammable gasses were allowed to build up inside the aircraft, a lightning strike could potentially ignite them, which, in turn, could cause a catastrophic explosion. Unfortunately, a problem emerged with the OBIGGS on Air Force F-35As last year, which led the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) to recommend units operating this variant not operate anywhere within 25 miles of lightning or thunderstorms. As of October 2020, those restrictions remained in place , but the aircraft’s manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, said that a fix would begin to be installed on all new-production A models by the end of the year. How long it would take for all existing jets to receive this modification was unclear, as well as how long JPO’s recommendations regarding flying near lightning or thunderstorms would stay in place. A briefing slide with details about the OBIGGS for the F-35., F-35 JPO The F-35C uses the same OBIGGS as the F-35A, but the system on the F-35B is slightly different. It remains unclear if the F-35 JPO ever issued similar guidance about flight restrictions for either of those versions after discovering the issue on the A variants. There is also no indication, one way or another, that the OBIGGS, or any other part of the fuel system, was a factor in the severity of the damage to the two Marine F-35Bs in Japan. “The vertical takeoff variant F-35B has a slightly differently designed OBIGGS system, which fits around its lift fan and historically has made it immune to the lightning issues of its F-35A cousin,” according to Marine Corps Times . However, it is worth noting that, in 2018, the Marines announced plans to buy lightning rods to shield their F-35Bs at Iwakuni from strikes, specifically justifying the purchase by saying “the lightning rods being requested are needed for deploying aircraft to any expeditionary airfield in support of combat operations or training exercises that do not support all lightning protection requirements for the F-35B.” The Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation had specifically raised questions about lighting protection with regards to the B variant back in 2015, as well, writing in an annual report that “The aircraft does not maintain residual inerting after flight for the required interval of 12 hours, which is a lightning protection requirement.” Whatever the case, the picture of the Air Force F-35As waiting out the storm under their protective lightning rods and the substantial damage the two Japan-based Marine Corps F-35Bs recently suffered certainly seem to provide one answer to the question of “which lightning do you think strikes harder?” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 9, 2021",This Kamikaze Impact Mark On A British Cruiser Is A Testament To The Brutality Of The Pacific War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The kamikaze attacks launched by the Imperial Japanese military during the tail-end of the fighting in the Pacific during World War II are justly remembered as some of the most desperate, terrifying tactics employed by any of the combatants during that global conflict. While they inflicted a heavy toll on Allied warships and personnel, they claimed the lives of thousands of Japanese pilots in the process and, of course, failed to turn the tide of the war. One photo, in particular, seems to sum up both the ferocity and the futility of this campaign, showing the telltale silhouette of a Japanese raider that slammed, more or less ineffectively, into the side of a British Royal Navy warship on this day, in 1945. The remarkable image was taken after the County class heavy cruiser HMS Sussex had been struck by a Mitsubishi Ki-51 — a monoplane light bomber that carried the Allied reporting name Sonia — near the Dutch East Indies on July 26, 1945. This was one of two kamikaze raiders that had attempted to target the ship. This particular aircraft impacted the warship just above the waterline, leaving a near-perfect imprint of its shape, but failed entirely to penetrate the cruiser’s hull or cause any significant damage. Wearing dazzle paint, the heavy cruiser HMS Sussex anchored in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, in October 1940., PUBLIC DOMAIN According to a Tweet today from the U.S. Naval Institute, HMS Sussex was protected by belt armor that was 4.5 inches thick, although other accounts from naval warfare experts point out that the County class did not carry any additional belt armor, as a result of limits placed on protection by interwar naval treaties , with the kamikaze raider instead ultimately being defeated by an inch of steel. Some reports suggest that the Ki-51 may have come in so low that it bounced off the top of the waves before impact, with the result that its velocity was significantly reduced. While the aircraft utilized a mainly metal construction, with fabric-covered control surfaces, its overall mass was fairly light, with a maximum takeoff weight of fewer than 6,500 pounds. Contemporary accounts indicate it wasn’t even initially clear which aircraft type had been responsible, suggesting there was very little left in the way of wreckage. One after-action report describes HMS Sussex being attacked by a Val — the codename for an Aichi D3A dive-bomber. The aircraft “was sighted approaching from the starboard beam, flying straight and at about deck level, heading for the after superstructure. He was engaged by the close-range armament and was shot down in flames, the pilot being seen to throw up his hands before the aircraft finally crashed, hitting the ship’s side abreast the mainmast.” This same account goes on to detail the damage to the warship — an eight-foot split in the side plating located around 8 feet above the waterline, and some minor distortion to panels on the hull. Being shot down by the warship’s anti-aircraft defenses was by no means an unusual fate for the suicide raiders. Of course, the Sonia would have been armed with explosives as well — this adapted light bomber could carry up to around 550 pounds of bombs for kamikaze operations. But these clearly didn’t detonate, and they may well have been torn off the aircraft once it first impacted the water. An Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Mitsubishi Ki-51., U.S. Navy The War Zone spoke to Mike Yeo, author of Desperate Sunset: Japan’s kamikazes against Allied ships, 1944–45 , who has identified the particular unit from which the Ki-51 was drawn. This was an Imperial Japanese Army Air Force training establishment based in northern Malaya, where it was preparing to try and repulse an expected Allied invasion of Malaya and Singapore, and it was involved in several waves of attacks against Allied warships on the 26th. In Yeo’s account, it was the first Ki-51 that was successfully shot down by the anti-aircraft guns on Sussex , while the second managed to press home its attack, striking the vessel and leaving its imprint on its hull. His findings include reports of “dents, scrapes, and scorch marks on the side of its hull,” together with the possibility, at least, that the aircraft’s fixed undercarriage impacted the water prior to impact. A colorized image of the kamikaze impact on HMS Sussex : That there is still some confusion surrounding the exact sequence of events of the attack on HMS Sussex is hardly surprising, given the chaos of a kamikaze raid. While this particular suicide raider was unsuccessful, it’s worth noting, too, that another Sonia pressed home its attack on the Royal Navy minesweeper HMS Vestal on the same day, causing critical damage and killing 20 of the ship’s crew. This would be the last British naval vessel to be lost to enemy action during World War II. HMS Vestal , the victim of a successful kamikaze attack on the same day., PUBLIC DOMAIN In another strange twist to the HMS Sussex ’s campaign, one sailor, George Coyne, later recalled that a Japanese ship was sunk, too, leaving around 20 survivors in the water. “One of our ships, at great risk to themselves, stopped to rescue them,” Coyne said, “Without exception, they refused help and so drowned.” Less than a month after the attack, Japan had surrendered, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Singapore, General Seishirō Itagaki, signing the surrender documents on behalf of the army aboard the Sussex on September 5, 1945. General Itagaki signs surrender documents onboard HMS Sussex ., PUBLIC DOMAIN “Thank God for the bomb ,” Coyne wrote in his diary at the time. “We should now get home safely.” As it is, this haunting image from the attack on HMS Sussex stands testimony to the brutality of the Pacific campaign and the fine line between those ships that survived to fight another day, and those that would not.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jan 10, 2022",Jet-Powered Coyote Drone Defeats Swarm In Army Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army announced a major milestone in its anti-drone efforts this week, claiming it achieved its first “air-to-air non-kinetic defeats” using Coyote Block 3 drones . The recent demonstration saw the Coyotes take down a hostile swarm of 10 drones using a non-specified electronic warfare system or directed energy weapon of some kind. In addition to proving the Coyote’s anti-swarm capabilities, the demonstration also proved that the drones can be recovered and redeployed on the battlefield. The tests of the Block 3 Coyotes were conducted by the Army’s Indirect Fires and Rapid Capabilities Office (IF/RCO) at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona. IF/RCO is concerned with developing a “systems-of-systems concept to ensure integration and interoperability are achieved between U.S. Army programs.” It’s unclear exactly when the tests took place, but Raytheon announced the successful demonstration on July 21. A Block 2 Coyote, Joseph Trevithick In a press release , Raytheon claims that the Block 3 Coyotes “engaged and defeated a swarm of 10 drones that differed in size, complexity, maneuverability and range” using a “non-kinetic effector.” In this sense, “non-kinetic” refers to systems that defeat hostile UAVs without using a physical projectile of any kind. That would typically mean the Coyotes used either an electronic warfare “jammer,” or a form of directed energy like high-powered microwaves . In some ways, drones carrying non-kinetic counter-UAS (C-UAS) solutions have an advantage over drones armed with traditional munitions in that they can be reused, as opposed to being destroyed by onboard explosives. In addition, some of these non-kinetic solutions can engage multiple targets without needing to be rearmed. “This test demonstrates the effectiveness of Coyote to counter complex, unmanned aircraft systems,” said Tom Laliberty, vice president of Land Warfare & Air Defense at Raytheon Missiles & Defense. “As a non-kinetic variant, we’re offering an effective weapon against the threat and value to the Army in the form of an affordable, reusable asset.” A Coyote on the tarmac at Avon Park Air Force Range in Florida, NOAA Raytheon states that the recent tests at Yuma also achieved several firsts for the Coyote aside from air-to-air non-kinetic defeats, including “survivability, recovery, refurbishment and reuse during the same test event,” successful integration with launchers from the Coyote Block 2 system, and engagement at long range using the Ku-band Radio Frequency System , a 360-degree radar used for detecting short-range threats like rockets or mortars, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). While the wording of Raytheon’s press release appears to signal that this demonstration only involved one Coyote drone taking on a swarm, previous iterations of the Coyote have been tested in swarming operation , meaning it’s quite possible the Block 3 versions can operate as a counter-swarm to defeat coordinated groups of hostile UAVs. “The demonstration moves the variant closer to deployment and we are planning with our U.S. Army customer to determine timelines,” a Raytheon spokeswoman told Inside Defense . The company declined to comment about what the “non-kinetic effector” used in the tests could be when asked. The Coyote, made by Raytheon Missiles & Defense, is a small, tube-launched UAV capable of being launched from larger aircraft or even unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). While the Army has eyed the Coyote specifically for anti-drone roles , the small drone has been mainly developed as a loitering munition , or “suicide drone,” sometimes even referred to as a “ low-cost cruise missile .” A Block 1 Coyote, Raytheon The Block 1 Coyotes made their first flights in 2007, featuring a rear pusher prop, a set of pop-out wings and a pop-up V-tail. These initial Coyotes were marketed as low-cost intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms, but ended up being somewhat of a testbed for a wide variety of applications including being air-launched by NOAA aircraft in order to gather data from inside hurricanes in 2017. Block 2 didn’t appear publicly until 2018 sporting a more missile-like appearance without wings. This second block featured an entirely different planform and propulsion system, which combines a rocket booster and a small jet engine. Control surfaces near the tail give the Coyote Block 2 a “ dogfight-type of capability ” in terms of maneuvering, claimed Raytheon VP of mission systems and sensors James McGovern, in 2020. “With a turbine engine, it has controllable thrust throughout the entire engagement, allowing it to close in on small targets that may be evading or jinking,” McGovern explained. Raytheon has said that both of these first Coyote models could also be reconfigured into loitering munitions , a unique subclass of weaponry somewhere between a missile and a UAV. The Block 1 Coyotes were also tested in swarming operations as part of the Office of Naval Research’s Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology program, or LOCUST . https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo The Pentagon has released few details about Block 3, stating simply and broadly in March 2021 that these new Coyotes would form “the baseline for numerous follow-on activities and programs within the Navy, Air Force, and Army.” Budget documentation from 2019 revealed that the Pentagon’s Low-Cost Cruise Missile (LCCM) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program office was developing “low-cost, conventional air-launched cruise missiles” using “surrogate systems” which were later confirmed to be Block 3 Coyotes by a DOD press release. Judging from other anti-drone technologies in development, it could be that the Block 3 Coyotes employ a high-power microwave system. DARPA recently demonstrated anti-drone microwave weapons on the Lockheed Martin MORFIUS, another tube-launched drone platform offering versatile payloads and the ability to defeat single UAV threats or swarms. The MORFIUS is based on the Area-I ALTIUS-600 platform, another drone capable of carrying a variety of payloads and executing a range of missions being tested by the USAF aboard the XQ-58A Valkyrie . Despite the lack of details, the sheer number of systems being tested on the Coyote show that the low-cost tube-launched drone has become a go-to platform for the Pentagon’s many recent experiments and demonstrations involving swarming concepts and counter-drone systems.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 7, 2021",MC-145B Wily Coyote Special Ops Planes Will Be Able To Launch Stealth Cruise Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Sierra Nevada Corporation, or SNC, plans to integrate variants of the very capable and combat-proven AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile series of stealthy cruise missiles onto its MC-145B Wily Coyote armed light transport aircraft. The company says that the ability to deploy these weapons via the aircraft’s rear cargo ramp will enable them to contribute to operations during higher-end conflicts, as well as support responses to lower-tier contingencies. U.S. Special Operations Command is presently testing an MC-145B prototype, among other types, as part of its Armed Overwatch program , as a potential replacement for the U-28A Draco aircraft, which will be primarily expected to operate in permissive environments. SNC highlighted the planned Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) capability for the MC-145B in a recent press release and accompanying video. No mention was made of any plans to integrate this stealthy cruise missile in the materials that the company previously provided to The War Zone , which was the first to report in-depth on the Wily Coyote’s configuration and expected capabilities. The aircraft itself is derived from the Polish-designed M28 Skytruck twin-engine turboprop light utility aircraft, an unarmed version of which, the C-145A Combat Coyote , U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) already operates. A rendering of the MC-145B Wily Coyote., SNC “We can actually do palletized munitions,” Mark Williams, SNC’s Vice President of Aviation Strategic Plans and Programs, says in the recently released video. “We’re going to be the only ones [in the Armed Overwatch competition] who can actually fire a JASSM out of the cargo bay.” SNC has not said what variant or variants of the JASSM series it is planning to integrate onto the MC-145B. The U.S. Air Force presently has two versions of the AGM-158 in inventory, the standard type with a range of around 230 miles and an extended-range one, or JASSM-ER, which can hit targets out to around 600 miles. Both of these are intended for use against targets on land. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy have also fielded an anti-ship derivative, the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), and the latter service is now pursuing a variant that will be a hybrid of sorts between the JASSM-ER and the LRASM. An Extreme Range version, or JASSM-XR , is also under development and is expected to be able to strike threats more than 1,000 miles away. It’s also not clear how many of these missiles SNC expects that an MC-145B will be able to carry at once. Concept art that the company has released so far shows a single missile in the plane’s main cargo bay. However, the weapon is depicted sitting between the two rows of four Common Launch Tubes (CLT) that the Wily Coyote can also be configured to carry. Each one of these tubes can be used to launch a variety of precision-guided munitions, as well as small drones. The aircraft also has four underwing hardpoints for additional stores. A rendering of a JASSM in the main cargo bay of the MC-145B, with the two rows of four CLT launchers seen on either side., SNC capture “We’ve got the ability to shoot anywhere from 14 to 28 APKWS [ Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System 70mm laser-guided rockets]. We also have the ability to shoot Hellfires , as well,” SNC’s Williams explained in the promotional video. “We can drop a Small Diameter Bomb . We have eight reloadable Common Launch Tubes in the cargo bay. You can launch a bunch of precision-guided munitions. You can launch UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] out of those CLTs.” A screen capture from SNC’s recent MC-145B promotional video showing a store being launched from inside the main cargo bay on the demonstrator aircraft via a CLT., SNC capture The MC-145B is also designed to be able to accommodate a variety of different communications, data-sharing, and sensor packages. This includes provisions for sensor turrets with electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as laser-designators, under the nose and in a retractable position under the fuselage. The aircraft will also be able to carry podded systems, such as the NSP-7 radar , which has synthetic aperture imaging and moving targeting indicator functionality. The view from a sensor operator station on the MC-145B demonstrator aircraft showing that it has MX-15D and MX-20D sensor turrets from L3Harris installed and is also carrying a podded NSP-7 radar., SNC capture A podded NSP-7 radar on the MC-145B demonstrator aircraft., SNC capture When it comes to planned munition options, the JASSM is in a completely different category from the weapons that the other aircraft competing in U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Armed Overwatch fly-off are capable of employing. In the promotional video, SNC’s Williams made clear that the point of integrating this cruise missile onto the aircraft was so that it could “actually have an impact in the peer-to-peer fight,” as well as support lower-end operations. The marketing material SNC had previously released to The War Zone also mentioned the possibility of the MC-145B being able to deploy versions of the ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), as well as X-61A unmanned aircraft, via the rear ramp. The ADM-160 is, in many ways, a small cruise missile that carries an electronic warfare payload, which can jam or otherwise confuse enemy radars, depending on the version , instead of a traditional warhead. The X-61A is an experimental drone under development as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Gremlins program that is capable of operating as part of a networked swarm and that is designed to be air-launched and recovered in mid-air by a mothership aircraft . As The War Zone noted in our initial coverage of the MC-145B, both of these systems are heavily geared toward defeating higher-end integrated air defense networks, something that seemed well beyond the scope of SOCOM’s Armed Overwatch effort. The JASSM plans only further underscore that SNC is pitching the aircraft as a more robust platform that could have broader applications. The Wily Coyote “can also do other missions that aren’t even captured in the [Armed Overwatch] requirements,” Williams, SNC’s Vice President of Aviation Strategic Plans and Programs, said in the recent promotional video. The company has also been focusing heavily on other multi-mission capabilities that the MC-145B offers, including its ability to airdrop cargo and act as a casualty evacuation platform, compared to the other Armed Overwatch entrants, all of which are smaller, single-engine designs . SNC, which is also supplying A-29B Super Tucano light attack aircraft to the Air Force in cooperation with Brazil’s Embraer, says that it looked at 44 different aircraft before ultimately settling on a converted M28 Skytruck for its Armed Overwatch submission. It’s also worth noting that AFSOC has been heavily involved in Air Force testing of palletized munition concepts in recent years, a program now known as Rapid Dragon. In June, the service disclosed that an MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker-transport had simulated the launch of a pallet load of JASSMs after receiving targeting information from offboard platforms during the most recent iteration of the biennial Northern Edge exercise . Last year, the service had also revealed an earlier test that involved a previously unknown prototype munition design called the Cargo Launch Expendable Air Vehicles with Extended Range, or CLEAVER . An MC-130J releases a simulated payload of JASSMs during Northern Edge 2021., USAF The Rapid Dragon concept, broadly, envisions AFSOC MC-130Js, as well as standard C-130 Hercules and C-17A Globemaster III airlifters, being able to rapidly shift from transports to stand-off strike platforms in support of higher-end operations. In principle, this would provide valuable additional flexibility and overall strike capacity at a relatively low cost. At the same time, questions have already been raised about how useful this new capability might actually be during large-scale operations where there are likely to be significant demands for moving personnel and materiel by air, especially amid existing concerns about shortfalls in airlift capacity . SNC is certainly touting the potential for the MC-145B to provide an additional layer of flexibility and capacity in these kinds of scenarios. However, the aircraft’s value in this role could be limited by how many JASSMs, or other similarly large stores, it can carry at once and how readily it may be able to employ them, even in coordination with other assets providing the targeting information. It will certainly be interesting to see whether or not the MC-145B’s ultimately has a future as a cruise missile-slinging platform in addition to its other capabilities.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 23, 2021",AI That Bested Air Force Pilot In “Digital Dogfights” Headed For L-39 Jet Trainer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The software company whose artificial intelligence, or AI, technology beat a human fighter pilot in multiple dogfights carried out in a simulator during last year’s high-profile AlphaDogfight trials is going to get the chance to put it through its paces in a real jet. Heron Systems recently confirmed to The War Zone that “in the near future” it will integrate its systems into an L-39 Albatros jet trainer as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Air Combat Evolution program, which looks at how AI and machine learning could be employed in air-to-air combat in the future. Heron says it’s so far flown more than 70 flights to test its AI technology on unspecified real-world fixed-wing drones, including achieving AI-controlled dynamic flight maneuvers and following virtual waypoints. Meanwhile, the company has also continued to use its developments in AI to simulate adversaries and wingmen in the virtual reality realm. The scene of a virtual dogfight from an Air Combat Evolution simulation. , DARPA/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP This information was provided as part of a recent announcement that Heron had been acquired as a new division of Shield AI , a San Diego-based tech firm that specializes in autonomous AI-enabled defense technology, including adapting self-driving car technologies for use in military aircraft. “Shield AI enables us the opportunity and scale to accelerate the integration of our AI-pilot on a next-generation fighter and UAS [unmanned aircraft system],” said Brett Darcey, Heron Systems general manager. “What stood out about Shield AI for us is that they’re really the only ones who have an operational AI pilot that can operate on the edge without GPS or comms, and this has been proven on combat operations.” “Whoever has the best AI pilots will have a decisive and overwhelming advantage on the battlefield — inferior AI pilots will be quickly destroyed, militaries without AI pilots won’t stand a chance,” added Brandon Tseng, the cofounder of Shield AI. The combined Shield AI and Heron team is excited and humbled to contribute to the warfighter, national security, and global stability by operationalizing AI pilots onboard 6th generation fighters and Group 5 UAS “ said Brandon Tseng Shield AI cofounder and former Navy SEAL. According to a joint press release from the companies, Heron and Shield AI will together “accelerate the deployment of advanced AI pilots to legacy and future military aircraft — an urgent and necessary step toward achieving national security priorities and remaining credible in the face of sophisticated peer countries.” One of those next steps is the aforementioned Phase 2 of DARPA’s ACE program, which will expand the AI-driven dogfighting scenarios to include live subscale aircraft, both propeller-driven and jet-powered, to see just how those AI algorithms translate to live air combat scenarios. Then, under Phase 3, that same AI technology developed by Heron will be inserted in a full-scale L-39 jet trainer, as an onboard AI “pilot.” Earlier this year, we reported how Calspan had already begun work to modify an L-39 for this role, although at that time it had not been specified which company would be providing the AI itself. A slide from a DARPA presentation showing the successive phases within ACE, culminating in live-flying with an AI-equipped L-39., DARPA/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP While Phase 2 is scheduled to take place later this year, the Phase 3 dogfights should follow in late 2023 and 2024. Heron’s AI technology first came to wider prominence in the air defense realm in August last year when the company’s software was used in DARPA’s AlphaDogfight trials, the result of which was a 5-to-0 win in simulated dogfights against an experienced U.S. Air Force F-16 pilot, and five other AI pilots. You can read more about that here . That event was followed by Phase 1 of ACE, which involved simulated 2-v-1 engagements that pitted AI-controlled F-16s against an opponent, at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), earlier this year. Unlike the AlphaDogfight scenarios, ACE Phase 1 also included a notional air-to-air missile, as well as the F-16’s gun, expanding the scenarios into the beyond-visual-range battlespace. Ultimately, DARPA hopes that technology developed by Shield AI and Heron, and by others, too, could smooth the path to AI technology being inserted into loyal wingman-type drones , like Skyborg , for example, allowing them to operate collaboratively alongside traditional manned fighters, as well as independently, in support of the same mission. The idea is for drones to potentially engage in dogfights (or other complex scenarios, for that matter), while the human pilots focus on overseeing the battle. Other efforts are underway to provide drones with increased autonomy, too, including experiments by General Atomics that have involved semi-autonomous flight tests of the stealthy Avenger drone fitted with a DARPA-developed “autonomy engine.” In particular, ACE is focused on progressing beyond relatively simple autonomous maneuvering to more complex capabilities that would be relevant in an actual combat scenario. The logical conclusion of that line of thinking is future air combat in which fully autonomous drones do battle in the air-to-air domain as well as performing air-to-ground missions, perhaps flying the more hazardous scenarios in which a manned fighter wouldn’t be risked. DARPA In theory, an AI-controlled drone should also be able to perform some missions more effectively than its human-operated counterparts, exploiting the software’s ability to make decisions more rapidly and with greater acuity. The same software advantages would also lend themselves to managing networked swarms of drones, a concept that’s rapidly gaining traction in the United States , as well as among its allies and potential adversaries . A video of the Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology program, or LOCUST , which has tested concepts for networked teams of drones: https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo Then there’s the potential to incorporate this AI technology in manned assets as a “ virtual co-pilot ,” another development strand that the U.S. military, in particular, is starting to take a close look at. It’s telling, however, that the press release from Shield AI and Heron made explicit reference not only to concurrent developments in this field that are happening in China but also to the U.S. Air Force’s Next-Generation Air Dominance , or NGAD, which will field its next fighter aircraft. Recently, it was revealed that the fighter around which NGAD will be based might be fielded in distinct versions, including a longer-range jet optimized for operations in the Indo-Pacific, while manned and unmanned versions are also a key part of the concept at this stage. “Heron has developed the most advanced AI pilot for fighter aircraft in the United States,” Shield AI’s Ryan Tseng stated. “With China already showing comparable results , operationalizing Heron’s work for programs such as Next Generation Air Dominance must be a national security priority.” The particular Chinese program that Tseng was referencing was its own tests of AI-driven aggressors flying against their human counterparts in simulated dogfights. According to Chinese reports, its air force pilots have also regularly lost these encounters, paralleling the results of AlphaDogfight. You can read our analysis of the Chinese reports here . Chinese fighter pilots do battle in a simulator., PLA It also underscores the People’s Liberation Army’s growing interest and investment in the development of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, generally. It is worth remembering, too, that there had been some skepticism around the ability of the AI technology demonstrated during the AlphaDogfight trials to actually perform outside of a simulator. Now, Shield AI and Heron have the chance to prove that they can make it work on a real aircraft, in a live-flying scenario. Momentum is clearly building behind ACE as the Air Force looks to tap into the technologies being explored to benefit both autonomous and semi-autonomous drones, as well as “virtual co-pilots.” Bringing Heron AI’s proven expertise in this field into the ACE program should help further those ambitions, while the fact that China is also apparently pressing ahead in this field makes the requirement to get AI technology into live-flying scenarios all the more important.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. He was from a different era. An era when fighter pilots would meet at the Officer’s Club over a Marlboro Red and a bourbon to debrief the sortie they just flew. A time when the jet did not tell on you, meaning aircrew could get away with a “little more” in terms of altitude, airspeed, and Gs. A time when the fighter pilots were braggadocio enough to consider themselves the cream of the crop but humble enough to know they were prima donnas in the eyes of everyone else. Tomcats . Miramar . TOPGUN . Maybe the attitude just comes with the territory? If you can regularly land a 54,000lbs jet in the dark of night , on top of a moving aircraft carrier the size postage stamp that is bouncing up and down in the froth of some foreign deep ocean—the world can forgive you for being a little too full of yourself. Dale “Snort” Snodgrass, legendary naval aviator and F-14 Tomcat pilot, perished in a single plane crash yesterday in Lewiston, Idaho. He was 72 years old. Snort was all the proverbial things associated with the world’s most famous jet fighter . Larger than life, tough as nails, tactical against the most difficult enemy, and respected across all generations. A “fighter pilot’s fighter pilot” as they say. He lived it, breathed it, promoted it, and flew it. Snodgrass pointing to an image of his F-86’s wing just inches from the ground. He always thrilled with his low passes, no matter what type of aircraft he was flying., AP “I really just wanted to become the best fighter pilot I could be” Snort told an audience at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. Snort did that and even more. This is a must-watch clip of Snort talking about his love affair with the Tomcat, that began before it even flew: The general public knew him first from his multiple stints as the F-14 Demonstration pilot. Later on, Snort made the airshow circuit for more than 20 years flying the F-86 Sabre, among many legendary aircraft. Recently, social media, including many video clips from YouTube and F-14 Tomcat Facebook fan pages, have shown the younger crowd who were not there in person what Snort’s flying achievements looked like in the jet. Undoubtedly, the most famous photo is of Dale’s opening banana pass from the flight deck of the USS America aircraft carrier flight demonstration. In the foreground is the Commander of the Air Wing Jay Johnson, who later became Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), casually watching with his hands behind his back. The huge barreling Tomcat screams by in a right-hand knife-edge pass so close to the ship people think the picture was photoshopped. In reality, it was a well-practiced maneuver with specific airspeed, altitude, and angle of bank performance metrics briefed before the flight and debriefed after. USN But beyond the awe of this photo is a snapshot in time that displays a real-world example of how naval aviation and naval aviators operate: controlled and calculated risk-takers who are the best in the world at what they do. Snort loved naval aviation and considered 1 v 1 air combat with guns only as “the pinnacle of flying an airplane”. During close air combat, “it was who can fly the best jet,” or more accurately, “who can cheat the best” he coyly mentioned. But even the most accomplished of aviators realize flying onboard the aircraft carrier at night is what sets naval aviation apart from its aviation peers. Super pilot Snort was no different: “Every one of those (night traps) I still get sweaty palms”, Snort remarked. Yes, Snort, we all do too (even us RIOs). The list of Snort’s career accomplishments is long. First nugget pilot selected for training in the F-14 Tomcat along with the most hours in the F-14 Tomcat for a pilot. A TOPGUN graduate and US Navy Fighter Pilot of the Year in 1985, plus a tour as Commanding Officer of VF-33 during Operation Desert Storm leading combat missions into Iraq. He rounded out his active duty career as Commander Fighter Wing Atlantic where he spearheaded adding precision strike capability for all Tomcats. In retirement, he would go on to fly some of the world’s most legendary aircraft on the air show circuit and was a founding member and pilot for commercial adversary services provider Draken International. But Snort stands above everyone else in one area: King of the Airshow circuit in the F-14 Tomcat. There are no demos like a Snort demo. Period. Imagine the Tomcat positioned at the end of the runway, nose dipped down like it is ready to prowl on some unsuspecting airshow observer. As Snort begins the takeoff roll, he lights the afterburners and rumbles past show center at 150 knots. With the nose gear still on the ground, Snort yanks the jet up and right, into a dirty wing over, and then inverted, the Tomcats afterburners spewing decibels towards the crowd. Women and children cover their ears. Grown men blush. Naval Aviators stick their chest out. Everyone knows they are about to witness something special. A thousand years from now, we will still talk about Snort and his legendary Tomcat performances. As a member of the final Tomcat Demo team back in 2004, we would meet Snort in various airshows across the country. As the new guys, it was a little intimidating to be around this old salty Tomcat naval aviator. But Snort was always welcoming to us and his best advice after the airshow brief was always to “have fun.” In my mind, he wanted to trade spots with us, but instead, made up the difference in other ways. At one airshow, I specifically remember sitting at the hold short watching Snort perform ahead of us in his F-86 Sabre. As he passed by us, the space between the ground and his wingtip could be measured in inches, not feet. I told my demo pilot, the balding Rocco Tangredi, that Snort could give him a haircut if we could just figure out how to attach clippers to the end of the F-86’s wing! We don’t make them that way anymore. Not because someone else can’t accomplish the same legendary airworthy things Snort did with a newer and more capable jet, but because of the place and time in which the folks like Snort flew and lived. It was a culture of swagger, exuded from the youngest maintainer to the saltiest of aircrew, brought on by the sexiest of fighter jets. Some refer to it as catching lightning in a bottle. One man was able to do just that. Cheers to you Snort—thank you for bringing us along. Anytime Baby!

The state-run China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, or CASC, released a statement earlier today stating that it had successfully carried out the first suborbital test of a reusable space vehicle that can land in a similar fashion to a traditional plane. Details about the test and the spaceplane itself are limited, but CASC has been publicly working on such technologies, ostensibly for commercial use, for years now and had previously said it expected to carry out such a flight test last year. A Chinese-language statement from CASC said that it had launched the spaceplane from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center , which sits in a part of the Gobi Desert in China’s Inner Mongolia region. The corporation said that the vehicle subsequently landed “horizontally” at Alxa Right Banner Badanjilin Airport, which is also in Inner Mongolia and is situated some 220 kilometers, or almost 137 miles, southeast of Jiuquan. No details were provided about the spaceplane’s basic design or performance specifications, or how long the flight lasted, how high it flew, and whether any payloads were aboard at the time. A satellite image of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center., Google Earth A satellite image of Alxa Right Banner Badanjilin., Google Earth Where the Earth’s atmosphere ends and space begins is a matter of debate, but the so-called Karman Line , which is defined as being at an altitude of roughly 62 miles up, is a defined boundary in common usage. “Suborbital” is only defined as a space flight that does not complete a full orbit and could, therefore, involve travel above and below that line. CASC also did not say how the spaceplane gets aloft and stays there, or how it then maneuvers back to Earth. However, back in 2016, the company had described plans for a vehicle that is boosted initially by a traditional space launch rocket and then get the rest of the way with a secondary booster. It would return to Earth in an unpowered mode. A graphic from circa 2016 depicting the method of operation of one of CASC’s planned spaceplanes., HAN PENGXIN / CHINA ACADEMY OF LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY This would fit well with a launch from Jiuquan, which regularly conducts more traditional space launches. Jiuquan was also the site of the launch of another, secretive “ reusable experimental spacecraft ” last year using a Long March 2F carrier rocket. That vehicle appeared to have subsequently landed a remote airstrip near China’s Lop Nor nuclear test site and could be related to a military spaceplane project called Shenlong . This latest spaceplane test, which appears to be unrelated, at least officially, to the one last year, would also align with CASC’s stated plans, as of 2016, to develop such a flight vehicle that could reach the Karman Line. At that time, the projected design was described as an 11-ton vehicle with a wingspan of 21 feet that would be capable of carrying five people. There were also plans for a larger version, an artist’s conception of which is seen at the top of this story, which could carry up to 20 people and that would be able to fly beyond the Karman Line. In addition, in 2017, CASC said that it planned to conduct a flight test of a prototype reusable spacecraft in 2020. That year, the company also outlined a “space transportation roadmap” that included reusable spaceplanes and a nuclear-powered space shuttle . It would not be hard to see how the flight test plans could have been delayed due to a variety of factors, including the complexity of the design and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If the flight test today is indeed related to the projects that CASC was publicly discussing in 2016 and 2017, it would seem that the vehicle in question is ostensibly intended for commercial use. This is bolstered by the fact the flight ended at a public regional airport, rather than an isolated military test center. With this in mind, it’s also worth pointing out that this announcement comes just days after space tourism firm Virgin Galatic’s founder Richard Branson and three other passengers flew to the edge of the Karman Line in the company’s VSS Unity , a Scaled Composites SpaceshipTwo reusable spaceplane. Unlike CASC’s previously stated concepts of operation for its spaceplane designs, however, the SpaceShipTwo design uses a specialized mothership aircraft rather than a traditional space launch rocket to makes its initial ascent. This is a general space launch concept that NASA and the U.S. military , as well as Russia and China , have explored in the past, which you read about more here . At the same time, any reusable spaceplane technology could certainly have military applications. CASC is the primary contractor for the Chinese space program, which is heavily intertwined with the country’s military . Jiuquan is a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) base. Reusable spaceplanes could provide a variety of valuable capabilities for military activities in space, as well as closer to Earth, offering the potential for rapidly transporting personnel and cargo across large distances, as well as a more flexible method for inserting certain payloads into orbit . Reusable spaceplanes could very well carry out offensive actions against hostile space-based assets or defensive missions to protect friendly ones, as well. There has been very similar speculation over the years about exactly what the U.S. military is doing with its own X-37B miniature space shuttle , which is now under the control of the U.S. Space Force . This is just one of a number of similar projects that we know about that the various branches of the U.S. military have pursued since the 1960s , as well. Just this year, the Department of the Air Force, which now includes the Space Force, announced a new formal research and development program, called Rocket Cargo, to explore the possibility of conduct long-range logistics across space using large, potentially reusable suborbital rockets. You can read more about that program here . “The development of reusable space transportation technology is an important symbol of China’s transition from a ‘big’ space-faring nation to a ‘powerful’ space-faring one,” CASC said in the statement today about its spaceplane flight test. It will be interesting to see what new information about CASC’s spaceplane projects might emerge now with this reportedly successful flight of a prototype design.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a highly unusual move, one of the U.S. Air Force’s E-4B Nightwatch aircraft , also known as National Airborne Operations Centers, or NAOCs, touched down today at Tonopah Test Range Airport (TTR), one of the most famous secretive aircraft operating locations in the United States, only surpassed by nearby Area 51. What might have triggered this highly unusual visit is puzzling, to say the least, but it seems it could (me must stress could )have been related to a possible visit to the facility by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. Confirmation of the E-4B’s arrival into TTR was provided using data available from open-source flight data website ADS-B Exchange , with the jet, serial number 74-0787, using the TITAN25 callsign usually assigned when the Secretary of Defense is onboard. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III says farewell to the Chargé d’Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in India, Edgard Kagan, before departing New Delhi, India, last March 20., DoD/Lisa Ferdinando Widely r eferred to as “Doomsday Planes,” the Air Force’s four existing E-4Bs are based on Boeing 747 airframes and are most famous for providing a robust and survivable airborne command post that offers a platform for the President of the United States, under a framework known as the National Command Authority (NCA), to initiate a nuclear strike. The planes have other functions, too, including directing large-scale military operations or a response to other major contingencies, such as major natural disasters. Also among their roles, the Nightwatch jets are often employed as a means of transporting the Secretary of Defense to foreign countries. You can read more about the E-4Bs and their missions, which are an essential component of overarching continuity of government plans , in this past War Zone piece . The E-4B’s flight from Andrews Air Force Base to TTR., FLIGHTAWARE E-4B serial number 74-0787, using the TITAN25 callsign, during its descent into TTR., ADS-B Exchange A C-37A — a Gulfstream V used as a VIP transport by the Air Force — appears to have possibly landed at TTR about an hour before the E-4, although it appears to have turned off its transponder before touching down there, so the final part of its flight cannot be conclusively determined. C-37A serial number 97-0401 apparently en route to TTR., ADS-B Exchange The Secretary of Defense had been expected to leave for a three-country tour of Asia sometime this week, but his exact departure date was not formally confirmed. With that in mind, it’s possible that Austin was making a visit to TTR ahead of leaving for Singapore, his first destination in Asia. It’s notable that the Air Force’s latest Red Flag large-force combat exercise is now underway at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, which might have prompted a visit by the Secretary of Defense to the nearby TTR. Red Flag 21-3, which is making use of the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), is a U.S. forces-centric version of the exercise and is employing F-117 Nighthawks in an aggressor role. Usually, a press team will be is onboard the E-4B if it’s taking the Secretary of Defense on an overseas tour, and the arrival of such an entourage at the notoriously secretive TTR would be a significant event in itself. If press were onboard, they could have been told to wait on the aircraft with shades drawn or, possibly, they were included whatever went on there. But considering the extreme security at TTR, that would be really a major shift in access. The remote and high-security Tonopah Test Range Airport., Google Earth After all, the wider Nevada Test and Training Range area includes the Department of Energy’s legendary nuclear test site , Area 51, and other normally off-limits areas . Of these, TTR is where the F-117 Nighthawk program was run in secret in the 1980s , and where the stealth jet still flies today , while during the Cold War the base also hosted Soviet fighters that were flown clandestinely for testing and as adversaries against American and allied fighters . Today the base is known to support ongoing Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) programs, as well as far more clandestine operations, including those surrounding advanced unmanned aircraft and special operations capabilities. It is the top site in the country where a highly classified program would move from a developmental role at Area 51 into a semi-operational one, while still maintaining secrecy. This would not be the first time a Secretary of Defense has quietly visited components of the NTTR to look at what is waiting in the shadows in terms of next-generation air combat capabilities, but we have never known of a visit to Tonopah and especially aboard an E-4B. Another option is that the E-4B flew into TTR without the Secretary of Defense on board. Either way, we now also have an indication that the aircraft departed the Nevada base after only a few hours, taking off at around 3:00 PM local time, according to online flight-tracking sources. The aircraft is now heading toward Alaska, which would be indicative of a trip to Asia. TITAN25 departs TTR., FLIGHTAWARE Once again, an E-4B visiting Tonopah is weird enough, but going there with the SecDef aboard before a major international tour is even weirder. If this is the case, it could be interpreted that a major program has hit a certain milestone that would prompt such a visit, and maybe, just maybe, disclosure of the system in question is on the horizon. It’s also possible that another VIP was onboard or that there was another reason for the E-4B and C-37 to visit the base. We will continue to look into the background of this highly unusual visit and update this story as we find out more about the aircraft’s next destination. UPDATE: Confirmed, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was onboard: Also, it is quite possible that the C-37 was there to take the SecDef to Area 51. Six hours at TTR is a long time. The C-37 would have been able to make the hop 60 miles to Area 51 without drawing much attention so that he could check out what was going on there, as well. Plenty of time to do it. Could have snuck in there before the Red Flag launch and left after the action died down. I mean, wouldn’t you if you were him?

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The pilot of the U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle whose jet was captured spewing sparks on takeoff from RAF Lakenheath in England, earlier this month, has offered his thanks to the plane spotter who alerted the base to the malfunction. The original incident, which The War Zone was first to report on , was attributed to a fault with one of the engine nozzles. According to a report from the BBC , it was plane spotter Ian Simpson who called the base after seeing that the jet was potentially in trouble. At the time, aviation photographer Matt Smart confirmed to us that someone had phoned the base to inform them and that, prior to then, even the pilots were unaware of what was happening. Sparks fly in the July 13 incident at RAF Lakenheath., MATT SMART Based on online flight tracking data available from ADS-B Exchange , the jet in question took off at approximately 9:02 AM local time and was heading out over the North Sea coast. On seeing the sparks streaming from the right-side Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan , Simpson got through to the field operations group via the Lakenheath switchboard and the base then informed pilot, Major Grant Thompson. Thompson himself told the BBC that he was “100%” sure that Simpson’s actions had saved his life. “His initiative was awesome,” the airman added. Major Thompson confirmed he had no clue that anything was wrong with his jet, serial number 91-0302, assigned to the 492nd Fighter Squadron , the “Madhatters,” part of Lakenheath’s 48th Fighter Wing . “From our perspective, it was a normal takeoff,” Thompson said. After getting the warning from Lakenheath, Thompson followed standard protocol and had his wingman approach close to the jet and take a close look at the engine nozzles, confirming the malfunction and prompting Thompson’s return to base. Happily for Thompson, the sortie ended with no further drama, while Simpson, a long-term spotter at Lakenheath, was thanked in person during a meeting with the pilot earlier this week and even got some swag. Matt Smart Lakenheath, in particular, has developed a good relationship with its very active spotter community, even going so far as to have them serve as unofficial intelligence-gathers , reporting suspicious behaviors around the base and online. It really should be a model of how to engage a community that shares a common passion and cares about the safety and wellbeing of those working at the base and flying from it in the air. On this occasion, thanks to one of those spotters’ quick thinking, a potential catastrophe may well have been averted. Certainly well worth a trucker cap or two.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Senate Armed Services Committee has rejected a USAF proposal that would have seen many A-10 Warthog aircraft being retired. The committee’s proposed fiscal year 2022 defense policy bill would prohibit the Air Force from retiring the A-10s, while Air Force leaders have said that keeping the Warthogs could be a major misstep. News of the Senate saving A-10s from the boneyard was first reported by Valerie Insinna at Defense News . The Air Force had proposed retiring 42 Warthogs, bringing the total number down from 281 to 239 aircraft, with an end goal of bringing the number of active A-10s down to 218 within two years. Insinna reports that Lt. Gen. David Nahom , the Air Force’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and Programs, said that not retiring the A-10s would have “considerable consequences” including higher sustainment and upgrade costs. An A-10C of the 66th Weapons Squadron., Jamie Hunter Naholm is referring to the Air Force’s plans to give its Warthogs new wings, GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs , a new High-Resolution Display System, and a host of other upgrades to extend their operational service through 2030 or beyond, which you can read more about in this past feature of ours . Meanwhile, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida argued in favor of retiring the A-10s in order to free up manpower in support of three new F-35 squadrons at Florida’s Tyndall Air Force Base . That proposal has seen its own share of controversy , as some have claimed that the hurricane-prone base would be a risky place to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure for the fighters. “It is my understanding that language is included in the chairman’s mark of the FY22 NDAA that would prohibit the divestment of 41 A-10 aircraft at the expense of Tyndall’s F-35 squadrons,” Rubio wrote in a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed and Ranking Member James Inhofe. “I urge the committee to remove, or reject, any provision or funding that would jeopardize the strategic basing of three F-35 squadrons at Tyndall,” Rubio wrote. “Including such language would have a significant impact on the Air Force’s F-35 pilot output, our strategic capacity to field F-35s in the event of a conflict, and have grave, long-term implications for the national security of the United States.” An A-10C drops a flare during an exercise at the Nevada Test and Training Range., Jamie Hunter While the A-10s were saved, the bill approved by the Senate would see the retirement of 18 KC-135s and 12 KC-10s. Those divestments are being made in order to make room for the still-struggling KC-46 Pegasus , but the USAF had actually requested to retire 14 KC-10s total. In addition, the Air Force wants to retire 48 F-15C/D Eagles , 47 of its older F-16C/D Vipers , four E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management aircraft, and halt purchases of MQ-9 Reaper UAVs. A full list of the significant airpower developments in this year’s budget proposals can be found here . Overall, the Senate’s proposed bill would add $25 billion more to the National Defense Authorization Act. An A-10 taxis into position after landing at Nellis Air Force Base, USAF/A1C Joshua Kleinholz The fact that the Senate is attempting to save dozens of Warthogs from retirement underscores how the nearly 50-year-old aircraft remains at the forefront of the Air Force’s close air support (CAS) mission despite attempts to replace the A-10 with F-35s for the same role. The Air Force has been trying to retire the A-10 for most of its life and the last major push came during the last decade, but failed. However, with every decrease in size of the A-10 fleet, there is less return on investment and even more vulnerability for further cuts . Still, despite claims of being vulnerable to modern air defenses, the aircraft’s combination of heavy armor, endurance, low-speed agility and formidable firepower still make it a terrifying presence for opponents on the ground. For those reasons, the A-10 is likely here to stay for the near future, but just how many will be flying in the years to come remains unclear. If the Senate Armed Services Committee gets its way, for the time being, the entire Warthog fleet would stay intact and slated for upgrade. Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com Brett Tingley"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 20, 2021",The Navy’s Next Attack Submarine Will Be An “Apex Predator” According To Undersea Warfare Chief,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s future nuclear attack submarine , or SSN(X), should bring together the best fighting qualities of its predecessors and provide the service with what one top admiral described as the “ultimate apex predator.” This, and other details, emerged on Wednesday, July 21st, that shed some more light on a program that remains extremely secretive and is still in its early stages. Rear Admiral Bill Houston, the director of the Undersea Warfare Division within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, spoke about his hopes for the new hunter-killer submarine during a panel discussion as part of the Navy League’s Sea Air Space 2021 event. Currently the Navy’s newest and most advanced nuclear-powered attack submarine is the Virginia class, but its successor is already in the works and is planned to be optimized for defeating high-end submarine enemies., U.S. Navy According to Houston, quoted by Defense News , the next-generation attack submarine should combine the payload and speed of the Seawolf class with the acoustics and sensors of the Virginia class . Those are two of the SSN classes that the new design is planned to succeed, the other being the Cold War-era Los Angeles class . However, SSN(X) should also incorporate the operational availability and service life of the Columbia class , the Navy’s hugely expensive next-generation ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), another new design that you can read more about here . The result should be a new class of hunter-killer that’s “going to be faster, carry a significant punch, bigger payload, larger salvo rate; it’s going to have acoustic superiority,” Houston confirmed. “We’re taking what we already know how to do and combining it together,” Houston added, noting that he was confident it would be possible to “mesh together” these various attributes in a single platform. At the same time, however, it’s clear that the Navy is at least considering incorporating some new-generation technologies in the SSN(X) as well, including, for example, a potential inflatable sail to enhance speed, maneuverability, and acoustic stealth. That the SSN(X) would leverage technology being developed for the Columbia class was already expected , together with the fact that it would likely be wider than the Virginia class. In fact, there may be scope for further spin-offs from the Columbia design, too, with thought having been given to a conventionally-armed, multi-purpose “ Large Payload Submarine ,” using the same hull form, for example. An artist’s conception of the future USS Columbia ., U.S. NAVY It certainly sounds as though the Navy wants its future attack submarines to focus on the same kinds of performance as the highly capable Seawolf class. These boats were schemed as the ultimate hunter-killers at the end of the Cold War, but spiraling costs saw the class restricted to just three hulls: USS Seawolf , plus USS Connecticut and USS Jimmy Carter . As a result, the boats have been widely used for developmental and special mission roles. The Jimmy Carter, with its big hull plug, is a one-off special missions submarine that deals largely in undersea espionage and highly classified operations. The subsequent Virginia class, in contrast, is officially termed an attack submarine but is in fact more of a multi-purpose type. Smaller and less expensive than the Seawolf , it has vertical launch system cells for firing Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and is optimized for operations in littoral environments, where it can be used to collect intelligence and insert and extract special operations forces. Already, it seems, the SSN(X) will likely mark a return to a laser focus on the classic hunter-killer attributes: speed, stealth, and potentially also on tube-launched torpedo weaponry to kill other submarines and ships, rather than vertical launch systems to attack targets on land. That would tally also with a 2018 report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that suggested the SSN(X) design would be expected to carry up 62 torpedoes or other torpedo tube-launched weapons, including anti-ship missiles, such as the UGM-84 Harpoon , plus future anti-ship weapons, and might do away with the vertical launch capability altogether. Sailors assigned to the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Columbia load a Mark 48 advanced capability torpedo., U.S. NAVY A high-end attack submarine makes sense for the Navy, especially when China and Russia are adding increasingly powerful new submarines to their fleets and operating them closer to U.S. areas of interest . “It really needs to be ready for that major combat operations, it’s going to need to be able to go behind enemy lines and deliver that punch,” Houston said of the SSN(X). “It needs to be able to deny an adversary the ability to operate in their bastion regions.” All this raises the question of how the Navy will be able to pay for such a sophisticated design, which will surely come with a price tag to match. After all, as well as developing the new attacks boats, the Navy will have to fund the Columbia class, continue production of the last of the Virginia class, and run repairs on other submarines already in service. The Navy will also have to fund the underwater drones that Houston expects will operate closely alongside SSNs of the future. He said that he envisages attack submarines controlling small and medium unmanned underwater vessels (UUVs) themselves, while larger UUVs are operated from shore installations. In any case, all this needs to be paid for, too. A 2018 briefing slide showing the wide range of UUVs in development for the Navy., U.S. NAVY It will be a challenge to avoid the same pitfalls that befell the Seawolf class, but by drawing upon the Columbia design, the service might be able to make some savings through commonality. The SSN(X) and Columbia sharing a hull-form, shortened for the hunter-killer boats, as The War Zone has suggested , might be a possibility. But by pointing specifically to the new SSBN’s “operational availability and service life,” Rear Admiral Houston at least suggested that these new boats are expected to offer value for money, with longer lifespans and reduced maintenance requirements compared to current SSNs. If leveraged that, at least, could help drive down costs associated with SSN(X). Another option that Houston suggested was to time the Columbia and SSN(X) programs such that production of the first could be scaling back just as the manufacturing effort for the latter begins stepping up. That, however, depends upon the research, development, and tests efforts of the SSN(X) being wrapped up in time, with any delays to the timeline potentially becoming very costly. Similarly, if anything goes wrong with the Columbia program, that could have a knock-on effect for SSN(X). Apart from maintaining a qualitative edge in underwater warfare, SSN(X) is also of fundamental importance to the Navy as it seeks to increase its atttack submarine fleet from the 50 boats now in service to the 70 examples that are projected under the Battle Force 2045 plan. To meet that target, the Navy will not only have to build new submarines but keep existing ones in service longer than planned, which will entail potentially costly refits and upgrades. The Los Angeles class submarine USS Santa Fe during a joint training exercise with four Royal Australian Navy Collins class submarines, in waters around Australia., U.S. NAVY The Navy’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget requests $98 million in research and development funding for SSN(X), but procurement of two boats per year is not expected until Fiscal Year 2034. The Congressional Budget Office expects that each boat will cost between $5.8 and $6.2 billion. Even taking inflation into account, that is a hefty increase over the Virginia class, each of which cost around $3.45 billion with its expanded payload module , or about $2.8B without. All in all, it seems abundantly clear that what the Navy wants for its next-generation attack submarine is a design that can offer the high-end capabilities of a next-generation Seawolf- like class in a more modern hull. While that ambition seems achievable, finding the budget to buy these boats in significant numbers promises to be a challenge in itself.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 30, 2021",U.S. Weighs Deploying Balloons To Provide Internet Access To Cubans During Crackdown,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the aftermath of the Cuban government’s response to protests throughout the country, the United States government is weighing what options it has for restoring communication services on the island nation. Internet service is currently suspended throughout Cuba, and some ham radio frequencies are even being jammed in Florida, preventing even rudimentary communications with the island. In an attempt to remedy the situation and reestablish communication networks in the one-party socialist republic, some officials in the United States government have proposed launching sophisticated high-altitude balloons made by Raven Aerostar over Cuba to provide wireless internet access from above. While the plan sounds good on paper, there are some doubts about how well it could work. Concept art from a Raven Aerostar promotional video demonstrating how only a few balloons can establish a wide-area communications network., Raven Aerostar via YouTube The protests in Cuba began earlier this month in response to widespread shortages of food and other vital resources like medical treatment. According to some observers , many protestors feel the Cuban government has been investing too heavily in tourism while overtaxing the general population and catering to foreign investment rather than shoring up the national economy. Cuba hasn’t seen widespread public protests in over 60 years, except for the occasional state-organized protest, as defiance of this nature is illegal in Cuba. Some protestors are now facing up to 20 years in prison for their participation. The Cuban government, meanwhile, has blamed the protests on American-sponsored counterrevolutionaries. Protesters in Havana on July 11, 2021, AP/Eliana Aponte Images of protesters being beaten or detained by police painted a grisly picture of the Cuban government’s response to the protests, but definitive information about what is happening in Cuba can be difficult to come by due to the fact that communication with the island is so limited. The Cuban government has even been accused of sharing fake news immediately after reports of the protests began to spread. According to a 2017 white paper published by the non-profit Freedom House, Cuba has “the most repressive media environment” and “the most restrictive laws on freedom of expression and the press” in the Americas. Freedom House notes that while there are a growing number of independent news outlets on the island, the Cuban government heavily restricts the information coming into and out of the country: Government publications come out irregularly, and their reports often lack details considered to be “sensitive.” Journalists must receive authorization from the relevant government department to gain access to press conferences and other information; independent reporters are typically denied this access. The Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) censors official media through its Ideology Department, formerly known as the Department of Revolutionary Orientation. Editors and reporters are responsible for adhering to the department’s “thematic plan,” which details which topics to cover and how to cover them. Some independent journalists who favor the government stay within the guidelines, while some critics try to dance around them and others disregard them and risk the consequences. Internet service, meanwhile, is reportedly expensive and relatively new in Cuba, at least among the broader public. While the Associated Press claims that more than half of Cubans today have internet access, the Cuban government owns the domestic telecom service and heavily restricts and censors what Cuban people can access. A protestor being detained in Havana on July 11, 2021., AP/Ramon Espinosa In response to the Cuban government restricting internet access in the wake of the protests, some members of the U.S. government are considering using high-altitude balloons in order to provide Cuban residents with some form of internet service. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida recently called on President Joe Biden to “immediately authorize and allocate funding to provide emergency connectivity to the internet for Cuba through balloon-supplied internet coverage.” According to Politico , FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr stated that high-altitude balloons made by Raven Aerostar are a “proven technology” that could be deployed just 20 miles north of Cuba in international waters, 70 miles south of Key West. Carr mentioned two other cases in which Raven balloons have been used to operationally provide internet service, one in remote areas of Kenya , and another in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017. Brendan Carr, center, commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, speaks during a news conference at the offices of Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., alongside Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, left, and Marcell Felipe, right, founder of the Inspire America Foundation., AP/Wilfredo Lee Raven previously worked with Google’s parent company Alphabet on the Loon project, manufacturing the balloons used in Loon’s tests of technologies to provide high-speed internet to rural or diaster-stricken areas. That effort shut down in January, but Raven Aerostar is still making the high-tech balloons for a number of different applications. Earlier this year, Raven’s balloons appeared off both U.S. coasts , sometimes hovering in the same general area, even against the prevailing winds, for extended periods of time by varying their altitude in order to leverage variations in wind patterns. According to some estimates, the balloons are able to stay on station for up to 30 days. The Department of Defense has been a major partner in some of Raven Aerostar’s endeavors. Naval Sea Systems Command awarded the balloon manufacturers a five-year contract in 2020 to develop unmanned systems, and Raven engineers were previously awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center for their work in high-altitude surveillance platforms in Afghanistan. U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) sponsored the development of similar Raven Aerostar platforms for use in anti-narcotics operations and disaster relief which were tested over the American midwest. A Raven Thunderhead balloon., Raven Aerostar In addition to serving as communication nodes as has been suggested in Cuba, the balloons can also carry a wide variety of advanced radar sensors, electronic intelligence systems, electronic warfare packages, optical payloads, and much more. Multiple Raven balloons can set up advanced networking capabilities among themselves, and can stay at high altitudes out of the range of many anti-air systems. While some of these capabilities can be offered by satellites, balloon launches are exponentially cheaper and can be performed much more rapidly. They also have far better persistence than many satellites, especially those in low earth orbit. You can read all about these revolutionary balloon systems and their applications in this prior feature of ours . This current case in Cuba is different than previous deployments of Raven balloons to provide internet services, however, as it would be in direct response to a foreign government’s actions against its own people. “The first move that brutal dictators make around the world is to shut down the internet to block messaging apps, because the thing that communist dictators like least is the bright light of international attention, the world’s eyes, seeing what is going on inside their regime,” FCC commissioner Carr said at a press conference with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and U.S. Representatives María Elvira Salazar and Carlos Giménez. Salazar added that “We’re not talking about Netflix-quality video; we’re talking about just the ability to lift the videos that show how they’re being beaten on the streets.” Meanwhile, an unnamed Biden administration official told The Washington Post that the White House “will be actively collaborating with the private sector to identify creative ways to ensure that the Cuban people have access to the free flow of information on the Internet,” but did not elaborate further. Telecom experts told the outlet that providing a network without a license to operate in Cuba would be in violation of international law. Despite the fact that the FCC commissioner feels the idea of sending balloons to reestablish some form of internet services in Cuba is sound, some have cast doubts on the efficacy of such a plan. One Internet services consultant told the Washington Post that the idea was a “Hollywood scenario.” Speaking to the Associated Press , satellite communications consultant Tim Farrar says such a network of balloons would be insufficient to provide the entire island nation with internet coverage. In addition, any wireless internet service the balloons provide would need a sufficiently large unused section of the radio frequency spectrum, and would ultimately be prone to jamming efforts by the Cuban government. There have already been reports that the Cuban government is actively jamming ham radio frequencies used to communicate with operators in Florida. Amateur radio operator and Cuban exile Alex Valladares posted a video to YouTube demonstrating what he claims is “malicious interference” on a wide band of radio frequencies. In addition, several amateur radio operators told IEEE Spectrum that they believe a “ coordinated jamming effort ” is underway. Meanwhile, the American Radio Relay League, which calls itself the “national association for Amateur Radio,” said that “there’s no proven connection between the jamming and the protests, as evidence has been circumstantial.” Nevertheless, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gave a statement to Motherboard stating it is “assessing these reports in conjunction with our field agents and communicating with the Department of State as this issue develops.” Cuba reportedly has a long history with jamming radio frequencies in Florida . If these reports are true, it would seem the Cuban government is attempting to restrict even the most basic forms of communication from the island. Special forces police parked outside of the National Capitol building in Havana, Cuba, Wednesday, July 14, 2021., AP/Eliana Aponte While the debate over whether the United States will send Raven Aerostar balloons near the island nation is still ongoing, these balloons could end up being the right technology available at the right time to provide a way around information suppression by dictatorships during a major crackdown or crisis. If they are put to use over Cuba, at the very least it could serve as a test as to their utility and it could offer a better understanding as to how to employ them under similar circumstances in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Big, turbulent shifts are underway in the U.S. military as those in charge try to rebalance future capability wants against accessible combat capacity today. For instance, a reduction and reshuffling of types are planned across the U.S. Air Force’s tactical jet fleet in the decade to come, and both the U.S. Navy and the Air Force are pivoting to what comes next in terms of tactical airpower in the form of their Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiatives . Yet long-range combat aviation is arguably under the most pressure. A new target of building 149 B-21 Raiders is taking shape, held up by the hope that what’s left of the B-1 fleet will stay solvent long enough to be replaced by some of those new stealth bombers. At the same time, the B-52 is slated to soldier on for decades to come , hopefully with new engines, but even that initiative is hitting financial headwinds .Â Even if these plans come to fruition, there will still likely be a long-range strike deficit as adversaries enhance their anti-access capabilities. As such, it’s fairly clear that the Department of Defense (DoD), as a whole, isn’t nearly as well equipped as it needs to be today should it get into a shooting match where long-range airpower becomes absolutely essential, such as during a war in the Pacific, and it will likely still struggle to meet demands in the decades to come. Yet there is one airframe in the inventory today that seems strangely overlooked for its potential to alleviate some of this pressure, as well as to help nullify other major pressure points among the DoD’s collective air combat inventory. Its economy, serviceability, extreme flexibility, and its ability to play a major role in any type of future fight the U.S. enters into, including one with a towering peer-state adversary like China, as well as playing critical roles in peacetime, is unrivaled. The aircraft I am referring to is Boeing’s P-8 Poseidon , but not in its current configuration. P-8 launching a trio of AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles during a test. , US Navy Untapped Opportunity In most regards, the P-8 has been a major success. It is a versatile tool that leverages the most understood airliner airframe on earth at its core. While maritime patrol may be its central functionality, it has already proven itself well suited for electronic intelligence gathering and for toting outsized sensors for specialized missions . There is a very strong argument to be made that there are not enough P-8s slated for the Navy’s inventory in order to pick up where the P-3 Orion left off, and especially in a new era of expanded submarine warfare, but that is not the focus of this piece. While the P-8’s ability to fulfill other roles is convenient, those other functions distract the relatively tiny fleet of a planned 128 examples from its highly critical primary mission set. In fact, the aircraft has so much latent potential, which is now slated to increasingly get unlocked via the addition of a slew of new weaponry and podded systems , that one can only imagine maritime patrol will continue to compete with everything else it can do. And since a P-8 can only be in one place at one time, regardless of how capable and versatile it is, this is a problem that seems to be demanding some sort of solution. That solution could, and very well should, go beyond the Navy. Instead of thinking just about how the Navy can buy more P-8s as they are configured today, the Air Force, possibly in cooperation with the Navy, should also be examining the idea of buying a variant of the P-8 that is stripped down to its bare essentials. In effect creating an off-the-shelf, highly economical, and sustainable arsenal ship and sensor platform that can perform a huge array of tasksâ€”submarine hunting and traditional maritime patrol not being one of them. P-8A carrying four AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles at a Middle East operating location. , USN What I am proposing here is an ‘RB-8’ of sorts. A P-8 stripped of all its maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare gear, aside from the relevant parts of its communications capabilities, defensive aid systems, FLIR turret, and outstanding electronic support measures (ESM) suite. In its nose, an off-the-shelf scalable fighter AESA radar would be installed. A substantial amount of its internal volume would be left empty, aside from packing as much additional fuel onboard wherever possible and housing a trio of open-architecture mission specialist/weapon systems officer consoles behind the cockpit. It would also retain the P-8’s current sonobuoy launchers and racks. Â What’s key here is that the P-8’s development is totally paid for. Its evolution continues with new weapons and other capabilities being added. With seven allied export customers now taking part in the program, sustainment of the type will be economical as it can be for decades to come.Â A fully-equipped P-8A has a unit cost of $175 million, and a 737-800 costs roughly $85 million new. One could imagine an additional large block buy of this stripped-down variant could be had somewhere in between, let’s just throw a number on it, say $130 million. What the total force would get for that price tag, roughly just 50% more than the price of an F-35A, would be absolutely outstanding. In fact, one could argue that it would be the most flexible, economical, and relevant combat aircraft in the entire arsenal.Â Norway’s first P-8A rolling off the assembly line in early July 2021., Forsvarmateriell Standoff Weapons Truck With this whittled-down base ‘RB-8’ model, the Air Force would get an aircraft capable of executing electronic surveillance missions just like the P-8 does today. This would free up the Navy’s P-8s for more maritime patrol-related tasksâ€”especially anti-submarine warfare operations. But where the aircraft would really shine is in its ability to adapt to any combat scenario. The P-8 has four wing pylons. Each of these stores stations, which are rated at 2,500 pounds, are able to carry standoff cruise missiles , such as AGM-84 Harpoons and SLAM-ERs , and eventually the stealthy Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). If the P-8 can carry LRASM, the RB-8 can carry its land-attack sister weapon, the Joint Air-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) , as well as LRASM, and more types of advanced air-launched standoff weapons are on the way . But unlike a fighter, it can carry those weapons over thousands of miles from an aerial refueling tanker, like U.S. bomber aircraft. Â Four JASSMs delivered for standoff attacks by fighters flying from bases thousands of miles from their launch points in the Pacific would require a large tanker commitment. The RB-8 would require a fraction of those resources and it could actually execute that mission with near-737 efficiency, which is far cheaper and more reliable than a bomber or even a jet transport aircraft.Â An AGM-84 Harpoon gets loaded onto a P-8’s wing pylon., USN While using transport aircraft to chuck JASSMs at enemy targets by deploying them via air-dropped pallet is certainly a worthy endeavor to continue to explore, in reality, during any major conflict, especially one in the Pacific, America’s airlift fleet will be pushed to its breaking point just trying to keep up with the basic logistics needed to sustain the war effort. So, unless you buy many more expensive transport aircraftâ€”of which no Western long-range jet-powered types are in productionâ€”it’s questionable just how useful this capability will be, at least in terms of sustained combat capacity.Â Also, aside from the special operations MC-130s , these aircraft don’t have the advanced ESM and self-defense suites that the RB-8 inherently does, making them more vulnerable to hostile forces, even far from the front lines. With the P-8 already getting towed electronic warfare-enabled decoys , its ability to survive even an unforeseen and more advanced threat will dramatically increase. P-8 Armed with four Harpoons executing aerial refueling from a KC-135R. , USAF In addition to its wing stations, inside the P-8’s weapons bay, there are five hardpoints, each capable of carrying 1,000 pounds. Mk 54 torpedoes, which weigh about 500 pounds each, are the baseline weapon of choice for the P-8 weapons bay, along with Quickstrike mines . It would seem that this same bay could hold between 10 and 20 GBU-53/B StormBreakers , previously known as Small Diameter Bomb IIs (SDB II). The precision-guided munitions can hit moving targets in any conditions at over 40 miles from their launch points, which gives them a brutal anti-ship capability, especially against swarms of small boats in the littorals. A torpedo gets loaded into a P-8’s weapons bay. , USN Alternatively, 500-pound or 1,000-pound JDAMs or laser-guided bombs, or even five small cruise missiles capable of standoff attacks, such as Israel’s Delilah or the new Sea Breaker anti-ship missile , could be carried internally. Israel is already intending on selling Sea Breaker to the United States. Finally, advanced air-launched decoys, like Miniature Air-Launched Decoy X (MALD-X) , could be launched from the weapons bay.Â A nice peek inside a P-8's weapons bay… pic.twitter.com/aQFqpuOxhw — AncientSubHunter ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±ðŸŒ» (@AncientSubHunt) October 21, 2017 Outfitted with a fighter’s modular AESA radar , the RB-8 could also potentially carry air-to-air missiles, providing for its own contingency defensive air capability. In fact, this aircraft, with its inherent networking capability, could also carry outsized very long-range air-to-air missiles , or air-to-air missile delivery systems , on its external pylons, as well, acting as a remote arsenal ship for fighters deployed far downrange.Â Swarm Mothership Things get even more interesting when we look at the infrastructure left over from the RB-8’s maritime patrol predecessor. The P-8 can carry 129 A-sized sonobuoys . The aircraft has three L3 Harris Sonobuoy Launching Systems, which are automated rotary launchers that can fire 10 sonobuoys in rapid succession before reloading, which happens inside the cabin. The P-8 also has individual manual sonobuoy launchers. While sonobuoys really don’t apply to our notional RB-8, although they could assist in seeding sonobuoy screens alongside their P-8 cousins, small drones can be deployed within the form factor of these A-sized sonobuoy tubes. Packing UAVs into this size sonobuoy tube was an initiative dating back to 2004. Fast forward to today and there are remarkably advanced off-the-shelf drone options.Â A P-8’s sonobuoy storage area as well as the three automated rotary launcher systems installed behind the rack areas. 129 can be equipped but that could be expanded further with additional racks., USN For instance, the ALTIUS-500 was built to be launched from an A-sized sonobuoy launcher-equipped platform at altitude. The ALTIUS-500 has a range of over 150 miles and can be configured for a number of roles, although today it is made to act as a magnetic anomaly detector drone for submarine hunting. Just using what is leftover from the P-8, 30 of these, or a similar drone type that can fit into the A sonobuoy’s form factor, such as Raytheon’s Coyote , could be launched in rapid succession. Three additional reloads of 30 drones could be carried and quickly deployed in successive waves. We are talking about an amazing ability to rapidly deploy an overwhelming standoff swarming capabilityâ€”one that could include any mix of surveillance, electronic warfare, decoy, and kinetic types in a single swarm.Â A Coyote UAS in its sonobuoy tube configuration., Via NOAA.gov The A-size sonobuoy launchers already included in the stock P-8 even have the ability Â to deploy stacks of 32 tiny CICADA drones in one shot. The point being, the existing launchers can be used to turn the P-8 into a seamless swarm delivery system/mothership and it also has space and communications to control those swarms once launched. But things get even more interesting when you add apertures in the P-8’s fuselage to support Common Launch Tube (CLT) weapons and pressurized launchersâ€”like those found on the KC-130 Harvest Hawk . This opens up a huge array of possibilities for more advanced internally launched weapons and drones. The ‘derringer door’-mounted pressurized launchers and Common Launch Tube rack on a KC-130J Harvest Hawk., Lockheed Martin The ALTIUS-600 is becoming more and more popular as the go-to air-launched drone because it has been thoroughly tested and is extremely adaptable. Each weighs 27 pounds and can carry a seven-pound payload. This can include electronic warfare systems, signals intelligence and reconnaissance payloads, and a potent shaped-charge warhead. They are also capable of working cooperatively together in a swarm. Most importantly, the ALTIUS-600 has a range of Â roughly 275 miles , giving it true long-range standoff capability. Area-I Because a good portion of the notional RB-8’s cabin will be unused, packing it with tube racks for various CLT-compatible weapons turns it into an even more potent arsenal ship. A swarm of a couple of dozen ALTIUS-600 drones loaded with EW, intelligence, networking relay, and explosive payloads coming at an enemy low over the horizon from hundreds of miles away, and launching them from a distance thousands of miles from a tanker, while providing on-station command, control, and monitoring of the swarm, is one brutally powerful capability.Â Being able to deliver multiple types of swarms and standoff weapons, and layering those into a target area, including against a naval flotilla or a set of well-defended shore targets, would pose a huge challenge to an enemy. The drones could provide stand-in jamming support, decoy, and suppression of enemy air defenses to ensure an incoming cruise missile strike, even one also launched by RB-8, is successful, for instance. In fact, the RB-8 could assist other aircraft with their own strikes, layering in swarms of jet-powered and lower-end decoys in order to make sure a large strike package of other aircraft is able to hit their own targets. Likewise, a single RB-8 could launch a devastating attack on a surface action group, using a mix of swarms, air-launched decoys, and cruise missiles from standoff ranges. And all that can be launched by a single aircraft with minimal modifications.Â Close Air Support Arsenal Ship What’s so exceptional about the RB-8 concept is that it wouldn’t just be a standoff weapons truck intended for a peer-state conflict. Its long endurance, 737-like economy, defensive suite, large electricity-generating capability, and wide array of payload options would allow it to be an outstanding close-air support and armed overwatch asset in more permissive airspace. It could stay on station for up to 10 hours without needing aerial refueling support. That is a far cry from fighters that can require refueling as constant as nearly every hour. Its powerful FLIR could help with identifying targets down below and additional electro-optical/IR targeting capabilities could be added by bolting targeting pods or other sensor payloads onto one of its wing stations or fuselage attachment points. Best of all, a standard crew of as many as five could work very complex CAS situations simultaneously.Â The P-8 already has very strong overland capabilities. The RB-8 would be a massively flexible airborne arsenal ship and surveillance platform. , USAF In addition, 2,000-pound class bombs could be carried on its wing pylons, although those shouldn’t be required on the majority of close air support missions. Its weapons bay could be packed with five JDAMs or laser-guided bombs, or at least double that in Small Diameter Bombs, while internally, a deep arsenal of Viper Strike , Griffin , and other Common Launch Tube-capable precision-guided weapons can be employed as needed, similar to how AC-130s and Harvest Hawks operate, but at jet speeds and altitudes. Even better would be the addition of a small guided direct attack munition that could fit within the confines of an A-type sonobuoy tube. Drones can also be launched to provide additional eyes overhead areas that are outside of the RB-8 direct line-of-sight, but not beyond the reach of its Small Diameter Bombs, small cruise missiles, or its warhead-armed drones. With SDB alone, in many cases, it could theoretically provide close air support to multiple areas within about a 40-mile radius without turning to more advanced powered standoff weapons. Using its drones as reconnaissance platforms and munitions, that engagement range could be extended to over 250 miles. RB-8 launched drones could also be used to provide additional electronic surveillance or electronic warfare capabilities, work as communications relay platforms over mountainous terrain, or be used as loitering munitions. They could even possibly be used to intercept other hostile drones .Â Electronic Missions With Ease Bolting on a readily available system like the Intrepid Tiger II pod could also provide multi-role electronic warfare and communications intelligence support. Likewise, carrying the ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye radar pod could enhance the RB-8’s ability to engage targets in any weather conditions and track enemy movements on the ground, finding enemy vehicles to stick its StormBreakers on. Self-protection jamming pods and towed decoys, paired with the RB-8’s high-situational awareness, could allow it to execute these missions even along the fringes of higher-threat environments. Intrepid Tiger II pod on an F/A-18 Hornet., USN Once again, it can do this at jet speeds. As such, it can respond to areas of need faster than its turboprop-powered counterparts.Â Basically, if CAS is largely platform-agnostic as USAF’s leadership have repeatedly claimed, ok, then you don’t need a B-1B for it or an F-16. An RB-8 would be far more flexible, effective, persistent, and economical, and could provide for a far more independent concept of operations. The RB-8 would be easily adaptable for other, non-kinetic roles. The airframe has already proven its ability to carry massively outsized radars and communications antenna farm pods using its under-fuselage attachment points . So, for the RB-8, anything you can strap on the wing or belly could potentially be employed. This could include powerful standoff jamming systems and even things like directed energy weapons that may be too cumbersome for a fighter aircraft to easily carry or too hard to integrate into a stealth bomber.Â A P-8 carrying the massive AN/APS-154 Advanced Airborne Sensor under its fuselage., @CVVHRN A critical communications gateway system is another possibility, a capability that will become increasingly important as time goes and that can take advantage of the aircraft’s existing communications suite. It’s also worth noting that the P-8 produces a lot of electrical powerâ€”it has extra generators that a standard 737 does not haveâ€”which would help when it comes to accommodating these types of power-hungry systems. Boeing is also actively developing an open-architecture and modular pod system for mounting on the P-8’s fuselage. This system, known as the Multi-Mission Pod (MPP), will make integrating new outsized payloads onto the P-8, or a notional RB-8, simpler, as it will work directly with the aircraft’s open-architecture mission system. Furthermore, Boeing tells us its form factor “has been very carefully engineered to add capability and versatility while maintaining P-8â€™s ability to fly anywhere between 41,000 and 200 feet, fast or slow, near or far as the target and mission demands. It will not impact P-8â€™s flight profile.” As such, if you can fit it into the general form factor of the pod and it meets other basic requirements, it can be flown on the airframe without impacting its flight envelope. This will greatly streamline flight testing of new payloads, as well.Â A rendering showing the Multi-Mission Pod on the P-8., Boeing There is also the issue of unmanned aircraft control, not just for small drones, but also for loyal wingmen and even more advanced unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). The RB-8 could operate as a forward control center for these largely autonomous systems. This concept of operations is especially relevant for loyal wingmen-like drones that will act as high-value asset protectors, an idea that is quickly gaining traction.Â General Atomics high-value airborne asset “Defender” concept., General Atomics For instance, the Royal Australian Air Force’s Air Teaming System (ATS) will likely be monitored and directed from tanker and/or airborne early warning aircraft , as well as fighters. Similar concepts are being pushed and even tested in the United States . The RB-8, with its open-architecture interface, would be ideal for this role and the drones’ presence would give the plane a huge boost in survivability for operations in contested environments. Basically, it could provide an organic and highly dynamic self-escort capability. The RB-8 could also employ the advanced drones in offensive roles, as well.Â Finally, the notional RB-8 could even fulfill light transport and on-demand logistics duties for small cargoes in a pinch. Simply put, the future growth and adaptability potential of an RB-8 would be unlike any other combat aircraft out there. Just how fast new or even existing capabilities could be added to it is a major sell in itself.Â Onboard the P-8., USN An Extreme Value Proposition Rewinding a bit, it must be made clear that above all else, the RB-8 could provide an economical, very low-risk path to extra long-range strike capacity in the near term. This is in addition to the secondary electronic intelligence collection mission that is already endemic to the over-tasked P-8 community. Currently, the need for the long-range strike mission set outstrips the capacity at hand, and despite the Air Force’s current plans, this situation could get worse long before it gets better. Procuring RB-8 aircraft would certainly offer some breathing room until the B-21 fully comes online and the tired B-1Bs can be finally pulled from service . After that, they can continue to augment the bomber force, while also addressing many additional mission sets that would be a poor, even fiscally irresponsible use of B-21 flight hours, or even those of an upgraded B-52. Procuring the RB-8 would also help offset some of the risks posed by the USAF’s aging aircraft fleet. While the B-52 is a marvelous warfighting machine, it continues to age. What the next few decades of service will look like for the bomber as it approaches its 100th birthday can only be predicted. The RB-8 fleet would help hedge against any unforeseen issues with the type, and with the ultra-high-tech B-21, for that matter. ""44% of U.S. Air Force aircraft are flying beyond their initial design service life."" – General Nahom, Dep. Chief For Plans & Programs — Mackenzie Eaglen (@MEaglen) July 21, 2021 As far as actually seeing an RB-8 come to fruition, the problem is when you talk about buying something, no matter how ‘off-the-shelf’ it is, many will see it as a threat to other existing “sacred cow” programs. While it is important that the USAF buys enough B-21s, and 149 may be needed, anything with a major price tag that can help out with a portion of its mission set is viewed as some existential impediment to reaching that production number goal. There may be some truth to this, but at the same time, it is a poor way of looking at force structure, one that has done far more harm than good in recent decades.Â The fact of the matter is 149 B-21s and 75 upgraded B-52s won’t be enough in terms of long-range weapons delivery platforms. The RB-8 can help pick up the slack at a very low comparative cost. And really, if it is going to suck funding from other sources, it should be spread more evenly based on all the missions it can doâ€”from alleviating pressure on the concerningly geriatric manned electronic intelligence gathering fleet to doing the same for the fighter community in terms of close air support. This holistic point of view will not place its required funding all at the expense of one program or another. The B-21 is an extremely high-end asset that comes at a cost of around $650M per copy. The operating expenses will be high, there is no way around that. The RB-8 can help offset some of the B-21’s demand while also being available to execute a huge array of other missions., USAF By producing say 75 RB-8, at the cost of 15 B-21s (the latter of which will cost very optimistically around $650 million per copy), this could go a long way in providing more standoff strike capacity, and more flexible capacity at that, without digging deeply into the B-21’s production numbers. You could say the same thing for F-35A. Would you rather have another 110 F-35As or 75 EB-8s? In the big scheme of things, I think with the multitude of long-range, high-endurance missions it could accomplish, and the huge array of weapons it could carry, it would be hard to argue for the relatively short-ranged F-35As considering many hundreds are already in the inventory.Â So, maybe cut it in half, the tactical and strategic side of the equation both gives up something, like seven B-21s and 58 F-35s. And what about the strategic intelligence gathering community? Maybe they could pitch in a bit as well. Their fleet of aging RC-135-based airframes could surely use some augmentation, at least as an interim measure. There is also the possibility of working with the Navy to make this a joint program. P-8 makes a turn with its weapons bay doors open., USN Once again, these are just some examples of how we can view the RB-8 program if we have to look at every procurement opportunity as robbing Peter to pay Paul.Â Finally, there is the issue of readiness. Neither F-35 nor B-21 will be ready to fly missions day in and day out like RB-8 would, or with such a low cost and logistical footprint. So while 75 airframes may not be a huge number, you would be squeezing many more completed sorties out of those airframes and at a much lower comparative price, in a given period of time. In addition, the P-8 shares vast commonality with the next-gen 737 airliner it was derived from. As such, sustaining it anywhere in the world, and especially during the duration of a conflict, will be a far easier proposition than a cutting-edge stealth bomber or fighter, or a 70-year-old B-52.Â While the B-52 remains an amazingly capable machine, it isn’t exactly economical, although it is less expensive to operate than its bomber brethren. , USAF With that in mind, the RB-8 could also provide a lot of forward presence at a relatively low cost and with a relatively small footprint. Its inherent flexibility, long loiter time, and endurance capabilities, as well as its ease of support, means RB-8s can be forward deployed anywhere in the world and they can provide the widest mission set in the entire force while there.Â What we are looking at here is an F-15EX-like solution to a different problem, albeit under similar circumstances. Just the fact that the F-15EX made it to fruition at all is evidence that an RB-8 concept may have legs. F-15EX was all about bringing in a low-risk, mature capability set as soon as possible while also providing an airframe that has a very long service life, proven availability and efficiency, and one that can do a wide array of missions its higher-end counterparts are ill-equipped to do, or doing so would be a waste of their precious airframe life. It was also an aircraft with the vast majority of its development already paid for, just like the RB-8 concept. It may not be sexy, but the RB-8 is an incredible opportunity sitting on a plate before the Air Force and even possibly the Navy. It’s a comparatively low-cost weapon system that can check so many boxes in any future fight the U.S. may find itself in. Luckily, the P-8 order book has remained strong for the time being, and an additional bulk order could potentially allow for a very attractive unit cost. An Aussie MRTT refueling a U.S. Navy P-8A loaded with Harpoons., Australian Department of Defence The P-8 is built on its own dedicated line in Renton, Washington. Boeing tells us this allows it to more easily scale up production if need be. Producing a couple of planes a month is not an issue now and that can be increased as needed. But once that line is shuttered, the 737 Max would have to be adapted for the role, which would take a lot of time and cost a lot of money to integrate and validates the original P-8’s capability set onto. This will likely make the entire concept unviable. So, this isn’t a wait for eternity proposition. There could be additional orders for a P-8 derivative, possibly from the Army , in the not-so-distant future, as well. This would only add to the supportability of the type and the potential for a big block buy at a very attractive price. The RB-8 concept should at least be carefully and thoughtfully evaluated. In fact, in an age where those in command often talk about how many air combat capabilities are increasingly platformed agnostic, the bizarre reality that an off-the-shelf, fully militarized 737 isn’t a compelling solution to a wide array of glaring challenges is quite puzzling.

UH-1Y Venoms from Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 267 (HMLA-267) from nearby Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton were seen dropping sonobuoys in what’s an unusual mission for this type, but which reflects a growing interest in anti-submarine operations within the Corps. Photos released by the U.S. Department of Defense during Summer Fury 21 show this large-scale military exercise underway on San Clemente Island, involving elements of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. The service describes Summer Fury as “the largest Marine aviation exercise on the West Coast [providing] 3rd MAW opportunity to improve warfighter readiness in support of a Marine Expeditionary Force maritime campaign.” A helicopter crew chief with HMLA-267 drops a sonobuoy during the Advanced Naval Basing evolution of Summer Fury 21 at San Clemente, California, July 20, 2021., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Isaac Velasco As well as 3rd MAW F/A-18C Hornets and F-35B Lighting IIs flying a long-range maritime strike against a simulated enemy warship, the UH-1Y was also seen in the context of offensive maritime operations, in this case, its crew members helping to prosecute a submarine contact by dropping sonobuoys by hand out of the cabin door. Sonobuoys are expendable sonar devices that are used to fix the position of an opposing submarine and monitor its movements, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . While sonobuoys are a regular feature of anti-submarine warfare operations and are dropped in significant quantities by specially-equipped fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, they aren’t normally associated with the UH-1Y. The UH-1Y, which has completely replaced the 1970s-vintage UH-1N within the Marine Light Attack Helicopter (HMLA) community, is potentially a useful tool for anti-submarine warfare work, being optimized for the maritime environment and also offering a useful speed of 170 knots, considerably faster than the old ‘November’ model. U.S. Marine Corps Lance Corporal Christian Paterson surveys the Pacific Ocean for simulated enemy vessels during Summer Fury 21., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Isaac Velasco With a mission repertoire that already encompasses offensive air support, assault support, escort, supporting arms coordination, and forward air controller — airborne, it’s maybe not such a surprise that the UH-1Y is also able to turn its hand to anti-submarine warfare, too, albeit apparently on what must be a fairly rudimentary basis. After all, the UH-1Y has no actual submarine-hunting equipment on board, so its role is one of assisting in seeding sonobuoy screens, helping pinpoint the submarines, especially after initial detection or where they might enter particular choke points. Since a single dedicated anti-submarine platform can only conduct its mission in one place at a time, any help in seeding sonobuoys across a wider area can serve as a significant force multiplier. A UH-1Y with sonobuoys dropped manually out of the door is also cheaper to operate than a specialized ASW asset and is also readily available. A helicopter crew chief prepares to drop a sonobuoy from a UH-1Y., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Isaac Velasco This use of the UH-1Y fits in with the increasing emphasis placed by the Marines on this mission, traditionally the domain of the U.S. Navy. The service’s new-found interest in anti-submarine warfare is based on the shift toward distributed and expeditionary warfare operations, as part of the Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) concept. Significantly, one of the stated focuses of Summer Fury 21 is defeating a peer adversary as part of distributed operations. EABO calls for Marine units to quickly establish forward operating bases across a broad area and then use these as a springboard to launch various other missions, before moving on to the next area. This should make it harder for an enemy to counter the Marines but also lends itself ideally to the kinds of Asia-Pacific environments in which the U.S. might expect to go to war with China, for example, as well as in the Northern European context, around the coasts of Norway, Iceland, and Greenland. U.S. Marines with refuel a UH-1Y helicopter at a forward arming and refueling point (FARP) on San Clemente Island, July 20, 2021., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Isaac Velasco One of the potential problems with EABO is that it is likely to rely upon logistics and other supporting operations by sea and with both China and Russia rapidly modernizing their underwater capabilities, these could be threatened. This is where a Marine anti-submarine warfare component fits in, although in practice any such effort is likely to be conducted in cooperation with the Navy. Among the potential different ideas for how the Marines can embrace anti-submarine warfare are using unmanned aircraft to deploy sonobuoy arrays and other anti-submarine warfare sensors in the waters around an expeditionary outpost. Manned aircraft could equally play a part, too, with the Marines flying KC-130 Hercules tanker-transports and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, as well as various helicopters, all of which could also contribute to dropping sonobuoys, in particular. The concept of turning existing platforms into sub-hunters is nothing new, in fact, with the Navy having explored adapting its carrier-based tactical aviation assets for just this role half a century ago. Now, in Summer Fury 21, it seems at least a part of that Marine ambition has been fulfilled, with the delivery of sonobuoys from the UH-1Y. A UH-1Y Venom pilot with Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 267, Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Isaac Velasco A caption to one of the photos released explains the UH-1Y was involved in a concept described as Advanced Naval Basing, which is said to offer “forward logistics and support, as well as sensor and strike capabilities that make a significant contribution to undersea warfare campaigns in the Indo-Pacific region.” Interestingly, back in 2016, the Marines came up with a wargaming “tool kit” that included a Navy SH/MH-60 Seahawk detachment flying from a Marine forward base on local anti-submarine operations, as well as anti-surface warfare and other missions. A UH-1Y flies with a U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk during Exercise Summer Fury 21., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Isaac Velasco While the UH-1Y doesn’t offer anything like the same full-spectrum anti-submarine capability in the role as the Seahawk, it’s possible that the Venom was being used as an adjunct to the Navy helicopter, an example of the MH-60R also being seen in the Summer Fury 21 photo release. Since the exercise also includes establishing a forward arming and refueling point (FARP), it’s also conceivable that these helicopters were flying their anti-submarine warfare missions from there, reflecting the proposal in the 2016 “tool kit.” So far, however, it seems no other details have been released about the anti-submarine warfare portion of Summer Fury 21 and the particular role played by the UH-1Y. However, it seems clear that the Marines are at least now experimenting with using this platform as part of this mission. An AH-1Z Viper escorts a UH-1Y Venom during the Advanced Naval Basing evolution of Summer Fury 21., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Isaac Velasco However, as The War Zone has discussed in the past , there still remain significant hurdles before anti-submarine warfare can become anything approaching a core Marine Corps function. Despite the importance of defeating hostile submarines in modern warfare, this is a very particular skill set that requires intensive training and resources, including personnel, especially bearing in mind the number of other functions the service is expected to perform. With this in mind, assisting the Navy in these operations makes sense. As it is, we will have to wait and see to what degree the Marines will embrace anti-submarine warfare as part of their evolving EABO doctrine and, within that, what kind of expanded role will be played by the adaptable UH-1Y.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More and more as of late, some of the F-117 Nighthawks long retired from active duty are now enjoying their secretive second life as developmental and red air aggressor platforms. The Air Force Test Center pilots that fly the Air Force Materiel Command-owned jets out of the shadowy Tonopah Test Range Airport (TTR) have been steadily expanding their operations in recent months with the type operating from other installations , refueling from standard tankers , and even frequenting Nellis AFB , home of the USAF’s aggressors . We have reported extensively on this unique role for the F-117s, including their first known appearance at the giant Red Flag air warfare exercises last August. Now we have new images that show “Black Jets” in action, roaring low over the Nevada desert during a Red Flag sortie. The images come to us from Joerg Arnu, the proprietor of the always awesome Dreamlandresort.com . He captured the jets from Coyote Summit egressing to the east at low altitude. Coyote Summit is a famous locale for military aviation aficionados and photographers looking to take in some of the Red Flag action from the ground. It is located just to the southeast of Rachel, Nevada, which is famous for its proximity to Area 51. Joerg Arnu/Dreamlandresort.com Red Flag 21-3 is currently underway out of Nellis AFB and over the giant Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) that lies to the north of it. It was along the eastern edge of this sprawling jigsaw puzzle of restricted aerial ranges that Joerg had his encounters with the F-117s. NTTR, RAND Red Flag 21-3 appears to be a U.S. forces-centric exercise. During these unique Red Flag events, where international players are at a minimum, more advanced capabilities are usually brought to the fight. Joerg Arnu/Dreamlandresort.com As for the F-117s, part of their duties includes serving as low-observable aggressors , which has become a necessity in a world where stealthy aircraft and cruise missiles are proliferating. They also work in a developmental role for low-observable and counter-low observable technologies. For Red Flag, they are part of the bad guys’ team. While flying missions during broad daylight may not have been on the docket during their operational career, these jets provide a target unlike anything fleet aircrews have encountered before. One can imagine how their elusive radar signature can only become harder to detect while flying amongst the ground clutter. One of the jets is wearing a striking all-red TR tail code and tail band, the TR standing for their home at TTR. The other is seen with a white TR tail code and what looks like some sort of round emblem, the details of which we cannot make out. Also of note, the F-117s have their retractable antennas extended , which does impact their low-observable cloak from certain angles. This could be a necessity for taking part in the exercise or it could be because the aircraft are leaving the training area and can communicate more freely as they are no longer valid targets. It’s also worth noting that radar reflectors are not mounted on the aircraft, so they are in a low-observable configuration. Joerg Arnu/Dreamlandresort.com According to Joerg, this was the flow of what he saw during his time at Coyote Summit, indicating multiple regenerations or runs by the aggressor Nighthawks: Here is a timeline: 1:33pm: Group of two F-117 heading east 1:44pm: Group of two F-117 heading back west at higher altitude (approx 15,000ft.) 1:52pm: Group of two F-117 heading east; one was less than 500ft. from my location 2:17pm: Single F-117 heading east; about 770ft. from my location Make sure to check out Dreamlandresort.com for all of Joerg’s photos from this encounter. It’s great to see these old jets still providing value well over a decade after they were formally retired. While the USAF is standing up a new ‘stealth equipped’ aggressor unit using early-block F-35As, we could see the F-117s serve beyond the unit’s establishment as they provide a very different form of ‘stealth’ than their higher-performance F-35 successors. We will keep you in the loop if we find out more about the Nighthawk’s participation in this Red Flag.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 7, 2020",Russia Threat Could See U.K. Fighter Jets Operating From Highways Once Again,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In an unmistakable throwback to the years of the Cold War , the U.K. Royal Air Force is preparing to undertake snap exercises that will see its fighter jets operate from civilian airfields and perhaps even strips of highway. The initiative is part of plans for dispersed operations in times of tension, recognizing the fact that potential Russian aggression would very likely target the U.K.’s handful of fighter bases as a matter of priority. The development was announced yesterday by the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which quoted Air Chief Marshal Mike Wigston, the Chief of the Air Staff . The commander of the Royal Air Force (RAF) unveiled plans for Exercise Agile Stance, during which the service’s fighters will receive ‘no-notice’ orders to deploy to alternative locations, beginning this fall . These locations will likely comprise civilian airfields able to accommodate them, but “other improvised locations” were also mentioned. These could include U.K. highways, which would revive a practice conducted — albeit on a limited basis — during the Cold War. Engineers at work on Typhoons at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire. Home to around half the U.K. Typhoon fleet, there is increasing concern about the vulnerability of this airbase and others like it., Crown Copyright “We’ll be re-learning how to disperse,” Wigston told the newspaper, pointing out that if “the arsenal [of advanced cruise missiles] Putin has been bragging about” was stationed in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad “we’d be in range.” The Chief of the Air Staff also spoke of relocating “all my Typhoons […] on 12 bases,” although it’s unclear whether that is a firm aspiration. The fighters would be deployed in ‘fighting fours,’ detachments of four jets each. Once at their temporary locations, the jets will be provided with forward arming and refueling points (FARPs) while troops from the RAF Regiment will provide force protection. The missile threat Wigston was referring to is very likely the controversial 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile , also known as the SSC-8 Screwdriver. According to NATO, this weapon violated the terms of the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, and it directly led to that agreement’s final collapse last year. With a range of around 1,500 miles, the 9M729 would be able to hit any target in Western Europe when launched from Kaliningrad. You can read more about what is known as the missile in this past War Zone piece . The Russian 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile and its associated transporter erector launcher, or TEL, during their first public appearance in 2019., SERGEI BOBYLEV/TASS Agile Stance will comprise a series of maneuvers testing the RAF’s ability to move its fighters rapidly from their home bases and make it “harder” for a potential enemy to target them with a pre-emptive strike, whether that involves a cruise missile, ballistic missiles, airstrikes, or other actions. Wigston, who was interviewed during his recent visit to the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, used the example of the Japanese attack on that location to emphasize the vulnerability of the RAF’s fighter bases to a surprise strike. The U.K. Chief of the Air Staff spoke unusually forcefully about what he described as the increasing threat posed to the United Kingdom by Russia over recent years. “They’ve murdered people on the streets of Britain and annexed part of Europe,” he said, referring to the Skripal poisoning case in England and the illegal occupation of Crimea . “They’ve got the threat systems. We are concerned about them. In the worst-case scenario, things we hold dear — like national infrastructure — will be in range of Russian missiles.” The U.K. Secretary of State for Defense Ben Wallace also recently brought attention to the apparent threat posed by Russia — in this case, its expanding maritime capabilities — when he labeled the country as the U.K.’s “number one adversary threat,” last May. This was evidenced, among others, by a pronounced uptick in Russian Navy vessels visiting waters around the United Kingdom . An RAF Typhoon overflies the Russian Navy Project 22160 patrol ship Vasily Bykov over the North Sea., Crown Copyright “I’m not interested in paving over Lincolnshire again,” Wigston told the Daily Telegraph , “and there will be the challenge of having armed aircraft on civilian airfields. That reference was to the World War II airfield expansion program that turned the eastern corner of England into something approaching a giant bomber base, from which the RAF and the U.S. Army Air Force launched its offensive missions against the German Reich and occupied Europe. Today, Lincolnshire is home to Coningsby, one of the RAF’s two frontline Typhoon fighter bases, with the other at Lossiemouth in the north of Scotland. The U.K.’s other fighter jet, the F-35B Lightning is meanwhile located at Marham in eastern England, with no plans for further bases in the future, although this aircraft’s short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability makes it particularly suitable for operations from shorter airstrips. U.S. Marine Corps and RAF F-35Bs operate together at RAF Marham last year., Crown Copyright “We should look at this as a national challenge and look at the wealth of airstrips we have in the UK,” Wigston added. “It sounds a bit Cold War-ey, but we have a pressing requirement to remember how to do it.” The idea has also found support among retired senior RAF officers. “Dispersal has always been a useful tool in the defense ‘box of tricks,’ but rarely used or practiced in recent decades,” Air Marshal Greg Bagwell, a former deputy commander of the service tweeted . “Good to practice and learn lessons, whilst also acting as a deterrent and sign of intent against potential foes considering the option of a ‘lightning strike,’” the former Cold War Tornado strike pilot added. As for the airstrips that will be used, the candidate civilian airfields would likely involve the less frequently used ones, perhaps including those located further from major population centers. While there are over 40 airports around the country, some of them are among the busiest in Europe. There are also some airbases still in military hands but not used on a regular basis, like Leuchars Station in Scotland, which has recently hosted Typhoons and P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft while resurfacing work was underway at Lossiemouth. Two Typhoons normally based at Lossiemouth launch from Leuchars Station due to a scramble call-out last year., Crown Copyright Two possible civil airport locations would be Bournemouth in the southwest and Teesside in the northeast, both of which are already used by commercial operators as well as by the contractor Draken Europe, from where the company provides adversary support and electronic attack missions using Dassault Falcon bizjets . With relatively few RAF airbases in daily operational use, the ability to be able to disperse aircraft and launch sorties from elsewhere is also a useful option should any runway be out of action for other reasons, too. Only recently, RAF Brize Norton, home of the RAF airlift fleet , had to be closed after poor-quality resurfacing work led to the tarmac melting in the summer heat. Although not mentioned by Wigston, RAF fighters could potentially also leave the British Isles entirely and head for a safer overseas location in times of tension. Last week, RAF Typhoons tested a “hot pit” refueling capability for the first time in Norway , as part of a proof-of-concept exercise to test the ability of the jet to operate from a dispersed location. At the same time, U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces James Heappey spoke of the importance of “re-finding our ability to disperse and operate in a more expeditionary way [that] makes life harder for those who look at our home base and think that we’re sunk if missiles hit Lossiemouth, Coningsby, and Marham.” The degree of protection that’s provided to RAF airbases, more generally, also seems to be a focus of Wigston’s concern. Compared to Russia, he said, “We’ve not kept pace in terms of air defense systems. We’ve not required ground-based air defense because of our strategic circumstances and the fact we were operating under a U.S. umbrella.” For much of the Cold War, for example, there were Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) for area defense of these critical installations, as well as low-level Rapier SAMs operated by the RAF Regiment. This kind of organic air defense capability was finally given up in 2019 when the RAF’s Joint Ground Based Air Defense (GBAD) command was transferred to the British Army. A British Army Rapier SAM system protects a runway while deployed to Estonia, while a U.S. A-10 taxis past. , Crown Copyright As for the potential operations from highway strips, these would obviously require more preparation, including removing roadside furniture — lighting, crash barriers, central reservations — before closing off the relevant portion and redirecting traffic. The has been done in the past, with some observers bringing up the highway operations conducted by RAF Jaguar strike jets . Most famous was the demonstration of April 26, 1975, when a British Aerospace test pilot landed a Jaguar GR1 on the M55 motorway between Preston and Blackpool, Lancashire. According to the manufacturer, now BAE Systems , “The purpose of the flight was to demonstrate the Jaguar’s ability to land on unorthodox landing strips away from main airbases under wartime conditions — a key feature of the jet’s design.” It’s notable, however, that the highway strip in question was located conveniently close to the company’s flight-test facility at Warton and the specific westbound carriageway had not even been opened to the public yet after it was built. After a first deliberate overshoot of the landing strip, the jet landed safely and was ‘bombed up’ by armorers, receiving dummy ordnance before taking off again. It’s unclear if anything similar was attempted again in the United Kingdom, at least involving fast jets. On the other hand, Cold War-era NATO tactical jets did make more frequent use of highway strips in West Germany, closer to the potential front lines of any conflict with the Warsaw Pact, and at least some of these incorporated provisions for use by aircraft. Speaking to The War Zone , Greg Bagwell recalled how the RAF based in Cold War Germany made use of specific lengths of Autobahn that were completed with reinforced concrete sections, central reservations that were at the same level as the highway itself, and with prefabricated dispersal areas roughly a mile and a half apart for refueling and rearming jets. These not only provided an alternative to airbases but could bring aircraft closer to their targets on the other side of the Iron Curtain. The Autobahn A29 near Ahlhorn in northern Germany, seen just after completion in 1984, included a runway and dispersal areas built into its design., U.S. Department of Defense An RAF Jaguar operates from the A29 near Ahlhorn during the 1980s., Crown Copyright Similar contingencies are still in use with other European air arms, notably Finland and Sweden, where operating from highways is part of the standard doctrine. In Eastern Europe , too, some nations retain the tradition of periodically taking operations out onto the road, although most of the adapted highways constructed during the Cold War are long out of use. For the U.S. military, meanwhile, dispersed austere airfield operations have taken on a particular resonance in the Pacific , where the island of Guam recently hosted Air Force F-16s and F-35s at an austere airfield as part of a new strategy in the region , again largely driven by the threat of ballistic missile attacks . A Swedish Air Force Gripen fighter operates from a section of Highway 44 between Lidköping and Grästorp, during an exercise last year., Swedish Defense Forces Ultimately, however, highway operations were always a rare occurrence in the United Kingdom, and the famous example on the M55 was probably intended to serve as much as a marketing tool for the Jaguar as a demonstration of a realistic wartime contingency. The RAF Harrier , on the other hand, had dispersed airfields as a fundamental part of its wartime concept of operations. The U.K.’s small fleet of F-35Bs could potentially be deployed in a similar manner, but are unlikely to be able to sustain operations in anywhere near as an austere environment as the Harrier. Nevertheless, the fact that the commander of the RAF is willing to at least consider the idea of operating fighters from highway strips points to how seriously he and his colleagues are taking the potential threat posed by Russia and that country’s increasing ability to hold the U.K.’s key military infrastructure at risk.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Aug 3, 2021",Air Force Directed Energy Report Argues Defensive Force Fields May Be “Just On The Horizon”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base has released a new analysis of the Department of Defense’s investments into directed energy technologies , or DE. The report, titled “Directed Energy Futures 2060,” makes predictions about what the state of DE weapons and applications will be 40 years from now and offers a range of scenarios in which the United States might find itself either leading the field in DE or lagging behind peer-state adversaries. In examining the current state of the art of this relatively new class of weapons, the authors claim that the world has reached a “tipping point” in which directed energy is now critical to successful military operations. One of the document’s most eyebrow-raising predictions is that a “ force field ” could be created by “a sufficiently large fleet or constellation of high-altitude DEW systems ” that could provide a “missile defense umbrella, as part of a layered defense system, if such concepts prove affordable and necessary.” The report cites several existing examples of what it calls “force fields,” including the Active Denial System, or “ pain ray ,” as well as non-kinetic counter-drone systems, and potentially counter-missile systems , that use high-power microwaves to disable or destroy their targets. Most intriguingly, the press release claims that “the concept of a DE weapon creating a localized force field may be just on the horizon.” In a press release accompanying the document, AFRL’s Directed Energy Deputy Chief Scientist Jeremy Murray-Krezan adds that current directed energy technology is “not quite Star Wars,” but adds that the AFRL is “getting close.” The document describes advances occurring both in the private sector and the Department of Defense that are driving the size and weight of DE systems down while increasing power, making the kinds of weapons dreamed about in science fiction seem more like reality. The authors describe the concept in more detail: The “holy grail” from a military utility perspective is a DE weapon system effective enough, favorable from a SWAP perspective, and affordable enough to provide a nuclear/missile umbrella. Although a concept often associated with science fiction, in fact ground and ship-based DE defense systems effectively act like point-localized force fields against small and relatively soft targets today. Airborne and space-based DE platforms could achieve a greater area defense and multipoint defenses, for a broader coverage missile umbrella. “By 2060 we can predict that DE systems will become more effective, and this idea of a force field includes methods to destroy other threats too,” Murray-Krezan said in the press release. “Eventually there may be potential to achieve the penultimate goal of a Nuclear or ballistic missile umbrella. It’s fun to think about what that might be in 2060, but we don’t want to speculate too much.” AFRL However, in the full report , the authors point out that “these concepts require significant technical advancement by 2060 to achieve the full range of power contemplated.” Murray-Krezan states in the accompanying press release that the document was intended to be somewhat of a thought experiment, but one based on current trends. “We’re painting with broad strokes, but we’re diving into what missions of the future will look like,” said Murray-Krezan. “DE is uniquely suited for an area of growing importance, nondestructive but damaging, disruptive, and denial of operations ,” Murray-Krezan said. “Not every military operation has to result in a smoking hole in the ground for it to be successful.” A tiered, layered defense concept put forward by the U.S. Army which includes directed energy weapons., U.S. Army Acquisition Support Center The report was written by the AFRL’s Office of the Chief Scientist for DE for the Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense’s Directed Energy Community of Interest . Contributions were also made by the Naval Research Laboratory, U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, the Joint Intermediate Force Capabilities Office, Los Alamos, Sandia, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and a variety of partners in academia, the private sector, and NATO affiliated allies. In the press release accompanying the report, AFRL states that the document was intended to “bring together some of the most innovative thinkers in DE to build a plan to keep our warfighters and our country safe.” The document defines directed energy as “a focused beam of electro-magnetic energy that is used to enable or create military effects, when used in conjunction with other military systems, including kinetic weapons.” Several different types of DE systems are cited in this definition including are lasers , radio frequency devices, high power microwave , millimeter wave, and particle beams . The report states that these can be used to create at least five different military effects: “ deny , degrade, damage, destroy , or deceive .” The Demonstrator Laser Weapon System (DLWS) undergoing tests at the High Energy Laser System Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range., AFRL/Keith Lewis Among the report’s key findings is that “due to the convergence of trends in technology and the evolution of the battlefield, DE military capabilities have reached or passed a tipping point in their criticality to the successful execution of cross-domain, military operations by the U.S., Allies, and current and potential rivals and adversaries.” The report also adds that these peer-state rivals are “challenging U.S. leadership in military DE capabilities” but that the AFRL is “moving aggressively to retain U.S. DE leadership.” A recent primer on directed energy technologies published by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) notes a few examples of these peer adversary capabilities, including anti-satellite microwave weapons being developed in Russia and China. The CRS adds that “Some analysts have questioned whether DOD has sufficient knowledge of adversary DE weapons systems and materials to develop its weapons requirements.” The AFRL report claims that the proliferation and advancement of DE technologies among superpowers will be driven by three pressing military needs: • Information superiority operations that promise control of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electromagnetic spectrum superiority in a conflict requires EW or DE weaponry. • Capability to project military power faster, at longer stand-off ranges, and efficiently, as part of an integrated layered defense which includes command and control, ISR, cyber, and kinetic weapons. • Unique, intermediate force, special operations, and potentially space-based missions that require flexibility, scalability, and precision effects across all domains and phases of conflict. The report’s authors argue that U.S. military leadership should instead remember the costly arms races of the Cold War and understand that “technological and military investment can drive national costs to unacceptable levels.” To ensure this doesn’t happen, the authors note that “there must be continued assessment of DE’s value.” A Multi-Mission High Energy Laser (MMHEL) prototype aboard a U.S. Army Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle., U.S. Army Acquisition Support Center The idea of a force field is still a science-fiction-inspired flight of fantasy, but heavier-than-air flight was also considered by some mainstream scientists to be a crazy idea only a little more than a century ago. There is also the reality that much of what is being developed on the cutting-edge in the directed energy space remains classified. Still, from all indications, we’re still a ways away from being able to fully realize these types of directed energy capabilities, but the Air Force Research Laboratory and other labs are clearly trying to envision future applications of more advanced versions of current DE concepts. It may be a stretch to call an automated high-powered microwave counter-drone system a “force field,” but at least some parallels can be drawn between the concepts. In fact, if such a system were built to be omnidirectional in nature, it would perform a bit like a force field as we see it in science fiction. Regardless, for a good primer of what is possible now and what is possible in the future when it comes to directed energy, check out this in-depth interview of ours . Ultimately, this new report by the AFRL shows just show promising directed energy capabilities are finally becoming to the battlefield of today, forcefields or not. If we have indeed already crossed the “tipping point” claimed in the article, the wars of the future are certainly going to resemble what has previously been seen only in science fiction.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Department of Defense’s (DOD) Office of Inspector General (OIG) has confirmed it will evaluate whether or not there are adequate procedures in place for events that might compromise the safety of the Presidential Emergency Satchel, more commonly known as the “ nuclear football .” The review comes in light of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021 in which protesters were able to storm past Capitol Police and essentially overrun the seat of America’s government. During the riot at the Capitol, many protesters were heard chanting “Hang Mike Pence.” When protestors breached security and entered the halls of the Capitol, Pence and many members of Congress were rushed to safety through the building’s emergency tunnel network . Security footage was later shown to the U.S. Senate in which Pence and his detail can be seen hurrying down a staircase with the nuclear football in tow. Protesters were reportedly able to reach within 100 feet of the Vice President, who along with the President, is followed 24/7 by a military aide carrying the football.

According to the Federation of American Scientists, the nuclear football contains a secure telephone, a booklet containing procedures for securing the President in the event of an emergency, a book of codes needed to co-authorize the use of nuclear weapons, and the all-important “black book” of pre-planned targeted response options. Currently, the President has the sole authority to order the use of nuclear weapons by identifying himself to the Pentagon with unique codes that only they possess. These codes are often referred to as the “gold codes” and the President carries them on his or her person in what is called “the biscuit.” A launch order would be sent to the Pentagon’s National Military Command Center and on to other elements of the National Command Authority (Secretary of Defense) and STRATCOM. If the order is deemed lawful by the Secretary of Defense, which remains a somewhat ambiguous safety mechanism, STRATCOM could launch land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles in as little as two minutes . The President has a number of military and cabinet advisors who could offer advice in the event that a nuclear strike would be called for, yet just the military aide that carries the football is ready to quickly provide targeting and response option advice to the President alone so that a strike can be quickly ordered with minimal outside support. As noted, no one has the power to override the President, strictly speaking, unless their order is deemed unlawful, especially by the Secretary of Defense. Even then, with such tight timelines involved and the so-called ‘fog of war’ that would surround a sudden and incredibly severe crisis, the effectiveness of this safeguard is debatable. In addition, it is said that elements of the National Command Authority, namely the Secretary of Defense, could be fired until someone in line would execute the order. The entire process remains a hotly debated topic, one that pits the struggle of ensuring a robust nuclear deterrent against the potential for a world-ending mistake or illogical action. Regardless, none of this can happen if the football is not secure and nearby the President or Vice President at all times. The events of January 6 put this in question. Randolph R. Stone, the Assistant Inspector General for Evaluations Space, Intelligence, Engineering and Oversight, issued a memo stating that the OIG’s evaluation would begin in July 2021 and would “determine the extent that DoD processes and procedures are in place and adequate to alert DoD officials in the event that the Presidential Emergency Satchel is lost, stolen, or Compromised” and will also “determine the adequacy of the procedures the DoD has developed to respond to such an event.” DOD Two members of Congress, Rep. Stephen F. Lynch, Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform’s Subcommittee on National Security, and Rep. Jim Cooper, Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, issued a statement following the announcement : The insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, was not only an unprecedented attack on our democracy, but it also put our national security in grave danger.  According to public reports, as Vice President Pence hurried away to safety with a military aide carrying his emergency satchel, or ‘nuclear football,’ Pentagon officials were unaware that the football was potentially seconds away from falling into the hands of a lawless mob. It is imperative that we fully understand the processes and procedures that are in place to protect the Presidential Emergency Satchel—especially when its custodians might be in danger—and we applaud the DOD OIG for accepting our request to initiate this evaluation.  We look forward to reviewing their findings once the report is completed. According to CNN , US Strategic Command was unaware that protestors who stormed the Capitol were able to get so close to Vice President Mike Pence and the backup nuclear football carried by his detail. Since 1992, (USSTRATCOM) has been responsible for all strategic nuclear forces in the United States arsenal. Kingston Reif, an expert on nuclear weapons policy at the nonpartisan Arms Control Association, told CNN that if protesters had attacked Pence’s detail and gotten their hands on the football, it would have been a “security breach of almost incomprehensible proportions,” allowing information such as pre-planned nuclear strike options to fall into the wrong hands or be shared with the world. The incident “ought to raise further questions about the rationale for the anachronism that is the football,” Reif added. A letter written in March by Sean O’Donnell , Acting Inspector General for the DOD, also states that USSTRATCOM was “reportedly unaware that Vice President Pence, his military aide, and the nuclear football were all potentially in danger.” O’Donnell states that Strategic Command only came to understand the seriousness of the security breach several weeks after the Capitol insurrection when security camera footage was played during a Senate impeachment trial. O’Donnell’s letter references another occasion on which the safety of the nuclear football was threatened. In 2017, former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and a member of the U.S. Secret Service got into a physical altercation with Chinese security forces who blocked the individual carrying the football from following the President. You can read more about the bizarre dust-up in this past article of ours . “These incidents raise grave national security concerns,” O’Donnell notes. In a separate incident, former President Donald Trump allowed guests at his Mar-A-Lago resort to pose for pictures with the nuclear football , raising questions about who could get close to the satchel. While the Secret Service Presidential/Vice-Presidential details and counter-assault teams (CAT) could inflict lethal force to protect the football, even with their skill and dedication, an angry mob may not be adequately repelled by such a defense. In this case, things were happening so fast and the space was so crowded, it may not have been possible to put up much of a fight before control of the situation was lost. And it isn’t just about what’s in the case that matters, it is also the symbolic nature of it. It represents the reliability of America’s nuclear deterrent. Losing it would be a major blow to the perception of the deterrent and its ability to be used at a moment’s notice. Many of these recent incidents have ignited debate over the nuclear football and, more broadly, the powers the United States President has in terms of ordering nuclear strikes. Some have argued that since the threat of nuclear war isn’t as pressing as it was during the Cold War, the President no longer needs to have such executive authority when it comes to ordering nuclear strikes. As others, like General Michael Hayden, the former director of the CIA, have noted, the system “is designed for speed and decisiveness” and “not designed to debate the decision.” Given the speed of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the U.S. would only have minutes to decide to respond to an incoming nuclear strike, making the football still somewhat of a terrifying necessity, at least without major reform to how these weapons are employed and by who.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 19, 2021",Russia’s Checkmate Light Tactical Fighter Is Officially Unveiled (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The wraps have finally, officially, come off the mock-up of Russia’s new light fighter, the Sukhoi Checkmate, also known as the Light Tactical Aircraft, or LTS in Russian, with a formal unveiling at the opening of the MAKS international air show at Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, today. Observers who had been given a succession of tantalizing, and mainly unofficial, glimpses of the new jet over the last few days now have the chance to examine the aircraft from all aspects. The actual ceremony ended up being delayed by several hours, perhaps to accommodate the visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was shown inspecting the mock-up after opening the show. The end result is very much in keeping with the observations that The War Zone has been gathering based on initial, leaked, imagery, much of it that came when the aircraft was still literally under wraps. The United Aircraft Corporation and Rostec, for their part, which are responsible for the Sukhoi design bureau, seemed to actively encourage this process, harnessing it as something of a PR coup. The unveiling of the Sukhoi Checkmate, or LTS, earlier today. , ROSTEC You can read our full assessment of the jet here , based on its first fleeting appearance “in the flesh,” as well as our analysis of the single-engine concept and the potential sales prospects of such an aircraft. The aircraft’s intake has been one of its most debated features over the last week. New imagery shows the angular ventral inlet, which wraps around the lower nose section, to share features with a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design, but exactly how mature Russia’s take on this concept is, remains to be seen. In terms of new developments, we now know that, as suspected, there is a larger main weapons bay within the lower fuselage. This is designed to accommodate three examples of the RVV-BD air-to-air missile, the export version of the very-long-range R-37M, or AA-13 Axehead, a weapon that you can read more about here . Furthermore, we now have confirmation that the long, conformal weapons bays located forward of the main landing gear are indeed intended to house smaller air-to-air missiles, for close-range defense. Performance-wise, the manufacturer is apparently claiming a short takeoff and landing capability (rather than a full short takeoff and vertical landing capability, as in the F-35B), a range of up to 1,860 miles, combat radius of 930 miles, and a payload in excess of 15,000 pounds. The airframe is said to be stressed to 8g, which is only slightly less than the 9g at which the airframe of the Su-35S Flanker heavyweight fighter is rated. This may reflect the fact the design focuses more on low-observable characteristics and range than maneuverability, although the final result is likely closer to the Su-57, concentrating on reducing the signature from the frontal hemisphere, rather than all-aspect stealth. This approach to low observability might also help drive down the price tag, although the figure of less than $30 million that has been presented seems to be wildly optimistic. By contrast, there was much fanfare when Lockheed Martin managed to bring the unit cost of its F-35A down to less than $80 million , achieved in 2019 after hundreds of examples had been built. An official press release from Rostec provides few further details about the LTS but does claim that there is “artificial intelligence support for the pilot’s work,” although it’s not clear how this is manifested. Moreover, it seems unlikely that Russia is anywhere as far along as the various U.S. Air Force projects exploring developments in AI and autonomous flight, including “ digital co-pilots .” A glimpse into the Checkmate’s cockpit — also a mock-up, of course — reveals a single, large-area display dominating the control panel, plus a smaller display above it, together with a traditional central control stick and a conventional-looking head-up display. The projected timeline for the LTS includes the first flight of a technology demonstrator in 2023, followed by construction of pre-series prototypes in 2024-25, and delivery of initial production examples potentially as early as 2026-27. All this, however, depends on first securing the funds to continue the project. With that in mind, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov was in a bullish mood at MAKS, claiming that the core markets would be India, Vietnam, and in Africa, and projecting global demand for 300 examples of the fighter. Meanwhile, although it might be tempting to try and see where Sukhoi’s designers may have picked up inspiration for the new LTS, as Tyler Rogoway has pointed out, there are only so many ways to create an advanced fighter, with all the associated attributes, and compromises. That said, the Russian design does make an interesting comparison to some previous fighter studies and concepts, both in Russia and the United States. The tailerons, in particular, are a feature that has been seen on various different fighter concepts, including the U.S. Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) designs from the 1990s, and the Northrop YF-23 , which was the unsuccessful rival to the F-22 Raptor . However, they also seem to be combined with stub-like horizontal tail surfaces on either side of the engine exhaust, used for pitch control. There are also a number of other U.S. studies that pre-date the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program that have some interesting parallels with the Sukhoi LTS design. In particular, there is the Northrop MRF-54E, a precursor to the YF-23 that allied an angular “chin” intake with tailerons. Not to be left out, Mikoyan, Sukhoi’s traditional rival in the fighter-designing business, has also unveiled some future combat aircraft concepts at MAKS, including a light multirole fighter, an advanced carrier-based fighter, and a stealthy carrier-based refueling drone, comparable to the MQ-25 Stingray . In contrast to the Sukhoi LTS, these would appear to be pitched mainly toward domestic, rather than export requirements, where the market prospects are likely less favorable. Nevertheless, they provide an interesting insight into the kinds of concepts Mikoyan is looking at for potential future development. The carrier-based fighter, in particular, shows a strong lineage to the Mikoyan design for the Multi-functional Frontline Fighter, or Mnogofunksionalni Frontovoy Istrebitel, abbreviated MFI, which led to the prototype 1.44 that was first flown, after much delay, in 2000. Unlike the Sukhoi LTS, this new Mikoyan fighter proposal retains the twin-engine powerplant favored by the Russian military since the end of the Cold War. The prototype Mikoyan 1.44 heavyweight fighter., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons It seems that, as expected, the Sukhoi fighter design will be the major talking point of the MAKS air show this year. The LTS design offers some intriguing solutions to the various problems of designing a new-generation fighter. On the other hand, it will need serious support from Russia and/or a wealthy export customer in order to make the next step, and progress to an airworthy demonstrator, especially with a projected first flight set for 2023. Thereafter, commercial success will be a challenge, too, especially with no shortage of potential rivals from China , South Korea , Turkey , and elsewhere waiting in the wings. Update, July 20, 11:30 AM PST: Further details of the planned configuration of the Sukhoi Checkmate LTS are emerging, as observers make their way through the various pronouncements made by officials during the unveiling earlier today. On Twitter, Moscow-based @krakek1 , in particular, has been parsing some of the key announcements about the new fighter design. Here’s a summary of what a production version of the LTS is supposed to offer: The planned powerplant is not confirmed, but it is described as an engine in the 14.5 to 16-ton thrust class engine, utilizing off-the-shelf components. This rating would put it at the upper end of the output of the AL-41F1 turbofan now used in the Su-57, or at the lower end of the all-new Izdeliye 30, which is currently still in development. Whatever the engine choice, Russia is promising a fighter with high-end performance, including the aforementioned STOL attributes, although it is noteworthy, perhaps, that the ability to supercruise has not been mentioned so far. In addition to the three long-range and two short-range AAMs that can be carried in the internal bays, a wide variety of air-to-ground ordnance is being offered as well. Unusually for a fifth-generation design, as well as different precision-guided munitions, the unveiling showed that the jet will also be able to carry various unguided rockets and dumb bombs. There will also be provision for an internal cannon, likely a 30mm weapon as on the Su-57 . YOUTUBE SCREENCAP/ROSTEC YOUTUBE SCREENCAP/ROSTEC The active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, of undisclosed type, is intended to engage six targets simultaneously while operating in a hostile electronic countermeasures environment. The radar will be part of one of an all-round sensor suite, including passive devices, likely similar to those found on the Su-57 . In fact, the leveraging of Su-57 technologies seems to be one of the cornerstones of Checkmate. Not only does it promise to reduce development costs, but it should, when combined with an open-architecture approach, let customers pick and choose which sensors, for example, they need on their particular LTS iteration. Looking further ahead, there is talk of operating Checkmate as part of a manned/unmanned team, and even an unmanned version of the jet, as well as further development of a potential (manned) naval variant, most likely directed at the requirements of the Russian Navy . Overall, Rostec is confident that its offering will attract customers thanks to its low operating costs, and also points to its logistics chain and post-sale support . In the past, these last two factors, in particular, have been bugbears for operators of Soviet and Russian aircraft, so it will be intriguing to see how they are addressed. On top of that, the LTS should offer ease of maintenance and operations, including when support infrastructure is limited. While that is not new for Russian designs, it would be a break from most fifth-generation design philosophies. As of today, the program is being funded internally, with investors being sought to launch production for export. Interestingly, officials said they hoped that Russia might opt for the unmanned variant, rather than the manned fighter.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 30, 2021",This Is Our First View Of Russia’s New S-500 Air Defense System In Action,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has, for the first time, released a video showing the S-500 air defense system in action. The launch, conducted during a test campaign at Kapustin Yar, near Astrakhan in southern Russia, reportedly downed a ballistic missile surrogate target, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, which announced the development earlier today. The Russian military is currently undertaking pre-service trials of the S-500, after which the system will begin to be deployed operationally, initially as part of the defensive umbrella surrounding the capital, Moscow. The system, which is named Prometey (Russian for Prometheus), as well as Triumfator-M, is expected to replace the current A-135 anti-ballistic missile system deployed around Moscow, as well as supplement the long-range S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile (SAM) system in Russian Aerospace Forces service. A capture from the first known S-500 missile live-fire test to be publically released., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP/RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE “The S-500 anti-aircraft missile system has no analogs in the world and is designed to defeat the entire spectrum of existing and promising aerospace attack weapons of a potential enemy in the entire range of altitudes and speeds,” the defense ministry said in a statement. The S-500 has been designed from the outset to counter a wide range of aerial threats, including ballistic missiles, as well as manned aircraft, and cruise missiles. Like many high-end Russian air defense systems, the S-500 can be configured to fire a range of different missiles, to tackle threats of various kinds and at different ranges and elevations. With that in mind, it’s not currently clear if the latest test described involved one of the 77N6 series of missiles, with hit-to-kill warheads, or a 40N6 missile, a type that is also intended to be fired by the earlier S-400 system . Russian defense policy observers on Twitter today came to different conclusions as to which type of missile was used, although most seemed to conclude that the 77N6 was the most likely candidate. However, it’s also worth noting that there’s another missile, too, that’s reportedly been tested with the S-500, according to the Russian newspaper Izvestia . Whatever the case, it’s evident that the Russian Ministry of Defense has made deliberate efforts to blur portions of the video and make it harder to identify the missile in question. The S-500 TEL raises its paired missile tubes into the firing position., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP/RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE The S-500’s active development phase had begun by 2009, but since then the program has suffered some significant delays, at least when compared to the confident predictions of series production by 2012. In the years since then, service entry dates have also slipped with some regularity. The latest anti-ballistic missile test suggests that the S-500 program is making progress now, though, although it remains to be seen if it will enter service in series-built form by 2025, as now projected. That date was given by Deputy Defence Minister Alexei Krivoruchko last year, based on the related state contracts being signed this year. Despite the holdups, there have been some other important milestones in the development program so far, including what Russia has claimed is the longest-range SAM test ever, hitting a target almost 300 miles away . According to Russia’s state-run media outlet RIA Novosti , the maximum range will eventually be around 370 miles. YOUTUBE SCREENCAP/RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE Once it is ready for service, the S-500 promises to further expand the capabilities of its anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) “bubbles” located in key strategic areas close to NATO’s eastern borders, such as around the exclave of Kaliningrad in the Baltic , and around Crimea in the Black Sea , to name just two. Potentially, Russia could also deploy S-500s in foreign theaters, too, such as in Syria , where it would further complicate an already delicate balance between Russia, the United States and its allies, and other players. Video of a Russian S-400 missile defense system active at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria: https://youtube.com/watch?v=ylEmQLBQokk But it’s in the anti-ballistic missile role that the S-500 could really come into its own. While the S-400 already provides Russian — and an expanding list of export customers — with a mobile system that can take down air-breathing targets at prodigious ranges, the S-500 promises to do similar against ballistic missile threats. Already, there has been Turkish interest in the new system , with Turkish President Recep Erdogan saying his country will cooperate in producing the weapon, although this may well have been a politically motivated signal to the United States, following Ankara’s ejection from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program over its planned purchase of S-400s. This is in stark contrast to the A-135 system, which is launched from fixed silos and has only been deployed around the Russian capital. The S-500 is road-mobile, with a 10 x 10 transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) on a BAZ chassis providing a significant degree of mobility. As well as making it deployable, it also renders it far more survivable. In fact, the S-500 is not the only system on development that will supersede the A-135. A follow-on development of that weapon, the A-235 , is also due to provide strategic defense against ballistic missiles attack, although it’s actually expected to be a dual-role missile with an anti-satellite capability. There is also potential for a naval version of the S-500, which would follow the same pattern of development as the S-300 and S-400, both of which have analogs in service with the Russian Navy. In this instance, a naval S-500 has been connected with the planned Lider class of destroyer, although the fate of this ambitious program is currently unclear, with reports of its suspension last year. A model of the Project 23560 Lider class destroyer design., ARTEM TKACHENKO VIA WIKIMEDIA From a Russian perspective, the S-500’s advanced capabilities can’t come soon enough. After all, the United States is now rapidly progressing plans to modernize all three legs of its nuclear triad, as well as develop new strategic and theater weapons delivery systems, including cruise missiles , revamped ballistic missiles , and rocket artillery . An ability to counter hypersonic missiles has been attributed to the S-500, but it’s unclear if this refers to incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase of flight or the new class of weapons that will cruise at hypersonic speeds. Certainly, hypersonic weapon defense will become a developmental focus of the system, if it is not already. Regardless, a mature S-500 could play a part in a Russian mid-course intercept capability. While actually realizing a robust ability to do so is a highly complex proposition and extends well beyond a single air defense system, S-500 could be a crucial part of realizing such a capability set. Even an extended-range terminal anti-ballistic missile capability, with the potential to even intercept very fast-flying ICBM warheads as they careen through the atmosphere, would be a remarkable accomplishment. The inherent flexibility of the S-500 looks to make it an attractive air defense asset not only for Russia but likely also for export customers. In the same way that the S-300, and then the S-400, brought long-range, mobile, SAM systems within the reach of many operators, the S-500 could do the same for anti-ballistic missile systems. After all, as well as being able to defeat these kinds of threats, the S-500 retains the ability to engage traditional air-breathing threats at very long range, too. The S-500’s long reach promises to further push back the “safe” areas in which high-value-asset aircraft such as aerial refueling tankers and Airborne Warning and Controls System (AWACS) aircraft can fly their critical missions. All told, while the S-500 has clearly suffered from delays, if its full potential can be realized, this ambitious program could set in motion an important overhaul of Russia’s ground-based air defense capabilities, further extending its existing A2/AD zones.

Adam Kehoe and Marc Cecotti,"Updated on Jul 14, 2021",The Strangest Encounters With Unidentified Aircraft We’ve Found In The FAA’s Huge Database (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone has begun to analyze some of the thousands of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) drone and unidentified aircraft incident reports collected in our new mapping tool . Several of these reports describe incidents that have been featured in our previous stories, including one that showcased nearly two dozen unusual incidents involving military aircraft or training ranges. However, many of them have provided leads on new and highly unusual incidents, ranging from puzzling high altitude encounters to craft described as cylinders and even discs. As might be expected, the degree of severity of the incidents in the data set varies dramatically. Many of the reports describe common but nonetheless concerning safety hazards posed by errant recreational drones flown at low altitudes. Buried within the reports are also much more concerning incidents involving aircraft operating near sensitive facilities, such as nuclear installations and military bases, or at highly peculiar, and illegal, altitudes. The reports also vary considerably in terms of the type of aircraft described. Beyond the expected menagerie of commercial and recreational drones, a number of unusual vehicles are mentioned, including some balloon-drone hybrids, and a small smattering of references to what pilots described as UFOs. We have created an interactive mapping tool that features nearly 10,000 drone and unidentified aircraft encounter incident reports that make up the FAA’s database that spans seven years. You can check it all out here. , UAVGEOGRAPHY.COM While many of the stranger reports will understandably draw attention, it is important to recall that simple commercial drones constitute a growing aviation safety issue. While we are working to conduct a more thorough analysis, it bears mentioning that the FAA dataset has 556 references to “NMACs” or near mid-air collisions. For example, in 2019 one of the reports cited an orange drone passing within three feet of the wing of an aircraft flying at 2,800 feet near Boston, Massachusetts. This brief video from Aviation International News depicts research findings on the potential hazard posed by drones striking aircraft: The Data Set The FAA does not provide many details about exactly how it collects and filters its Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Sightings Report . However, the incidents largely focus on unauthorized or dangerous UAS activity. Given how broad the UAS designation has become, the reports also encompass a number of unidentified aircraft in addition to objects explicitly identified as drones and balloons. The report summaries available in this data are typically brief. However, 72 percent of report summaries reference additional documents generated by the FAA’s Mandatory Occurrence Report (MOR) process. According to FAA regulations , a MOR must be generated whenever a pilot reports “unauthorized UAS activity or authorized UAS activity that is conducted in an unsafe or hazardous manner.” An example of a MOR report can be seen below. Example of a Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Mandatory Occurrence Report , Federal Aviation Administration The reports help provide structured information about the incident, including whether the observed UAS or unidentified aircraft flew as part of a swarm formation, and the general shape and type of the aircraft. Table of Vehicle Description Keywords , Data derived from FAA UAS Sightings Report, Adam Kehoe The full data available in MOR reports are not included in the public data set. The War Zone has filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Organization for copies of all MOR reports pertaining to these incidents. In the interim, we have filed individual requests on particular incidents of interest. Highlighting Interesting Cases It will take some time and the assistance of the public using our report mapping tool to fully identify all of the interesting cases, but below we will highlight some of the incidents we have found and examined so far. We have grouped some of the cases into thematic clusters. Many of the report summaries are written in highly dense, heavily formatted text that reveal fascinating details when read carefully. Nuclear Reactor Cases The War Zone has reported extensively on drone incidents involving strategic infrastructure, particularly domestic nuclear reactors. The most notable incident to date involved a half dozen drones “orbiting” the nation’s most powerful nuclear reactor facility in Palo Verde, Arizona. Indeed, three incident reports appear to describe those events: November 2017: Tonopah, Arizona PRELIM INFO FROM FAA OPS: TONOPAH, AZ/UAS INCIDENT/1934P/ALBUQUERQUE ARTCC ADVISED PALO VERDE POWER PLANT SECURITY REPORTED 2 LARGE UAS FLYING OVER THE POWER PLANT.

It should also be noted that the integrity of nuclear reactor airspace has been an international issue of some concern, particularly among environmentalists. In 2018, Greenpeace activists flew a Superman shaped drone into the side of a nuclear facility in Bugey, France. The stunt was designed to highlight the vulnerability of reactors to outside attacks. Military Incidents As reported previously, a large number of incidents involving military aircraft, airspace or facilities are represented in the dataset. A chronological list can be found below. Additional details are available in our previous reporting on these incidents. Many of these involved highly unusual altitudes for drones, often in excess of 10,000 feet. FAA regulations permit UAS to fly only as high as 400 feet in most situations.

UAS MOR Alert for ZLC Number: ZLC-M-2019/07/01-0005 Type: Hazardous and/or Unauthorized UAS Activity Date/Time: Jul 1, 2019 – 2026Z  A/C:  (CRJ2/L)  Summary: At 2026Z on R04 at FL200 reported what appeared to be a small drone unknown rotors about 1000 feet below them and 200 yards of their left side. Pilot stated it was an orange metallic color with the sun reflecting off it. No evasive action was taken by the pilot. On R05 at 2033Z the pilot of stated it could have been a Mylar balloon but it was flying like it was going somewhere and not floating aimlessly. Plotting the coordinates of when it reported the sighting shows the aircraft was in an unpopulated area of Utah at the from the Evanston WY airport. ACN. Intriguingly, balloon/drone hybrids have been explored in the past as a way to exploit the persistence of balloons with the maneuverability and station keeping of drones. An example can be seen below in this 2017 video from Mashable: UFOs Six of the case summaries reference the term “UFO.” In several instances, the term appears to be used by a pilot momentarily searching for words. For example, in this 2017 incident in San Antonio, Texas a pilot first refers to a “UFO” and later calls the object a small drone: October 2017: San Antonio, Texas PRELIM INFO FROM FAA OPS: SAN ANTONIO, TX/UAS INCIDENT/1330C/A321 PILOT REPORTED A SMALL UAS 6 NW SAT AT 3,000 FEET. NO OTHER DESCRIPTION GIVEN. NO EVASIVE ACTION TAKEN.

NO OTHER INFORMATION WAS GIVEN BY THE PILOT. NO OTHER REPORTS WERE GATHERED. The War Zone has received video of the radar screen and audio from the event. In the brief clip below, the pilot describes seeing the object and initially thinking it was a bird. As is somewhat typical in many of these incidents, he was unable to describe much about the drone. In the audio released to us, there appear to be no references to UFOs. Another incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involves a highly ambiguous sighting of a flashing light, with a pilot again apparently searching for words: January 2018: Tulsa, Oklahoma PRELIM INFO FROM FAA OPS: TULSA, OK/UAS INCIDENT/1745C/TULSA APCH ADVISED E75L OBSERVED A UAS WITH RED AND BLUE FLASHING LIGHTS KEEPING PACE OFF RIGHT SIDE AT 1,600 FEET BETWEEN 5 MILE TO 3 MILE FINAL FOR RUNWAY 18L.

E75L REPORTED THE UAS/ACFT WAS MATCHING HIS SPEED. THE PILOT NEVER ADVISED THAT IT WAS A UAS. HE SAID ALL HE COULD SEE WERE BLUE AND RED FLASHING LIGHTS. HE TOLD LOCAL THAT HE MIGHT CALL IT A UFO. WE HAD A REPORT 1/25/18 FROM A BE35 OF SEEING SIMILIAR LIGHTS. WE THOUGHT HE SAW ANOTHER AIRCRAFT ON FINAL. THE BE35 PILOT ADVISED THAT THE OBJECT WAS CLOSE TO HIM BUT IT WAS AFTER DARK AND HE COULDN’T SEE A SIZE COLOR ETC. ONLY THE LIGHTS. I WAS WORKING OSCIC FOR THAT SHIFT AS WELL. THE PILOT DIDN’T GIVE ANY INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE LIGHTS SO WE DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT. The War Zone has also received video and audio from this incident. In this clip, the pilot relates the sighting and inquires if it might have been a helicopter. The air traffic controller states that they have no indication of a helicopter in the area. After a short interval, another pilot offers that the sighting may have been a local news helicopter. One curious report from Louisiana involved a much larger unknown object: January 2018: Shreveport, Louisiana PRELIM INFO FROM FAA OPS: SHREVEPORT, LA/MISCELLANEOUS/1800C/SHREVEPORT ATCT REPORTED AN UNKN OBJECT AS BIG AS A HELO WITH RED, GREEN AND YELLOW LIGHTS HOVERING AT 2,000 FEET THEN 4,000 FEET 1 SW SHREVEPORT.

TRIED HAVING AN A/C VERIFY WHAT WE OBSERVED, BUT HE WAS UNABLE, TYPE IS UNKNOWN. Here a relatively large object (“as big as a helo”) was seen hovering at relatively high altitudes for an UAS. A second aircraft was unable to verify the observation, and the type remains unknown. The War Zone obtained the FAA’s Mandatory Occurrence Report about this incident. The report does not offer many details beyond the UAS Sightings report description: FAA Report Regarding Shreveport, Louisiana UFO Incident , Page One, Marc Cecotti FAA Report Regarding Shreveport, Louisiana UFO Incident , Page Two, Marc Cecotti The report highlights that the aircraft type was unknown. Several of the MOR reports we have remarked that the person filling the form had to select a known type like rotorcraft or fixed wing, even when the type is unknown. Another large object was observed near Robbinsville, New Jersy at 11,300 feet: July 2019: Robbinsville, New Jersey PRELIM INFO FROM FAA OPS: ROBBINSVILLE, NJ/UAS INCIDENT/LATE REPORT – 1405E/WASHINGTON ARTCC WAS ADVISED BY NEW YORK TRACON THAT END  AVL – LGA, OBSERVED A LARGE UAS OR “UFO” AT 11,300 FEET 10 SW ROBBINSVILLE.

The pilot stated that the UAS was about 3 ft in diameter and consisted of 2 pieces. The top was cylindrical and the color was silver and very reflective. The Pickens County, GA Sheriffs Department was notified. The Sheriffs Department had already received one report of UAS activity in that vicinity. Next Steps The reports above are a small sample of some of the interesting incidents in the FAA’s UAS Sightings data. We continue to search through them and develop new leads, and invite the public to help us find more. We are particularly interested in identifying high altitude cases that tend to be less typical of drone hobbyists. Some of the incidents we have identified have been in excess of eighty times the legal limit of 400 feet. A key challenge in evaluating this data is the sheer diversity of incidents it describes. The majority of incidents in the data set clearly describe known types of drones and balloons. Among the stranger cases, it is important to recall that the observation is often made of relatively small objects at great distances, at high rates of speed. Further, it is important to appreciate that UAS can have diverse physical shapes. The incident involving Greenpeace intentionally crashing a Superman-shaped drone into a nuclear reactor shows that UAS can be used to send a message, and that they can have unusual or even whimsical shapes. That said, many of the cases are legitimately puzzling, and should not be dismissed without further investigation. This is all the more true when those cases take place near critical infrastructure or sensitive national security facilities. Going forward, we will provide updates on any details we uncover on these incidents. We also plan to continue to develop our computational approach to the drone problem by extracting more information about the size, shape and color of the objects in order to identify potential patterns. UPDATE: JULY 20 12:11PM EST One of the encounters we reported above involved an incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In an audio clip of a conversation between an air traffic controller and pilots, one pilot mentioned the possibility that the sighting might have been caused by a local news helicopter owned by KOTV, News On 6. A source familiar with KOTV’s air operations contacted us and stated: “After examination of our records, we are unable to find anything indicating our helicopter, a Bell 206B, flew on 01/26/2018, or on 01/25/2018, since the report lists similar lights on that day. Since ours is the only news helicopter in the Tulsa TV market, there are no other stations who could have been there at that time. Furthermore, the audio and report indicate the object was at 1,600 AGL. We usually fly closer to 600-700 AGL. Also, our helicopter is based either at our own helipad in downtown Tulsa, or at Jones Riverside Airport (KRVS), so we only fly to Tulsa International (KTUL) if there is a story there.” UPDATE: July 20 4:42PM EST We removed extraneous formatting characters from a large number of the reports. The content of the reports remains the same. Contact the authors: Adam@thewarzone.com and Marc@thewarzone.com Adam Kehoe and Marc Cecotti Contributors Air Unmanned"
Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 9, 2021",This Spherical Manned Airship Was Tested By The Navy As An Eye In The Sky,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the early 2000s, the U.S. Navy expressed interest in a highly unusual manned airship known as the AeroSphere SA-60, a 62-foot-diameter completely spherical aircraft. The AeroSphere was intended as a persistent high-altitude surveillance , electronic intelligence, and communications platform, potentially offering some of the same benefits as a satellite but with a more flexible operational concept and at a far more affordable price. Unlike other high-altitude balloons , though, the AeroSphere could be optionally manned, and featured a cockpit housed directly inside the sphere itself rather than hanging in a gondola below it. At least one flight of the bizarre-looking craft reached over 20,000 feet, manned by the head of the Navy’s Airships Concepts program. The AeroSphere was built by TechSphere Systems International and marketed by Cyber Aerospace. The sphere was tested on multiple occasions in 2004, mostly at lower altitudes. A 2004 press release stated that tests of the AeroSphere would be conducted in June 2004 in the D.C. Metropolitan area in order to “demonstrate the significant capabilities of the [airship] to monitor activities on the ground while flying altitudes in excess of 5,000 feet.” In addition, the release says that the airship’s manufacturer received “two contracts for airship services; one from a U.S. Government agency, another from the U.S. Navy.” An archived page on the AeroSphere’s manufacturer’s website states that the Department of Defense “has expressed significant interest in utilizing the airships of Cyber Aerospace to enhance the U.S. forces surveillance operations.” The AeroSphere being shown off at a media event in 2004., AP/Elliot Minor At that time, the Navy was interested in a wide variety of airship concepts such as the Hybrid Ultra Large Airship , or HULA, which could be used for strategic airlift missions, or the Littoral Airborne Sensor Hyperspectral (LASH) airship which could be used for long-endurance surveillance missions. To that end, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) stood up the Advanced Development Program Office (ADPO) – Airship Concepts program in 2002 in order to explore a wide variety of lighter-than-air (LTA) craft and hybrid airships for a number of mission types including transportation, surveillance, and serving as communication nodes. According to the RAND Corporation, these airships could “ serve as surrogate satellites at a presumably reduced cost.” According to an archived 2004 article from DCMilitary.com , the AeroSphere SA-60 made at least two manned flights, including one piloted by Steve Huett, NAVAIR’s head of the ADPO Airship Concepts program. At the time, Huett said his team is “interested in making NAVAIR a focal point for airship technology.” In June 2004, Huett and Tim Buss, lead test pilot for one of the companies involved with the AeroSphere, conducted a test flight of the SA-60 prototype, ascending to 10,000 feet and flying for three hours. Four months earlier, DCMilitary.com reported Huett and the airship’s designer Holkan Colting set a world altitude record by taking the AeroSphere up to 20,453 feet. It was noted at the time that the prototype used in these tests was “severely underpowered” and operated at around only 40% of its propulsive potential. Another 2005 study written by USAF Major Andrew Knoedler for the Air Force’s Air University claims that the AeroSphere reached 20,000 feet during a test flight in 2003. Space.com reported the same claim . However, a 2005 RAND Corporation study titled “ High-Altitude Airships for the Future Force Army ” states that the AeroSphere would be tested at 65,000 feet. It’s unclear if any more tests were conducted above 20,000 feet, though. According to a 2005 Air University study by USAF Lieutenant Colonel Edward B. Tomme, the Navy was planning at some point to build a 200-foot diameter version that could reach “near space.” CyberAerospace made another model, the SA-260, which had a claimed operating altitude of 68,000 feet , far below anything that could be called “near space” but certainly high altitude. Air University The SA-60 was the company’s 11th prototype. The Aerosphere was intended to have a 50-hour loiter endurance, be able to carry two crew members plus a payload of up to 500 pounds, and weighed just 4,500 pounds total. Each AeroSphere cost around $5 million. The sphere’s lift came from a helium-filled Mylar bag housed inside the outer envelope. At launch, the helium bag only took up around six percent of the total volume inside the sphere. As the AeroSphere gained altitude, the inner helium bag expanded to take up about 85% of the interior volume, and some of the air keeping the sphere pressurized and rigid was released to make room for the expansion. According to a Rand Corporation study , the outer shell of the AeroSphere was made of Spectra fiber, a composite material found in body armor and vehicle protection. Unlike many other forms of airships that feature rigid internal structures or catwalks, the interior of the SA-60 was essentially just the inside of the balloon, with a small cockpit area. An internal blower system kept a positive pressure inside the craft, almost like an inflatable bounce house. The cockpit featured a Plexiglass windscreen offering a “spectacular” view, described as “like looking out a 14-foot porthole.” The AeroSphere at a demonstration at Captain Walter Francis Duke Airport in Hollywood, Maryland in 2004., AP/Matthew Gunby Two 80-horsepower gasoline engines powered a pair of 45-inch propellers on each side, which offered vectored thrust as they rotated on their mounts. Another engine and propeller were mounted to the rear of the sphere, but instead of offering propulsion, this propeller faced the craft itself. The stream of air from this rear propeller would eliminate what is known as boundary layer separation , an aerodynamic effect that increases drag. The crew of the AeroSphere could refuel the engines on the fly by keeping five-gallon containers of gasoline inside the envelope, or shell. The SA-60 had a small footprint when deflated, able to fit on a flatbed truck. A crew of six could have the airship ready to fly in less than 24 hours. The AeroSphere’s shape offered another significant advantage over oblong airships like blimps. Whereas a non-spherical airship has to pay constant attention to wind speed and direction, the spherical form of the SA-60 means it presents the same shape to the wind no matter which direction the wind is blowing. This allows it to be anchored in fixed positions without having to rotate around a morning mast in order to avoid being blown around by high winds. The AeroSphere at a 2004 demonstration flight., AP/Matthew Gunby The craft’s inventor Holkan Colting holds numerous patents related to airship components and design, including one for a spherical ship like the SA-60. In his spherical airship patent, Colting claims that such a ship could offer unique capabilities that could make it well-suited for electronic intelligence (ELINT) gathering: The present inventor has also noted other properties of a spherical airship that may tend to make it suitable for relatively long endurance use as a communications or surveillance platform. First, the envelope may tend to be transparent to electro-magnetic waves in the frequency ranges of interest, namely the electronic communications frequencies. This may tend to permit (a) remote control of the platform from a ground station, further reducing the weight aloft and lessening both (i) the risk of human injury in the event of a machine failure; and (ii) the need to land frequently for the comfort of the crew; (b) the use of the platform as a communications relay station for sending and receiving signals; and (c) the use of the station as a radar platform or as a listening station. European Patent Office The corporate structure of the companies that developed the Aerosphere is confusing, to say the least. Many publications list the manufacture as TechSphere, while others list it as Cyber Aerospace. The SEC lists a filing for Cyber Aerospace from 2004.  A SpaceDaily.com report from 2004 describes the sale of an AeroSphere by writing that “Proxity Digital Networks, through Cyber Aerospace, an operating subsidiary of Proxity’s On Alert Systems, announces the purchase of the AeroSphere SA-76 from Techsphere Systems.” SEC filings for Proxity Digital Networks ended in 2007 . The SA-60 popped back up in 2009, however, this time under the ownership of a different company, the Sierra Nevada Corporation. The company tested the AeroSphere at the Reno-Stead Airport in Nevada, drawing a lot of attention from locals. One Reno news station reported at the time that “the giant white sphere has generated quite a few calls” to their newsroom. Cyber Aerospace A spokesperson for the Sierra Nevada Corporation told the station at the time that the AeroSphere “could be used to monitor crowds or border crossings” or “be valuable to anyone who desires a persistent surveillance presence in a remote location.” It was reported that FAA regulations required the craft to be manned at the time, but “in the future it may be operated by remote control.” It’s unknown if any more tests of the AeroSphere were conducted after 2009. While it seems like the literal eyeball-looking eye-in-the-sky AeroSphere fizzled out before ever being deployed like so many other ambitious aerospace projects , lighter-than-air craft have never quite gone away from the Department of Defense’s arsenal, as high-tech balloons and aerostats are still widely used for surveillance and communication nodes worldwide. In fact, LTA craft seem to be having a resurgence lately. The unique capabilities they offer still have their place on the battlefield, even as more advanced platforms continue to proliferate. In 2020, it was revealed that the U.S. Army is looking to make unmanned high-altitude balloons to launch swarming munitions and drones that can act as sensor platforms or decoys as a key tenet of its future warfighting plans. However, unlike the AeroSphere, these balloons are almost entirely fully unmanned systems today, as ‘hybrid’ LTA craft can keep station for longer periods of time over a target area without the help of aircrews. Earlier this year, we reported on the appearance of high-tech balloons off the West Coast that can autonomously stay on station for up to 30 days, even against the wind, by varying their altitude in response to leverage wind and temperature patterns. A powered hybrid drone-blimp LTA craft, with a similar configuration as AeroSphere, could do so much more accurately and persistently, as well as maneuver to new areas whenever needed. Smaller, unmanned designs could leverage battery power and solar technologies to stay aloft for extreme lengths of time, as well. This blending of drone and blimp is not a novel concept, it has been explored , and continues to be , by multiple manufacturers , tech startups , and research groups. Even swarms of subscale drone-blimps have been tested. The Navy’s plans for placing giant optionally manned spheres high in the atmosphere may have not gotten off the ground, but similarly configured unmanned lighter-than-air craft appear to have a bright future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 5, 2020",The Navy Is Looking At Fitting Its Future Attack Submarines With Inflatable Sails,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is investigating the possibility of having its future nuclear attack submarines fitted with sails — the tower-like structures on their forward upper-hulls — that are inflatable, popping up when required, but otherwise concealed to preserve the sub’s speed, maneuverability, and acoustic stealth. The Inflatable Deployable Sail System (IDSS) is ultimately hoped to result in technology that will allow the Next-Generation Attack Submarine , or SSN(X), to be able to “operate submerged without the impediments of a sail.” In a document published earlier this year on the website of the Navy’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, under which the service seeks to provide funding for start-ups and small businesses, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) outlines its initial requirements for the IDSS initiative. The outlined objective: to “Develop technology that will advance traditional submarine design toward accommodating an Inflatable Deployable Sail System (IDSS) for future submarines.” One of the latest Virginia class submarines, USS Vermont (SSN-792), at Submarine Base New London, last December 24. The prominent sail may disappear from the next generation of U.S. Navy attack submarines., U.S. Navy/John Narewski While the IDSS could represent potentially cutting-edge technology for the Navy, it’s also worth noting that China has unveiled a sail-less submarine design in recent years. In 2019, in a surprise development, China unveiled a new submarine, roughly 150 feet long, with no apparent sail , and just a small fairing in its place. A photo of this unique submarine is provided at the top of this article. Initially, there was speculation this was an unmanned design, but the consensus is now that it’s likely a testbed for advanced new technologies likely to be found in future Chinese submarine designs. Clearly one of these concepts is a submarine without a sail. China’s sail-less submarine is thought to be a prototype for advanced technologies and submarine concepts., JIANGNAN SHIPBUILDING GROUP In the United States, too, there has already been some developmental work on exotic new sail designs, albeit using sub-scale submarines. This has included work at the Large Scale Vehicle Range (LSVR), part of the Navy’s Acoustic Research Detachment (ARD), around 375 miles from the ocean at Bayview, Idaho. A 1/4 scale attack submarine operates on the Large Scale Vehicle Range (LSVR) in Idaho testing a radical sail design., Public Domain The NAVSEA document notes that speed, maneuverability, and stealth are the primary drivers behind the IDSS concept but identifies the key challenge that will have to be overcome to ensure it will actually work — how to safely navigate a submarine without a sail. Traditionally the sail is used as an observation and conning platform when operating on the surface of the water, as well as providing one potential entry/exit route for the crew. Projecting well clear of the water, a traditional sail can also be used to help conduct vertical replenishment ( VERTREP ) operations. It also provides a position from which to provide force protection, too, and has an important function of breaking through the ice and providing initial access outside of the sub when operating in polar regions. The Seawolf class attack submarine USS Connecticut (SSN-22) after surfacing in the Arctic Circle during Ice Exercise (ICEX) 2020., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Michael B. Zingaro Above all else, the sail is normally used to house important sensors like periscopes, communication antenna masts, as well as electromagnetic and radar sensor systems. In the past, when submarines spent much of their time surfaced when engaged in combat, the sail also incorporated a physical command center, but more modern designs primarily have their critical functions contained within the main hull. The mast can even be used as a storage locker of sorts for special operations forces. Finally, the sail can sometimes serve as a location for diving planes, although this is becoming less of a common design element, evidenced by their relocation to the hull on the Los Angeles class SSNs starting with the improved 688i standard. Sail-mounted diving planes remain a characteristic of the Navy’s ballistic missile submarines , possibly including the forthcoming Columbia class . USS Honolulu (SSN-718) was among the last of the Los Angeles boats to feature the diving planes mounted on the sail., U.S. Navy Now, however, technological developments could mean that the Navy is able to make at least trial use of “Advances in inflatable structures [that] can provide the freeboard needed for surface transit with a temporary and reusable structure.” Above all, the challenge will be to find a way of retaining something akin to the functionality of the sail’s bridge area while the submarine is running on the surface, and allowing members of the crew to keep an eye out for maritime traffic or other potential hazards. Commander Lincoln Reifsteck, commanding officer of the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Hampton (SSN-767) stands on the bridge as the submarine returns to port following a deployment., U.S. Navy The IDSS is not expected to carry any sensor systems, which will instead have to be incorporated into the hull. The specific requirements from NAVSEA for an inflatable sail include a minimum 16-foot freeboard (the distance from the waterline to the top of the sail), capacity for at least two crew at the front of the bridge hatch, and another two behind them, plus all the required power, lighting and communications, flip-up windshield, storage lockers, and more. Of course, there also needs to be a means to access or escape the main pressure hull , via a ladder system, and the entire bridge module should not weigh more than 4,000 pounds. The structure will have to be resilient, too, capable of operating in icy waters and providing ballistic protection against small arms fire. A range of minimum operational constraints are outlined, including the requirement for 10,000 operational cycles, ability to maintain shape at periscope depth, in operations in Sea State 6, and at temperatures ranging from -60°F to 150°F. USS Chicago cruises at periscope depth near Malaysia. , USN “A generally soft or soft/rigid hybrid inflatable structure with a rigid or hybrid rigid/inflatable bridge,” the IDSS is expected to deploy or retract, in the space of just one minute, with pressurization achieved using seawater and/or air. “The structural loadings, deployment/retrieval operations, and stability mechanisms required present significant design and material challenges for an inflatable and deployable sail,” NAVSEA notes. The command suggests that industry might look at some of the kinds of inflatable soft structures now being used elsewhere in the Pentagon, as well as by NASA, which is looking at designs for inflatable space habitats, for example. In particular, these technologies include “inflatable control surfaces, deployable energy absorbers, and temporary on-demand structures.” The document then goes on to note many of the advanced manmade fibers that are used in these kinds of soft inflatable structures, of which Kevlar is probably the most familiar but also including Vectran, DSP (dimensionally stable polyester), PEN (polyethylene napthalate), and Spectra, a type of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. “The soft structures considered for use in developing the IDSS may include, but are not limited to, control volumes constructed of inflated membranes, 3-D woven preforms, flexible bladders, coated fabrics, and hybrid (soft/rigid) material systems, and hard goods-to-soft goods connections,” the document continues. “Hybrid inflatables may include inflatable elements with semi- or fully-rigid reinforcements serving as deployment shaping controls and abrasion-resistant contact surfaces.” Ultimately, NAVSEA may call upon interested parties to produce full-scale IDSS prototypes of their virtual design concepts that will be able to test inflation/deflation, and resistance to wave slap and impact loadings. A crew of a Los Angeles class attack submarine pulls into port. , USN That, of course, is still some way off and although the document doesn’t provide any kind of timeline and the Congressional Research Service’s latest report on SSN(X) doesn’t envisage a first example of the new submarine even being procured until Fiscal Year 2031. It’s also possible that the IDSS, if it does prove successful, might only be introduced on later blocks of the SSN(X) design. The Navy has been examining whether SSN(X) should be a follow-on to the current Virginia class design, a design based on the Columbia class SSBN, or an all-new design. Last December, The War Zone reported that the vessel would be significantly wider than the current Virginia class , making it closer to the dimensions of the advanced Seawolf class , while also utilizing technology being developed for the Columbia class. An artist rendering of the future Columbia class ballistic missile submarine, a derivative of which could form the basis of the SSN(X)., U.S. Navy If IDSS is successful and is adopted as part of the SSN(X) program, a further phase of the development, as envisaged by NAVSEA, would see it adapted for other potential applications, namely “future underwater weapons, unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and commercial/industrial dual use.” The latter category is notably broad, encompassing lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicles, space vehicle structures and habitats, “chemical/biological containment systems for internal use aboard aircraft and mass transit ground vehicles,” and others. It’s clear that the U.S. Navy is now looking seriously at operating future nuclear attack submarines with inflatable constructions in place of their traditional sails. While this proposal sounds like it would offer considerable advantages, on paper, actually developing a reliable technology is likely to be a much more challenging proposition. After all, if the inflatable sail fails to properly retract, for example, it would render the submarine highly vulnerable and at the very least end its mission. However, if NAVSEA’s initiative is a success, it could permanently change the way advanced attack submarines look while making them even more effective fighting machines.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Twitter user by the name @Nemo4Incognito posted a video supposedly showing himself fishing a piece of a missile out of the sea. Judging from the video, he found the tail section, which includes the motor, from a Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon , also known as an NLAW. The caption accompanying the video states that the tail section was found in the ocean near the Lulworth Ranges, a live-fire practice range for tanks and other armored vehicles. While the individuals in the video are joking as they handle the missile component, touching any piece of an explosive military device, whatever its condition, is no laughing matter. A soldier firing an NLAW, Royal Navy Watch the video in the tweet below: The NLAW is a “fire-and-forget” short-range anti-tank missile system developed by Sweden’s SAAB and the U.K.’s Thales Air Defence jointly for infantry use. The unique man-portable, shoulder-fired weapon is designed to be disposable, being capable of firing only once. SAAB claims that the NLAW is “unjammable” and can be deployed in only five seconds by a single soldier, day or night. The NLAW has a claimed range of 20–800 meters and fires a shaped charge designed to penetrate armored targets. A soldier aiming an NLAW practice unit., MOD The NLAW, which can easily be fired by a single soldier, can fire in both Direct Attack or Overfly Top Attack (OTA) in which the missile will detonate downward onto targets from above, where armor is usually thinnest. SAAB also claims the NLAW “can be used against soft targets like trucks, buses, cars and helicopters” and that “When fired directly through a window into a building, fragments will cause significant damage.” Operators must track a threat with the NLAW’s onboard guidance system for three seconds before firing, at which point the missile will use predicted line of sight (PLOS) to guide itself towards its target. It has no infrared, TV, or radar sensors to track the target in flight. Instead, the PLOS system predicts where the target will be after the missile’s short flight and it flies a tailored arch to that point. The system is said to work very well under most engagement circumstances and it keeps the missiles light and relatively affordable. The missile found by @Nemo4Incognito likely came from the ranges at Lulworth Camp, a British Army base on the southern coast of Dorset, England that is home to the Armoured Fighting Vehicle Gunnery School and the Lulworth Ranges. The Gunnery school has been in use since 1918 . Tanks used for live-fire training at Lulworth Camp., Public Domain The Lulworth Ranges post updates about the live-fire exercises planned for each month, with the accompanying warning: “Do not enter the danger area when the range is in use, this is a danger to life.” The UK government even hosts an entire page devoted to notifying the public about when it is safe to visit military training ranges on public lands. The Lulworth ranges are not only right in the middle of a very popular tourist area, but tourists are also allowed to move freely through parts of those ranges at certain times. The War Zone’s Thomas Newdick says that “It used to be the case that there was a red flag, and you took your chances. I’m not sure now, but there are periodic road closures.” A map of the danger areas at sea surrounding Lulworth., Defence Infrastructure Organisation The user who posted the video to Twitter has been getting plenty of flak on social media from people basically telling him he’s an idiot for touching anything that appears to be ordnance, unexploded (UXO) or otherwise. Injuries and deaths caused by the remnants of war are common throughout many parts of the world, but England’s issues with UXO mostly center around the leftover bombs dropped by the Luftwaffe on major cities like London or Portsmouth during the Blitz in WWII. Discovering parts of weapons from modern live-fire training or exercises is less common, but it does happen from time to time . Earlier this year, in fact, a target drone loaded with explosive countermeasures washed up on the beach in West Palm Beach, Florida. People surrounded it and even sat on it before it was hauled away by U.S. Air Force personnel. A British soldier lets loose an NLAW., 16th Air Assault Brigade Twitter Anything that looks like a bomb or missile should be treated as one, even if it appears to be inert or has already exploded, as was the case with the NLAW tail section found in Lulworth. Even the chemicals and materials used in modern weaponry can be highly toxic, especially after being burned, damaged, or otherwise partially destroyed. So yeah, if you see something that looks like it is part of a military munition, don’t pick it up, and notify the authorities.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Sep 11, 2020",MQ-9 Reaper Tests Prove It Can Operate From Unprepared Locations On The Fly,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force just demonstrated a new capability for the MQ-9 Reaper that could pave the way for the unmanned aircraft to deploy to and operate from a wider array of locations and without the need to have specialized infrastructure in place. The service has also now demonstrated how the drones can use targeting pods and other sensors to generate reference points for automatic landing and takeoff capabilities from the air to further support future agile, expeditionary deployments . This is a broader concept of operations that the Air Force has been developing, with a particular eye toward future distributed operations, particularly in the Pacific. The 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada conducted two successful demonstrations of the General Atomics MQ-9’s Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability (ATLC) on July 8, 2021, according to a USAF press release issued recently. During the tests, crews operated the MQ-9 from Nellis Air Force Base, located 56 miles away, using a satellite datalink. Reaper flying over the Nevada Test and Training Range. , USAF The successful demonstration shows the Reaper’s ability to “divert to airfields without traditional launch and recovery infrastructure or personnel,” according to the Air Force. The service said that this new capability for MQ-9, combined with an upcoming software upgrade and a new portable aircraft control station, will “change how it will be employed in theaters worldwide.” In the two-day demonstration, the Nellis-based 556th TES crew used satellite control links to fly the MQ-9 from Creech to Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico where it landed, taxied, and took off again to return to Creech. The USAF says the aircrew “used imagery in the cockpit to generate the reference points for the automated landing system” during the first day of testing. The second day of the tests saw the crew fly the Reaper from Creech to Holloman Air Force Base and back, with the MQ-9 using a targeting pod to collect data about the destination’s runway, fly in a safe traffic pattern, then land and take off again. The Air Force has previously tested the use of targeting pods for non-traditional geolocation purposes aboard C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, in which the pods combined imagery from electro-optical and infrared sensors with laser rangefinder data to generate specific geographic coordinates that identify landing sites for airdrops. An MQ-9 Reaper prepares to take off from Holloman AFB using the Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability., USAF/A1C Jessica Sanchez The recent tests of a targeting pod being used for ATLC aboard the MQ-9 is a further demonstration of how those sensors’ capabilities can be leveraged for non-traditional purposes. The MQ-9 in its baseline configuration carries the Multi-Spectral Targeting System which includes an infrared sensor, both color and monochrome daylight cameras, and short and mid-wave infrared cameras. In addition, the MQ-9 is equipped with a laser range finder and designator, the former of which would be used to help gather precise geolocation data on unfamiliar landing areas. It’s unknown, then, why the 556th TES would test the MQ-9’s automatic takeoff and landing capabilities using a targeting pod instead of using the native MTS sensor ball. It could be that the pod has better performance for generating precise coordinates and bolting one on is a cheaper and faster solution than upgrading the native system to leverage the MTS instead—at least for now. Also, the pod provides another pair of independent ‘eyes in the sky,’ which can be beneficial for a number of reasons. The MQ-9 used in recent ATLC tests, shown here at Holloman AFB., USAF/A1C Jessica Sanchez Prior to these recent tests, the MQ-9 primarily employed split operations, meaning one crew piloted the aircraft from a ground station, such as at Creech AFB, while another specialized crew, sometimes on the other side of the world, was tasked with launching and recovering the drone in-theater once it came within line of sight and was “handed off.” It was also necessary for these recovery personnel on the ground to electronically mark reference points on runways using an actual Reaper. This effectively precluded the unmanned aircraft from self-deploying to an airstrip where this data had not already been collected and that did not have the other supporting infrastructure already in place. An MQ-9 in Afghanistan in 2015., USAF Now, the MQ-9 will be able to land at a much wider variety of airfields and installations without the need for these predetermined reference points. From the USAF’s description , it also sounds like the Reaper may soon be able to be operated by just one flight crew, flying the aircraft remotely and using the new ATLC system to land and launch the plane on its own without a dedicated ground launch and recovery crew. Of course, the aircraft would still need to be fueled, serviced, and rearmed by humans on the ground at any destination. In addition, the Air Force’s announcement about the capability states that “the technology and 556th TES-derived tactics are ready today for the aircraft to divert to a foreign field where an MQ-9 has never been before.” This would be highly useful in emergencies or for contingency operations, but in the future, it could allow MQ-9s to operate from a forward arming and refueling point , or FARP, instead of having to transit huge distances to return to a fixed base to rearm and reload, which takes a long time as it is a turboprop. This would be especially useful if the Reaper was ever tasked with covering large areas of the Pacific, a region for which the Air Force has been developing more flexible deployment scenarios. A maintenance airman inspects an MQ-9 Reaper in Afghanistan in 2015., USAF Specifically, the Air Force says it is now particularly interested in how ATLC can help integrate MQ-9s into future operations centered on the Agile Combat Employment (ACE) concept. This is a broader initiative to move toward being able to deploy aircraft to various forward locations, including more remote or austere sites with limited resources. Overall, the ACE concept is an attempt to make it more difficult to defend against U.S. air operations and to provide better proximity for forces to key areas during a conflict and to enhance those forces’ survivability. The initiative also aims to make aircraft deployments more flexible and less predictable, enabling small numbers of aircraft to operate from austere locations , where they can land and take back off quickly regardless of existing infrastructure. A Reaper undergoing a pre-flight check in Afghanistan in 2015., USAF The Air Force has previously used MC-130J Commando II special operations transport aircraft to send crews to operate the UAV in forward deployments. This operation requires having site survey data on hand for safe landing and takeoff operations of the MQ-9, so it limits the places where the USAF can rapidly deploy the aircraft. The new capabilities offered by the ATLC concept would give this same force package a lot more potential basing options, while also potentially removing a large logistical and financial burden by flying the MQ-9 through satellite links only, without the need to transport a specialized launch and recovery crew. This could also drastically cut down the amount of time it takes to deploy an MQ-9, as the aircraft could fly itself to a new airfield and be ready to redeploy in a much shorter time than if it was disassembled and transported inside a container. In 2013, for example, it was considered fast to be able to have an MQ-1 Predator up and running three weeks after landing at an austere overseas airfield. The more portable ground control station mentioned in the Air Force’s ATLC announcement would only offer more speed and flexibility in operations. In addition to making deployments more flexible, ACE could help reduce the Air Force’s reliance on known, established bases that would likely be targeted in the opening stages of a major conflict. The concept is intended for use in the Pacific, in order to “ensure agility, deterrence, and resiliency in a contested or degraded environment,” according to a prior USAF release . While designed primarily as a long-endurance, high-altitude surveillance platform, the Reaper can also be fitted with a variety of air-to-ground and even potentially air-to-air weapons . The aircraft’s long-endurance capabilities and easy adaptability have also made it a very convenient platform to bolting on all types of podded systems—from wide-area surveillance systems, to electronic warfare pods, to networking relays, to AI computer brains , and much more . This wide mix of bolt-on weaponry and podded capabilities makes the Reaper uniquely suited to protecting areas around island outposts or providing multiple forms of intelligence collection over a broad swathe of ocean in low-to-medium threat environments. General Atomics Despite this proof of concept of the Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability, the future of the MQ-9 remains uncertain, as the Air Force has already signaled it wants to shut down production on the UAV . That debate is ongoing within the Department of Defense, with some top USAF leaders arguing there is no need for any more MQ-9 aircraft. The Air Force has already begun planning on the UAV’s replacement, tentatively known as the MQ-Next . Regardless, the MQ-9 will still serve for many years to come and it has a role to play even in a higher-end conflict, one which will require the Reapers to operate more independently than ever before.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a surprising turn of events, a pair of warships from the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy, or IRIN have broken out of the Atlantic and headed into the English Channel, where they were noted today. The final destination of the two vessels, the â€œsea base shipâ€ Makran and the frigate Sahand , Iranâ€™s most modern warship , is unclear, but their passage would conform with previous reports that they are headed to the Russian port of St. Petersburg for the naval parade that takes place there later this month.

For a while, it was anticipated that they might cross the ocean headed for Venezuela , to deliver weapons and/or oil. In particular, the appearance of seven missile boats on the deck of the Makran , as well as what seemed to be a full load of oil or fuel, suggested it might be delivering these cargoes to its ally in South America, as part of expanding military and non-military cooperation between the two countries.

(@TankerTrackers) July 17, 2021 Commissioned earlier this year, the Makran is a former oil tanker and, with a length of 755 feet, is the largest vessel in the IRIN fleet, drawing comparisons with the U.S. Navyâ€™s Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESB) , which are 764 feet long. The Makran Â is able to accommodate helicopters, but lacks hangars, and has also been used on maneuvers with drones, fast attack craft, and Â mini-submarines. However, there are also concerns that Iran may exploit a legal gray area afforded by the vesselâ€™s military status and use it to transport cargoes to countries under international sanctions, such as Syria and Venezuela. Previous Iranian efforts to deliver fuel to both Venezuela and Syria using merchant tankers have led to these vessels being impounded , while Makran is afforded additional protections under international law. Iranian media has also claimed that the Makran will be able to undertake other missions, too, including electronic warfare and special operations. In the past, Rear Admiral Khanzadi has also talked of the vesselâ€™s â€œmissile and weapons capabilities,â€ although it is not clear what these might consist of. As a naval auxiliary, however, Makran would be prohibited from launching attacks during a conflict, at least in a legal sense, although itâ€™s questionable whether the regime in Tehran would necessarily pay heed to that, especially in a time of heightened tensions. If anything, the prestige and importance of the Makran have only increased in the months since it was commissioned, following the loss of the replenishment ship Kharg , which caught fire and sunk in the Gulf of Oman, last month. The Kharg had been one of Iranâ€™s most important naval vessels and was once the biggest in its fleet. This vessel had been used to support operations further from Iranâ€™s own shores, including a high-profile visit to China in 2013.Â The sinking of the Kharg , after a fire in the Gulf of Oman last June 2., FARS/IRAN STATE MEDIA Accompanying the Makran , the Sahand has in the past been described by Iran as a destroyer , with a displacement of 2,000 tons, it is more accurately categorized as a frigate or even a corvette. The design is a derivative of British-made warships that were supplied to the country in the 1970s, before the Iranian Revolution.Â The Sahand is fitted with launchers for Â Qader subsonic anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as Sayyad-2 surface-to-air missiles, an Iranian adaptation of the U.S. RIM-66 Standard Missile-1 (SM-1). The warship also features a 76mm main gun and torpedo tubes, as well as various automatic cannons and machine guns for close-in defense.Â https://youtube.com/watch?v=ok_0RhvAm4Q The naval parade in St. Petersburg, planned for July 25, will mark the Russian Navyâ€™s 325th anniversary. As well as the likely appearance of the two Iranian warships, the event is also planned to feature three nuclear-powered submarines from the Russian Navyâ€™s Northern Fleet. These are the Borei-A class ballistic missile submarine Knyaz Vladimir , the Oscar II class cruise missile submarine Orel , and the Akula II class nuclear-powered attack submarine Vepr . Earlier this month, a writer for Iranâ€™s Tasnim News Agency tweeted that Iranian warships were expected to join the naval parade in St. Petersburg, together with the commander of the IRIN, Hossein Khanzadi. While the Atlantic deployment is a first for the IRIN, sending just two vessels is little more than a token force, but the importance lies not so much in the overall capabilities brought to bear, but in the demonstration of a new area of operations for the service, beyond the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. In the past, the IRIN has operated further afield, too, but primarily in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the northwest portion of the Indian Ocean. The ability to conduct long-duration, long-endurance missions in the Atlantic confirms that the service is at least starting to make good on its ambitions to become a blue-water navy.

In recent months, the IRIN and Russian Navy have taken part in joint maneuvers in the Caspian Sea, while there have been repeated reports that Iran has offered Russia the use of its own naval bases on its Gulf coast, which would extend the geographical area available for combined operations beyond the landlocked Caspian and into the wider Persian Gulf, and via the Strait of Hormuz, the Gulf of Oman.

At the same time, the lifting of United Nations restrictions on Iranian arms imports once again provides Russia, in particular, with a potential client for its advanced weapons systems. With that in mind, while the imminent presence of two Iranian warships in Russian Navy celebrations in St. Petersburg is chiefly ceremonial, it could also be a portent of increasing naval cooperation between the two countries in the years to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 17, 2021",Russia’s New Fighter Design Seen Uncovered For The First Time (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The biggest story going in the military aviation world right now is Russia’s new light-to-medium-weight fighter that has been hyped-up by what seems to have been an incredibly effective and glitzy media campaign . Now, for the first time, we have gotten a look at the design in an uncovered state prior to its official unveiling. You can read our prior analysis of Russia’s “Checkmate” fighter, which appears to be a Sukhoi product, by clicking here. Â A new video from the presentation area of what will likely be a dramatic unveiling ceremony at Russia’s big MAKS airshow outside of Moscow this coming week confirms a number of things about this new design and provide a few new details, as well. First off, we can confirm that the aircraft design has a single angular air inlet situated under its forward fuselage. Although we cannot definitively state it, it sure looks like a Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI), which makes sense considering a couple of other clues that exist as to the existence of a Russian single-engine fighter concept in development that would leverage this technology. This configuration would help provide steady airflow to the engine across a wide operating envelope without complex mechanical systems and controls, but it would also work to help block the engine fan face from radar waves from most angles. You can read all about DSIs in this previous piece of ours. https://youtube.com/watch?v=zFYdaOrGtWs We also see the aircraft has a slide-back bubble canopy like the Su-57 Felon , the advanced heavy fighter that this design likely shares a lot of subsystem architecture and other technology with. The staple infrared search and track system housing is mounted in front of the canopy as it is on all of Russia’s modern fighters. We also see that the aircraft does indeed have a pair of tailerons splayed out at an angle instead of a traditional vertical and horizontal stabilizer arrangement. This configuration can offer high maneuverability, reduced radar signature, and helps in reducing infrared signature from many aspects. It’s worth noting that a number of fighter concepts looked to leverage this configuration, including the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) designs the United States explored in the 1990s that led to the Joint Strike Fighter. The YF-23 actually put it to use. You can read all about this configuration as it was employed on the YF-23 here. The aircraft has a chine line that runs around its forward fuselage and makes up a leading-edge root extension (LERX). It also looks to have something akin to a bit of a boat tail, with ‘booms’ on each side of the main engine that support the tailerons. The wing looks like a modified delta design with ‘clipped’ wingtips. We will have to wait for more angles to give a better analysis of these details and especially its planform. The Checkmate jet is painted in a splotched gray and taupe scheme on its upper fuselage with a baby blue underside. This counter-shading-like concept is common for modern Russian aircraft and is most similar to schemes worn by the Su-57, which isn’t surprising. It wears a bort number of Blue 75 (maybe for Su-75?) and the Russian red star on its tail. Best stitch so far @TheDEWLine @Aviation_Intel https://t.co/avawAyCWIY — EvstPalaiologos (@EvstPalaiologos) July 18, 2021 The biggest new detail, beyond the inlet, we see in the image is what looks like an elongated, relatively narrow, conformal weapons bay situated forward of the landing gear. With just one angle available to us, it is hard to draw many distinct conclusions, but it appears to be best suited for a single air-to-air missile, likely of a shorter-range nature. This is a similar design philosophy to the Su-57, which has dedicated clamshell-like bays for a short-range air-to-air missile on each side. Presumably, considering the thicker dimensions of its center fuselage section, the Checkmate will have a ventral weapons bay, as well, with a serpentine duct moving air from the inlet to the engine, and over a weapons bay. The nose seems quite squat from the angle we are seeing it here, which would limit the size of the AESA array it could feature, at least in the vertical plane, although it could make up for some of that area horizontally. A better angle could change this analysis.Â The side view also indicates the aircraft has ample room for internal fuel. It will be interesting to see the range claims for this single-engine design. As to whether this is a real, flyable aircraft, I doubt it. It looks like an elaborate mockup, but we will have to wait for more imagery to better define just how far comprehensive it is. Wait for more details at midnight âš¡ On our YouTube-channel ðŸ‘‡ðŸ» https://t.co/x55tjPeiuV Or on the YouTube-channel of United Aircraft Corporation, Ð°nd the page of the project https://t.co/mPWIBOLOAx pic.twitter.com/IabCRBDGbq — Rostec Ð¡orporation (@Rostec_Russia) July 18, 2021 It is also worth noting that in the background there is what looks like a KH-59MK anti-ship missile . It will likely be part of a larger display of the exportable weapons the Checkmate is intended to be able to deploy. Finally, as to the issue of low-observability, or at least the degree to which the aircraft’s design is optimized for, my initial take is this will end up being somewhat similar in concept to the Su-57, taking a balanced design approach dictated by Russia’s capabilities in low-observable design, manufacturing, and material sciences versus cost and performance. The aircraft will have some optimization for reduced signature from the frontal hemisphere, where it is most critical. I don’t think this is trying to compete directly with U.S. stealth designs, that isn’t the point, but includes reduced radar signature where it matters most. In the end, any stealthy claims by the manufacturer won’t be as interesting as those pertaining to procurement and operating costs, sustainment, and funding for the type’s development, which will be substantial. As I have stated in the past, this aircraft is likely an export product answer to light-to-medium weight advanced fighter designs coming out of China, South Korea, and Turkey, to name the primary players. These aircraft, which all feature some degree of low-observability, should they go into production and hit the export market, could erode Russia’s share of the fighter market. Hence, the “Checkmate.” Turkey’s TF-X mockup., JohnNewton8 /wikicommons We will continue to update this post with more information as it comes available. In the meantime, what do you see of interest, let us know in the comments below. UPDATE: Rostec has posted yet another teaser video with a quick view of the rear, including a serrated round exhaust and a bit of the tail ‘booms’ and tailerons, as well as a head-on silhouette. There look to be large rectangular structures at the base of the tails. Whether these are the tail actuators, some sensor gear, or both, or something else, is not clear.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 19, 2021",Now We Know Russia’s Mysterious New Fighter Is A Single-Engine Design (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s new fighter, which appears, at least at this time, to be named Checkmate , is a single-engine light-to-medium weight design , based on more photos of the jet that have emerged since it made its surprise, unofficial appearance at Zhukovsky International Airport, outside Moscow, yesterday. While it’s vital to remember that we don’t know — yet —whether this is a full-size mock-up or a real aircraft, its engine configuration is a significant piece of the puzzle. The aircraft is set to be officially revealed next week at the MAKS international air show at Zhukovsky, but until then, here is our preliminary analysis. The fighter, which appeared at Zhukovsky wrapped in a black covering, has now been photographed from additional angles, albeit with most details still obscured. However, a view from the rear shows a telltale outline of a single round engine exhaust nozzle. Although it’s not clear what type of engine is installed, mock-up or otherwise, this confirms many rumors that the fighter would indeed be a single-engine type. The new fighter under wraps and in front of a hangar at Zhukovsky yesterday., Vlad Vinogradoff Meanwhile, the designer appears to be Sukhoi, with the company’s logo (in Cyrillic) appearing on the side of the large hangar in the background of the photos, which has been draped in Checkmate marketing banners for the unveiling. Last May 26, Russia’s TASS state-run news agency reported that Sukhoi was “developing the first Russian single-engine light tactical fighter with supersonic speed and low radar signature.” According to the same article, the aircraft would have a takeoff weight of up to 18 tons, fly at Mach 2-plus, and feature thrust-vectoring engine controls. While we can’t be sure that the aircraft seen at Zhukovsky is the same Sukhoi design, it does appear to broadly fit the description. Intriguingly, there has not been a new single-engine Russian fighter built since the Cold War and the country has, since then, been lukewarm about procuring any new aircraft in this class. That reality would tie in with the idea that the new fighter is being aimed squarely at the export market, perhaps as a low-observable, high-technology successor to the MiG-35 , the latest expression of the Cold War-era MiG-29 family. The impression that’s given by the PR campaign so far, which has included an English-language teaser on Twitter and a video that features “air force pilots” from the United Arab Emirates, India, Vietnam, and Argentina, certainly points to this being primarily an export offering. https://youtube.com/watch?v=u-OZZKnjhRI One or more of those countries may be more receptive to buying a single-engine jet than the Russian military, especially if the offering is a low-observable fighter that provides some of the technologies developed for its existing twin-engine, heavyweight Su-57 , but with a proportionally lower price tag and sustainment cost. So far, efforts to sell the Su-57 to foreign air arms have failed including, most spectacularly , in India. On the other hand, it’s worth noting that the successful Su-30 multirole fighter family relied almost entirely on Indian funding to make any progress through much of the 1990s and 2000s and this aircraft had already won a number of export orders before Russia, too, bought into it and acquired the Su-30SM version . Apart from the F-35 , which was tailored to a unique tri-service requirement, including a short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) version, all other so-called fifth-generation fighter designs to have made any significant progress to date have adopted a twin-engine layout. In selecting a single-engine arrangement, the United Aircraft Corporation will hope to drive down overall costs and complexity and potentially challenge single-engine rivals on the export market, such as the Sino-Pakistani JF-17 Thunder . From that perspective, the single-engine decision may make sense but it’s unclear what engine has been chosen for the aircraft, although it appears to have a round nozzle. The new-generation Izdeliye 30 engine would be the obvious candidate, offering more power and increased reliability compared to the AL-41F1 turbofan now used in the Su-57. However, the Izdeliye 30, which is expected to produce around 16-17 tons of thrust, is currently still in development. In the meantime, it’s likely the AL-41F1, producing around 14.5 tons of thrust, would be used in the new fighter, even if only temporarily. Both the Izdeliye 30 and AL-41F1 feature thrust-vectoring for improved maneuverability. In the past, there has even been talk of a potential new STOVL fighter design from Russia, which would also presumably involve a single-engine configuration with a lift-fan, as found in the F-35B. However, domestic demand for STOVL fighters is currently strictly limited, especially bearing in mind the status of the Russian Navy’s single aircraft carrier , although the two planned amphibious assault ships may have the potential to be completed for fixed-wing aviation operations. Beyond that, it’s questionable if there would be much foreign interest in that type of aircraft. Aside from its one engine, what else can we gauge about the new Russian fighter at this point? The engine intake, in particular, is a puzzle. From some angles, the covered-up aircraft seems to be fitted with side-mounted intakes similar to those on the F-22, or the diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) type found on the F-35. In at least one profile view, as Aviation Week ’s Defense Editor Steve Trimble has pointed out, the aircraft even seems to have a pentagon-shaped intake that begins just below the forward part of the cockpit canopy. This DSI arrangement would parallel a desktop model of an as-yet-unknown fighter design that appeared on the desk of Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov late last year. The fuselage seems to adopt the blended wing/body configuration found across most new-generation fighter types, with a prominent chine running along the centerline and perhaps incorporating prominent leading-edge vortex controllers, or LEVCONS, as found on the Su-57. These moving surfaces serve to increase lift and maneuverability at low speeds and, on the Su-57, reportedly also boost maneuverability at supersonic speeds. The outward-canted tailfins are prominent, but there’s no sign, as yet, of horizontal tail surfaces, or canard foreplanes. In the general configuration, the aircraft may have similarities in some of the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) designs that preceded the Joint Strike Fighter program, as well as developmental initiatives like Subsonic High Alpha Research Concept (SHARC), which was evaluated by NASA in the 1990s. SHARC and one JAST offering., NASA/McDonnell Douglas The landing gear on the new fighter appears very realistic, providing this is indeed a mock-up, with obvious shock-absorbing oleo struts. It also looks notably robust, but not too much can be read into this. For some generations now, Russian land-based fighters have been provided with heavy-duty landing gear to allow operations from poorly prepared surfaces. The complexity of the gear point to this article being either a highly elaborate mock-up or something further along, developmentally speaking. While the cockpit canopy is clearly visible, there is the possibility that, at some point, the new fighter could be fielded in an unmanned or optionally manned configuration, too. According to the TASS article from last May, the jet being developed by Sukhoi “can be a universal platform in manned and unmanned versions.” Such a program could perhaps leverage technology developed for the S-70 Okhotnik unmanned combat air vehicle, which Sukhoi is developing under the so-called Strike-Reconnaissance Unmanned Complex program. As such, it is possible that unmanned or optionally manned variants of this design could work alongside manned aircraft in a loyal wingman role, or as independent UCAVs. While this may be an exciting-sounding concept, it is harder to execute than it sounds and would likely be part of a spiral development roadmap, if it is envisioned for this type at all. The ability to offer a somewhat economical fighter with some low observable features and advanced sensors and avionics on the international market would be a significant coup, but there is little evidence Russia is in a position to do that independently without sacrificing other major defense initiatives. In order to do so, Russia is likely looking for a foreign partner to team up with that will offset at least a sizeable portion of the development costs. Once again, by leveraging as many of the lessons learned and even subsystems and components from the Su-57 program, risk could be reduced and the cost of such a program could become a little less daunting, but significant resources would still have to be applied to the program over multiple years. However, it’s significant that Russia thinks it can make a mark in the light-to-medium-weight fighter category, which has previously been dominated either by lower-cost designs like the JF-17 or by upgraded Cold War-era jets, like the F-16. While there may well be a market for a cheaper alternative to the F-35, realistically, Moscow will not be going after many potential Joint Strike Fighter customers. More likely customers, such as Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam, are also not necessarily in the market for single-engined fighters, although inserting some of the same high-end technologies developed for the Su-57 into this smaller and chapter airframe may change that. That said, any potential customer may have to first address the issue of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAASTA, which puts sanctions on countries buying from Russia (and other U.S. adversaries), unless a specific waiver is granted. India , for example, was forced to obtain a waiver to buy Russian-made S-400 air defense systems , and this can be a difficult process. If a customer is unable to buy the F-35 for political or budgetary reasons and can get around the CAASTA hurdles, the Russian fighter would still face competition from other indigenous advanced light-medium fighter types, providing they continue into production. These include offerings from China , South Korea , and Turkey , to name just three. The Chinese Shenyang FC-31 fighter prototype., CHINESE INTERNET Still, the fact that these other aircraft are deep in development could become a major issue when it comes to Russia retaining its current fighter market share. As such, at least in this regard, attempting to develop something similar makes some sense. In addition, it’s no longer just about selling fighters and munitions as well as support for those systems. Advances in unmanned technologies will see loyal wingman drones and unmanned combat air vehicles increasingly integrated with manned types. As such, “owning the infrastructure,” via the base fighter platform will be key to capturing these other tactical combat aircraft sales opportunities. In other words, more is on the line here potentially than what meets the eye today. With all that being said, we await the official unveiling of the new fighter at Zhukovsky next week with growing interest. UPDATE: We have a couple more photos that point to a lower fuselage inlet design. Say what you will, but the marketing campaign around this aircraft unveil has been pretty incredible.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Photos have appeared on social media showing what appears to be Russiaâ€™s much-hyped new light-to-medium-weight fighter , or at least a mock-up of it, days after the countryâ€™s United Aircraft Corporation first teased that a new design was likely to appear imminently. Previous announcements indicated that the rumored fighter, described as â€œa fundamentally new military aircraft,â€ was to be officially unveiled at the MAKS international air show that will begin at Zhukovsky International Airport, outside Moscow, next week. These new photos, which show the fighter at Zhukovsky, reveal a full-size airframe wrapped in a black protective covering. This reveals a stealthy-looking overall shape, including what seems to be a prominent chine along the fuselage centerline. The planform of the mid-set wing is not immediately discernable, but the twin tailfins are canted outwards. While rumors of the fighter have suggested it will be a single-engine design, that canâ€™t currently be verified and there have also been reports of twin-engine fighter studies ( author’s note: see update at the bottom of the story ). One of the images also shows a large hangar in the background, covered with banners promoting â€œThe Checkmate,â€ as the new jet seems to be named. A set of four images, showing the jet in different positions around the airfield, appeared on the Russian online social networking service VK , earlier today , credited to a photographer with the username V3tritium and carrying todayâ€™s date. That same name is also associated with an Instagram account, where another photo was posted, credited to Vlad Vinogradoff/V3tritium.Â https://www.instagram.com/p/CRWigmqoB8m A similar photo was then repurposed by Rostec, for use on its Twitter account, with the phrase â€œWanna see me naked?â€ overlaid. pic.twitter.com/la1RzjflZa — Rostec Ğ¡orporation (@Rostec_Russia) July 15, 2021 Rumors of a new Russian fighter design from the United Aircraft Corporation â€” the organization that brings together the countryâ€™s major aerospace firms â€” emerged on July 11, when that company posted a cryptic teaser on its Twitter account. This included the message (in Russian): â€œEverything is easier than it seems. #checkmate.

ROSTEC A video was then uploaded to YouTube on July 13, making it now clear that the new design was a fighter and suggesting that it was being pitched at the United Arab Emirates, India, Vietnam, and Argentina. Pilots from those countries all appeared in scenes in the video, as did the shadow of an aircraft over water, suggesting a probable twin-fin fighter design. https://youtube.com/watch?v=u-OZZKnjhRI The aircraft we see in the images does not appear to bear any strong relationship to existing designs. The big question is whether this is a mock-up, or a real aircraft, and to what degree the aircraftâ€™s development program has progressed.Â It could well be that the new design actually traces its origins back many years. Part of UAC, the MiG company has previously worked on the Lightweight Multifunctional Tactical Aircraft project, known in Russia as the Logkiy Mnogofunktsionalnyi Frontovoi Samolyot , or LMFS. LMFS dates back to the latter days of the Soviet Union and a 1986 call for the development of two complementary new fighter jets from the MiG design bureau. At the time, it was planned for the LMFS to supersede the MiG-29 , but the demise of the Soviet Union saw work on the LMFS suspended. Apparently dating from 2015, this is a wind-tunnel model of a potential LMFS configuration., GEEKTROOPER2/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS However, the idea of a lightweight fighter didnâ€™t disappear entirely and in the late 1990s the LMFS was resurrected to compete for the Future Air Complex of Tactical Aviation â€” in Russian, Perspektivnyi Aviatsionnyi Kompleks Frontovoi Aviatsii, or PAK FA â€” requirement. The MiG design was unsuccessful here, too, losing out to the Sukhoi T-50 project, which was formally selected in 2002 and has since become designated the Su-57 . Since then, however, MiG has continued low-scale, self-funded conceptual work on the LMFS, seeking foreign customers in the process. While the original LMFS was a twin-engine design, more recently the company has also considered an alternative, single-engine version. We will keep a close eye on developments in Russia and bring you more details as soon as they emerge. UPDATE/Tyler’s Analysis: It will be very interesting to see the details of this new concept. The images we have are a bit reminiscent of the Subsonic High Alpha Research Concept (SHARC) and Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) concepts that the United States explored in the 1990s, but the reality is we have likely seen glimpses of this design before.Â The SHARC and one of the JAST designs from the 1990s., NASA/MCDONNELL DOUGLAS I would expect it to heavily leverage lessons learned from the Su-57 and that it will likely take a similar ‘balanced’ approach to low observable (stealthy) features as its heavy fighter forebearer. You can read more about that here . The V-like tail is good for maneuverability, RF low observability and masking IR signature from various aspects.Â We can probably also expect some avionics commonality with the Su-57, and thrust vectoring capability, possibly based on one engine. A Divergent Supersonic Inlet (DSI) is likely as well, which would simplify the inlet design while maintaining performance and help with reducing radar cross-section from the forward hemisphere. A radar baffle could still be necessary for the engine fan faces , especially if it is a single inlet configuration mounted ventrally, which isn’t completely certain at this time. The image below has been floating around for some time supposedly showing the nose of a potential Russian light-to-mid-weight 5th generation fighter design and its DSI inlet. It’s still possible a twin inlet design could be used.Â Uncredited The big factor here is money. Russia would have to make some very hard choices to execute the full development and fielding of this aircraft themselves. Hence the heavy marketing push for major export partners to help offset some or even all of the cost.Â The development also comes as other countries are working on their own light-to-medium weight advanced fighters with stealthy attributes, such as Turkey and South Korea . These indigenous fighter programs could threaten some of the market currently enjoyed by Russian designs. Regardless, MAKS 2021 just got a whole lot more interesting.Â Stay tuned!

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 13, 2021",A Fifth Of The Air Force’s Combat-Coded F-22 Stealth Fighters Are Headed For Guam,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it is planning on sending roughly one-fifth of its combat-coded F-22 Raptor stealth fighters to the Western Pacific later this month as part of a major airpower exercise. The service says that the goal is to demonstrate its “strategic flexibility” in deploying significant numbers of combat aircraft to conduct operations from forward locations in the region. This is how it would expect to respond, at least in part, to any major contingency in this part of the world in the future, such as potential crises or conflict with China. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the Air Force’s top command in the Pacific, recently provided details about the upcoming Pacific Iron 2021 exercise, which, so far, it has only said is set to take place “in July.” Some of the participating aircraft have already touched down at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. The exercise will see various aircraft fly from Andersen, as well as the adjacent Northwest field airstrip and the island’s Won Pat International Airport, along with Tinian International Airport on the island of Tinian , which is part of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Both Guam and Tinian are U.S. territories. It’s very possible that the aircraft will also make spots elsewhere in the course of this training event. F-22 Raptors from the Hawaii Air National Guard’s 199th Fighter Squadron fly past Mount Fuji in Japan during a deployment earlier in 2021., USAF Around 25 F-22s will take part in the exercise, according to an official release . These aircraft will come from the 525th Fighter Squadron, part of the 3rd Wing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, and the 199th Fighter Squadron, an element of the Hawaii Air National Guard’s 154th Wing. A total of 10 F-15E Strike Eagles from the 389th Fighter Squadron, part of the 366th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, along with a pair of C-130J Hercules cargo aircraft from the 374th Airlift Wing at Yokota Air Base in Japan, will also be among the participants. F-15E Strike Eagles at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam on July 14, 2021, after having arrived for Pacific Iron 2021., USAF However, the F-22s, which remain some of the Air Force’s most capable fighters, are clearly the stars of the show. “We have never had this many Raptors deployed together in the Pacific Air Forces area of operations,” Air Force General Ken Wilsbach, head of PACAF, told CNN . A contingent of 25 F-22s may not necessarily seem like a large number, but, at present, the Air Force only has around 186 of these jets. Of those, only 125 of them are assigned to combat-coded units, with the rest being set aside for various training and test and evaluation duties . Many of the jets in the latter categories have not been upgraded to the most recent block configuration , either. All told, the 25 Raptors set to head the Pacific represent around 20 percent of the combat-coded aircraft and just over 13 percent of the total fleet. A row of F-22 Raptors, including non-combat-coded jets., USAF Beyond that, the F-22s are notoriously maintenance-intensive aircraft that have only become more difficult to sustain over the years. This is especially true when it comes to maintaining their special radar-absorbent skins , which are sensitive to environmental conditions. In 2020, only around half of the entire Raptor fleet, on average, was actually capable of performing any assigned missions, according to data that Air Force Magazine obtained earlier this year. If only half of the combat-coded jets are actually available for combat missions at any one time, 25 jets would actually represent around 40 percent of the real capacity of the Air Force’s F-22 fleet. As such, Pacific Iron 2021 is set to be a significant demonstration of the Air Force’s ability to muster up a large number of some of its most advanced stealth fighters, in addition to showing off the service’s force projection capabilities more generally. How the Raptors actually perform will be an important reflection of the real capabilities the fleet has to offer. This could also be doubly significant now that the service is openly talking about planning for the end of the F-22’s career and the potential replacement of these jets with a new sixth-generation fighter in development as part of the larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which you can read more about in detail here . Air Force officials have separately talked about the importance of NGAD program, as well as future upgrades to its fleet of F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, to winning conflicts in the Pacific region, especially any potential future altercations with China. Pacific Iron 2021 will notably come around a month after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) sent 28 military aircraft into the southwestern corner of Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ. This was the largest number of Chinese sorties in that area since the PLA began sending planes there on a near-daily basis back in 2020 and came after authorities in Beijing had reacted angrily to criticism of Chinese policies on various issues from the G7 group of industrialized nations, which includes the United States. As already noted, Pacific Iron 2021 will also be yet another demonstration of the Air Force’s ongoing development of new concepts of operations surrounding rapid deployments and distributed operations, which the service presently refers to as Agile Combat Employment (ACE). This is all heavily tied to broader efforts to be more prepared for higher-end conflicts, particularly in the Pacific, and to rely less on established bases . Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, a key strategic American military outpost in the region, would be a primary target in any large-scale fight with a near-peer adversary in the Pacific region, such as China. This reality has already pushed the Air Force to work on expanding the available facilities at Guam’s Northwest Field, as well as on Tinian , among other locations in the Pacific , to provide alternative basing options. Earlier this year, some of the service’s F-35As, as well as F-16C/D Viper fighter jets, deployed to Northwest Field to demonstrate that airstrip’s ability to handle more robust combat aviation operations. Before recent improvements were made, it was only able to accommodate C-130-type cargo aircraft and helicopters. Altogether, it will be very interesting to see how Pacific Iron 2021 plays out and what conclusions the Air Force might draw about its Agile Combat Employment concept, as well as about the future of its F-22s as those jets get closer to the twilight of their careers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 28, 2020",Check Out These Flag-Bearing Navy SEALs Training With A Submerged Submarine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has released a striking underwater image, seen at the top of this story, of SEALs conducting diving operations training while embarked on the Virginia class attack submarine USS New Mexico in the Mediterranean Sea. Submarines, in general, offer a valuable way to covertly or clandestinely deploy special operations forces , and the Virginia class, in particular, was designed with a number of features to support these missions. The training event took place in June, but the Navy only released the picture above yesterday. This image shows five individuals, one of which is holding a line with the flags of the United States and the state of New Mexico attached to it, congregating near the exterior hatch to the submerged submarine’s lock-in/lock-out chamber. The Navy had previously released another underwater shot from the drills, seen below, as well as other pictures of the naval special operations forces working with the New Mexico , after the submarine had picked them up in Souda Bay in Greece on June 4, 2021. US Navy SEALs swim around the Virginia class submarine USS New Mexico in the Mediterranean Sea in June 2021. The exterior hatch to the lock-in/lock-out chamber is seen open in the background., CPO Christopher Perez, USN It is worth noting that both the Navy’s submarine forces and the SEALs typically try to keep a very low profile, so highlighting these activities, at all, is notable by itself. This is the latest example of a recent burst of unusually public submarine activity , which service has often publicized officially , around the world , as well. Interestingly, the Navy also described this particular set of drills as a “milestone event” and a “proof-of-concept in theater” to show how the capabilities that these naval special operators offer could be more readily included in routine submarine operations in the region. However, though the Navy categorizes them as attack submarines, the Virginia class was designed from the outset to have multi-mission capabilities, including the ability to support special operations forces. A number of these boats are configured specifically for the special operations support mission with a Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) on top of their hulls aft of their sails. The DDSs, like the one seen in use in the Navy Combat Camera video below, allow for the underwater deployment of large payloads, such as miniature submarines and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), as well as the simultaneous egress of large groups of combat swimmers. Even without a DDS fitted, all “ Virginia class submarines have special features to support special operations forces (SOF), including a reconfigurable torpedo room which can accommodate a large number of SOF and all their equipment for prolonged deployments and future off-board payloads,” according to the Navy. “The class also has a large lock-in/lock-out chamber for divers.” Since around 2014, at least, New Mexico has actually been specifically designated as an alternate to the special operations-focused boats with the DDSs installed. Still, this recent drill does underscore how, even without a DDS, Virginia class submarines, in particular, can be rapidly repurposed as underwater launch platforms for special operations forces. A briefing slide from 2014 showing US Navy submarines configured for special operations forces support and equipped with DDSs, as well as alternate boats, including the USS New Mexico ., SOCOM “The combined clandestine capabilities of Naval Special Operations Forces and submarines provide an asymmetric advantage that bolsters the Navy’s lethality from the sea,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Anthony Carullo, the Director of Maritime Operations for U.S. Sixth Fleet, which oversees American naval operations in and around Europe and much of Africa, who is also the Commander of Submarine Group 8, said in a statement about the training earlier this month. “This training demonstrated how the submarine force can adapt mission sets for theater commanders, providing a variety of options to address multi-domain challenges.” “The training between Navy SEALs and USS New Mexico are a real-life demonstration of the capabilities the U.S. military can bring to bear,” U.S. Air Force Major General David Tabor, head of Special Operations Command Europe (SOCEUR), said in a separate statement . “It is important to remember Special Forces do not operate in a vacuum. Close coordination between Special Operations Forces and conventional forces acts as a force multiplier and leverages discreet capabilities to enhance lethality and contributes to dominance on the battlefield.” The use of submarines to deploy small teams of combat swimmers is, of course, hardly new . As Rear Admiral Anthony Carullo noted, submarines inherently offer a prime way to get special operators where they need to go covertly or clandestinely. This ability to conduct operations discreetly and in contested environments is extremely valuable for staging raids on targets at sea or on land , with special operations forces like the SEALs being able to minimize their chances of detection when traveling to and from their objective. However, not having the DDS would limit how far away a Virginia class submarine could deploy special operators from their targets. Without a larger swimmer delivery vehicle of some kind, SEALs or other combat swimmers would have to rely on smaller propulsion devices or simply swim the entire distance, which could be extremely taxing on even highly trained personnel. A picture showing SEALs on the surface as they prepare to rendezvous with the USS New Mexico . The submarine’s various masts are seen at the right., CPO Christopher Perez, USN Scuba gear with rebreathers , which it’s not clear if the SEALs were wearing during the training with USS New Mexico , do keep breathing gasses warmer, and therefore makes the entire experience closer to normal breathing, helping to reduce fatigue. They also recycle those gasses, giving individuals more time they can spend underwater, and more range as a result. However, none of this changes the physical stamina required to swim across extended distances underwater, especially if the water temperature is very low. Cold water temperatures can cause fatigue even for individuals riding in swimmer delivery vehicles that are not fully enclosed and this is one of the reasons why the Navy has been developing a new Dry Combat Submersible to at least supplement existing “wet” designs. The SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) Mk 8 seen above is a “wet” swimmer delivery vehicle presently in US Navy service, but can only be deployed by submarines equipped with a DDS., MCCS Andy Mckaskle, USN Regardless, training to integrate SEALs, or other special operations forces, such as Scuba-qualified U.S. Army Special Forces teams, into Navy submarine operations on a more routine basis could offer commanders in and around Europe and Africa greater flexibility. Being able to readily embark those special operations elements onto boats at forward locations, such as Souda Bay, would only provide more options during crises and contingencies of various scales. Training to more regularly use any Virginia class submarine for special operations forces support missions is also valuable given the limited number of boats specifically configured for these tasks, which also include the four Ohio class guided missile submarines. Those converted Ohios , which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature , are in very high demand around the world, but are also extremely low-density assets, which can function as long-range strike platforms, launch pads for special operations forces and unmanned systems, and robust underwater intelligence fusion and command and control centers. The concepts of operation that the SEALs and the crew of the USS New Mexico demonstration would be applicable elsewhere around the globe, too. However, it’s perhaps not surprising that the Navy chose to publicize this particular training in the Mediterranean, which touches on a number of areas of tension or potential flashpoints, from Syria to the east , the Black Sea to the northeast , and North Africa to the south . The region is a hotbed of submarine and other naval activity, recently both on the part of the Navy , as well as its allies , and potential adversaries, particularly the Russians . It is, of course, still intriguing that the Navy decision to publicize any of this at all, and it remains to be seen whether more imagery of these kinds of specialized, but very valuable training exercises will continue to be released as time goes on.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iron Eagle may have been “the other” fighter jet movie of 1986, but for some of us, it really triggered our interest in military aviation. Even as a very young kid seeing it, I was just as fascinated in trying to understand what seemed like total bullshit as what looked real. Decades later, I penned the definitive resource on explaining one of the film’s biggest absurdities—the seemingly unlimited arsenal of Iron Eagle’s F-16A Fighting Falcons. Now you can show the world that you too are an Iron Eagle with this rad T-shirt. Beyond the fighter jets, Iron Eagle was the quintessential 1980s action movie, complete with a beyond stupid premise and ‘super kids’ that could do anything—even commit all types of felonies to steal a pair of F-16s and go to war with a foreign country. I mean does it get any better and worse? Let’s not forget the soundtrack was actually excellent, anchored by Queen, although, once again, it was overshadowed by the score to Topgun and the heaping of Kenny Loggins that movie came with it. Also, Iron Eagle hit theaters first, by about five months, which didn’t help in keeping it top of mind after Maverick and Co. showed up on the big screen. Doug Masters and Knotcher on the home stretch during the Snake race scene., Tri Star Pictures There were so many great lines in this thing. Louis Gossett Jr. was absolutely classic, playing up all types of tropes with deadly seriousness. I mean, how can you forget this pep-talk monologue delivered right when our young hero and teenager turned F-16 ace, Doug Masters, needed it most?: “God doesn’t give people talents that he doesn’t want people to use. And he gave you The Touch. It’s a power inside of you, down there where you keep your guts, boy. It’s all you need to blast your way in and get back what they took from you.” Above all else, it made the elegant F-16 a bonafide movie star—only to be upstaged by the very opposite F-14 Tomcat , truly a brutish beast of a fighter, months later. Israeli F-16 “Netz” fighters wearing USAF roundels and tail codes were the winged stars of the movie., Tri Star Pictures The movie was largely filmed in Israel, which made it all that much more confusing. “Why are Air Force F-16s flying around in desert camouflage? What are those delta-wing fighter planes ? This doesn’t feel like the U.S. does it?” It is pretty wild to think that Israel went with this during the mid-1980s. That’s probably worth its own story all in itself (coming soon!). One scene in the movie that stands out as ridiculous as it is awesome, maybe above all others, is where, in Iron Eagle’s bizarre alternate universe, Doug Masters, a high school kid, and pilot (also a secret F-16 pilot, too!), that has a bunch of Air Force brat buddies that are also pilots, races at low-level through dangerous terrain on a route known as “The Snake” against his personal nemesis, staple teen movie dickhead, Knotcher. Of course, Knotcher doesn’t race Masters in an aircraft, but instead on a dirt bike. High tempo rock, illogical aerobatics, and many thousands of dollars in damage to aircraft ensue. I mean weren’t you and your high school buddies from working-class military families racing in airplanes when you were young? The entire thing is absolutely bonkers and it goes down as a true cult classic aviation/automotive race scene from a less logical era in entertainment. It also brings us to the second aircraft celebrity of the film, the Cessna Aerobat—the fully aerobatic derivative of the extremely pedestrian Cessna 150/152.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk from the U.S. Army’s 1st Combat Aviation Brigade was forced to make an emergency landing on the streets of Bucharest, Romania this week, creating some incredible footage in the process. Images and video shared to social media show the helicopter coming in low over Charles de Gaulle Square in the Romanian capital. Luckily, nobody was hurt in the incident. U.S. Army Europe and Africa public affairs published a release stating that the crew “conducted a precautionary landing” and that “Due to the expertise of the crew, and the Romanian police officers on the ground, the helicopter landed safely.” The Army states that a joint Romanian and American investigation into the incident is now underway. In the images and videos shared online, the Black Hawk can be seen flying along above a busy boulevard before making a rapid descent and landing in the road amid traffic near a roundabout. As it descends, the rotors of the helicopter appear to knock down two streetlights, at least one of which landed on a car. After the landing, images show the crew milling about on cellphones as emergency personnel surround the site. The engine compartment of the Black Hawk was opened after the landing, but it remains unclear why the helicopter was forced to land. Firefighters inspect the Black Hawk helicopter from above as onlookers try to get a glimpse at the helicopter., AP/Andreea Alexandru The U.S. Embassy in Bucharest also issued a statement following the landing that said they are “working with our Romanian partners to resolve the situation and we will provide more information as it becomes available,” according to Reuters . “We regret the incident that happened Thursday … with a helicopter of the U.S. Armed Forces that was forced to land in Charles de Gaulle Square in Bucharest,” read a separate statement from the Romanian Ministry of Defense, according to ABC News . “The pilot managed to control the aircraft so that there are no victims, and the material damage is reduced.” A Romanian serviceman talks on the phone following the emergency landing., AP/Andreea Alexandru Images shared to Twitter show the slight damage caused by the Black Hawk’s emergency landing, which includes two downed light poles. It does not appear as if the helicopter suffered any serious damage. In videos shared online following the incident, the helicopter can be seen breaking formation as it quickly loses altitude before landing amid pedestrians and motorists: In another video posted to social media, it’s easy to see how low the helicopter was as it swooped in above vehicles on the Bucharest streets: A Romanian gendarme takes pictures of the damage caused by the Black Hawk’s emergency landing., AP/Andreea Alexandru The Black Hawk was reportedly in Bucharest to rehearse for an upcoming military parade that will celebrate the end of the Romania’s military involvement in Afghanistan. Romania sent some 32,000 troops to Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, and withdrew its remaining forces in May 2021. Romania joined NATO in 2004 and has since developed strong military ties within the Alliance, including with the United States, in particular. The country notably hosts an Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense site operated by the U.S. Navy. A U.S. Army crew inspects the Black Hawk following the emergency landing., AP/Andreea Alexandru Following this incident with the downed Black Hawk, Romania’s defense ministry has reportedly canceled all aircraft participation in the upcoming ceremonies. The Army’s official press release has also offered more details about the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade’s current deployment to Europe: The unit is forward deployed from Illesheim, Germany, as part of the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade rotation and operating in support of Atlantic Resolve. Atlantic Resolve rotational units conduct bilateral, joint and multinational training events in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. The training focuses on strengthening bonds between allies and partners, increasing interoperability and building readiness. The UH-60 Black Hawk , and its many variants, are one of the mainstays of U.S. Army air missions. The helicopter first entered service in 1979 and has been used in a wide variety of roles including tactical transport, medical evacuation, electronic warfare, special operations support, and even mine laying. Black Hawks are now used by the militaries of 28 countries worldwide. We will update this story as more information becomes available.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 9, 2021",Arctic Pit Stop A First For British Typhoon Fighter Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Royal Air Force’s Eurofighter Typhoon jets have tested a “hot pit” refueling capability for the first time in Norway, during a deployment that parallels recent U.S. Air Force activities in this increasingly contested area. This involves aircraft being topped up with fuel with their engines running the entire time. The proof-of-concept exercise was used to test the ability of the Typhoon to operate from a dispersed location, which would likely be of paramount importance in any future conflict with a peer adversary. The training event, announced by the RAF today, took an undisclosed number of Typhoons assigned to No II Squadron from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland to Bodø Main Air Station in northern Norway, above the Arctic Circle. The fighters were supported by an A400M transport plane and a Voyager aerial refueling tanker , both from RAF Brize Norton in England. A Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 accompanied by a pair of Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16AMs., Crown Copyright After establishing what the service described as a “self-sufficient, multi-skilled, RAF team that was embedded within the Royal Norwegian Air Force [RNoAF] base,” the Typhoons flew a joint training exercise over the Norwegian Sea with RNoAF F-16 fighters . “This integrated activity demonstrated our ability to deploy, integrate and recover our assets in an agile, short notice manner,” said RAF Air Vice-Marshal Ian Duguid, U.K. Global Air Component Commander. “This small footprint strengthens the flexible employment of Air Power across the NATO partnership.” “This bilateral training improves the speed at which highly capable Air Forces, across the NATO partnership, can deliver decisive airpower from several dispersed locations,” added Royal Norwegian Air Force Colonel John Olsen, Norway’s Defense Attaché to the United Kingdom. While the deployment of RAF aircraft to Norway helped improve interoperability and strengthened the bonds between the air arms of the countries, “hot pit” refueling also has an important application in real-world scenarios, maximizing the amount of time spent in the air compared to on the ground and reducing turnaround time between missions. While the RAF has conducted “hot pit” refueling at its own bases in the United Kingdom, notably when it still operated the Tornado GR4 strike aircraft, the latest, out-of-country exercise for the Typhoon is planned as part of a series of drills that will practice setting up and then running flying operations from “multiple dispersed locations” at short notice. The plan is that, should it be required, Typhoons could be rapidly dispersed to other bases, likely those of NATO allies elsewhere in Europe, such as Norway, refuel on arrival, and then immediately launch operations. This could be put to use to respond to a particular situation that flares up in another country, or otherwise to disperse the RAF Typhoon fleet from its two main operating bases in the United Kingdom, Coningsby and Lossiemouth, should they come under threat. That last point was among those raised yesterday by U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces James Heappey, during his address at the Air Chiefs’ Conference yesterday. An RAF Typhoon is refueled in front of an A400M transport. , Crown Copyright Heappey spoke of the importance of “re-finding our ability to disperse and operate in a more expeditionary way [that] makes life harder for those who look at our home base and think that we’re sunk if missiles hit Lossiemouth, Coningsby, and Marham.” The last base mentioned by Heappey is home to the U.K.’s F-35B stealth fighter fleet , a portion of which is currently operating aboard the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , in another expression of the ability to operate fighters from forward locations. With a history of having operated Harrier attack jets in austere environments, the United Kingdom could also be well placed to use its F-35B fleet in this way, too, exploiting its ability to operate even without the need for traditional runways. It’s worth noting that RAF F-35Bs have already undertaken “fast ground refueling” from a C-130J transport at an austere airfield on the Italian island of Pantelleria. Italian Air Force ground crew refueling an Italian F-35 at Pantelleria during Exercise Falcon Strike last June., Italian Air Force Distributed operations of the kind that would likely employ “hot pit” refueling, as well as forward arming and refueling points (FARPs), which were not tested in Norway, are clearly a matter of increasing importance for many air forces. With the types of threats that can hold traditional airbases at risk proliferating, as well as becoming harder to defend against , air arms, including in the United States are looking at ways to rapidly move aircraft and personnel out to austere locations and then set up fully functional airbases . That applies in Europe, but also in the Asia-Pacific region , and the U.S. military has of late been stepping up this kind of training, especially as part of its bomber operations. This has included B-2 Spirit stealth bombers flying from the Azores in the Atlantic and B-1B Lancer bombers operating from Norway teaming up near Iceland, another region of significant strategic importance , for a show of force earlier this year. For the multi-role Typhoons, the trip to Norway also emphasizes their importance for NATO missions beyond air policing rotations, and against potential enemies very different to those encountered during the type’s enduring commitment to the counter-ISIS mission in the Middle East, from their base at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus . Two RAF Typhoons based at RAF Akrotiri conducting an armed overwatch mission in the Middle East. , Crown Copyright Norway, too, has particular relevance, both for the strategic implications of its location and for the increasing military cooperation between the Scandinavian country and the United Kingdom. As well as the recent Typhoon exercise, U.K. officials have confirmed the nine RAF P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft will work closely with Norway’s five examples, which are yet to be delivered. The P-8 fleets will “share basing facilities, undergo cold-weather training together and patrol the seas and skies side-by-side […] to successfully face down the growing threats from adversaries in the North Atlantic region,” according to a U.K. government statement . As for the geographic advantage of closer collaboration with Norway, Bodø, in particular, is an ideal location to provide closer access to the Norwegian and Barents Seas, as well as the wider Arctic region , the strategic importance of which is only set to grow . More specifically, these waters are also routinely patrolled by Russian Navy ships and submarines as they head out via the so-called Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom (GIUK) gap, and into the northern Atlantic Ocean . That Russia, for its part, considers Norway a potential theater for combat operations is evidenced by provocative activities in this region, including multiple mock airstrikes that were apparently directed at the radar facility at Vardø , close to Norway’s border with Russia. The U.S. military, too, is increasingly looking to the possibility of launching operations out of Norway. Earlier this year, a U.S. Air Force B-1B bomber touched down at Bodø , where it conducted a so-called “warm-pit refuel,” in which the crew remains on board and the aircraft receives power from its auxiliary power unit (APU), but with the main engines shut down. The U.S. Navy is also looking to expand its presence in northern Norway, with consideration given to submarine operations that would make use of the huge underground base at Olavsvern, around 200 miles northeast of Bodø. Of course, while it makes sense to deploy RAF Typhoons to Norway based on the increased NATO focus on that country, there is no reason why the same kinds of concepts can’t be employed elsewhere, too. This recent exercise, and the force package involved, is similar in some respects to the U.S. Air Force Rapid Raptor concept , in which small packages of F-22 fighters arrive, “ready to fight,” in distant locations and at short notice with the help of other supporting aircraft. This has since evolved into what that service now refers to as Agile Combat Employments (ACE), which involve various different kinds of aircraft. All told, it seems likely that we will see RAF Typhoons, and perhaps other aircraft too, conducting similar dispersed operations drills in different locations in the near future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 1, 2021",USS Thresher’s Crew May Have Survived Many Hours After Its Disappearance According To New Docs (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Remarkable new information has emerged on the fate of the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Thresher , also known by its hull number SSN-593, the lead submarine of its class, which was lost during trials east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, in April 1963. While the official explanation states that the submarine sunk soon after getting into trouble, quickly claiming the lives of all 129 sailors and civilian technicians onboard, a newly unclassified report indicates that one submarine sent to search for it thought that at least some of the crew were still alive around 24 hours after the vessel was determined to have imploded. The newly released information is found among 600 pages of documents, which constitute the most recent releases of information from the previously classified investigation into the loss of the Thresher . While the Navy began releasing these documents last year, on the orders of a U.S. District Court, these are the most recent. They seem to provide the first evidence that at least some of those searching for the Thresher believed there may have been crew members still alive on the submarine many hours after it was posted missing. USS Seawolf (SSN-575) departing San Francisco Bay later in its career. The official account of this submarine’s involvement in the search for USS Thresher has just been declassified., U.S. Navy Expert analysis of the latest information has been provided by Aaron Amick , a former submariner and a contributor to The War Zone , in the video below. The pertinent details are found in the official account from the commander of the USS Seawolf (SSN-575), a unique vessel that was the second submarine to feature nuclear propulsion, following USS Nautilus (SSN-571). The Seawolf was one of two submarines involved in the search for the Thresher . Newly overhauled, the Thresher had been conducting deep-diving tests at the time it went missing on the morning of April 10, 1963. Previous Navy disclosures about this incident have said that the submarine rescue ship USS Skylark detected a high-energy, low-frequency noise, characteristic of an implosion, at approximately 09:18 AM that day. Exactly when this was determined is not immediately clear, especially since the Seawolf was still searching for signs of life more than 24 hours later. The Seawolf , as well as the Balao class submarine USS Sea Owl (SS-405), had been called to the area after voice communications with the Thresher were originally lost and the two submarines arrived in the course of the following day. Neither was equipped to attempt any kind of rescue, but they were to help search for the Thresher . The newly released documents describe that, while on its way to the area of interest, the Seawolf noted a possible life vest seen through its periscope, as well as other debris in the water. However, this seems to have been a false alarm that eventually only delayed the submarine’s progress. Around 10:30 AM on April 11, the submarine finally began diving in the area where Thresher was last noted, listening for any signs of distress. Just over an hour later, according to the report, the SQS-4 sonar onboard the Seawolf discovered a stationary object at a distance of 2,000 yards. The submarine closed in on the target only to lose it once Seawolf passed directly overhead, hiding the contact from the sonar. At 12:11 AM, Seawolf heard, via its Rycom receiver, a signal from a distress beacon, or pinger, also known as the BQC. Although it couldn’t yet be confirmed that it was from the Thresher , this was clearly good news, since the pingers, two of which were fitted on each submarine, needed to be manually activated in order to broadcast a signal. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Et5vdyF5Axs Using its UQC underwater telephone , the Seawolf requested the Thresher turn its beacons on and off. A few minutes later, Seawolf reported “We hear what may be interrupted keying now,” suggesting the beacons were now being switched on and off deliberately. USS Thresher (SSN-593) at sea in July 1961., U.S. Navy The Seawolf faced a problem, however, since the sonar activity of the destroyers that were also involved in the search was making it hard to decipher signals coming from what was now assumed to be the Thresher . Furthermore, the Seawolf needed to come near the surface each time its crew wanted to relay messages to other vessels in the search party, or to the headquarters ashore. A second dive by the Seawolf involved another attempt to communicate with the Thresher . “If you hear my transmission, key your underwater telephone,” was the message sent using the UQC. U.S. Navy At 1:55 PM, the Seawolf reported that it received the emergency beacon tone three times. Five minutes later, another two tones were heard. As of this point, it seems the Seawolf thought that there were at least some people still alive on the Thresher , which would only have been possible had its hull not fully collapsed. More evidence then came to the crew of the Seawolf at 2:15 PM, when they reported hearing the main sonar from the Thresher. If true, this would have indicated that there were not only survivors aboard the submarine, but that it still had enough power reserves to transmit actively. At 2:24 PM the report notes that the sonar on the Thresher stopped transmitting, likely after the battery became exhausted. In total, the Seawolf had heard no fewer than 37 pings from the sonar of what it identified as the stricken submarine. A portion of the report from the commander of the USS Seawolf , noting the 37 pings heard from the Thresher ’s sonar. , U.S. ATLANTIC FLEET At 2:33 PM, the Seawolf reported it “may hear [a] very weak voice” over the Rycom receiver, but the communications were too garbled to make sense of. On the third dive, the sonar operators on the Seawolf said they began to hear the telltale banging of metal upon metal, suggesting that someone aboard the Thresher was trying to make contact. “Bang five times on hull,” was the request made by the Seawolf. Although the Seawolf did not get the five bangs requested, and instead heard groups of three, it did successfully make active sonar contact again, followed by more raps on the hull that were detected at 8:30 PM. Once again, the Seawolf needed to surface to issue a report, and once again it broke any contact with the Thresher . The wreck of USS Thresher, showing an external portion of a sonar dome photographed by the bathyscaph Trieste in August 1963., NATIONAL ARCHIVE A fourth and final effort to find the missing submarine was then made early in the morning of April 12, almost two days since the Thresher had first been posted as missing. Trying the active sonar and calling the Thresher again on UQC yielded no response. “No answers, no signals,” in the words of the report from the Seawolf. At 5:52 AM the dive was ended. Eventually, of course, the remains of the Thresher were located on the seafloor at a depth of 8,400 feet. But what happened in the lead-up to this catastrophe is now far less certain. The original narrative had the submarine rapidly sink at the point at which communications were originally lost, but Seawolf , at least, was still trying to make contact with what it thought was the Thresher , many hours later. While the Navy was compelled to release these new documents, it remains perplexing as to why aspects of this report, at least, were never disclosed before. Ultimately, the Navy thought the Thresher underwent an implosion, which would have made any survivors of the initial accident a near-impossibility. In the meantime, the issue of what actually happened has continued to be controversial. In his analysis, Amick suggests it might have been a case of the Navy wanting to keep the prolonged demise of the Thresher a secret from the families of those who died. Whatever the reason, we are now, slowly, finding out more about this naval tragedy — the second-deadliest submarine incident on record — but there are clearly many unknowns that remain. Update, July 15: We have received correspondence from several readers who wish to emphasize the fact that the claims of the USS Seawolf were discounted at the time of the original investigation into the loss of the Thresher . To clarify, that investigation determined that the Thresher sank on the morning of April 10, and was destroyed near-instantaneously by implosion. It is presumed, therefore, that all the documents that were released earlier this week, relating to the part played by the Seawolf in the scenario, were also taken into account when this conclusion was originally reached. Unfortunately, the available account provides little in the way of detailed assessments of the sounds purportedly heard by the Seawolf but concludes that “None of the signals which Seawolf received equated with anything that could have been originated by human beings.” Meanwhile, on the message board of the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System Caesar Alumni Association ( IUSSCAA ), and in response to Amick’s video analysis of the newly unclassified Seawolf documents, Bruce Rule, a naval acoustic and SOSUS expert who testified at the Thresher inquiry, has stated: “This YouTube video is false, the Seawolf report the presenter is reading from is correct, but the final report certified it was false readings. Seawolf was confused by the active sonar and noise created by the destroyers and the diesel submarine Sea Owl searching for Thresher on 11 April 1963, the day after she was lost. She mistook all sounds from the searching ships as banging on the hull and sonar pings from Thresher . It was a mistake.” The War Zone has reached out to the Navy for further clarification of the Seawolf report, how it was originally assessed and how the crew of that submarine came to believe that it was possible that crew aboard the Thresher may have still been alive so long after it had been posted missing.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 28, 2021",The Mach-3 XF-108 Rapier Would Have Packed Its Big Missiles On A Revolver-Like Launcher,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Of all the aircraft projects of the 1950s that never saw the light of day, without doubt, one of the most potentially impressive was the North American XF-108 Rapier . This was a planned all-weather interceptor that would have been propelled to a speed of over Mach 3 by a pair of General Electric J93 afterburning turbojets. Those were the same engines that powered the remarkable XB-70 Valkyrie strategic bomber, another Mach-3 North American product. The XF-108 shared some visual similarities and certain components with its larger cousin, but perhaps the most novel feature was its unique, internal rotary missile launcher. A rotary launcher for weapons is today a standard fixture in the bomb bays on U.S. strategic bombers , but no operational American fighter has ever had a similar feature. While there have been some ingenious solutions to packing weapons into internal bays on fighters , and new technologies are still being developed in this field today, rotary launchers are much more associated with air-to-ground weapons, rather than air-to-air ones. Concept artwork of the XF-108 in its definitive configuration., U.S. Air Force After Air Defense Command released its General Operating Requirement (GOR) 114 in late 1955, work on the XF-108 began, leading to a full-scale mockup that was presented to the Air Force in January 1959. A photo of the XF-108’s rotary launcher installation, apparently from this same mockup, was brought to our attention by Twitter user @clemente3000 and shows just how neat the jet’s weapons solution was expected to be. As it was, the Rapier would be canceled before the end of that same year. A mockup of the XF-108’s rotary missile bay, loaded with GAR-9s., NATIONAL ARCHIVES The weapons launcher, which would have carried three of the long-range GAR-9 missiles on a T-shaped assembly, was designed to fit the relatively slim stores bay in the lower fuselage between the XF-108’s huge engines and intakes. As the weapons bay door opened, it rotated to expose the missiles, meaning there were no doors that extended into the airstream. For a while, at least, the McDonnell F-101B Voodoo used a somewhat similar arrangement for its armament, with a rotary pallet that carried three Falcon air-to-air missiles on the outside, and three more on the inside, but when opened, all the missiles were exposed. On the XF-108, in contrast, a single missile was exposed in turn. U.S. Air Force With a primary mission of swatting down nuclear-armed Soviet bombers before they got too close to American territory, the Rapier would have been expected to cruise at Mach 3 and 70,000 feet and hit an altitude of 100,000 feet in a zoom climb. Burning exotic “zip” fuel, which produced much more energy on combustion than normal jet fuel, each of its engines would put out around 30,000 pounds of thrust, a little more than the F100-PW-229 that powers today’s F-15EX , albeit optimized for high-speed, high-altitude flight. These performance expectations meant that internal weapons carriage was a prerequisite, not only to ensure low drag but because kinetic heating would likely render any external ordnance useless. As for the missiles the XF-108 was intended to carry, the GAR-9 was a member of the Hughes Falcon family, but was considerably larger than its cousins, with a length of over 12 feet. By comparison, the GAR-1D and GAR-3A Falcons then in service at the time were around 6 and 7 feet long, respectively. The GAR-9 had been specifically developed for the Long-Range Interceptor Experimental (LRI-X) program, for which the XF-108 was selected in 1957 as the winning design, being chosen ahead of the rival Republic XF-103 . Illustrations from a 1958 Air Force document showing the proposed F-108’s layout, including the weapons bay. , U.S. AIR FORCE Originally intended to carry a conventional or nuclear warhead, the GAR-9 would have had a range of 100 miles or more, flying to its target using semi-active radar homing, with the engagement process being managed by the AN/ASG-18 fire-control system on the Rapier. Design changes to the GAR-9 increased its weight and diameter, leading to modifications to the XF-108’s weapons bay, although it’s unclear if the rotary mechanism was changed in the process. North American concept art of the F-108 in Air Force service., U.S. Air Force Ultimately, however, despite good progress in the development effort, XF-108 was canceled in 1959, with the Air Force failing to find the funds needed to keep the program alive, despite its promised performance. Moreover, the concern about Soviet bombers was beginning to diminish, now that intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) appeared to pose a much graver threat. It would be left, instead, to Convair F-106 Delta Darts to defend North American skies against bombers, a job that they did well into the 1980s. A similar fate befell the XB-70, too, this being canceled in 1961 — before any examples had been flown. The reasons included developments in Soviet surface-to-air missiles, which were expected to put it at risk, as well as the appearance of cheaper, nuclear-armed ICBMs. Despite the demise of the XF-108 program, work continued on the GAR-9, which was redesignated as the AIM-47 in 1963.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Jan 13, 2022",The Pentagon Is Adding Two More Large Unmanned Surface Vessels To Its Ghost Fleet Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office, or SCO, is adding two more unmanned surface vessels, or USVs, to its secretive Ghost Fleet Overlord program, which it is running in conjunction with the U.S. Navy. In addition to the pair of new ships, SCO has announced that it will transfer the two existing USVs it has been testing to the Navy in January 2022. The SCO’s Ghost Fleet Overlord program, which dates back to at least 2017, aims to rapidly field autonomous surface vessels in order to “better expand the reach of manned vessels,” according to the Pentagon . The project has been looking to develop ships that can not just travel from point A to point B on their own, but also follow the rules of the sea and avoid other ships autonomously. The announcement about the two new vessels comes amid many other recent developments signaling the Navy’s increased emphasis on unmanned vessels . The Nomad unmanned surface vessel during phase I trials in 2019, USN “The intent is to utilize this time period to do fleet demonstration exercises and operational vignettes to continue to demonstrate in an operational context the utility of these vessels to augment manned combatant capabilities,” Luis Molina, SCO’s deputy director told reporters this week. The SCO’s two existing large unmanned surface vessels (LUSVs) for the Ghost Fleet Overlord program, the Ranger and the Nomad , were converted from commercial fast supply vessels, which are typically used to support various offshore activities, such as work on oil platforms and around offshore wind farms . As such both of them feature large open spaces in the rear, originally intended to carry cargo, which can be readily reconfigured to accommodate different payloads. Since October 2020 , both of the USVs completed autonomous transits from the Gulf of Mexico to the West Coast of the United States, operating in human-controlled modes only when traversing the Panama Canal. The most recent voyage, carried out by the Nomad , saw the USV travel over 4,000 miles in June 2021 with 98% of the trip completed autonomously.

Little is known about the new vessels, or their manufacturers. For security reasons, the SCO is not releasing the names of the firms developing its new unmanned surface vessels in light of recent security breaches among Navy contractors. “We are developing cutting-edge technologies for the future fight. We’re trying to protect those investments from being stolen by our adversaries,” Molina said this week. “As a result of that, we [SCO] do not normally provide the names of our industry teams.” The Ranger USV during phase I trials in 2019, USN In order to control its growing fleet of unmanned assets, the Navy has been working with Raytheon in the development of a Common Control System (CCS), an effort designed to help unify future operations involving various autonomous platforms, such as the MQ-25A Stingray aerial tanker drone, submarine-launched Large Displacement Undersea Vehicles (LDUUVs) like the Snakehead , and other experimental USVs . The Navy is also planning to incorporate other existing unmanned platforms into the system in the future, such as the MQ-8 Fire Scout . As part of its plan to develop new medium and large USVs, the Navy has requested $144.8 million for Fiscal Year 2022. The House Appropriation Committee, however, has proposed cutting $42 million from the program. DOD DO The SCO’s Ghost Fleet Overlord program will officially end in 2022, but the end date is more of a bureaucratic formality, as the same USV experimentation will continue under the control of the Navy with the turnover of the Ranger and the Nomad , according to the Navy. U.S. Navy Captain Pete Small, program manager for Naval Sea Systems Command’s (NAVSEA) Unmanned Maritime Systems program, told reporters that by the end of 2022, the first two vessels will have transitioned from SCO to the Navy and the two new Navy-funded Ghost Fleet Overlord prototypes will have been delivered. It’s unclear if the second pair of ships will go to SCO or to the Navy directly. In light of the rising and sometimes wasteful costs of maintaining a large fleet of large, manned ships, the Navy has been increasingly moving towards a future consisting of distributed fleets of lower-cost ships and unmanned platforms. As part of the effort, the Navy stood up Surface Development Squadron One (SURFDEVRON) in May 2019 in order to explore new tactics and procedures that involve unmanned surface vessels. SURFDEVRON, which is based in San Diego, presently includes the Navy’s two existing Medium Unmanned Surface Vessels, or MUSVs, the Sea Hunter and Seahawk. In an interesting parallel to the Ghost Fleet Overlord effort, Sea Hunter was originally developed as part of a project led by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), before being transferred to the Navy . These drone ships both took part in the UxS IBP 21 experiment earlier this year, which featured a wide variety of other manned and unmanned assets , as well, as you read more about here . Naval Sea Systems Command officials also recently inquired about engineering and technical support for future electronic warfare and intelligence-gathering activities as part of that separate program. Despite the investments into USV research and development, it remains unknown what exactly the concepts of operation surrounding these ships will look like down the road. It’s possible that the current vessels are only technology demonstrators and that future platforms will have other capabilities besides those tested, including potentially weapon systems or electronic warfare suites . There is also the potential for them to end as an expensive, but ultimately unproductive experiment that gets sidelined as the Navy’s priorities, or those of the U.S. military, as a whole, change. Lawmakers have already expressed their skepticism about the Navy’s plans for larger unmanned surface vessels, approving less than $94 million of the $464 million that the service has originally asked for to support its own Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV) program in the 2021 Fiscal Year. The Navy has previously defined the Ghost Fleet Overlords Ships as being in the LUSV size category. A briefing slide from NAVSEA’s Unmanned Maritime Systems program (PMS 406). The Ghost Fleet Overlord ships are mentioned in the large category., USN Regardless, the recent successes of the Ghost Fleet Overlord program, coupled with the announcement of these two new USVs, signals that the Navy could be rapidly moving to a state in which unmanned vehicles operate alongside human counterparts in the skies, below the seas, and on the surface of the ocean all at once. Like a lot of projects that aim for major innovations, the questions remain: how expensive will it be, and when could it realistically happen?

Adam Kehoe,"Updated on Jul 20, 2021",Explore Thousands Of FAA Drone And Unidentified Aircraft Incident Reports With Our Interactive Tool,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are excited to announce the launch of our new interactive tool that maps and makes searchable thousands of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and unidentified aircraft incident reports. The vast dataset is drawn from information compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration . Some of the reports are highly unusual, going far beyond typical low-altitude drone mishaps. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make a publicly available system that can both seamlessly search and map these incidents. Though the data in the reports is often cursory, it provides a mechanism to identify and further investigate significant incidents and to interpret broader trends. A growing problem UAS incidents with manned aircraft have become increasingly commonplace in recent years, with some posing significant aviation safety and national security concerns. The term UAS is used to convey a wide variety of aircraft, including rotary and fixed-wing drones as well as balloons and less clearly identified types. The War Zone has covered a number of high-profile UAS incidents. For example, earlier this year a “highly modified” drone in Tucson penetrated controlled airspace, leading to a prolonged helicopter chase and no success in identifying the operator or the high-performance drone type. Drones have also become a significant issue for nuclear reactor safety, including a still unresolved incident involving multiple drones descending on the nation’s most powerful nuclear reactor in Palo Verde , Arizona. The issue has also significantly impacted the military. The War Zone covered an incident that involved a large number of drones apparently harassing Navy vessels near Southern California. Our subsequent investigation of FAA records surfaced nearly two dozen other reports of unusual UAS activity near military facilities or aircraft. These new records come in addition to exclusive past reporting on aviation safety hazards off the East Coast and similar records released by the Air Force . The UAS issue has in many ways converged with an ongoing national discussion on “unidentified aerial phenomena” or UAP. The Office of Director of National Intelligence recently released a long awaited report on UAP that prominently cited the importance of FAA data in resolving unidentified aircraft sightings. The UAPTF report acknowledged that some reports may be attributable to foreign adversaries, though there is no direct evidence of such at this time. The War Zone has explored the potential connection between UAP sightings and UAS at length. The Data The original FAA data consists of approximately 10,400 incident reports published online via a number of Excel spreadsheets. The FAA offers few details about how the reports are collected, or how they are ultimately selected for this public dataset. A significant number of the summaries involve references to Mandatory Occurrence Reports (MOR), an FAA process designed to capture a wide array of information about aviation safety incidents. According to FAA regulations , a MOR must be generated whenever a pilot reports “unauthorized UAS activity or authorized UAS activity that is conducted in an unsafe or hazardous manner.” Example FAA Mandatory Occurrence Report , Federal Aviation Administration The UAS Sightings Report data span from November of 2014 until December 2020. We have standardized and joined these spreadsheets together into one consolidated resource. Although the reports do not include precise location information, we have been able to assign approximate locations using the city and state information provided. Importantly, we have introduced a small amount of randomness to the locations in order to prevent the incidents in the same city from overlapping each other on the map. Please note that the location on the map does not correspond precisely to the location of the incident. In fact, based on our previous reporting , we have found that the actual location of the incident can be many miles from the city cited in the report. Further, there are a large number of spelling errors and other issues in the original data, so not all locations have been matched to date. Currently, our mapping system has geocoded 9566 reports. We are working to resolve the location information on the remaining reports. We have also implemented a tool to extract the approximate altitude of the incident based on the summary text. Due to variations in the underlying reports, the tool is not able to capture altitudes for all incidents. Our system currently allows users to search either by keywords in the incident summary, or by filtering a minimum altitude. With the caveat that altitude information is imputed and not included in the original data, we found that the maximum reported altitude was 39,000 feet, with a median altitude of 1,500 feet. The Tool You can also browse the cases in the embedded map below. Due to the prevalence of UAS incidents around strategic infrastructure, we have included the ability to mark key locations on the map to better find incidents. In this initial release, we have incorporated the location of active nuclear reactors in the United States. Those locations are marked with an icon displaying the ionizing radiation hazard symbol. Please note that due to the number of incidents that the map may take a few moments to load depending on your connection due to the large amount of data: UAVGeography.com , Screenshot of UAVGeography.com, Adam Kehoe This tool also permits searching the incident reports by keyword. Many of the stories involving UAS described above can be found in the case summaries in this data. In fact, the tool has allowed us to revisit some cases and locations to develop new leads. We invite readers to search and share their own findings with us so we can further investigate ‘unique’ cases. We will be publishing a separate piece shortly detailing a number of new cases that we are investigating and will continue to pursue additional leads. You can access the tool with its full feature set via this link , as well. Next Steps We plan to make updates and improvements to the system over time. This initial release of the tool is designed to quickly give the public access to this data, particularly given the growing concern regarding UAS. As the system grows, we plan to incorporate more search and filtering functionality. We also plan to make further improvements to the location matching system and our ability to extract altitude information. The summary reports also contain a wealth of unstructured information that can be leveraged in the coming weeks, such as references to the color, size and behavior of the UAS. Our experience navigating and searching the system suggests some possible future directions. For example, we created a separate tool that allows users to visualize incident reports in three dimensions. This capability is particularly useful when viewing urban areas that have a large number of “nuisance” type incidents at lower altitudes. You can see a brief video of the 3d capability below: We are unable to distribute the 3d version of the application widely without significant costs, but we are offering limited access to analysts interested in trying the tool. Note that this version only includes a different mode of visualizing cases, and otherwise has identical data as the open version. On the whole, we hope this tool will allow the public to develop a greater appreciation of the scale and seriousness of UAS incidents. The tool may also help provide context for the difficult job of air traffic controllers and pilots to manage an increasingly complex sky. The number and variety of UAS and other craft, like balloons, pose clear challenges for pilots and aircrew to clearly identify what they are seeing, especially given the relatively small size of many of the reported objects. The large community of open-source intelligence professionals and enthusiasts may also play a helpful role in identifying and analyzing significant events. There are some that are very peculiar, involving remarkably high altitudes and multiple craft, among other bizarre factors. As always, The War Zone will continue to update and develop this story as new information and data becomes available. We will publish an initial analysis of unique cases we have identified using this new tool shortly. We again ask that readers share their tips with us so we can look into other strange incidents that may be buried in the data set.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 11, 2021",Fifteen Percent Of U.S. Air Force F-35s Don’t Have Working Engines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A total of 46 F-35 stealth fighters are currently without functioning engines due to an ongoing problem with the heat-protective coating on their turbine rotor blades becoming worn out faster than was expected. With the engine maintenance center now facing a backlog on repair work, frontline F-35 fleets have been hit, with the U.S. Air Force’s fleet facing the most significant availability shortfall. At a hearing before the U.S. House Committee on Armed Services’ Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces yesterday, Air Force Lieutenant General Eric T. Fick, director of the F-35 Joint Program Office, confirmed that 41 U.S. Air Force F-35s, as well as one Joint Strike Fighter belonging to the U.S. Marine Corps , another from the U.S. Navy , and three that had been delivered to foreign air forces were grounded without engines. Those figures were as of July 8. An F-35A assigned to the 61st Fighter Squadron at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, takes off as the sun sets, during corrosion testing of the F135 engine., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Staci Miller The exact breakdown of how many of each F-35 variant lack engines is unclear. The Air Force and the Navy only fly the F-35A and F-35C, respectively, but the Marines operate both F-35Bs and F-35Cs and various models are in service with other military forces around the world. With regards to the Air Force specifically, as of May 8 this year, the service had received 283 F-35As , which means that around a little under 15 percent of the service’s Joint Strike Fighters can’t be flown due to this engine shortage. “They had a rush on the depot due to unexpected Calcium-Magnesium-Alumino-Silicate (CMAS) degradation on deployed F-35As,” Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ’s Defense Editor and a friend of The War Zone , wrote on Twitter . “And the depot itself has been a bottleneck, with turn times at two-times planned rates earlier this year.” The depot in question is the F135 Heavy Maintenance Center at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, which looks after the F-35’s turbofan engines, which are produced by Pratt & Whitney. The Heavy Maintenance Center is the primary repair depot for all F135 engines, including those operated by the Navy and Marine Corps units, and some of the foreign partners in the F-35 program. While Trimble noted that those depot rates “are coming down now,” this is not good news for a program that has suffered its fair share of setbacks in recent months, with criticism of its operating costs , in particular, extending all the way to the top of the Air Force. It’s also noteworthy that this particular engine problem has been rumbling on for some time now. Shortages of F135 powerplants were reported back in February when it emerged that the Tinker Air Force Base facility was unable to complete scheduled depot maintenance on the engines as quickly as required. The ribbon-cutting ceremony for the F135 Engine Heavy Maintenance Center at Tinker Air Force Base in 2014. , U.S. Air Force/Kelly White Contributing to the backlog was the discovery of “premature distress of rotor blade coatings,” Defense News reported at the time , meaning the depot was having to add unscheduled engine repairs to its worklist. Back then, an unnamed defense official confirmed to the same publication that the worn-out blades had led to a “serious readiness problem.” That problem now seems to have gotten worse. As of February, it was predicted that 5-6 percent of the F-35 fleet might be left without engines by 2022, providing that planned fixes worked as hoped. If they didn’t, the same official told Defense News , then the figure could leap to 20 percent of Air Force F-35s being grounded. The figures for last May suggest that while the effects of a fix may now be in kicking in, to some degree, the number of F-35s without engines is worse than was projected. Prior to the details of the turbine rotor blades emerging, senior Pentagon officials were concerned that issues with the F-35’s engines were impacting mission capable rates — one of the metrics used to gauge how many of the Air Force’s aircraft are actually ready to conduct their assigned mission at any one time. One of the results of those engine problems was the decision to reduce the number of air show appearances scheduled for the F-35A Demonstration Team , which is provided by the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. That measure was hoped to reduce the burden on the engine depot. Captain Kristin Wolfe, F-35 Lightning II Demonstration Team commander and pilot, performs at the 2020 Fort Lauderdale Air Show last November., U.S. Air Force/Capt. Kip Sumner Exactly when it became apparent that the work needed to address the CMAS blade coatings — coupled with the slower progress on F135 scheduled depot maintenance — is unclear. However, even in early 2020, the Pentagon had publicly flagged an engine shortage issue . A second shift should have been introduced at the F135 Heavy Maintenance Center last month, Defense News reported, which should help mitigate the problem as the depot seeks to bring reduce the time it takes to process an engine from over 200 days to around 122 days. For its part, Pratt & Whitney said it introduced a hardware modification to the engine blades last year and that the same treatment is being made to engines as they pass through the overhaul process. It is worth remembering too, of course, that the F-35 enterprise almost had an alternative engine to the F135. However, the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 turbofan was deemed to be an unnecessary expense and was eventually canceled in 2011, when the project was over 80 percent complete. With the benefit of hindsight, it can well be imagined that an alternative source of engines would be very valuable right now. A General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine, the alternate powerplant for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, is tested at maximum thrust conditions., Rick Goodfriend While the engine issues regarding the F135 may well prove to be more temporary in nature, the latest revelation does come amid growing concerns about the sustainment costs associated with these jets, more generally. There were also reports about F135 cost growth as a result of Turkey being ejected from the Joint Strike Fighter program, although this hasn’t been linked in any way to the maintenance issues currently ongoing. Looking further ahead, there is the potential to upgrade the powerplant for the F-35 as part of the long-term roadmap for the jet. An adaptive-cycle engine , designed to modulate the airflow, improving fuel efficiency, and boosting range, is one of the options. Pratt & Whitney and General Electric are both working on designs under the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Adaptive Engine Transition Program, or AETP. In the shorter term, technology that emerges from AETP could end up providing the basis for an F135 upgrade, too. Meanwhile, in an event that seems unlikely to have been entirely coincidental, the F-35A Demonstration Team on May 25 paid a visit to Tinker Air Force Base “as a show of appreciation for the men and women who perform depot-level maintenance on the F-35’s engine and related components,” in the words of an Air Force press release. Members of the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex Heavy Maintenance Center pose for a group photo with the Air Force’s F-35A Demonstration Team during their visit to Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, on May 25, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Paul Shirk “The commander of Air Combat Command [General Mark Kelly] said he wanted to do something to motivate the forces that are powering the F-35,” said Brigadier General Jeff King, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex commander, at the time. Among the other items on show on the maintenance side were “new, more advanced, borescopes, a flexible camera used to inspect internal engine components.” After the flight demonstration, F-35 Demo pilot Major Kristin “Beo” Wolfe said: “We would not be combat-ready without all the hard work of the F135 engine team.” With that in mind, it must be hoped that the efforts that have been taken to smooth the process of engine maintenance, and fix the problem of excess wear and tear on turbine rotor blades, will finally address the engine backlog and put those 46 F-35s back on a combat-ready status.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 13, 2021",Gigantic Hangar Near Secretive Chinese Test Facilities Points To Exotic Airship Development,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s expansive far western regions are well-suited to hosting facilities to support various kinds of military research and development and test and evaluation activities , as well as ostensibly civilian work that could also have military applications, especially in the air and space arenas. These areas of the country, which are also highly remote, help to keep all of these activities away from prying eyes. As such, they are practically littered with notable or otherwise curious infrastructure. One particularly interesting facility that appears to have largely escaped public attention, features, among other things, an absolutely massive hangar—you could fit a Nimitz class supercarrier inside with 100 feet to spare on either side—and is situated near other sites associated with missile defense and anti-satellite activities. The hangar clearly has to do with the development of lighter-than-air craft, which could include large unmanned airship designs capable of operating in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. The War Zone has obtained satellite imagery of this site from Planet Labs and has reviewed additional images of the site that are available from the company, as well as through other sources. The hangar is situated just over five miles south of Bosten Lake, the largest lake in China’s Xinjiang Autonomous Region . It is also located some 60 miles east of Korla, Xinjiang’s second-largest city and the capital of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. Malan Air Base, a secretive People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) test base with an emphasis on unmanned platforms , is notably situated on the opposite side of Bosten Lake from this hangar. A satellite image of the hangar and associated infrastructure as of Nov. 25, 2020., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A map showing the general location of the hangar within China., Google Maps The hangar is approximately 1,150 feet long and 450 feet wide. It is also extremely tall, as is made clear in satellite images where there are ground vehicles or shadows present. An image of the site, available through Apple Maps, the date of which is unclear, also notably shows what appear to be military vehicles with overall green paint jobs, as is common to see on trucks and other vehicles in service with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). A satellite image, the date of which is unclear, showing green-colored, likely People’s Liberation Army (PLA) vehicles parked outside of the east end of the hangar. , Apple Maps A runway-like area, which appears to be paved or otherwise partially improved, extends some 3,000 feet to the west of the hangar. As seen in the image below, there is a separate unimproved, but visibly demarcated path that extends diagonally northwest from the middle of the improved section and leads to a tower in the center of an area marked by a circle with a cross inside it. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION While we can’t say with absolute certainty what the hangar’s purpose is, its general size and shape are in line with others around the world, past and present , associated with lighter-than-air vehicles, including various kinds of airships. However, it is significantly larger than many of these structures and would appear to be one of the largest aircraft hangars of any kind anywhere on Earth. A satellite image of the site from Planet Labs, dated Nov. 25, 2020, offers additional evidence of an airship connection in that it shows the hangar’s huge door open and a big rectangular cradle positioned in front of it on the “runway.” Lighter-than-air craft cannot be moved in and out of a hangar-like regular aircraft and this piece of equipment looks like what one might expect to see for use in maneuvering a very large airship around, as opposed to more typical options, such as some sort of mobile mooring mast or mooring lines lashed to ground vehicles. The rectangle shape of the cradle could point to a non-traditional airship configuration without a largely cylindrical center structure, as well. With all this in mind, it seems highly probable that the nearby tower is a mooring mast.

An access road connects it to a larger one that runs north toward Bosten Lake, as well as south to a number of other highly remote facilities. Some two miles to the south is a collection of buildings, including hangar-like structures with retractable roofs, some of which are camouflaged. Satellite imagery shows additional green-colored vehicles, as well as camouflage netting, further pointing to military activity.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Another satellite image of one of the groups of arches, the date of which is unclear, showing an object suspended between a pair of them., Apple Maps Past reports have suggested that much of this infrastructure, some of which predates the appearance of the airship hangar, could be related to ground-based anti-satellite laser systems, as well as electromagnetic pulse or high-power microwave weapons and testing. Some of the features visible at these sites, especially the object seen between the two arches , are in line with known U.S. military EMP-related test facilities . A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tanker undergoes a test of its hardening against electromagnetic pulses (EMP) at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland in 2017. Note the EMP generator suspended above the aircraft., USN A large tower is situated to the south, some four and a half miles from the hangar, as well. It is possible that this could be another mooring mast, but it seems as if it might be overly tall for this purpose when compared to historic examples of such masts . Tom Jarvis, a journalist and editor at Audio Ordeal , who appears to be one of the first to have closely explored the visible infrastructure in this area of western China, estimated it to be nearly 284 feet tall based on the shadow it cast in one satellite image. Jarvis also noted that its overall design also appeared similar to drop testing towers, such as the Fallturm in Bremen in Germany. Apple Maps Looking eastward, there is one isolated hangar-like structure, as well as yet another one attached to a nearly 8,000-foot-long paved runway-like strip.

The Planet Labs image of this area on (?), seen below, shows some additional infrastructure compared to past shots, as well. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION An older image of the same area., Apple Maps Regardless, we don’t know exactly what kind of work might be going on at the hangar, or any of these nearby sites, now, or have taken place there in the past. None of the satellite imagery The War Zone reviewed, including the Nov. 25 shot with the hangar door open, show any airships or other lighter-than-air craft of any kind. We don’t know precisely when construction began on the hangar or when it was completed, either, but the available imagery does show that the foundation had been laid by 2013 and indicates that the full structure had been erected by 2015. An academic paper published in the Chinese Journal of Aeronautics in 2018, which was written by researchers at Beihang University and titled “Multi disciplinary design optimization with variable complexity modeling for a stratosphere airship,” mentions in passing a test of one such airship, called Tian Heng, in Korla the year before. The beginnings of the airship hangar near Korla, as seen in a satellite image from September 2013. Imagery from December 2012 shows the area still devoid of any activity, indicating that this construction began sometime afterward., Google Maps An accompanying graphic depicting the Tian Heng, seen below, shows a more complex solar-powered stratospheric airship design with two propellers at the front for “forward propulsion,” and another at the rear capable of “thrust vectoring,” which would allow for changes in direction of its flight. It is an unmanned design with an “avionics nacelle” on the underside of its “overpressure hull.” No information is given as to its size. Beihang University Neither the graphic nor the text of the paper makes any mention of specific payloads that the Tian Heng might have carried or been designed to carry. “Nowadays, a stratosphere airship sows its origins from earth observation, maritime monitoring, missile warning, communication signal relays, etc., namely, it is mooted as an affordable part substitute for a near-earth orbit satellite or can eliminate the need for multiple aircraft sorties to sustain continuous on-station keeping,” the paper’s authors noted in its introduction. The stratosphere is generally defined as beginning between altitudes ranging from 23,000 to 66,000 feet, with the measurements depending on where you are on Earth. The paper also mentions a 2015 test of another airship designed for stratospheric operation, the Yuan Meng , but said that it took place in Xilinhot in Inner Mongolia, nearly 1,500 miles to the east of where the hangar is located in Xinjiang. That test was supposed to have lasted 24 hours in total and have taken the airship, which was 75 meters long and had a hull diameter of 22 meters, to altitudes up to 20,000 feet. It’s unclear how Yuan Meng ultimately performed. A Chinese-language poster regarding the Yuang Meng, depicting a design with some general similarities to the one seen in the Tian Heng graphic., Chinese Internet “Using solar power to drive its rotors will save additional weight in order to increase payload, and gives it a total flight endurance of six months,” according to a piece from Popular Science at the time. “The Yuanmeng’s 5- to 7-ton payload of data relays, datalinks, cameras and other sensors would also be powered by the sun.” With all this in mind, it is interesting to note that the hangar’s foundation appears in satellite imagery the same year that an “airship base” officially opened in Alxa League in Inner Mongolia. In 2014, Chinese media announced an impending flight test of what was claimed to be the world’s largest airship, known as the BNST-KT-02, from this facility. A picture reportedly from inside a hangar at the airship base in Alxa League, circa 2013-2014., Xinhua “As the largest airship in the world, the BNST-KT-02, as it is known, measures 100 meters in length, 30 meters in diameter and weighs 13 tons,” according to a report from the state-run China Daily . “The gargantuan airship also has a payload of 2 tons and can reach a maximum height of between 6,000 to 7,000 meters.” It’s not clear if that test ever occurred. The site did support other airship projects, as well, at least for a time. A picture, the date of which is unclear, of an airship in front of the hangar in Alxa League. Not that it is being maneuvered around using a mooring mast mounted on a truck., Chinese Internet Satellite imagery of the airship base in Alxa League from 2016 shows a hangar that is similar in size and shape to the one near Bosten Lake, but appears to show it in what appears to be a state of disrepair. The state of other structures at the site, as well as that of the apron in front of the hangar and other associated infrastructure, raises questions about whether this facility was ever actually completed. Another image taken of this area in November 2020 shows no new activity. A satellite image of the Alxa League airship base in 2016., Google Earth Another satellite image of the airship facility in Alxa League as of November 2020., Google Earth It’s also interesting to point out that Alxa League is some 640 miles southwest of Xilinhot, which is where the test of the Yuan Meng airship occurred in 2015, according to the 2018 paper in the Chinese Journal of Aeronautics . This would seem to further indicate that the Chinese ultimately abandoned plans for the Alxa League facility and moved airship research and development to other sites. Construction of the hangar in Xinjiang also interestingly coincides with the tail end of a particularly pronounced burst of interest in lighter-than-air craft on the part of the U.S. military, including designs intended for stratospheric operation, particularly in support of missile defense missions. In 2013, Lockheed Martin was notably still actively pitching its High Altitude Airship (HAA), which the 2018 paper in the Chinese Journal of Aeronautics mentions as a specific example of another similar lighter-than-air craft that existed at the time, for both military and civilian research purposes. At that time, the company said that solar-powered HAA could carry payloads weighing at least 2,000 pounds, as well as generate 10 kilowatts of electricity or more, all while operating for periods of time measured in months at altitudes up to 65,000 feet. A 2013 briefing slide discussing Lockheed Martin’s High Altitude Airship (HAA) concept., Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin had first begun work on this airship in 2001 as part of a Missile Defense Agency (MDA) program, also known as HAA. In 2008, the U.S. Army’s Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) had taken over responsibility for the project, before canceling it the next year. HAA work had overlapped with the development of a subscale demonstrator for MDA, and then the Army, known as the High-Altitude Long Endurance-Demonstrator (HALE-D), as well as a separate derivative as part of an effort called the Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) that the Defense Research Projects Agency ran together with the U.S. Air Force. HALE-D crashed during its first test flight in 2011. The airship, including its payloads, which included full-motion video cameras and a communications package, was completely destroyed in the accident and the Army canceled the project later that year. The ISIS project, which had planned to install a dual UHF/X-band radar with moving target indicator functionality inside an HAA-derived airship, came to an end in 2014. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin At around the same time, the Army’s SMDC was also experimenting with other stratospheric designs that Aerostar and the Southwest Research Institute developed together, known as the HiSentinel series , again with an eye toward missile defense applications. These are, of course, just some of the high-altitude light-than-air projects that the U.S. military, as a whole, has and still is working on to this day. Aerostar subsequently evolved into Raven Aerostar, which remains actively engaged in such work. While we don’t know what applications any Chinese airship work at the hangar in Xinjiang may have focused on in the past, or may still be exploring now, it is very possible that it could be, or have been, at least in part, focused on missile defense. China has publicly acknowledged work on ground-based ballistic missile defenses over the years, including a test of an interceptor just earlier this year. Video footage purporting to show part of that test subsequently emerged online and was said to have been shot somewhere in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. A stratospheric airship could provide valuable, long-range persistent radar coverage, unencumbered by the limitations imposed by the rugged, often mountainous terrain in China’s far western regions, for both testing and operational missile defense applications or other purposes. Korla is already home to a large, ground-based phased-array radar, as well as a missile test facility. The PLA’s Unit 63618 , which is involved in missile defense activities, is based there, too. A stratospheric airship, in general, could offer significant benefits as a platform for anti-missile weapons, including interceptors or directed energy weapons, such as lasers or high-power microwave generators. Fired from a very high-flying lighter-than-air craft, an interceptor would not have as far to fly in order to reach certain kinds of harder-to-reach threats, such as ballistic missiles in the mid-course portion of their flight outside of the Earth’s atmosphere. Similarly, placing directed energy weapons on such a high-altitude platform might help mitigate issues of atmospheric distortion and diffusion, which can limit the effectiveness of ground-based systems, without overly onerous power generation requirements. It is also important to remember that many ostensibly missile defense-related capabilities are inherently applicable to anti-satellite operations, as well. As already noted, some of the other structures in the general vicinity of the airship hangar could be related to China’s research and development of anti-satellite capabilities. “In addition to the development of directed-energy weapons and satellite jammers, the PLA has an operational ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) missile intended to target low-Earth orbit satellites,” a 2020 Pentagon report to Congress on Chinese military developments declared. The U.S. government has also accused its Chinese counterparts in the past of using reported missile defense testing as a cover for anti-satellite work. None of this would, of course, preclude the use of such an airship for other purposes, including as a platform for other types of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) packages or as a communications relay node. A pseudo-satellite communications capability could be very valuable in any future high-end conflict, where satellites would be prime targets and where it could be difficult to quickly place new ones in orbit. This is something the U.S. military, in particular, is also grappling with . There has also been work elsewhere on using large airships as a lower-cost method of launching payloads into space . Any large airship hangar could also support research and development into designs not intended for stratospheric operation, including multiple smaller types, as well. At the same time, the size of the cradle seen in the satellite imagery outside of the hangar in Xinjiang would seem to point toward the hangar being primarily intended for use with a single, larger design. As already noted, the shape of that cradle could potentially point to a design with a non-traditional shape, such as a hybrid airship. Hybrid airships typically have small wings or some other form of “lifting body” type design features, and often have squatter hulls than traditional blimps or aerostats. Various companies have pitched such designs over the years for commercial and military purposes, generally with significant emphasis on long-endurance and heavy-lift cargo capabilities. Between 2010 and 2013, the U.S. Army tested one such design, known as the Long-Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle (LEMV), which was designed to carry a Northrop Grumman-developed ISR payload. British company Hybrid Air Vehicles developed the actual airship, known as the Airlander, and has continued its development work in the years since the Army program was canceled. U.K.-based Varialift Airships is one of a number of other firms also still working on similar designs. An airship similar to Varialift’s design could certainly demand the massive hangar and rectangle cradle seen at the remote hangar facility in China., Varialift Airships In addition, by the mid-2010s, Lockheed Martin was still working on its P-791 design, which had lost to the Northrop Grumman proposal for the LEMV program, and it subsequently began the development of derivatives for commercial applications . Despite plans to “float out” a prototype of the new LMH-1 design in 2019 , this airship still does not appear to be have been publicly unveiled. For China, a hybrid airship design could be very useful for moving large amounts of cargo, including outsized payloads, to remote outposts inside the mainland portion of the country or on islands around the Pacific . All told, we can’t say for sure what the purpose of this airship hangar, or any work that has been done or that might be still be going on there, might be. However, it seems very possible that it is intertwined, at least to some degree, with the missile defense and potential anti-satellite activities going on at other facilities in the immediate area. This would not only be in line with what is know about the PLA’s development of both of those capability sets, but also, as already noted, reflects work that was going on publicly elsewhere in the world, particularly in the United States, around the time the construction of the airship hangar began. At the same time, these are many other areas of interest the Chinese could have when it comes to airships. Going forward, we will certainly be keeping a watchful eye on this highly unique and secretive facility.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Apr 29, 2019",The British Army’s New Light Howitzer Could Be Unmanned,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has revealed that it is looking at unmanned self-propelled guns, which could have autonomous capabilities, as potential replacements for the British Army’s current L118 105mm howitzer. An artist’s conception of one proposal for this future Lightweight Fires Platform, seen at the top of this story, shows a design with four wheels on separate, articulating legs. Jon Hawkes, Head of Land Warfare at the Janes defense and security information company, today tweeted a slide from an apparent briefing provided by the U.K.’s Defense Science and Technology Laboratory, or Dstl, a branch of the U.K. Ministry of Defense that leverages scientific and technological advances for the benefit of the armed forces. Dstl is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its establishment today, as well. British soldiers from the 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment Battlegroup fire live rounds from an L118 Light Gun during an exercise in Kenya., Crown Copyright The slide Hawkes shared shows a computer-generated concept for an unmanned self-propelled gun, mounted on a four-wheeled chassis. As already noted, each of the wheels is mounted on an articulating leg and there are no connecting axles, suggesting that this proposal would involve a hybrid-electric motor-in-hub arrangement, or perhaps some sort of mechanical linkage inside the leg that connects to a motor in the central body. Either way, the concept is at least fairly notional at this stage. This general concept has been seen on other unmanned ground vehicle designs, such as the Multi-Mission Unmanned Ground Vehicle , or MULE, that was developed for the U.S. Army, initially as part of the abortive Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. This type of design is intended to provide a very high degree of mobility over all kinds of rough terrain. The artist’s conception of the Lightweight Fires Platform (LFP) includes a gun and onboard ammunition stowage on top of the chassis, along with what appears to be an autoloader, shown in red, to actually load rounds into the weapon. The slide says that Dstl has been exploring weapons of various calibers, along with associated ammunition. This particular concept is likely just one to have emerged from this three-year “pre-concept” study that aims to find a successor to the L118, a 105mm weapon that has to be towed into action or transported by helicopter. The L118 dates back to the late 1960s and is also used by the U.S. Army, in a modified form, as the M119 howitzer . Most interestingly, perhaps, is the fact that Dstl is considering “unmanned, autonomous, and self-propelled concepts” for the future gun, as part of the Lightweight Fires Platform (LFP) program, an effort that seems not to have been widely known about until now. There is little publicly available information about LFP, either, although a tweet from the 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery last October reveals that a senior engineer from Dstl visited that unit to discuss ammunition and the logistic support chain to help inform the program. Moreover, LFP appears to be part of a broader initiative known as the Close Support Fires program. In the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s Defense Equipment Plan for 2019, Close Support Fires was described as an effort “which will deliver a step-change in artillery capability providing greater agility, range, and lethality in support of the warfighting division from 2026.” The Dstl slide says that it is, though “investigating and evaluating multiple calibers and advanced projectile solutions,” looking to find a new light artillery piece that has extended range and improved accuracy and effects, as well as greater mobility and a reduced crew complement. The current L118 has a range of around 11 miles, although it is considered far less accurate once firing at targets beyond around 9 miles and it’s highly probable that any replacement would feature at least the option of precision-guided shells . Royal Air Force Chinooks move L118 Light Guns in support of 16 Air Assault Brigade conducting a raid on Salisbury Plain during a gunnery exercise in 2019., Crown Copyright Clearly, an unmanned and potentially autonomous self-propelled gun, which would appear to be consistent with the accompanying concept artwork, would offer significant manpower savings. An autonomous system has the ability to operate completely independently of human control and a concept such as this would enable a relatively small number of personnel to provide significant fire support, as well as potentially distribute those assets better and make it easier to relocate as needed. The manpower issue is particularly significant for the British Army, which has been steadily shrinking in size for years now. As for a desire for extended-range artillery, this is something that was brought up in the U.K.’s Defence in a competitive age white paper published last March. “Investment in longer-range artillery will mean the Army is able to deliver a more precise and lethal response and attack potential adversaries at greater depth, providing greater protection,” the document stated. However, that same paper did not mention the LFP program but instead references the Mobile Fires Platform, for which the U.K. has already committed to spending over £800 million over the next decade. This is a future indirect-fire weapon system that is planned to supersede the AS90 self-propelled howitzer and will see the U.K. observing the U.S. Army’s mobile howitzer trials . Meanwhile, the LFP concept emerges at a time in which there is considerable discussion in the United States, in particular, about the potential for unmanned artillery. Until now, however, most such concepts and demonstrators have involved rockets and missiles, rather than tube artillery. In the past, The War Zone has examined the U.S. Army’s Autonomous Multi-Domain Launcher , or AML, a prototype unmanned derivative of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS , that is also capable of a degree of autonomous operation. The AML is currently able to autonomously navigate a series of waypoints or operate in a “follow-the-leader” mode, in which it follows another vehicle, such as a manned HIMARS launcher. Targeting information and launch commands can be received remotely or via a control panel on the vehicle itself. The U.S. Marine Corps, too, is embracing the potential offered by weapons-toting unmanned vehicles, with a variant of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle armed with Naval Strike Missile anti-ship cruise missiles now under development under the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) program. In this case, it’s not entirely clear to what degree the system can work autonomously, or semi-autonomously. The NMESIS system consists of the unmanned Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), also known as the Remotely Operated Ground Unit Expeditionary-Fires (ROGUE-Fires), and a launcher with two ready-to-fire Naval Strike Missiles (NSM) inside their self-contained launch canisters. , U.S. Navy Then there are other systems that have been described as “autonomous,” but which are in fact heavily automated, a category that includes Elbit’s Autonomous Truck Mounted howitzer System (ATMOS), although there have also been suggestions that this, too, could ultimately add some kind of actual autonomous or at least semi-autonomous capability. Clearly, the British LFP initiative is looking at the smaller end of the scale in terms of vehicles and firepower, although it’s clear that the U.K. Ministry of Defense acknowledges the potential advantages of unmanned and potentially autonomous systems in this area. If anything, the kind of platform likely to be selected for an unmanned successor to the L118 will probably be closer in size to the U.S. Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle-Light unmanned ground vehicle prototypes, or RCV-L, the first prototypes of which were handed over late last year. The British Army will likely require a productionized LFP to be as least as transportable as the current L118, including underslung carriage by a medium helicopter. The first RCV-L prototype delivered to the US Army last November., Pratt Miller While the United Kingdom’s latest defense review may not specifically mention plans to replace the L118, it is explicit about the importance of artificial intelligence and increased autonomy across the armed forces: “Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI-enabled autonomous capabilities will be essential to defense modernization: accelerating decision-making and operational tempo; extending the range, persistence, and mass of our capabilities; removing personnel from harm’s way by undertaking ‘dull, dirty and dangerous’ tasks; and delivering significant efficiency and affordability gains.” All those aims would seem to be reflected in the LFP program, too, or are at least being considered for it. The project comes with a question mark, too, however, and that’s whether the United Kingdom can actually afford the potential costs and complexities of replacing manpower with more advanced unmanned autonomous platforms, at a time when the defense budget is already stretched . Clearly, this effort is at an early stage, but this initial concept suggests that the successor to the British Army’s light gun could be much more advanced than the current L118.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Aviation photographer Matt Smart today captured an eye-catching sequence of shots of a U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle suffering a dramatic incident on takeoff from its base at RAF Lakenheath in England. Most surprisingly, perhaps, it seems the aircrew were not necessarily even aware of what had happened, initially at least, and continued their sortie. Online flight tracking data available from ADS-B Exchange , seen further below, shows the jet taking off at approximately 9:02 AM local time before heading out over the North Sea coast and not returning to the airfield until around 10:56 AM. Matt Smart “From what I heard the pilot reported no issues with handling etcetera and stayed out for a while; we were expecting him to return to base, but he didn’t,” Matt told The War Zone . “I understand that someone also phoned the base about it to make them aware.” ADSBexchange.com Unconfirmed reports suggest that the trail of sparks emitted from the F-15E’s right-side Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan was caused by a broken nozzle petal and actuator. In normal operation, the actuator controls the nozzle petals, increasing the diameter of the exhaust when the afterburner is engaged, and the thrust output increases dramatically. In this image can see what appears to be damage to some of the ‘turkey feathers’ that make up the F-15E’s right-side exhaust nozzle., Matt Smart Whatever the case, it seems there was no immediate cause for alarm from the crew of F-15E, serial number 91-0302, which is assigned to the 492nd Fighter Squadron , the “Madhatters,” part of Lakenheath’s hard-worked 48th Fighter Wing . The parent wing also includes the 493rd Fighter Squadron , “Grim Reapers,” flying the F-15C/D , and the 494th Fighter Squadron, “Panthers,” also equipped with the F-15E. Before long, the base will host the Air Force’s first overseas-based F-35A unit , the 495th Fighter Squadron, “Valkyries.” While the incident on departure from Lakenheath certainly looked alarming, it’s well known that the F-15E is a tough jet and this one seems to have been able to continue its sortie before returning safely to base. How long the aircrew was oblivious to what was happening at the opposite end of their jet as they climbed out is not clear. Now, however, whatever damage was done will no doubt be left in the capable hands of the base’s maintenance group.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Feb 11, 2021",First Improved W88 Nuclear Warhead For Navy’s Trident Missiles Rolls Off The Assembly Line,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration has announced the completion of the first production example of the improved W88 Alteration 370 warhead, or W88 Alt 370, after 11 years of work, and a major, costly delay that was first revealed more than a year ago. This modernization program is aimed at mitigating issues relating to the age of the existing stockpile of W88s and maintaining the readiness of these warheads, which are among multiple types presently available for loading into the U.S. Navy’s Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The first production unit of the W88 Alt 370 was completed at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas on July 1, 2021. Specific details about the warhead are classified, but the Alt 370 upgrade package “replaces the arming, fuzing, and firing subsystem, adds a lightning arrestor connector, and refreshes the conventional high explosives within the weapon to enhance nuclear safety and support future life extension program options,” according to an official fact sheet . In addition, the effort is concurrent with “planned exchanges of limited-life, or routinely replaced, components, including the gas-transfer system and neutron generators.” National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has estimated that the total cost for the program, which is expected to continue updating W88s through 2026, will be around $2.8 billion . The W88 Alt 370 arming, fuzing, and firing assembly., NNSA The original W88 was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which began producing the warheads in 1988 and delivered the first units in 1989. The warheads have an estimated yield of 475 kilotons and can be deployed in either airburst or contact detonation methods. The warheads measure just under six feet in length, making them small enough for use aboard multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). It’s estimated that around 400 W88 warheads were manufactured . Dr. Charles Verdon, Acting NNSA Administrator, stated in a Department of Energy press release that the completion of the first production unit is proof of the NNSA’s effectiveness when it comes to maintaining the nuclear stockpile: This accomplishment is the culmination of over a decade of work, featuring contributions from several sites within the NNSA Nuclear Security Enterprise, members of the NNSA federal workforce, and members of the DoD. The W88 Alt 370 is a crucial part of Nation’s strategy for the sea-based leg of the nuclear triad, and a testament to the Enterprise’s ability to execute major modernization programs. As we continue to modernize the stockpile, the successes and lessons learned from this program will bolster our future warhead activities to provide a safe, secure, and reliable deterrent. The Nuclear Weapons Council , a joint advisory group staffed by the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, first approved the W88 Alt 370 program in 2012 . Flight testing of inert prototypes of the W88 Alt 370 began in 2014. The fourth and final test was conducted in November 2015, when an unarmed warhead was launched aboard a Trident II missile from the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Kentucky at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. After that launch, the NNSA concluded that “the weapon system alteration is functional and in line with NNSA’s commitment to complete development on schedule.” A drop test was conducted as part of the W88 Alt 370 program at Sandia National Laboratory., DOE Each Trident II can carry up to 14 individual warheads, but the missiles are generally only loaded with five or six at a time due to a succession of arms control agreements between the United States and Russia, including the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which the two countries agreed to extend earlier this year. In addition to W88 series warheads, the Trident IIs can also be loaded with W76-1s, which have an estimated yield of around 100 kilotons, as well as the new W76-2 variant . The W76-2 is a lower-yield design that reports have suggested could have a yield of just five kilotons and you can read more about it and the controversy surrounding it here . NNSA had previously planned to have the first round of the W88 Alt 370 units completed in December 2019, but concerns over a $5 off-the-shelf capacitor found in each warhead caused significant delays. By September 2019, the decision was eventually made to replace those capacitors with more durable versions that cost nearly $75 each, a change that added $850 million to the total price tag of the entire effort and pushed the schedule back considerably. Despite those delays, NNSA called the completion of the first unit a “major milestone” for the United States, claiming the successful first production unit was achieved “one month ahead of schedule after more than 11 years of design, development, qualification, and component production.” Shipping container for the W88 warheads, DOE Efforts to modernize and maintain America’s nuclear arsenal are expected to cost $1.5 trillion over the next three decades. However, because of the secrecy surrounding America’s nuclear enterprise, the astronomical costs of these programs can often avoid the public attention and oversight that more public defense programs receive, as you read more about here. President Joe Biden’s Administration has asked for approximately $15.5 billion for various nuclear weapons-related activities in the proposed budget for the 2022 Fiscal Year. This is $139 million more than Congress appropriated for the relevant accounts in the 2021 Fiscal Year, but $460 million less than President Donald Trump’s administration had projected for the upcoming fiscal cycle. NNSA is clearly hopeful that, having made it past the parts issue, the W88 program will now remain on track and on budget as it continues to upgrade these warheads over the next five years.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 15, 2021",Here’s Our Best Look Yet At The Navy’s New Laser Dazzler System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Images published by the U.S. Navy this week offer the most detailed look yet at the new Optical Dazzling Interdictor, or ODIN, in an operational setting. The directed energy weapon was seen aboard the USS Stockdale (DDG 106) Arleigh Burke -class guided-missile destroyer while it was conducting a replenishment-at-sea with the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) on July 12, 2021. ODIN is one of the Navy’s premier directed energy weapons initiatives and according to these images and budget documentation, the dazzler may be approaching a largely operational status. The images shared by the Navy show the turreted ODIN system installed on the Stockdale ’s forward close-in weapon system pedestal. ODIN is a lower-power laser system designed to blind adversarial electro-optical and infrared sensors by projecting a “dazzler” laser beam at them. The Navy intends for ODIN to be capable of disrupting and countering sensor systems aboard a wide range of threats including those aboard surface vessels, aircraft and UAVs, and even some anti-ship missiles. The ODIN system also includes a high-power camera system that can be used for other applications beyond its primary role in targeting for the dazzler system. This gives the Arleigh Burke class an additional high-power optical sensor in addition to its already outstanding EO/IR suite. The ODIN aboard the USS Stockdale, USN/MC Elisha Smith The USS Stockdale is part of the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group (CSG-1), which was rushed to Hawaii in June amid drills carried out by Russia’s Pacific Fleet. The strike group is currently conducting routine training off of the West Coast as part of the U.S. 3rd Fleet. ODIN is one facet of the larger Navy Laser Family of Systems (NLFoS) which includes the High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-Dazzler System ( HELIOS ) and the High Energy Laser Counter-ASCM Program (HELCAP). ODIN being tested at Naval Support Facility Dahlgren in 2020., USN The Navy has requested $9.5 million for ODIN in its FY 2022 budget documentation, down from $34 million in 2021. The Navy’s budget requests state that the decrease is due to the fact that “the majority of the procurement, assembly, checkout, integration, T&E, and installation of units 1-8 being either complete or in process,” noting that “Funding in FY22 is primarily for the Operation & Sustainment (O&S) of installed ODIN Units.” DOD DOD In 2020, Frank Peterkin, the Senior Technologist for the Directed Energy at the Office of Naval Research (ONR), indicated ONR had plans to deploy ODIN systems aboard seven more Navy vessels by 2023. “We’ve been working hard for the last five to seven years to try to bring directed energy forward in a meaningful sense to the warfighter and the operational community while at the same time advancing the technology,” Peterkin explained, adding that “We’re in a little bit of a golden age for collaboration now for directed energy.” The USS Stockdale during a replenishment-at-sea with the USS Carl Vinson in July 2021., USN/MC Elisha Smith Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Adm. Mike Gilday visited Naval Support Facility Dahlgren in Virginia in late 2020 to be briefed on directed energy programs including ODIN. “As we develop the Fleet of the future, it’s important that we invest in weapons that are more precise, have longer range, and give us the ability to make our ships more survivable,” Gilday said during the visit .  “The development and fielding of new technology like directed energy and high-velocity projectiles are not science fiction – they’re happening today.” Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Adm. Mike Gilday being briefed on the ODIN system at Naval Support Facility Dahlgren., USN/Lt Rachel Maul The appearance of the ODIN laser system aboard the USS Stockdale follows other brief glimpses of Navy directed energy weapons over the last few years. In October 2019, a mysterious object was shipped by Northrop Grumman from Redondo Beach, California to San Diego, which was later determined to be the Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD) tested aboard the USS Portland to shoot down a drone . Later in 2019, a turret which appears to have been an ODIN system was seen on the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Dewey (DDG-105) in 2019. These latest images of ODIN point to several lines in the Navy’s most recent budget requests which state that seven units are now in operational status with one more in the testing and certification phase. ODIN is already installed aboard three Arleigh Burke -class guided-missile destroyers, and two more are expected to be installed in 2021. The remaining three will be installed over the next few years. DDG-106 pulling alongside CVN-70 for replenishment, ODIN looking on., USN/MC Elisha Smith Naval leadership plans to add directed energy capabilities to a wider range of vessels including Littoral Combat Ships , and potentially including aircraft carriers according to statements made by the ONR. ODIN is something of a first step in a number of increasingly capable and lethal laser systems that will be fielded over the decade. Some, like HELIOS , combine low-power dazzling with higher-power, more destructive laser capabilities, as well. So, expect to see more U.S. Navy ships armed with lasers in the near future, with ODIN being just one of the systems developed to offer a number of varying capabilities.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth linked up with one of her American counterparts, the Nimitz class USS Ronald Reagan , as well as the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima , among other warships, for a large force exercise in the Gulf of Aden today. This was a major demonstration of allied naval power in a body of water that forms a maritime crossroads between a number of strategically significant areas. The U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS The Sullivans and USS Halsey and its Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Shiloh , as well as the Dutch De Zeven Provinciën class frigate HNLMS Evertsen , also took part in the drills . Evertsen is accompanying the Queen Elizabeth on her maiden operational cruise as part of the U.K.-led multi-national Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21). U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters are also embarked on the British carrier, along with U.K. Royal air Force F-35Bs and Royal Navy Merlin helicopters . Top to bottom, the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, HMS Queen Elizabeth , and the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima ., USN “Our team was proud to operate alongside the UK Carrier Strike Group during this unique opportunity to hone the full scope of our mutual capabilities,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Will Pennington, commander of the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group and Task Force 50, said in a statement . “By operating together at sea, we deepen our coalition partnerships and extend our global reach throughout the region’s critical waterways.” “The aircraft carrier is the ultimate expression of global maritime power,” U.K. Royal Navy Commodore Steve Moorhouse, commander of CSG21, added. “ Queen Elizabeth , Ronald Reagan , and Iwo Jima symbolize the might of the U.S. and UK partnership, and the ease with which our naval and air forces can combine here in the Gulf of Aden, or anywhere else in the world.” This is actually the second time that CSG21 has worked together with Iwo Jima during this deployment, with the two ships and others taking part in another exercise in the Atlantic Ocean in May. Queen Elizabeth has also trained with a Nimitz class carrier before, the USS George H.W. Bush , as part of another drill in the Atlantic back in 2017 . USS Ronald Reagan , at top, and HMS Queen Elizabeth. , USN “Participating forces focused on the full spectrum of maritime warfare operations, practicing anti-air warfare (AAW), anti-surface warfare (ASUW), and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) tactics and procedures,” according to an official Navy news item . “The crews exercised their abilities to conduct precision maneuvering, hunt simulated enemy submarines, provide layered defense against simulated air and surface threats, and conduct long range maritime strikes against simulated adversarial forces.” All of these missions sets are relevant for aircraft carriers and their strike groups operating anywhere in the world, but are particularly applicable in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding bodies of water. The Gulf of Aden links to the Red Sea, which is situated to the west through the highly strategic Bab Al Mandeb Strait . The Indian Ocean lies the east of the strait. Yemen to the north and Somalia to the south are major hotspots in their own right. Houthi rebels in Yemen have notably attacked ships belonging to a Saudi Arabian-led coalition, as well as U.S. Navy warships , with anti-ship cruise missiles and remote-controlled explosive-laden boats in recent years, causing casualties and serious damage to vessels in some instances. From the Gulf of Aden, ships can sail north through the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, via the South Canal. Queen Elizabeth just came from that region, where she launched F-35Bs on combat missions in support of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The ships of CSG21 also played a game of cat-and-mouse with Russian warships and warplanes, including Tu-22M3 bombers and MiG-31K combat jets armed with anti-ship and hypersonic missiles, respectively. The Mediterranean is notably a hotbed of submarine activity , as well. Continuing east from the Gulf of Aden would take Queen Elizabeth and the rest of CSG21 into the Arabian Sea. Ronald Reagan , which is forward-deployed in Japan and recently began a rare deployment to the Middle East, had been operating in the North Arabian Sea to help provide cover for the ongoing U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan . U.S. officials said last week that this drawdown is already more than 90 percent complete . In May, First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin, the Royal Navy’s top officer, talked about how Queen Elizabeth could, in principle, launch F-35Bs into Afghanistan from the North Arabian Sea, which would require them to fly over Pakistan , but it’s unclear if any such strikes are in CSG21’s future. Last week, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson disclosed that the majority of British forces in Afghanistan had also departed the country . HMS Queen Elizabeth sails in the Gulf of Aden on July 12, 2021. A total of 13 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, as well as a Merlin helicopter, are visible on her flight deck., USN Queen Elizabeth will eventually continue on to the Indo-Pacific region. There the carrier and the rest of CSG21 will almost certainly integrate again with warships from the United States, as well as the United Kingdom’s other allies and partners. Many of those countries have already been stepping their own naval activity across this broad part of the world with a particular eye toward challenging China’s vast and almost universally disputed territorial claims and increasing general regional influence. Just today, the U.S. Navy denied that Chinese forces had chased the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Benfold away from the waters around the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, which authorities in Beijing claim almost all of despite competing claims from other countries. This so-called Freedom of Navigation Patrol (FONOP) came on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of a ruling from the international Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Netherlands rejecting Chinese claims to the bulk of the South China Sea. There has been much discussion already about whether Queen Elizabeth or other ships from CSG21 will take part in their own FONOPs around Chinese-claimed areas in the Pacific. Regardless, Queen Elizabeth joining Ronald Reagan and Iwo Jima , as well as the other ships, in the Gulf of Aden underscores how the Royal Navy is likely to conduct carrier operations in many cases in the future, broadly, as part of larger multi-national coalitions. This could be beneficial for the United Kingdom, which has a limited number of surface escorts with which form its own independent carrier strike groups, and for allies looking to bolster their own naval aviation capacity during combined operations. As already noted, the entire task force that took part in this exercise today presented an impressive display of shared naval power. USN All told, the exercise in the Gulf of Aden is another significant milestone in the Queen Elizabeth ‘s first operational deployment, but it won’t be the last.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 14, 2021",Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation Channels The X-Files With This Cryptic “UFO” Teaser (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russiaâ€™s United Aircraft Corporation, the organization that brings together the countryâ€™s major aerospace firms and many of their related defense companies, has provided a cryptic teaser of its upcoming contribution to the MAKS international air show that will begin at Zhukovsky International Airport, outside Moscow, next week. The teaser, which appeared on the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) Twitter account, carries the obscure message (in Russian): â€œEverything is easier than it seems. #checkmate. Something seems to be on the way.â€ A Sukhoi Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter takes off. As a prominent part of the UAC product line, the Su-57 will no doubt be well represented at the MAKS air show., UAC Oddly, while it appears on the companyâ€™s Russian-language Twitter account, it is not on UACâ€™s English-language version ). So far, so ambiguous. Ğ’ÑĞµ Ğ¿Ñ€Ğ¾Ñ‰Ğµ Ñ‡ĞµĞ¼ ĞºĞ°Ğ¶ĞµÑ‚ÑÑ #ĞĞĞš #uac #Ğ Ğ¾ÑÑ‚ĞµÑ… #rostec #ĞœĞĞšĞ¡2021#checkmate ĞšĞ°Ğ¶ĞµÑ‚ÑÑ, Ñ‡Ñ‚Ğ¾-Ñ‚Ğ¾ Ğ½Ğ°Ğ¼ĞµÑ‡Ğ°ĞµÑ‚ÑÑğŸ˜ğŸ˜‰ pic.twitter.com/ylh7niDpZX — United Aircraft Corp (@UAC_Russia) July 11, 2021 But itâ€™s the image posted together with that message that is perhaps most puzzling. As well as the words â€œGuys, everything is simpler than you think,â€ there is a grainy image of a tree-lined landscape with a floating Knight chess piece. The original photo was swiftly identified by Twitter user @Ingraman5000 as a famous hoax UFO photo by the Swiss Eduard Albert â€œBillyâ€ Meier. In the 1970s Meier claimed to have been in contact with aliens and provided photographs like this to â€œproveâ€ it. Those photos became known to a much wider public when they were used as publicity material for the U.S. science-fiction show The X-Files that launched in the mid-1990s. The particular photo repurposed by UAC was the inspiration for the â€œI want to believeâ€ UFO poster that was seen on the office wall of FBI special agent Fox Mulder, played by David Duchovny, in The X-Files and which is now in the Smithsonian collection . After an intellectual property lawsuit launched by Meier, the poster in the TV show switched to a stock background image instead. So, whatâ€™s going on here? Clearly, UAC is playing deliberately on the UFO/ X-Files connotations of this image and could be suggesting anything from the paranormal, extraterrestrial life, or even government cover-ups, all of which were familiar staples of the TV show and its spinoffs. With that in mind, UAC may be hinting they are about to reveal some previously unknown flying object, manned or unmanned, although a spacecraft seems possible, too. The company portfolio is based primarily around fairly conventional military and commercial aviation, including transports, fighters, bombers, as well as upgrades of existing Soviet-era aircraft. Among the best-known UAC aircraft are the Sukhoi Flanker family of multirole jet fighters and the Tupolev Tu-160 Blackjack strategic bomber. A Russian Aerospace Force Tu-160 takes off., Dmitry Terekhov/Wikimedia Commons The reference could simply be an allusion to a program, whether aircraft or otherwise, which is simply yet to be revealed, and which may be as straightforward as a turboprop airliner . The wording seems to suggest something not only new but also something emphasizing convenience or ease of use. The significance of the repeated chess reference and Knight figure is also a mystery, with no known active programs of this name. In Russian, the name of that chess piece is translated simply as â€œhorse,â€ so a specifically military reference here is perhaps less likely. On the other hand, various Russian companies are known to be working on advanced drone programs, including an apparent counterpart to the U.S. loyal wingman concept , in which an unmanned combat air vehicle, or UCAV, would fly into battle alongside manned fighters and offer complementary capabilities. Sukhoi, as a part of UAC, has been especially active with its Okhotnik strike drone and another new development in this program would not be entirely surprising. Sukhoi Okhotnik., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Whatever UAC is planning on revealing or unveiling at MAKS â€” which starts next Tuesday and runs until Sunday, July 25 â€” itâ€™s a good time to deploy UFO imagery to gain attention. After all, the Director of National Intelligence in the United States recently published its long-awaited Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force document, as a long list of incidents challenges our understanding of what used to be called UFOs. This, of course, is something The War Zone has examined in detail in the past , with this in-depth feature providing a good starting point to the phenomenon. In the meantime, UACâ€™s teaser has certainly piqued our interest. It should be remembered, though, that Russiaâ€™s military-industrial complex has also a track record of promoting sometimes-laughable PR stunts , with a number of vaporware weapon mockups that never made it to service. Although it is somewhat hard to envisage that the relatively beleaguered Russian aerospace industry will spring a genuinely out-of-this-world surprise at the Zhukovsky next week, the truth, as they say, is out there. Update, July 13: Rostec, the Russian state corporation responsible for UAC, has followed up the teaser Tweet with a new countdown website , as well as a video uploaded to YouTube that might hint at a rumored new single-engine fighter jet . â€œRostec will present a fundamentally new military aircraft at MAKS-2021,â€ according to the text title to the video. The video, which has scenes of the United Arab Emirates, India, Vietnam, and Argentina, as well as air force pilots from those countries and others, continues the Knight chess-piece theme. At one stage, the shadow of an aircraft over water shows a broad similarity to the Mikoyan MiG-35 multirole fighter jet. While the MiG-35 (more specifically, the MiG-29M/M2 export version) has already been sold to Algeria and Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, India, Vietnam, and Argentina are, notably, all either existing operators of Russian fighters or have been linked with purchases of Russian fighters in the recent past.Â https://youtube.com/watch?v=u-OZZKnjhRI At the last MAKS air show, in 2019, RAC MiG presented the MiG-35 in a â€œrenewed export configurationâ€ with enhanced avionics including open-architecture software, Zhuk-AE active electronically scanned array radar, plus a new larger wing and tail. This jet has already been pitched to India to meet its new requirement for 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA).Â The aircraft shadow briefly seen in the new UAC video., Youtube Screencap/UAC As well as the MiG-35 and its derivatives, Russia is also known to be working on the development of a new light-to-medium-weight fighter jet , according to reports. This is apparently based on a single-engine configuration, rather than a twin-engine one, but further details have remained elusive so far. At one point, it was even reported that Russia and the UAE might collaborate to develop a successor to the MiG-29/35 family, although itâ€™s unclear if these two projects are related.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Feb 1, 2022","You Can Bug-Out To Your Own Cold War Communications Bunker For A Cool $695,000","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you’ve ever wanted to build your own impenetrable underground lair and have a spare $695,000, one seller on eBay has just the property for you. A Cold War-era communications bunker in western Kansas is up for grabs on the online auction site eBay, offering a lucky buyer the chance to own a piece of American history and the ultimate bug-out shelter. The bunker, which is located outside Scott City, Kansas, sits on approximately 10 acres and is described by its seller as “an incredible asset to own.” Inside, it offers 8,000 square feet of underground floor space, plus an additional 3,800 square feet consisting of a “steel mezzanine” which makes up a second floor. The facility is complete with blast doors which “are nicely painted and functional” and the complex is described as being “EMP protected” without further detail, albeit if it was a Cold War communications site, this makes sense. “Clean floor surfaces,” the listing also boasts. eBay/officefirstsolutions The bunker is being sold on eBay by user “officefirstsolutions” who describes the bunker as “used in clean condition, being sold as is where is with no warranties.” The full description on eBay reads: This site was built in 60’s at a cost of approximately $4 Million (1960’s money). This facility is an underground structure built as a power-feed station on a hardened transcontinental coaxial-cable route, extending from Airmont, NY to Mojave, CA. The installation was also a base of operations for the technicians who maintained a section of the cable route and its unattended repeater stations. The mineral rights go with the property. This site is partially developed into a data storage center (could be used for legal grow space in near future) and the other half partially developed into a VIP residential area. There are a number of security cameras installed around the property to provide security for the facility. They can be remotely operated for off-site security monitoring. Included with this system is keypad and keycard access. The bunker was designed to withstand a nearby nuclear blast, featuring walls and ceilings constructed from 18 to 24 inches of military-grade concrete and steel, with four to six feet of dirt between it and the surface. Inside, the ceilings are 16.5 feet tall. eBay/officefirstsolutions The facility features a standard 120v electrical system that can be upgraded to 480v, all powered by an on-site generator with a 2,000-gallon diesel fuel tank. In addition, there is an original backup generator at the site. A one-ton hoist at the bunker’s main entry can be used to load heavy equipment in or out of the facility. eBay/officefirstsolutions The bunker also features a 10,000-gallon stainless steel water storage tank, a newly-dug well, and what is described only as a “functional bathroom.” Two sewage ejector pumps feed into a “double reduction sewage lagoon system.” The site even includes a 177’ radio tower outside the bunker that is described as “potentially income-producing.” eBay/officefirstsolutions An additional description on the eBay listing offers a variety of uses for the bunker: I have one of the best and cleanest sites available, so much refurb work has gone into this facility, so much potential here, as it sits, it can be finished as both a data center, lab, legal grow room and residential center of straight residential, I have worked on this site for several years, put a lot more money into this site then what I am asking for it, due to health issues and relocation I am selling my project, for the right person this has a lot of upside potential, it will take some work to complete, vision, this is no money really for the facility and what has been done in comparison to what this would cost from scratch, this is a must see, please contact me for more information. Only serious inquiries only, please be prepared to allow us to vet you and your party if you want any information sent to you as we WILL NOT send plans or detailed information for security reasons without first knowing who you are, verified email and phone number required, thank you for your cooperation on this matter. The listing then notes that “all Data center equipment, racks, servers, battery back up, power distribution” are sold separately, and that the price is for the facility only. eBay/officefirstsolutions Despite being described as a “VIP bomb shelter,” the accompanying images show the facility needs a little TLC. Pictures on the eBay listing show that the bunker is largely unfinished, with stacks of sheetrock panels and insulation piled up in some rooms and unfinished interior walls in others. For a hardened bug out shelter, though, the site looks hard to beat. eBay/officefirstsolutions Given its description as being on a “transcontinental coaxial-cable route, extending from Airmont, NY to Mojave, CA,” the bunker was most likely part of the AT&T L-Carrier Cable Network , a communications system developed to send telephone signals, and later television, coast-to-coast. AT&T began construction on the network in the years immediately following World War Two, and the line was upgraded beginning in the early 1960s in order to provide a hardened land line connection between critical military command installations that could survive an initial nuclear exchange. The website ColdWarComms.org documents and archives these facilities, even including pictures of how many of them appear today. The site’s description of the switching stations used in the L-Carrier network sound quite similar to the bunker facility listed on eBay: These were main stations providing circuit routing and power injection to the cable. Repeaters were located every mile or two along the route in underground manholes. The cable itself was buried a minimum of 4 feet deep. The spacing of the repeaters and main stations depended on the version of the L carrier system in use on a particular route, the location of cities to be served by sidelegs from the main cable, and geography of the area. Different classes of stations provided either just power feed, circuit termination, and circuit switching. The power feed only stations were the smallest, while the switching stations were quite large, and all located below ground for protection from nuclear radiation and blast effects.  The stations were constructed of reinforced concrete and had heavy steel blast doors. ColdWarComms.org Over 100 main stations and 1000 “repeater vaults” were constructed with enough amenities to sustain support crews for two weeks following a nuclear exchange. Every station offered nuclear early warning and blast detection systems. By the mid-1980s, the L-carrier lines were no longer needed, as faster forms of communication like fiber optic cable and satellites had made the coaxial copper cable that these stations carried from coast to coast obsolete. These types of hardened military structures pop up for sale online from time to time. In 2018, an incredibly hardened former Royal Corps of Signals post built to spy on Soviet communications went up for sale , complete with its golf ball-shaped radome. In 2019, Grist House Brewing in Pennsylvania bought a derelict Nike Missile Master Direction Center from the 1950s outside Collier Township, Pennsylvania, and converted it into a brewery . Other Cold War-era facilities can now be rented out for television and film productions. It might not be turning nukes into plowshares, but at least these abandoned relics of the Cold War’s past can be put to use instead of fading away into rubble. Whatever the future owner of the bunker might do with the communications facility for sale in Kansas, they’ll be doing it in one of the safest locations possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2019",The Army Is Once Again Trying To Sell Off Some Of Its Underappreciated Naval Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly two years ago, Congress told the U.S. Army to pump the brakes on its plans to dramatically cut the size of its obscure and generally underappreciated fleets of amphibious landing ships, landing craft, and a variety of other maritime assets, which are also referred to as “ the Army’s Navy .” This came after The War Zone first reported that the General Frank S. Besson class Logistics Support Vessel USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda was up for sale, a listing that was quickly taken down from the General Services Administration’s auction website. Now, a number of Army vessels are available for purchase again, showing that the service is moving ahead again with at least some of the previously planned divestments. A banner advertisement currently on the GSA Auctions website says that a total of nine Landing Craft Mechanizeds (LCM), eight Landing Craft Utilitys (LCU), four small tugs, one large tug, and a crane barge, will be up for bid between July 7 and July 16, 2021. At the time of writing, all of these vessels are listed on the site. Two US Army LCU-2000 landing craft with a large tug in between them. Eight LCU-2000s and one large tug are now up for auction through the GSA., US Army The present sizes of the Army’s various watercraft fleets are unclear, but, as of 2018 , it had 36 LCM Mk 8s (LCM-8), 34 LCU-2000s, 16 small tugs, 8 large tugs, and two crane barges, spread across a number of active duty and so-called Reserve Component units, as well as in storage in propositioned stockpiles around the world in case of contingencies. The Reserve Component includes the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard. It’s also not clear if the vessels and the barge on sale now came from active or reserve elements. The banner advertisement promoting the sale of various Army maritime assets presently on the GSA Auctions website., GSA An LCM-8 and a small tug, which are among the Army vessels now up for auction., GSA Small tugs up for auction., GSA GSA Two different views of the large tug on sale through GSA., GSA The crane barge now up for auction., GSA If the overall size of the Army’s Navy remains largely the same, the 23 maritime assets that have been put up for sale through GSA represent a much smaller portion of the total watercraft fleet than the service had attempted to shed back in 2019, before lawmakers intervened. Also notably absent from the auction listings, at least so far, are any of its larger Logistics Support Vessels (LSV), some of which had originally been on the chopping block . The Army has eight LSVs, six of which are approximately 4,200-ton displacement ships that are similar in some respects to Land Ship Tank (LST) type vessels, a kind of amphibious warfare vessel that the U.S. Navy no longer operates . The last two of these ships are members of a distinct, larger subclass with various additional features that give them greater operating range and improved performance on the open ocean. You can read more about them in this past War Zone story . It is also worth noting that the Navy is now working with the Marine Corps on the acquisition of a new class of Light Amphibious Warships (LAW), which are also closer in general design and capabilities to LSTs. The USAV Major General Robert Smalls , at center, one of the two improved LSVs, with the USAV Major General Charles P. Gross , one of the six initial LSVs, at left. An LCU-2000 landing craft is also seen sitting alongside Smalls ., US Army It is also important to point out that the Army is still moving ahead with plans to purchase a fleet of new Maneuver Support Vessels (Light), or MSV(L), which you can read about in more detail here , to replace its LCM-8. The service’s most recent budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year asks for $76.6 million to buy two MSV(L)s, which, if approved, would add to funding it has already received to buy a pair of these boats in the current fiscal cycle. An artist’s conception of a pair of the US Army’s future MSV(L) landing craft., US Army “The two LRIP [Low-Rate Initial Production] vessels are required for Production Verification Testing (PVT), Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) testing, and Operational Testing,” according to official budget documents . The Army has said in the past that it wants to buy 36 MSV(L)s, in total, to replace all of its LCM-8 on a one-for-one basis. As a result, the divesture of nine Vietnam War-era LCM-8, at least, may not ultimately have an impact on the overall size of the Army’s Navy. The Army’s proposed 2022 Fiscal Year budget also includes $44.4 million for various other watercraft-related activities, the bulk of which would go to extending the service life of one LCU-2000 and four Modular Causeway Systems (MCS), the latter of which are used to help get vehicles and other materiel from larger ships to shore in the absence of traditional port facilities. This funding would continue years of service life extension efforts for the service’s LCU-2000 fleet and its MCSs. US Army vehicles drive ashore after being unloaded from an LCU-2000 landing craft onto a Modular Causeway System during an exercise in South Korea., US Army Army efforts, to ensure the service’s relevancy in future high-end conflicts, especially in the Pacific against China, appear to be a major factor in the revision of its watercraft plans. The Trump Administration’s National Defense Strategy, which was released in 2018 , placed a renewed emphasis on preparing for so-called “great power competition” with near-peer adversaries, such as China and Russia. “The Army decided to suspend watercraft transformation while we evaluate the overall watercraft requirements needed to support of the National Defense Strategy,” a spokesperson for the service had told The War Zone back in August 2019. “Initial analysis identified excess capability beyond existing requirements.” The sections of the service’s proposed 2022 Fiscal Year budget for the future MSV(L)s, as well as sustainment of its various existing fleets, reference “Multi-Domain Operations” (MDO) and “Joint All Domain Operations” (JADO). MDO is the Army’s component of the broader U.S. military-wide JADO concept. When it comes to the Army, at its most basic, “the [MDO/JADO] concept describes how U.S. ground forces, as part of the joint and multinational team, deter adversaries and defeat highly capable near-peer enemies in the 2025-2050 timeframe,” according to U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). Preparing for a high-end, distributed conflict across a broad portion of the Pacific, potentially against China , has been a key focus of MDO within the Army and JADO across the U.S military, as a whole. “The Army Watercraft Systems (AWS) provide… [an] ability to access multiple entry points via littorals and inland waterways (waterborne corridor) IOT [in order to] sustain forces within an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubble,” the Army’s 2022 Fiscal Year budget request explains. Just this month, one of the Army’s LSVs, USAV Lt. General William B. Bunker , helped move elements of the service’s I Corps from the unit’s home base at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State some 5,600 miles across the Pacific to Guam as part of Exercise Forager 21 . This drill “is designed to test and refine the Theater Army and the Corps’ ability to deploy landpower forces to the Pacific, execute command and control, and effectively conduct multi-domain operations throughout Oceania,” according to the Army . “Through innovation and experimentation during Forager, the theater Army is finding new ways to employ Army watercraft systems to increase logistical options to the commander and present new dilemmas to adversaries.” Personnel offload vehicles from the USAV Lt. General William B. Bunker in Guam as part of Exercise Forager 21., US Army So, while you can hop on GSA Auctions right now and place a bid for a variety of Army landing craft and tugs, or that crane barge, the future of the Army’s Navy seems much more secure than it did two years ago.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 30, 2021",The Navy’s Exotic M80 Stiletto Test Ship Defeated Drone Swarms At Sea During Trials,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s exotic M80 Stiletto experimental testbed ship has successfully completed a six-week demonstration of an automated 360-degree detect-and-defeat anti-drone system. The demonstration saw the M80 go up against “drone swarms” and what has been described as “a wide range of unmanned robotic threats.” The combination of the Navy’s one-of-a-kind littoral vessel and an automated anti-drone system highlights the increasingly significant threat that lower-end unmanned systems pose to naval operations and may point to these systems becoming more common aboard surface ships. The anti-drone system tested aboard the Stiletto was the DroneSentry-X manufactured by Australia-based defense contractor DroneShield. In their July 2021 newsletter , DroneShield claims the system tested aboard the Stiletto “demonstrated overall detection capability, detection and defeat ranges, on-the-move operation in various sea states, and effectiveness against drone swarms, involving a wide range of unmanned robotic threats.” The exact nature of the “swarms” in these tests is unknown, meaning it’s not clear if an actual networked, autonomous drone swarm was the threat in question or if the tests were conducted against multiple drones simultaneously. The M80 Stiletto at Guantanamo Bay while conducting counter-illicit trafficking operations in 2008., DOD/PO2 Nathaniel Moger For this latest demonstration, the M80 was fitted with the DroneSentry-X, a relatively small (24.9” x 24.9” x 9.1”) pod designed for roof-mounted applications. The entire system is housed within an IP66-rated octagonal shell, weighs just under 60 pounds, and is operated by a proprietary tablet-based digital control panel and display. On its product page , DroneShield writes that the system uses “integrated sensors to detect and disrupt UASs moving at any speed” and is “suitable for mobile operations, on site surveillance and on the move missions.” The company claims the system uses artificial intelligence to analyze the surrounding radiofrequency environment and identify potentially hostile drones. Once the system identifies the particular radio bands used by those drones, it then activates “non-kinetic jamming for controlled management of response to threats.” A fact sheet for the system claims the DroneSentry-X has a detection range of more than 2km (1.2 miles), with a disruption range of “greater than 300m.” DroneShield In an email to The War Zone , DroneShield CEO Oleg Vornik told us that the DroneSentry-X successfully passed all of the evaluations aboard the M80 Stiletto and added that “saltwater represents unique challenges to electronics, and these tests, in addition to performance against drones, also test the ruggedization and resilience in a wet, corrosive environment.” While the company’s releases and their CEO’s emails to The War Zone all claim the anti-drone system was tested against a “wide variety” of robotic threats, it’s unclear exactly what the threats in the demonstrations consisted of. The War Zone reached out to Vornik and the company to inquire about the details of these tests, but has yet to receive comments clarifying what exactly these tests involved. The DroneSentry-X mounted aboard the M80 Stiletto, DroneShield DroneShield also writes in their July newsletter that this latest successful US Navy demonstration validates other recent DroneSentry-X evaluations conducted by the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Homeland Security, and various law enforcement agencies. The contractor makes a wide variety of sophisticated anti-drone products, including the sci-fi-looking rifle-style jammers seen deployed by the Belgian Federal Police at a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and King Philippe of Belgium last month. While used primarily as a testbed for new systems and technologies, the Navy’s M80 Stiletto was envisioned as a combination of a high speed, low signature command and control station, a delivery platform for special operations forces (SOF), and a mothership that could launch and recover its own craft. The ship currently belongs to Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division at Little Creek in Virginia, who refer to it as a “ maritime demonstration craft .” A catapult and arrestor device used to launch and recover drones aboard the M80., USN The Stiletto’s M-shaped hull is designed to reduce the ship’s wake, drag, and acoustic signature, while keeping it from slamming against waves and rough surf at high speeds. The design is intended to be much more stable in shallow waters than traditional monohull designs, allowing the Stiletto to launch and recover smaller vehicles including U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) 11-meter Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB). The M80’s overall design is also scalable, meaning either larger or smaller versions of the hull could be built. The Stiletto was born in the mid-2000s by the now-defunct Office For Transformation (OFT), and was part of an initiative called Project WolfPAC which aimed to “explore command and control of geographically dispersed, networked, autonomous and semi-autonomous assets” in shallow water operations. You can read more about the M80 and its capabilities in this past feature of ours . A crew assigned to Naval Special Clearance Team One (NSCT-1) prepares to enter the well deck aboard the M80 Stiletto., USN/PH Damien Horvath Beyond defending against small drones, the U.S. Navy is pursuing offensive UAV capabilities as well, such as swarming aerial drones that can be launched from unmanned vessels both above and below the waves. The U.S. Marine Corps, meanwhile, is planning to arm their Long-Range Unmanned Surface Vehicle drone boats with loitering munitions. Naturally, the U.S. is far from the only nation developing and refining these capabilities. While a small drone can’t sink a large warship, one armed with a small munition could cause a mission kill on its own by causing a relatively centralized amount of damage to a vital system. A swarm of similarly equipped drones could do much more harm and there are currently few defenses against such an onslaught. The danger small UAVs pose isn’t all about kinetic threats like “suicide drones,” however. Unarmed small drones can still present significant dangers to large ships. A relatively small number of drones can be used instead to decoy or jam shipboard air defenses and communications, just like land-based air defenses , for example. In addition, UAVs are a threat on their own just for their potential surveillance capabilities. Armed with relatively inexpensive and unsophisticated equipment, a small drone could gather critical intelligence and provide targeting to other platforms and munitions that could cause much more damage than the drone could itself. Many recent incidents of Navy vessels encountering reportedly unknown UAVs underscore the need for ship-based anti-drone systems. In one 2019 incident, multiple Navy destroyers were stalked for days by unknown drones in training ranges just off of the California coast, an incident even the Navy’s top brass will not explain to this day . With reports of U.S. Navy vessels being seemingly observed by drones and other UAS in restricted airspace , it’s no wonder the Navy is now testing automated anti-drone systems aboard Navy vessels, even if only on its experimental Stiletto test bed for now. UPDATE: 6:06 PM EST: ​ DroneShield CEO Oleg Vornik shared additional details via email about the capabilities of the system tested aboard the M80 Stiletto: Our system is able to deal with UAVs, USVs and UGVs (so, air, water surface, and ground drones). They all use similar tech, although USVs and UGVs have an added complexity of being closer to the ground, with more clutter and ground/water reflections for the sensors. We do not presently target UUV detection, as their comms work entirely differently to the rest, and the signal propagation under water is quite different. However our AI signal processing software works equally well on sonar (and space) data, which is one of the next steps for our product roadmap. Ultimately, we go where our customers ask us to.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 1, 2021",This Is The Navy’s Timeline For Ridding Itself Of Four More Littoral Combat Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The latest blow has been struck to the U.S. Navy’s troubled Littoral Combat Ship , or LCS, program, with the service’s announcement that it wants to get rid of another four of the warships by March 22 next year. This is in addition to the first two LCS ships that are already heading to a very early retirement. The Navy has put this proposed timeline on the deactivation of three Freedom class variants, USS Fort Worth (LCS-3), USS Detroit (LCS-7), and USS Little Rock (LCS-9), and one Independence class vessel, USS Coronado (LCS-4). The youngest of these — USS Little Rock — will only have been in service for a little over four years when it’s withdrawn. The Navy’s latest plans for the LCS retirements were made public recently by the Chief of Naval Operations and brought to our attention by Navy veteran and former journalist David Larter. The official administrative notice, of NAVADMIN, details not only specific project dates for the planned decommissioning of these four LCS vessels, but also lays out a timeline for five surplus Cyclone class patrol boats to be sold off via the Foreign Military Sales program, among other things. It’s not clear which navy, or navies, have been identified as customers for the patrol boats. The USS Detroit (LCS-7) and the Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS Gridley (DDG-101) during exercises in the U.S. Southern Command’s area of responsibility in January 2020., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Devin Bowser As of now, 10 examples of the Freedom class ships have been delivered, with another five under construction or in the process of fitting out, and one more example on order. Thirteen Independence class warships have also been commissioned, the most recent in May this year , with another two fitting out, three under construction, and one on order. Although the final fate of the four LCSs will depend on a Congressional decision, it’s abundantly clear that the Navy wants to do away with the warships. This plan to decommission these four ships first emerged in the Navy’s latest budget request for Fiscal Year 2022. The plan is for these four ships to be placed in what is called “ Out of Commission, In Reserve ,” which would leave the potential, however remote, that they could be reactivated, if necessary. The service’s proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2021 had also tried to retire the first examples, each, of the Freedom and Independence class LCSs, to save money. Notably, these four vessels were not completed to the same standard as subsequent examples in either subclass, and the cost to update them and make them combat-ready is significant — around $2.5 billion, in total, according to Navy officials . Congress last year approved the retirement of the first two ships in each subclass, USS Freedom (LCS-1) and USS Independence (LCS-2), which will be decommissioned this year. However, legislators blocked the Navy from getting rid of the next two ships, Fort Worth and Coronado. The Navy is now trying again to retire LCS-3 and LCS-4, pointing to the high costs associated with upgrading them to a common configuration in line with other more recent LCSs. These two warships also lack the controversial mission modules , which were originally designed to be switched in and out of the hulls rapidly while in port, before this idea was abandoned, leaving each ship with a single module installed. In the meantime, the Navy is still waiting for its anti-submarine warfare and mine countermeasures modules, leaving only the anti-surface warfare version available on some of the hulls. In addition, the service is now looking to decommission USS Detroit and USS Little Rock. These are both Freedom class ships and were only commissioned in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Unfortunately, they have also had some of the worst of problems with their propulsion systems, specifically the combining gear , which links the two main diesel engines on the Freedom class design to a pair of gas turbines, which can provide additional power for its water jet propulsion system. As such, the combining gear is a critical part of these vessels’ ability to reach speeds of over 40 knots, which was a core requirement when the ships were under development. The Pentagon specifically identified the combining gear in LCS-7 and LCS-9 as the reason to decommission of these warships earlier than planned, its Defense Budget Overview for Fiscal Year 2022 describing “major propulsion train casualties” on both these Freedom class ships. The Freedom class USS Little Rock (LCS-9) departs Naval Station Mayport, Florida, for the ship’s maiden deployment, in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility, in February 2020., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Nathan T. Beard The Pentagon has concluded that fixing the Freedom class ships would be too costly and that retiring them would save $186 million that could better be invested elsewhere. “Decommissioning these two ships includes a cost avoidance strategy, so that scarce maintenance funding can be allocated to the highest priority ships,” the Pentagon continues. The Navy also argues that its future FFG-62 Constellation class frigates will be able to provide equivalent, if not vastly improved capabilities over the four LCSs now slated for decommissioning. These new warships are shaping up to be very capable for their size , but the first of them is only due to enter service in the late 2020s. An artist’s rendering of the future Constellation class frigate, or FFG-62, which is nearing completion of the design phase., Fincantieri Marine Group Nevertheless, despite the decision to build an entirely new class of more capable frigates, the Navy otherwise seems to be sticking to its LCSs, despite their shortcomings, and is still building LCSs in the meantime, too. With that in mind, additional — and hopefully more reliable — LCSs would help bridge the gap until the new warships arrive. The process of actually providing new LCSs to the fleet is not without problems, however. Last January, with 10 examples of the Freedom class commissioned, the Navy called for a pause in deliveries , again attributed to problems with the drive train. At the same time, the ships that have been delivered are proving alarmingly expensive to operate, especially when compared to the limited capabilities they currently offer. It emerged earlier this year that the cost of operating the vessels is far higher than planned , comparing unfavorably even to the much more capable Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer. The Navy commissioned its latest Independence class LCS, USS Mobile (LCS-26), on May 22., U.S. Navy Amid the catalog of problems that’s afflicted the LCSs, the Navy has not deployed Independence in an operational capacity, while Freedom , Fort Worth , and Coronado have each deployed once. The deployments for those last two warships were also interrupted by technical problems . More recently, the Navy has announced plans to have six LCSs deployed on operations before the end of this year, which would be a new record for the ships. As for the future, and the remaining LCSs, the Navy is hopeful that the addition of the Naval Strike Missile , or NSM, on all these hulls will provide a new relevance for littoral operations. Meanwhile, thought is also being given to whether the LCSs can also be used for the Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) concept, currently being developed by the Navy and Marine Corps. In that scenario, the LCS would be used as something like a fast troop transport , moving small numbers of infantry around as part of an Indo-Pacific region island-hopping-type campaign. Losing another four LCSs, however problematic they have proven to be so far, further dents the Navy’s aspiration to reach a total fleet size of 355 ships . These warships were each originally expected to serve for around 25 years. On the other hand, they have spent very little time on operational deployments, so deleting them is unlikely to make a significant difference in terms of overall maritime capability. While it remains to be seen whether Congress will be convinced by the Navy’s and Pentagon’s arguments to do away with another four LCSs, the latest development is another indictment of the concept in general, and of the Freedom class specifically.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Mar 11, 2021",War Games In California And Florida Linked To Test Massive “Kill Web”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force’s latest large force test event has once again pushed the boundaries of modern aerial warfare, leveraging long-range “kill web” technology and integration of an autonomous drone. A test pilot at the center of the work told The War Zone how ranges in the east and west of the United States came together to prove-out data link fusion, while the Air Force’s Skyborg program gave an early, but important, demonstration of how it can operate safely and effectively in complex aerial battlespace. “This was another test event as part of a series that is focused on kill web integration, event survivability and — new for this iteration — two new focus areas: autonomy integration and very long range kill chain integration in that we actually linked up the respective four-hour Orange and Emerald Flag VULs [Vulnerability Periods] for about an hour via a system under test,” Major Brandon “Siphon” Burfeind, the Orange Flag Director, told The War Zone during an exclusive interview. An F-35A prepares to taxi out at Edwards AFB for Orange Flag., USAF/Chad Bellay Orange Flag 21-2 hosted by the Air Force Test Center’s 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 2021, linked-up with its sister Emerald Flag event at Eglin AFB, in Florida, over 2,000 miles away. The combination was designed to prove long-range data linking and targeting capabilities. In addition, the Air Force Vanguard program Skyborg was included in the action, flying aboard a General Atomics Avenger as part of Orange Flag over the California desert. Explaining more about the long-range link-up, Burfiend added: “It’s a U.S. Army long-range fires capability and network they use to connect various components that was able to connect the two VULs. Bottom line is we had a Link 16 data link picture spread across both Orange and Emerald Flag.” “That single LInk 16 picture means that somebody flying in the Eglin range, if they can zoom out far enough on their display, could see the entire fight happening in the southwestern United States, and if they had a weapon, they could target off of that information. Let’s be clear, long-range Link-16 is nothing new, but doing it across the Army network is new. These were Army tracks that were then converted to Link 16, so the highlight here is the Integrated Fire Control Network.” Orange Flag 21-2 aimed to provide a large force, multi-domain test environment for the autonomy participants.” The USAF confirmed that it had flown the Skyborg Autonomy Core System aboard a General Atomics MQ-20 Avenger unmanned vehicle during the event. You can read more about Skyborg’s involvement and its coupling with Avenger here . “As the nation’s premier, large force, multi-domain test event, it is critical that we provide the opportunity to test emerging technologies, including autonomy,” said Major Burfeind. The General Atomics Avenger carrying a Legion infra-red search-and-track pod on the wing., USAF The geographically separated combination of the R-2508 range complex in California near Edwards AFB, and the Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range over the Gulf of Mexico for the respective Orange and Emerald Flags was significant. It included testing related to preparation for Project Convergence , the U.S. Army’s contribution to Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2). The Program Executive Office Missiles and Space’s Tactical Systems Integration Lab utilized the Integrated Battle Command System to provide dispersed infrastructure, and this enabled long-range connections between geographically separated large force test events.” You can read all about the Integrated Battle Command System in this past War Zone feature . Capt Samantha “FIGI” Thorn synchronizes efforts between the Skyborg-equipped Avenger and fighter aircraft during Orange Flag 21-2., USAF Emerald Flag is a quarterly event designed to support the rapid experimentation of multi-domain kill web technologies, and it is hosted by the 96th Test Wing at Eglin. Orange Flag is conducted three times annually by the 412th Test Wing. These advanced kill webs are ultimately designed to support mission commanders and assist them with rapidly identifying and selecting options for taskings and to bring effects to bear on targets, bringing together multiple sensors, effectors (everything from missiles to lasers), and support elements across air, land, space, surface, subsurface, and cyber domains and across the different military services. Orange Flag, Emerald Flag, and Black Flag are being combined on an increasing level to work in concert and provide robust environments to assist the advance of the Joint All-Domain Operations and the National Defense Strategy. This supports the testing of JADC2 and the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) to validate new tactics and technologies. The exercises’ are designed to stress systems through combat-relevant testing early in their development cycle. “This isn’t the first time we have linked the R-2508 and Gulf of Mexico range complexes,” Burfeind explained. “However, we like to make the distinction between linking test infrastructure [such as distributed test operations at different locations] and linking a system that is under test. The former relates to control rooms, radios, telemetry streams, that kind of stuff — that’s normal. What is new here is linking the system under test, which in this case is the Integrated Fire Control Network, across this long-range network between two large force test events.” While much of what was linked in this test could not be divulged, Burfeind commented: “This was about track information with varying degrees of quality, to include weapons quality.” An F-16D launches from Edwards AFB for Orange Flag., USAF Explaining the relevance and importance of the linked testing, Burfeind says: “We are in the early stages of building the capability to undertake kill web integration, where there’s kinetic control nodes in the Continental US and personnel at the battlespace edge who are sensing and stuff like that, and we are very concerned about latency. You need to be able to test that, and this gives us a venue where we can test the latency impacted error rate and target location error across long distances.” “This iteration of Orange Flag is a shining example of Test Flag enterprise collaboration. This event incorporated Skyborg experimentation into the combined Orange and Emerald Flag scenario, consistent with our charter to bring next-generation capability at the speed of relevance,” said Maj Gen Christopher Azzano, Air Force Test Center commander. The news release added: “Collaboration among the Test Flag events makes multi-domain test available to participants that require long-range integration or non-geo-centric locality models.” Emerald Flag included air assets from the 40th Flight Test Squadron and the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron. The USAF’s brand-new F-15EX Eagle II also participated to stress its systems in this complex environment. “Being able to take the F-15EX with new software and new sensors and integrate it into a multi-domain atmosphere enabling kill chains is a win,” said Maj Ryan Stec, Emerald Flag air operations officer. “Through the planning and execution process, both developmental and operational tests learned valuable lessons to integrate more efficiently. We want this aircraft ready for the warfighter.” The USAF included its new F-15EX in Emerald Flag., USAF Unrelated to the long-distance linked element of the two events, the addition of Skyborg was one of a range of individual participant objectives. “This was the first known testing of an unmanned vehicle operated autonomously in a large force test event,” said Maj Daniel Prudhomme, Orange Flag Operations Director. Skyborg was flown from the General Atomics facility at El Mirage, near Palmdale, in California. In addition, just about every fighter type in the US inventory, along with a single B-52H and a B-1B were also crammed into the R-2508 complex for the Orange Flag event — so it was a complex air picture. “The big thing for us during our Orange Flag part from a test capability was autonomy,” said Burfeind. “We understand autonomy is a part of the Department of Defense roadmap for combat capability, so as a Test Flag enterprise we must make sure we are ready to force those programs to think about integration early on. Providing these programs opportunities to look at integration regardless of technical readiness level is incredibly important for future value to the warfighter.” “This is a very early iteration of the Skyborg autonomy system, integrated on the MQ-20, and flying in a large force event. It was a success for us because of all the administrative hurdles that it takes to put an autonomous aircraft into an event line an Orange Flag — the team laid the groundwork to now start integrating autonomy early in the lifecycle of a large force event, and we are forcing these autonomy programs to show their cards on how well they integrate with other players, earlier and earlier in their technical readiness level.” Maj Michael “Orbit” Nayak coordinates Orange Flag 21-2 ground assets on an Electronic Combat Range., USAF When it comes to testing actual autonomous behavior, Burfiend says things such as flying around in circles doesn’t require an Orange Flag. “There are certain autonomous things that do require large integration, then there’s the concept of we’re going to build this autonomous craft then it needs to work with everybody else — if it works in a vacuum it’s no use to anyone else. So Orange Flag is where developers — be that the Air Force Research Laboratory or industry — can come to showcase capabilities and ability to integrate. Forcing the developers to think about integration right now is huge and Orange Flag has been a driving voice. The same holds true for programs such as Golden Horde , programs like these are integrating with the traditional elements more and more.” One of the most important nodes in the event was a U-2S “Dragon Lady” carrying its fifth gen-fifth gen communications gateway that enabled the various participants to communicate via Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL) and Multi-Function Advanced Data Link (MADL), which allowed the F-22s and F-35s to join the army network. “As Orange Flag has evolved over the last three years, interoperability is still the main driver here,” said Maj Daniel “Beeper” Prudhomme, the Orange Flag Operations director. “We have multiple tactical data links in play and every domain being used. Interoperability is woven into about 80% of the objectives. There’s lots of sensors out there, various emitters, with targeting and shooting information across so many networks.” F-35s worked with a U-2 during the event to aid data-linked communications with other assets., USAF Orange Flag is at the cutting edge of some of the most impressive emerging technology being fielded by the U.S. military. Linking up two big test events on opposite sides of the continent provided a unique ability to jointly execute long-range targeting, stress-test advanced new battle networks, and evolve major emerging capabilities for the USAF. Maturing and developing battle management technology and long-range kill webs are the linchpins to projects such as the emerging nuclear Long-Range Stand-Off (LRSO) missile for the B-52. The next Orange Flag is scheduled for October 2021 and it will again occur in the R-2508 range complex, with further collaboration with Black Flag in the Nevada Test and Training Range suggesting an operational test slant for this iteration and more end-user focus. The USAF says that in this iteration the material solutions will start to blur with the tactics to be employed, a fundamental step towards bringing these innovative warfighting technologies to fruition.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An A-10C Warthog ground-attack aircraft has emerged in a striking black and dark gray paint job. The scheme on the jet, assigned to the Indiana Air National Guard’s 122nd Fighter Wing, was created to help mark the 100th anniversary of Indiana National Guard aviation operations. The jet, serial number 80-0244, also retains the distinctive snakehead nose art found on all A-10Cs that belong to the 122nd Fighter Wing, which is nicknamed the Blacksnakes. The complete scheme also has a number of other symbolic touches. The A-10C Warthog assigned to the 122nd Fighter Wing in its special anniversary paint scheme., Indiana ANG What follows is a full description of the scheme from an official news item published today: The paint scheme on the A-10 is a mixture of black and dark grey with colors breaking along standard A-10 paint lines on the wings, engines and fuselage. The nose of the aircraft is wreathed with a distinctive 122nd FW green eyed snake, complete with fangs, surrounding the aircraft’s 30mm rotary cannon . One side of the aircraft has a 122nd FW tail flash with the text, “Fort Wayne” embossed in yellow over Indiana state-flag-blue background. The opposite tail flash shows a “Racers” checkered flag with the text “Terre Haute” of the disbanded 181st Fighter Wing, now the 181st intelligence Wing. The distinctive A-10 twin engines are embossed with an Indiana ANG centennial logo displaying the text “Indiana Air National Guard” under a large number “100,” along with the years “1921-2021.” … Editor’s note: For our readers who are aviation modelers or enthusiast, the two-tone colors on the centennial Indiana ANG A-10 are grey 118 and black 038. Indiana ANG Indiana ANG Indiana ANG Air National Guard Paint Facility technician, Paul Grigsby cleans up stenciling on the nose of a U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II while in the paint booth at the Sioux City, Iowa based Air National Guard Paint Facility on June 29, 2021. , Indiana ANG Indiana ANG Indiana ANG Indiana ANG Indiana ANG Indiana ANG Indiana ANG Indiana ANG This scheme is very different from other commemorative paint jobs that have been applied to A-10s in the past, most of which are at least based on historical camouflage schemes . For instance, earlier this year, the U.S. Air Force’s Warthog Demonstration Team received a jet sporting a version of the iconic Southeast Asia camouflage pattern that is most closely associated with the service’s operations during the Vietnam War. The anniversary paint job on the 122nd’s A-10C is closer to a special snake-inspired scheme applied to an F-16C Viper fighter jet assigned to the Viper Demonstration Team last year. The F-16C assigned to the Viper Demonstration Team with its snake-inspired paint scheme., USAF The Indiana Air National Guard traces its history back to the establishment of the 137th Observation Squadron in 1921, which was equipped at the time with Curtiss JN-4 Jenny biplanes . The 122nd Fighter Wing specifically traces its roots back to the U.S. Army Air Force’s 358th Fighter Group, which stood up in January 1943. That unit trained on P-40 Warhawk piston fighters before moving to England to join the Allied air war in Europe during World War II, where it was equipped with P-47D Thunderbolts . After World War II, various predecessor units to the current 122nd Fighter Wing operated a succession of piston and then jet-engined fighter aircraft, including the F-51D Mustang , F-84F Thunderstreak , F-4C and F-4E Phantom IIs , and F-16C Vipers . In 2009, the Wing transitioned to an A-10C unit. The official news story about this newly painted A-10 also included the history of how the Wing gained its nickname, which is as follows: Master Sgt. William Hopper, 122nd Fighter Wing Public Affairs Superintendent, said the 122nd adopted the Blacksnake moniker from Revolutionary War figure Anthony Wayne who is also the namesake of the city of Fort Wayne. Also known as “Mad” Anthony Wayne, Native Americans gave Wayne the title “Black Snake.” Wayne was known for a methodical fighting style where he instructed his soldiers to lie in wait for the right moment to strike, similar to the actions of a North American Black Snake. “The Blacksnakes are proud of the names historical significance and connection it gives us to our local community and home town of Fort Wayne,” said Hopper. Today, the Indiana Air National Guard consists of the 122nd Fighter Wing and the 181st Intelligence Wing, and its days of flying the A-10 may now be numbered. In its latest budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year, the Air Force has once again proposed trimming the overall Warthog fleet , with the 122nd being one of the units that would be cut under the plan. If Congress approves the proposal, something legislators have repeatedly blocked in the past, a total of 42 A-10s would head into retirement in the coming fiscal year. The Air Force is also looking to further consolidate Warthog operations at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, which is already a major hub for the type. If the 122nd Fighter Wing is indeed about to lose its Warthogs, it certainly couldn’t have picked a better way to go out on top than this awesome black-and-gray paint scheme—probably our favorite ever.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Watch A Russian Tu-95MS Bear Bomber Unleash Its Cold War-Era Tail Guns,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense’s latest video presenting its now-regular long-range bomber drills includes a relatively rare in-action view of the tail guns of the Tupolev Tu-95MS Bear-H spitting out 23mm rounds. The Tu-95MS — which, despite its antiquated looks, is actually a good deal younger than the U.S. Air Force’s B-52H — is one of very few frontline aircraft still equipped with a tail gunner’s position, something you can read about in detail here . The video, which appeared recently on the Russian Ministry of Defense’s YouTube channel, shows Tu-160 Blackjack and Tu-95MS strategic missile carriers, during the course of drills in which they practiced launched cruise missiles against ground targets on a range in the Arctic, and which were scheduled to end today. So far, however, there has been no evidence of any live cruise missile launches, with the only visible weapons employment relating to the Bear’s tail guns. A Tu-95MS unleashes 23mm cannon fire from its tail turret., Youtube Screencap/Russian Ministry of Defense According to the defense ministry, at least some of the bombers seen in this video took off from an airfield in the Saratov region, in southwest Russia, and flew more than 2,400 miles, aided by aerial refueling. “In addition, in the Irkutsk region, the crews of the Tu-95MS of the Amur Long-Range Aviation formation practiced firing from the tail aircraft cannons,” the ministry explained. The accompanying video shows several bursts fired from a Bear’s tail turret, but it’s not clear what, if any targets, are being engaged. The official statement suggests that this particular Tu-95MS was from Ukrainka Air Base, in the Amur region in the Russian Far East. This is a major strategic aviation hub with almost 40 individual revetments for three squadrons of Bear-Hs. While the Tu-95MS is undergoing a process of modernization and is adding advanced weapons including low-observable subsonic cruise missiles , with both nuclear and conventional warheads, the tail turret is, admittedly, a throwback to the aircraft’s original design origins in the 1950s.

The tail gunner, however, is provided with a separate rear compartment from which they operate the 23mm cannons that provide a degree of defense from the rear aspect. The 9A-503M tail turret has powered controls and can be aimed using a Krypton radar sight, known to NATO by the reporting name Box Tail. The Tu-95MS seen in the video appears to be armed with the older AM-23 single-barrel guns , which were fitted in early Bear-H aircraft. Later aircraft were equipped with two twin-barrel 23mm GSh-23 cannons instead. The same GSh-23 defensive tail turrets are found on the Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bomber and the Il-76 Candid transport aircraft, too. Russian Aerospace Forces Il-76 transports practice dropping bombs and strafing with their tail turrets: The ancestor of today’s Tu-95MS, the original Tu-95 first flew in November 1952, at a time when defensive armament for heavy bombers was still commonplace, in the Soviet Union as well as in the United States. By the time the Tu-95MS began to be manufactured in 1981, the aircraft has assumed a new role as a launch platform for long-range cruise missiles , and advances in surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles meant that gun armament was of far more limited value. A Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-95MS, with the tail gunner and their gun turret clearly visible., Alex Beltyukov/Wikimedia Commons Nevertheless, the Tu-95MS retained the tail guns, as did its U.S. counterpart at that time, the B-52H, which had a single 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon plus a radar. The American bomber differed, however, in relocating the gunner to the main cabin, while the gunner in the Tu-95MS remains in their lonely outpost in the tail. A B-52H bomber with its tail gun still installed., U.S. Air Force During the Cold War, the tail gunner was often the crew member who saw the most of the various aircraft sent to intercept the Bear flights, and there was no shortage of interaction between tail gunner and fighter pilots, including mutual photography, especially vital to identify any potential changes in aircraft equipment or configuration. Sometimes this even developed into a good-humored rapport , including crews showing each other copies of Playboy magazine, or raising bottles of vodka.

Meanwhile, the Tu-95MS today relies primarily on electronic countermeasures and chaff to deceive enemy radars, as well as infrared flares to spoof heat-seeking missiles. The Meteor-NM self-defense system on the Tu-95MS includes radar warning receivers, infrared missile launch-and-approach sensors, as well as active radar jammers. The countermeasures dispensers are located in the huge undercarriage fairings on the wings. The later tail gun configuration on the Tu-95MS, with two twin-barrel GSh-23 cannons., Зимин Василий/Wikimedia Commons It’s probable, too, that the Bear’s guns are also used to fire countermeasures, in the form of radar and thermal decoy rounds. These are known to be part of the ammunition for the remotely controlled tail guns in the Tu-22M3, for example. Ultimately, the value of tail guns firing conventional ammunition is highly questionable for any of the kinds of combat missions the Tu-95MS is likely to undertake. On the other hand, the fact that crews are still training to use all functions of the Bear-H points to the increasingly high levels of readiness that Russia now demands of its strategic bomber force.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Images shared online by the United States Marine Corps this week show Marines conducting training exercises with the Drone40 , a miniaturized, low-cost, expendable drone that can be deployed by hand or launched from a 40mm grenade launcher. While other nations have deployed the Drone40 in overseas operations, this is the first time U.S. troops have been seen training with the versatile, potentially game-changing unmanned systems, which can carry a wide variety of payloads, including various sensors or small high-explosive warheads. The Drone40 tests were conducted by the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, part of the 2nd Marine Division, and took place at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina on July 7, 2021. According to the captions accompanying the pictures shared by the USMC , this unit is an “experimental infantry battalion to test new gear, operating concepts and force structures.” A U.S. Marine retrieves a Drone-40 during a training exercise at Camp Lejeune, N.C., USMC/Pfc. Sarah Pysher The Drone40 was previously deployed earlier this year by British Army forces carrying out peacekeeping missions in the northwest African country of Mali. As we noted at the time , the Drone40 could fit inside launchers designed to fire 40mm rounds, such as variants of the Heckler & Koch AG36 under-barrel grenade launcher, used by both U.K. and U.S. forces , among others. So far, the British forces that brought the drones to Mali have used only hand-launched versions configured for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The Drone40 is manufactured by Australian defense contractor DefendTex , who claim the tiny unmanned quadcopter can be equipped with a wide variety of payloads including full-motion electro-optical video cameras, electronic warfare systems, and laser designators, as well as smoke or flash-producing systems. The Drone40 can even be configured to carry small high-explosive or armor-piercing warheads. The drones measure just seven inches in length and weigh under half a pound. Multiple Drone40s can operate together as a swarm after launch, or even network together with other UAS platforms to operate as a heterogenous swarm. Aside from being deployed by hand or from grenade launchers, a video on DefendTex’s website shows the drones operating in a launch-on-demand swarming mode after taking off from tubes placed on the ground. The drones are reusable when employed in a way that doesn’t result in their destruction, and DefendTex even says they are waterproof, which could make them suitable for recovery when used in missions at sea or in bad weather. A fact sheet from the DefendTex website states that the drones’ targeting and control functions can be accomplished via “integration with existing deployed smart devices using readily available communications technology” and an encrypted radio datalink to a portable ground control station. In addition, the Drone40 boasts a GPS-based autopilot system. The official product sheet for the Drone40., DefendTex The claimed wide-ranging payload options mean the Drone40 can fit into many different roles. Units could launch the drones from behind cover to surveil enemy positions or even carry out attacks from above directly when fitted with the small warheads. The laser designator versions could paint targets that could be engaged by precision-guided munitions. The smoke payload could be used to shield friendly forces’ movements, while the one designed to produce a bright flash could turn the drone into a very flexible less-than-lethal weapon. The drones’ manufacturer even claims that the Drone40’s swarming capabilities could enable what is called “multiple round simultaneous impact,” or MSRI. This means a single soldier could launch two or more drones with explosive warheads that would then loiter in the air until being order to swoop down on multiple targets a the same time. If multiple-warhead types were deployed in a single salvo, a relatively small force of Drone40-equipped units could engage complex and dispersed targets simultaneously, such as armored vehicles and the troops standing in the open beside them. A U.S. Marine training with a Drone40., USMC/Pfc. Sarah Pysher While we’ve only seen the Marines employing these in a handheld mode so far, they could certainly take advantage of the grenade launched mode, as well. The USMC announced in 2019 that it would transition from the M203 grenade launcher to the M320, which offers greater range and accuracy . In addition, unlike the Army, the Marines also field the six-round M32A1 . While it’s not clear whether or not the Drone40 is compatible with the M32A1, it would certainly be an impressive combination if it was. The captions that accompanied the new images of Marines testing the Drone40 state that the 2nd Marine Division’s mission is to “refine infantry battalions across the Marine Corps in accordance with Force Design 2030.” In a 2021 annual report , General David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps, wrote that Force Design 2030 is a modernization effort that helps the Marines prepare to “better fulfill our role as the nation’s naval expeditionary force-in-readiness.” Last year’s Force Design 2030 report states that “the Marine Corps requires a family of UAS capabilities” and must “transition from our current UAS platforms to capabilities that can operate from ship, from shore, and able to employ both collection and lethal payloads.” The Drone40 seems like it could fit into this goal, as it boasts a flight time of 30 to 60 minutes, a range of 12 miles, and can carry both types of payloads specified in the 2020 Force Design 2030 white paper. A Drone40 carried by a British soldier., Crown Copyright The Marine Corps has tested a wide variety of UAVs in recent years including man-portable suicide drones and the MartinUAV V-Bat . The Drone40 is somewhat different, though, in that its tiny size makes it far more portable and versatile than these other, larger models. Diminutive, hand-launched drones similar to the Drone40 are currently operated by the U.S. Army, such as the tiny Black Hornet. You can read more about the Black Hornet, which is now being deployed by almost 20 different countries, in this past War Zone piece . The Marines have also been eager to push small UASs all the way down to the squad level for years now, and the Drone40 could be perfectly suited to fit that role. Small tactical drones “organic to tactical maneuver units, generally at the battalion level and below provide battlespace awareness and target development in support of squads, platoons, companies, battalions and Marine Special Operations Teams and Companies,” Marine Corps Combat Development Command/Combat Development & Integration said in 2019 . The Drone40 is yet another example of how small drones and other unmanned assets are becoming integrated into battlefield operations around the world at even the lowest operational levels. Tactical, versatile drones launched by individual soldiers could be transformational in terms of how America’s expeditionary forces conduct warfare, allowing small units to carry out attacks that would previously require a wide variety of assets including air support.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. NASA says that its experimental X-56B unmanned aircraft suffered what it described as an “anomaly” today. The current state of the drone, as well as whether it technically crashed, is unclear, but an additional statement that “there are no casualties,” which seems slightly cryptic when discussing a drone and could suggest a hard impact into the ground. The incident occurred around 7:30 AM local time at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center, which is collocated with the U.S. Air Force’s Edwards Air Force Base in California. The drone had just taken off when the unspecified fault emerged. “The investigation is underway and further details will be provided when available,” an official statement from officials at Armstrong said. NASA only recently began a new flight test series with the X-56B, in cooperation with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Northrop Grumman, in April. It’s unclear what the objectives of this testing were. The X-56B, which has a blended wing body planform and is powered by two small turbojets, is a conversion of an earlier X-56A, which retains the “centerbody” from the original drone, according to NASA. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced design division originally built two X-56As for the Air Force, with the first flying in 2013. A rear view of the X-56B, showing its centerbody, which was retained during the conversion process from its original X-56A configuration., NASA Those drones, also referred to as Multi-Utility Technology Testbeds (MUTT), were initially used in the research and development of technologies relevant to the design of high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft, including features to mitigate destructive “flutter” vibrations. One of these unmanned aircraft subsequently crashed in 2015 during a test of the design’s flutter-suppressing wings, which were designed to be extremely thin, lightweight, and flexible. The first X-56A makes its maiden flight in 2013., USAF NASA was also involved in this research and subsequently took over full responsibility for the program, which officially ended in 2019. In addition to exploring ways to suppress flutter, the “X-56A team also facilitated the development of tools and technologies and acquired data to validate modeling techniques,” according to NASA. It’s not clear what will happen to the X-56B flight test program now, but its future will almost certainly depend on how much damage the drone suffered in the incident today. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 11, 2021",China Tested An AI-Controlled Submarine-Hunting Underwater Drone A Decade Ago: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report claims that China has, apparently for decades now, been working on underwater drones able to autonomously identify and attack hostile submarines. The once-secret unmanned underwater vehicle , or UUV, may already have been tested in the strategically vital Taiwan Strait , back in 2010. These revelations come from a military-funded research program that was partly declassified last week, according to the South China Morning Post , or SCMP, a Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper. The UUV in question is said to be able to “recognize, follow and attack an enemy submarine without human instruction,” and was developed by the Harbin Engineering University, which SCMP described as Beijing’s “top submarine research institute.” A Chinese HSU-001 unmanned underwater vehicle. No details have been released about the particular underwater drone used in the reported 2010 trial., IMAGINECHINA VIA AP IMAGES The same article also raises the possibility of “a variant of the sub [that] could be planted on sea floors and activated in the event of a clash or war.” The concept, as reportedly outlined by Guolong and his colleagues, seems to be based around using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to better identify and track submerged targets, promising results better than human sonar operators, for example. “ Sonar operators still need to use their eyes and ears to make judgments on important issues such as identifying friendly vessels, with final decisions taken by the captain,” the article asserts. Nevertheless, there are no details given in the SCMP article about how exactly the UUV would identity and classify underwater targets, after having acquired them using sonar, or about how it is powered and what kind of performance it might offer. Meanwhile, although it is suggested that the 2010 test took place in the Taiwan Strait, this also can’t be confirmed at this point. SCMP claims that “partial coordinates from a map in their paper” indicate that the trial was undertaken “off the coast of the eastern province of Fujian, in or near the Taiwan Strait.” Harbin Engineering University In this test, it’s claimed that the UUV patrolled at a depth of around 30 feet, along a predetermined route and then used onboard “sonars” to detect a target craft that was replicating the noise signature of a submarine. The UUV then “circled in a hexagonal pattern and pointed its sonar arrays to various sources of sound, while artificial intelligence tried to filter out ambient noise and determine the nature of the target.” An unarmed torpedo was reportedly then fired by the UUV toward the simulated submarine. While the size and type of the torpedo are not stated, if this was a conventionally sized weapon of this type, that would suggest a large-size underwater drone, similar perhaps to the American Orca extra-large unmanned underwater vehicle (XLUUV) that’s now under development. In its initial form, however, the 51-foot Orca will be unarmed. The Boeing-developed Orca UUV for the U.S. Navy., Boeing China also has its own very rough equivalent to the Orca, known as the HSU-001 , although this was only identified in 2019 , nearly a decade after the supposed UUV test. Alternatively, mention of a torpedo could suggest the development of a smaller torpedo, another area of interest for navies around the world right now. China has been actively working on other kinds of UUVs, as well, with various examples of ocean glider-type unmanned undersea vehicles having been found in the waters of the Asia-Pacific region in recent years . The exact purpose of these is unknown, but there has been speculation that Beijing has been using them to conduct underwater surveys of routes between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean , information that could be especially useful for its submarines transiting through these areas while submerged. A presumed Chinese ocean glider-type drone discovered by Indonesian fishermen last December., VIA TWITTER While SCMP states that “it is unclear why China has now declassified details of the test,” the same source does point to a recent spike in tensions between authorities in Beijing and those on the island of Taiwan, suggesting this may have prompted the reported partial declassification. Professor Liang Guolong from the Harbin Engineering University is quoted by SCMP as explaining that these UUVs are currently working mainly individually, but that they could, in the future, operate as underwaters swarms. However, the lack of detail in the SCMP story has led to some observers questioning the accuracy of the report and even the veracity of the original declassified paper, which is said to have appeared in the Journal of Harbin Engineering University . In a piece for Forbes , David Hambling , suggests that it’s unlikely that an academic institute such as Harbin Engineering University would be handling a weapon — even if unarmed — as part of early development tests and suggests the launch of the torpedo may have been entirely simulated. However, Harbin Engineering University is a government-controlled institution with long-standing ties to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) dating back to its founding in 1953 as the PLA Military Engineering Institute. Beyond that, in general, it’s not uncommon for ostensibly civilian research institutions in China to take part in work that could at least have potential military applications , if it is not being done for the military outright. As already noted, SCMP’s report says that this test was sponsored by the PLA. A Chinese Yu-6 torpedo., Chinese Internet Undoubtedly, however, SCMP has, in the past, published stories of extraordinary-sounding Chinese military technology that has not actually materialized. Hambling points to weather-modifying radar and a laser assault rifle as examples of this phenomenon. The War Zone also took issue with the latter report when it first emerged. Like these, the AI-driven underwater drone could have some basis in scientific research, but might not be a genuine piece of hardware. On the other hand, though, China is clearly busy with a range of high-tech activities in the underwater military domain and UUVs, in particular , are an area of interest. Guolong himself, as Hambling observes, has also previously conducted research into sonar intended for UUVs, although the example of a paper he highlights is a more recent, tangential study that describes similar, but far less impressive capabilities. An old, but nonetheless interesting U.S. Navy graphic showing possible payloads for underwater drones, including weapons., U.S. Navy Finally, Hambling notes that the purported research paper is not currently listed on the Journal of Harbin Engineering University website, making it impossible, for the time being, to compare the SCMP claims to the team’s original findings. However, if this study was classified, then it might still not be included in those lists, and we still don’t know for sure where SCMP obtained the purported study from. As for the specific technological claims made, some of the capabilities attributed to the AI-driven, torpedo-armed UUV already exist in other underwater applications. The U.S. Navy, for example, is already working on an air-dropped mine, called Hammerhead , which is intended to lie in wait for months at a time after being deployed before autonomously engaging a target, with the help of sonar and a torpedo payload . The Chinese UUV, as described, would offer additional capabilities, of course, being able to move around as well as patrol certain areas of interest. A graphic showing the internal configuration of the Hammerhead for the U.S. Navy and the components it will leverage from the earlier Mk 60 CAPTOR mine., U.S. Navy The United States, at least, is also working on apparently parallel technologies to the Chinese UUV. Under a program known as CLAWS , the U.S. Navy is looking to “develop an autonomous unmanned undersea weapon system capable of providing offensive effects to the Combatant Commanders beyond Phase 0 inside the first island chain ,” according to the service’s 2021 Fiscal Year Budget request said. “It will clandestinely extend the reach of large UUVs and increase the mission areas into kinetic effects,” the report adds. It’s almost certainly right to urge caution about the specifics of the SCMP story, and China’s potential to have fielded, back in 2010, the kinds of capabilities apparently promised in the elusive academic paper. However, it’s just as important to note that underwater drones of this kind are, at least today, within reach of China and other major powers. UUVs are already proliferating and, as they grow in size and scope, they will add more complex and capable sonar, AI brains, communications links, and other technologies that will allow them to better monitor enemy submarine movements and attack them if required. If this report is to be believed and China was doing this over a decade ago, we can only imagine what they have now.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Presidential Presser Cut Short After Typhoon Jets Have To Scramble To Intercept Russian Planes (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A visit to a Lithuanian airbase by Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda was all set to include the two leaders speaking to the press in front of a Spanish Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon jet, deployed to the country on a rotational NATO air policing mission. However, in an impromptu demonstration of the air alert facility’s readiness, Nauseda had to break off his address as the jet was prepared to scramble to intercept Russian aircraft approaching NATO’s Baltic territories. The press conference was taking place at Šiauliai Air Base, Lithuania, earlier today, as part of the Spanish leader’s three-day visit to the Baltic states, including checking in on the Spanish armed forces contingent deployed as part of the NATO mission to help defend these countries. While Nauseda was speaking in a hangar at Šiauliai, a pilot could be seen racing up the ladder into the Typhoon in the background, while technicians prepared the jet for action. An advisor then explained that a live scramble had begun and the officials and their lecterns began to be moved out of the way to let the jet depart the hangar. A Spanish Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon over the Baltic region., Spanish Air Force/Geert Vandeput According to Spanish newspaper El Pais , citing unnamed Spanish government sources, the incident was a live, or Alpha, scramble, rather than a training scenario. Two Spanish Typhoons were scrambled, as is the normal procedure, to respond to at least one unidentified Russian aircraft. The fighters taking part in the Baltic Air Policing (BAP) mission routinely intercept Russian military aircraft, to ensure they don’t enter the national airspace of the Baltic states. BAP guidelines state that the NATO fighters, which carry live weapons, have to be airborne within 15 minutes of the alert. The original planning for the day’s events had included a practice, or Tango scramble, after the leaders’ address, but it seems that wasn’t required. El Pais reported that unnamed military sources “assume that Russia intentionally raised the alert for the visit of the Spanish leader,” especially since there had been no previous such incidents in the previous 18 days. “Alliance sources believe that it is not by chance that [the alert] occurred during the appearance of Sánchez and the Lithuanian president,” the newspaper added. However, Russian military aircraft activity in the Baltic, and especially between the exclave of Kaliningrad and Russia itself is by no means uncommon. The press conference reportedly resumed 25 minutes in an empty hangar after the Spanish jets had departed for the live scramble. The Spanish prime minister took the opportunity to point to the latest alert incident to show “the importance of our presence here.” Similar sentiments were echoed on Twitter by Nauseda, although it should be noted that there is no indication that the Russian aircraft violated NATO airspace at any point. What is unclear, however, is why the presidential press conference was scheduled to take place in a hangar in front of an alert jet in the first place. Even if this particular Typhoon was not a primary-assigned alert jet, and had to be used as a backup, there seems to have been some kind of oversight in the planning. In the past, at least some BAP alert jets have been kept in a high-security, sanitized area. Although it appears the jets were able to scramble without problem today, Russia, deliberately or otherwise, still managed to effectively upend a high-level press conference. The fact that an Alpha scramble might occur during the event would likely have been a consideration, at least. After all, the number of NATO scrambles Europe-wide has been on the increase. Across the continent last year there were more than 400 scrambles, around 350 of which were in response to flights by Russian military aircraft. This was a moderate increase compared to 2019, according to NATO . The Baltic, in particular, has long been a hotbed of this kind of activity . A Spanish Typhoon is loaded with missile armament while on a BAP deployment., Spanish Air Force Currently, around 140 personnel from the Spanish military are at Šiauliai for the BAP mission. The Spanish Air Force, or Ejército del Aire, has been providing the latest BAP rotation at the Lithuanian base since April 30, while an Italian Air Force F-35A contingent is meanwhile making its debut appearance at Ämari in Estonia. These are currently augmented by a detachment of Turkish Air Force F-16s at Malbork in Poland. To date, Spain has been one of the active contributors to BAP, with eight of these deployments to the Baltic since 2006. As well as Typhoons, Spain has also sent Mirage F1M and EF-18 Hornet fighters to the region. A Spanish Air Force Typhoon scrambles during a previous Baltic Air Policing rotation., Spanish Air Force During the 2018 deployment, the Spanish Typhoons made headlines after an AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM was accidentally fired by one of the jets, around 50 miles west of the country’s border with Russia. That incident was later attributed to pilot error . The video below shows Spanish Typhoons during the Baltic Air Policing mission in 2016: Typically, around four fighters are deployed to each BAP base, although the current Spanish contingent in Lithuania, known as Vilkas 2021, is larger than usual, with seven jets, although only four of these have been transferred to the NATO chain of command, the remainder presumably available as spares or for unrelated training sorties. The BAP mission has been carried out since Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia joined NATO in 2004, as none of these countries have their own fighter jets. Different NATO rotations provide the Baltic states with the ability to monitor and control their airspace, conducting quick reaction alert (QRA) missions on their behalf. Most real-world missions involve intercepting and identifying Russian military aircraft that do not comply with international flight regulations, for example flying without transmitting a transponder code to indicate their position and altitude, lack of a proper flight plan, or failure to communicate with air traffic controllers. All of these pose a potential risk to civilian airliners. In the meantime, it’s very likely that encounters between Russia and NATO in the Baltic region will continue in the days to come, with preparations now well underway for the Navy Day parade in St. Petersburg later this month, which is expected to feature at least three nuclear-powered Russian Navy submarines. Of these, the Borei-A class ballistic missile submarine Knyaz Vladimir and the Oscar II class cruise missile submarine Orel have already entered the Baltic. Also awaited is the Akula II class nuclear-powered attack submarine Vepr . It’s unclear whether Russia really launched aircraft into the area in order to disrupt the Spanish-Lithuanian meeting today, as has been alleged. However, if that was the intention, the rapid and very public response by the Spanish Air Force contingent shows that the BAP mission continues to work just as advertised — providing 24/7 airspace coverage to the three Baltic states. In the future, however, we might expect to see any press conferences taking place a little further away from the alert jets. Update, July 9: NATO and the Russian media have confirmed that the aircraft the Spanish Typhoons were scrambled to investigate yesterday comprised a pair of Russian Naval Aviation Su-24 Fencer jets. Russian state news agency TASS reports that two Su-24s were conducting a scheduled training flight over the Baltic Sea. Russian defense officials stressed that “the flight was carried out in strict accordance with international rules for the use of airspace, without violating the borders of other states.” A NATO official speaking anonymously to Associated Press confirmed that the aircraft investigated by the Typhoons were two Russian Su-24s heading northeast. “Those two Russian jets did not file a flight plan, did not have their flight transponder on, or talk to traffic controllers,” the official added. Meanwhile, NATO Air Command tweeted that “the Russian aircraft did not follow internationally recognized flight regulations,” and provided two photos of Russian Naval Aviation Su-24s, at least one of which is a Su-24MR Fencer-E reconnaissance version. It’s not clear if these are file photos or whether they were taken during yesterday’s mission. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Fighters Typhoon"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 22, 2021",Marines Had An “Aircraft Carrier On Land” With Catapults And Arresting Gear In Vietnam,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During the long conflict in Southeast Asia , U.S. Marines Corps jets regularly flew from bases on land in direct support of troops on the ground. However, only one of the airbases that the service operated from in South Vietnam was actually outfitted with arrester wires and even catapult launch gear. This was at Chu Lai, where the Marines built themselves what was basically a land-based “aircraft carrier” that was utilized by A-4 Skyhawk light attack jets and, later, F-4 Phantom II fighters. The story of Chu Lai Air Base is inseparable from that of the A-4’s service during the Vietnam War, where it was, quite rightly, recognized as one of the signature aircraft of the conflict. U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Skyhawks bore a significant brunt of the air war for the first half of the conflict. In the process, pilots routinely flew into harm’s way on unglamorous missions, and the A-4 eventually accounted for more than a third of all Navy fixed-wing combat losses—Marine attrition rates were similar. An A-4C from VMA-225 makes what is purportedly the first landing at Chu Lai, on June 1, 1965., U.S. Navy While Navy A-4s had been operating in Southeast Asia ever since 1964, when the Gulf of Tonkin incident led to more direct U.S. engagement in the conflict, Marine Skyhawks arrived later on the scene, as the ground war was becoming more intense. The Corps F-4 Phantom IIs, as well as RF-8 Crusader reconnaissance jets and EF-10 Skyknight electronic warfare aircraft, were already operating from Da Nang Air Base in South Vietnam when the service elected to throw its A-4s into the fray. However, with Da Nang’s capacity to support additional aircraft increasingly stretched to the limit, the decision was made to set up a new airbase from scratch. This was Chu Lai, located on the coast, around 55 miles south of Da Nang. It would be a Marine-led effort that included the installation of a Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) system, which would launch jets via a trackless catapult and recover them using aircraft carrier-style arresting gear. Unlike a catapult found on an aircraft carrier, which runs down a trackway recessed in the deck, the trackless version was based on a wheeled dolly and a cable-tow driven by a capstan, powered in turn by turbine engines. 1st Lieutenant Conrad “Ham” Hamilton in the cockpit of an A-4 after the 1,000th mobile arresting gear landing at Chu Lai Air Base., CENTCOM/Rich Lee The entire arrangement would enable aircraft to get into the air and land back at the base without the need for a lengthy, traditional runway. This would also help address the performance limitations that came from the hot and humid conditions. As well as extra capacity, the new base would bring airpower closer to where it was needed, reducing flying time to targets, as well. Work on the land-based catapult as a part of the SATS system been launched more than 10 years previously, inspired at least in part by experiences in the Korea War, when pierced steel matting had been laid to form extemporized airstrips close to the troops. By the early 1960s, there were experimental SATS sites at Bogue Field, North Carolina, and Quantico , Virginia. At one stage it was planned for SATS to accept a range of carrier-capable naval aircraft, including the A-6 Intruder , F-4 Phantom II, F-8 Crusader, and even the ultimately abortive F-111B . Testing the CE-2 trackless aircraft launcher as part of the SATS system at Quantico, in 1963: However, Chu Lai seems to have been the only facility in which SATS was used operationally and the task of building the new base fell upon the Seabees , the Navy’s Construction Battalions. Working in temperatures of 100 degrees or more, the Seabees laid a runway made of AM-2 aluminum planks — roughly 1.4 million square feet in all — soon nicknamed “the tinfoil airstrip.” AM-2 aluminum planks are unloaded for onward transit to Chu Lai, May 1965., National Archives By the end of May 1965, taxiways, a parking ramp, and arrester gear had also been built at Chu Lai. The catapult arrived sometime later. All this was constructed in an area that was not only unstable but also prone to becoming seriously waterlogged after heavy rain. The basic SATS concept envisaged a rapidly established airfield with a runway that was 2,000 to 3,000 feet long and 72 feet wide. But since Chu Lai was expected to be in use for a considerably longer period than a typical expeditionary operation, and host many more aircraft, the design was adapted, with a planned length of 8,000 feet and width of 107 feet. Initially, however, only 4,000 feet was actually completed, while work continued to stabilize the ground below the other half. Thereafter, constant attention was required to keep the runway planking from sinking into the mud. Later on, Chu Lai also got its own conventional runway , located in parallel to the SATS airstrip. An A-4E from VMA-121 lands at Chu Lai, using an arrester cable, in March 1967., U.S. Marine Corps The first jets to arrive at the base were the A-4Cs of Marine Attack Squadron 225 (VMA-225) and the improved A-4Es from VMA-311, both of which touched down on June 1, 1965. Missions began the same day. The E-model Skyhawk featured various improvements compared to the C variant, perhaps most important being five external hardpoints for stores instead of three, allowing a heavier load of weapons to be carried. In Peter Mersky’s authoritative US Navy and Marine Corps A-4 Skyhawk Units of the Vietnam War , former A-4 pilot retired Colonel Ned Carroll recalls what it was like to operate from the tinfoil airstrip in the early days: Because of an engineering fluke, the bed material for the fabricated aluminum panel that made up the expeditionary runway had been laid over what we thought was laterite rock. However, once the monsoon arrived, we quickly learned that what we had presumed to be rock was actually clay! Softened by the heavy rains, the bedding material soon began to shoot out between the planks every time an aircraft passed over them. Deep voids quickly formed, which made takeoffs an adventure, with bumps so bad that eventually bombs were jarred loose and rolled down the runway! These bombs still had safening wires through their fuses, so there was no immediate danger of them exploding. Still, aircraft-bomb collision, with disastrous results, was always possible.” Until the catapult arrived, A-4s were boosted into the air using rocket-assisted take-off (RATO) bottles. Each RATO bottle provided around 3,500 pounds of thrust for five seconds, approximately halving the takeoff run. Even so, the jets had to takeoff with a reduced fuel load, before quickly finding a KC-130 Hercules tanker to take on more gas. Using the RATO gear was also not without its hazards, and pilots had to keep a close eye on the bottles to ensure both had fired properly. If not, and if carrying a heavy load, they would have to eject, since they would likely not make it off the runway. Returning to Chu Lai was a case of lining up to catch the wire of the M-21 arrester gear, located around 1,000 feet further down the runway from the standard touchdown point and which could bring a Skyhawk to a standstill within as little as 250 feet. This was especially useful if the jet was returning to base in a damaged state, providing an extra degree of safety. In the months that followed, Chu Lai’s Skyhawks saw heavy action, flying day and night in support of Marines and South Vietnamese troops sometimes engaged only half-a-dozen miles from the base perimeter. At times, Chu Lai itself came under attack from North Vietnamese forces, and the A-4s were required to defend their own base, which they did successfully. Jets frequently returned to Chu Lai with significant combat damage, while poor weather led to a suspension of flying activity in late November 1965. By this time there were four Skyhawk squadrons at the base, with the addition of VMA-211 and VMA-214, and each unit had a complement of around 20 aircraft. An aerial view of Chu Lai, circa 1965., U.S. Marine Corps Ultimately, four squadrons of A-4s were considered the maximum that Chu Lai could accommodate, but different units were rotated in and out of the base as the demand for close air support continued to grow. The catapult system finally became operational in May 1966 and was powered by a pair of General Electric J79 turbojets (as used in the F-4, among others), providing almost 35,000 horsepower. This could launch A-4s off the runway in either direction and, from a pilot’s perspective, reportedly made operations remarkably similar to flying to and from a real carrier deck. There was even a mirror landing aid to aid their recovery. Once up and running, the catapult could launch a fully armed Skyhawk into the air once every 90 seconds. A mirror landing aid onboard the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne ., Nick Thorne/Wikimedia Commons By the summer of 1966, the A-4 squadrons were reportedly averaging between 600 and 700 combat flying hours a month out of Chu Lai, with the close proximity of the fighting allowing pilots to fly multiple sorties each day. The rotational A-4 squadrons began “hot pad” alerts at the base, with a section of jets standing armed and ready to scramble, engines running and with pilots in the cockpits, should the need arise. A VMA-223 A-4E comes to a halt after an arrested landing at the Chu Lai, circa 1966., U.S. Marine Corps Much heavier and more powerful than the A-4, the Marine Corps F-4 was the other type to make extensive use of the SATS system in an operational capacity. During tests of the catapult , a Skyhawk was found to require 1,165 feet to take off, while a Phantom II needed 1,485 feet. Armed with 12 500-pound bombs, an F-4B from VMFA-323 completed a first catapult shot from Chu Lai in August 1966, but it was not the smoothest start, as the pilot, retired Colonel Robert Jonhson, recalls in Peter E. Davies’ US Marine Corps F-4 Phantom II Units of the Vietnam War : About halfway down the track, the aircraft seemed to lurch to a higher, nose-high attitude, and simultaneously with hitting the end of the catapult track, the starboard engine suffered a catastrophic failure (it exploded). My attention at this time was directed to my immediate front, which consisted of numerous trucks, Marines, and civilians waiting at a checkpoint off the end of the runway. Slowly climbing, I next noticed the base ammunition dump below my flight path. My briefing on emergency jettisoning of external stores did not cover this eventuality, but we were still flying… albeit only briefly. I made a slight turn to the right in the direction of what appeared to be a clear area where we could jettison. As I tried to level the wings the stick bucked and froze in my hand. All I had to say was, ‘Eject, Jim, Eject.’ Jim responded instantly, and after hearing the second explosion, canopy and seat, I followed suit. Out altitude at the time was 100 feet or less. When my seat fired the aircraft was nearly 90 degrees to the horizon. As advertised, seat separation and chute opening occurred automatically, and I got a 90-degree swing in the chute before landing in a the-wire concertina fence. I looked up to see Jim come down in his chute about 30 yards away, The aircraft disintegrated about 50 yards beyond that, but none of the bombs detonated. Colonel Johnson’s cool head saw him get a Distinguished Flying Cross and it was later found that the catapult shuttle had likely been incorrectly attached to the cable, leading to a near-deadly disaster. In October 1966, the runway was extended to 10,000 feet and provided with a concrete surface, as well as parking ramps and taxiways. This made the airbase better suited to the Marine F-4s and the additional ramp space permitted three Phantom squadrons to be operated alongside the A-4s, although facilities on the ground remained basic, with most maintenance conducted in the open air. Chu Lai survived the onslaught of the Tet Offensive that began in January 1968, during which the airstrip came under rocket attack, injuring two and damaging four Skyhawks. However, by September 1970, Chu Lai’s tenure as a Marine airbase had come to an end and it was handed over to the Army as the U.S. began withdrawing combat units. What became of the SATS system is unclear, but the Army would not have had any use for it. Thereafter, the remaining Marine combat squadrons in the country were concentrated at Da Nang. In fact, VMA-311 became the last U.S. combat squadron to leave Vietnam, which it did in January 1973, shortly before the ceasefire came into effect. A bombed-up VMA-121 A-4E at Chu Lai., U.S. Navy The “instant airfield” at Chu Lai was destined to be a one-off, but the lessons of SATS continue to this day, as the Marines continue to work on their Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) concept, a modern approach to bringing tactical airpower to bear anywhere it might be needed. The 2019 Marine Corps Aviation Plan describes the EABO concept as follows: “A future naval operational concept that mitigates peer competitors’ anti-access/area-denial capability by creating a more survivable, resilient, and persistent forward-postured force. The EABO concept is designed to re-establish the force credibility required to have a deterrent effect. Using key maritime terrain in the vicinity of close and confined seas, EABO provides decision-makers with sea denial options that are coercive, but not escalatory.” Paralleling the way the A-4 and F-4 were adapted for land-based “cat and trap” operations, the Marines have been exploring the potential for the F-35C carrier-capable variant to undertake short-field and austere operations . To prepare for real-world EABO scenarios, Marine F-35Cs have been using the M-31 expeditionary arresting gear , permitting operations from smaller runways. Moreover, within the U.S. military right now there is now an increasing focus on rapidly building up austere air bases . In particular, as the Pentagon continues its “pivot” toward the Pacific theater , there is an understanding that a conflict with China would likely see established infrastructure, including traditional airbases, quickly destroyed . In Europe, too, expeditionary base concepts are seen as vital for any conflict with any near-peer threat nation. Meanwhile, although SATS was destined to be something of a footnote to the conflict in Vietnam, the effort to set up an airbase from scratch was indicative of the determined and innovative approach of the Marines in the air war in Southeast Asia.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. NASA is retiring the last Lockheed S-3B Viking still flying today, marking the end of a nearly fifty-year career for the iconic aircraft. While NASA’s Viking was used as a research aircraft, the U.S. Navy’s S-3s saw widespread use throughout the Cold War as anti-submarine warfare aircraft and even as a Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) aircraft, before moving on to serve in other roles, including as aerial refueling tankers and for electronic intelligence gathering. NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, which operates the S-3B in question, today announced its impending retirement, which will follow a final ceremonial flight. “This is the last S-3B flying today anywhere in the world,” said Jim Demers, the Center’s Flight Operations Manager. “It’s been a workhorse for NASA, but we just can’t source its unique parts anymore.” NASA’s S-3B Viking, NASA NASA’s S-3B Viking was reconfigured by the space agency in 2006 in order to support flight research missions. The aircraft’s weapons systems were swapped out for avionics, GPS, and satellite communications systems in order to help NASA research in-flight communications technologies and concepts. According to a NASA press release , one of the aircraft’s most significant contributions was its use in research that led to the development of communications standards used by unmanned aircraft. NASA says the aircraft produced data throughout its career that gave NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and private industry “a path to secure, reliable command-and-control radios used for communication from the ground to unmanned aircraft systems.” Mike Jarrell, head of NASA’s Command and Control project, said NASA’s S-3B has been a “huge part of ushering in the future of aviation,” adding it’s been “a perfect match” for much of his group’s research. “It has a nice flat bottom where we can mount a variety of antenna,” he added. “It flies steady and goes low and slow so we can communicate with ground stations.” The S-3B’s ability to fly at a variety of altitudes also made it perfect for a NASA research mission that saw hyperspectral imaging sensors on the aircraft’s belly and used to measure algae growth in Lake Erie and other bodies of water. Roger Tokars, an elliptical and optics engineer with NASA’s Glenn Research Center, also added that the aircraft’s inertial navigation system helped NASA engineers calibrate their own equipment for obtaining more precise geo-referencing data. With the S-3B headed to retirement, NASA’s research will pivot to using a T-34 Mentor aircraft to help develop new communications standards for recommendation to the Federal Aviation Administration. NASA’s S-3B Viking in flight., NASA In Navy service, the S-3B may have never gotten the attention that more photogenic fighter aircraft tend to receive, but the Viking nevertheless boasted impressive capabilities including 10-hour endurance, excellent fuel efficiency, and ample room for avionics, weapons, and sensors, as well as four crewmen. In addition to specialized anti-submarine warfare gear, the long-range, tactical-sized jet also sported an internal weapons bay, a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor system, an impressive radar, was later wired for a targeting pod, and could act as a tanker. It even had enough internal volume to allow it to operate as a cargo-carrying plane and passenger transport , in its short-lived US-3A configuration. It’s a literal workhorse of an aircraft that the Navy never fully utilized to its potential. As such, prior to the Navy’s retirement of the type from active duty in 2009, the S-3 Viking had a long and storied career in anti-submarine operations and other roles, which you can read about in detail in our exclusive four-part Confessions Of An Ancient Sub Hunter series ( part one , part two , part three , part four ). Lockheed also experimented in the 1970s with converting the S-3 into a dedicated aerial refueling tanker, known as KS-3, by adding a conformal weapons bay fuel tank, wing pylon mounted drop tanks, and a dual internal hose and reel drogue system, all in addition to its standard wing-mounted fuel tank and refueling probe. That plan never came to fruition, meaning the S-3s which served as tankers during the Gulf War and beyond instead used the Airborne Refueling System (ARS), or “buddy refueling system,” which consists of a wing-mounted refueling pod and a hose and drogue system. A Navy S-3B deploying its buddy refueling system, U.S. Navy As already noted, in addition to sub-hunting, the Viking had the ability to engage surface warships, as well as targets on land. On March 25, 2003, a Navy S-3B assigned to Sea Control Squadron 38 (VS-38) took off from the USS Constellation and destroyed a target near Basra, Iraq, with an AGM-65E Maverick surface-to-air missile, marking the “ first overland combat strike by a Viking,” according to the Navy. In one of its more media-worthy moments, an S-3B Viking famously landed aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln carrying President George W. Bush in the co-pilot seat, who had arrived to controversially declare “Mission Accomplished” at the claimed ‘conclusion of major combat’ following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. President George W.

To date, no other country has operated the Viking and none have gone to private operators.

Thus, over 100 S-3s now sit slowly degrading in the desert sun at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base’s Boneyard in Tucson, Arizona. Now that NASA has officially retired its S-3B, the Viking can finally fly off into the sunset. Its last trip will be to the San Diego Air and Space Museum in California, which will bring the operational career of one of the U.S. Navy’s most underappreciated jets to a close for good.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 20, 2021",The B-17 Bomber’s Combat Debut 80 Years Ago Today Was A Fiasco,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The iconic Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress , the aircraft best known for spearheading the U.S. Army Air Forces’ daylight bombing campaign in World War II, first flew into combat 80 years ago today. The bomber’s first operational mission was in British hands and, as the combat report reveals, it was an inauspicious debut. Nevertheless, the U.K. Royal Air Force’s early experiences with the B-17 in the European theater led to various improvements to the aircraft and its tactics and, when the U.S. Army returned the aircraft to action, it would be altogether more successful. Although the B-17 had first flown in 1935, there had only been limited production of the aircraft before the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States’ entry into the war. However, by the spring of 1940, the United Kingdom had been stretched to capacity in its fight with Nazi Germany and the Royal Air Force (RAF) still didn’t have an in-service heavy bomber capable of carrying a significant payload into the Reich. A Fortress Mk I of No. 90 Squadron that was based at West Raynham, Norfolk, in June 1941., Air Ministry At this time, Boeing was building the B-17C model, which had a defensive armament of seven machine guns, a mix of .30 and .50 caliber types, including twin guns mounted in a “bathtub turret” below the fuselage. The definitive B-17G, by contrast, carried no fewer than 13 .50 caliber guns, but, for its time, the B-17C was considered well defended. Self-sealing fuel tanks and defensive armor added to the C-model’s survivability. To help plug its bomber gap, the United Kingdom reached an agreement with the U.S. government in March 1940 to acquire 20 B-17Cs. In return, the British promised to provide the United States with detailed reports of how the bomber fared in combat. The aircraft, which the British designated as Fortress Mk Is, began to arrive in the United Kingdom in early 1941 and were assigned to No. 90 Squadron, based at West Raynham in the east of England. By the time of the B-17’s combat debut, on July 9, 1941, the RAF’s No. 90 Squadron had moved to an airfield at nearby Polebrook. Their first target was Wilhelmshaven, on the German coast, home to an extensive base belonging to the Kriegsmarine, or German Navy, in what the British media at the time described as a “stratosphere raid,” due to the high altitude at which it was flown. The daylight raid was to be flown by three aircraft — referred to as C, G, and H — which would take off at 3:00 PM to attack their primary target of Wilhelmshaven from high altitude. The squadron’s official account of the mission explains what happened next: Aircraft G and C attacked the primary target between 1650 and 1700 hours from 28,000 and 30,000 feet respectively. Aircraft G dropped 4 x 1,100-pound demolition bombs and aircraft C had 2 x 1,100-pound bombs hang up and only two were released. Bombs ‘hanging up’ referred to the weapons remaining suspended in the weapons bay, meaning they would have to be carried back to base. An RAF Fortress Mk I crew embark their aircraft ahead of a mission from Polebrook, Northamptonshire., Air Ministry Two bursts were observed on the target and a stick of four bombs was seen with the first bomb 250 yards west of the Bauhafen [the harbor where warships were constructed] and the others at 150-yard intervals to the southeast. Electrical failure of both cameras prevented photographs from being taken. There was more trouble to come, however, when the Plexiglas “astrodome,” used for celestial navigation , froze up in aircraft G at an altitude of 18,000 feet. The official report says that “fire control” was made “impossible,” as a result, though it’s not clear exactly how the navigation-focused astrodome’s functionality factored into this. A page from the No. 90 Squadron’s Operations Record Book, including the first two B-17 combat missions., National Archives With that in mind, this bomber, in particular, seems to have had a lucky escape, since two enemy aircraft, believed to be Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters were spotted around 2,000 feet below the Fortresses, close to the German-occupied Dutch island of Terschelling. [The fighters] climbed and approached on the starboard beam closing to about 600-800 yards when one of them appeared to go into an involuntary spin and was seen still spinning about 600 feet below. The second aircraft broke off the attack and followed the first one down. No fire was exchanged. Fortress Mk I, AN529, at Heathfield, Scotland, shortly after arriving from the United States. This was aircraft C in the July 8, 1941 raid., Ministry of Aircraft Production As for the third Fortress, aircraft H, it also experienced a technical problem, when it began to lose oil at 28,000 feet and abandoned the primary target, and instead headed for another North Sea island, Nordeney, where it dropped four 1,100-pound bombs from this same height at 4:45 PM. “Bursts were seen on the sand about 500 yards from the town,” but photographs taken of the island failed to show any damage. Aircraft H’s woes were not quite over, however, the combat report explains: Lateral flutter due to oil freezing on the tailplane and building up to about 7 inches thick, and consequent vibration was experienced after bombing. This was eventually overcome by losing height to 15,000 feet at which height the oil thawed and cleared the tailplane. All four airscrews [propellers] were feathered in succession, but this had no apparent effect non the vibration. Despite the ill-starred combat debut, the squadron launched another mission before the end of the month, with another three aircraft flying all the way to Berlin on July 23. Their planned high-altitude attack was frustrated by heavy cloud cover, as well as a thunderstorm and the aircraft were forced to return to base without dropping their bombs. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill observes as a Fortress Mk I is put through its paces., War Office A total of 26 RAF Fortress raids were launched by September 1941, involving 51 individual aircraft sorties, but half of them were aborted, with no weapons delivered. As well as the problems experienced on the first mission, the aircrew encountered problems with the Sperry bombsight and with their defensive guns freezing up. Seven aircraft were lost. The RAF’s initial experience of the Fortress was not a happy one, but the aircraft had, importantly, shown that it had the range to strike the German capital. The British soon decided that the B-17 was not the aircraft for the job of flying daytime bombing missions over Europe, but this had more to do with their own tactics than any major shortcoming in the aircraft itself. The Royal Air Force’s tactics called for the bombers to operate individually or in small groups, instead of the huge formations of aircraft providing mutual defensive fire, as proposed by the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF). A Luftwaffe training aid, showing the firing arcs of the defensive weapons on a USAAF B-17., Bundesarchiv The higher altitudes involved in the RAF bombing missions were intended to improve survivability but actually failed to evade the Luftwaffe’s fighters. The high-level sorties also reduced accuracy, especially since the Sperry bombsight was inferior compared to the more sophisticated Norden system used in U.S. bombers. Flying higher also meant the aircraft — and crews — suffered in the extreme cold. A Norden bombsight on display at the Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama., USAF The British subsequently tried out the Fortress in combat in North Africa, briefly, then switched the aircraft over to the long-range anti-submarine patrol mission, a role in which it was much more successful. Other examples were used for what was, at that time, termed radio countermeasures work, helping pioneer aerial electronic warfare jamming against the German air defense network, but their tenure as bombers over Europe had, for the time being, come to an end. In British hands, later models of the Fortress were successful as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft, and the type was also credited with sinking 11 U-boats., Royal Air Force In the meantime, however, Boeing had been working to improve the bomber’s basic design, as well as its survivability against fighter opposition. Powered turrets were now added, each with two .50 caliber machine guns, behind the cockpit and in the bottom of the fuselage, plus a barbette in the tail with another pair of .50 caliber guns. In this upgraded B-17E form, the Flying Fortress returned to combat in the European theater, with the USAAF, on August 17, 1942, as the United States built up its strength in the war against Germany. On that day, a formation of a dozen of these bombers attacked a railroad marshaling road at Rouen, northern France, without loss. The raid had been launched from Polebrook in England, the same base from where the B-17 had first gone into combat a little more than a year before. A B-17E of the 97th Bombardment Group in August 1942. This was the first USAAF unit to fly a B-17 combat mission in the European theater., USAAF The subsequent success of the B-17 in the Eighth Air Force’s daylight precision bombing campaign is well known and, within the space of a year, the USAAF had over 300 B-17s stationed in England. By spring 1944, the Eighth Air Force’s Flying Fortresses were marauding as far as Berlin, with fighter escort, demonstrating the ultimate ascendancy of the bomber offensive against a beleaguered Luftwaffe. So successful, in fact, was the B-17’s later career, that it’s little wonder that the type’s unfortunate combat debut is now barely remembered.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 1, 2023",Ballistic Missile Submarine USS Tennessee Emerges From Refit Sporting A Flank Sonar Array,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On July 7th, 2021, the U.S. Navy’s Trident Refit Facility, or TRF, in Kings Bay, Georgia, posted some great images of a very refreshed USS Tennessee , also known by its hull number SSBN-734, wrapping up a major refit—one that the facility says is the longest and most extensive work package it has executed in its history. Multiple images show this Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarine , or SSBN, at the end of her dry dock period, looking in fantastic shape, which is a testament to the TRF’s work—the sub has been in service for 33 years. Yet if you look closely, it is clear that there is a puzzling new addition to the ‘boomer’s’ trademark long and sleek hull. In a message on TRF’s Facebook page, the facility touted the occasion to go along with a set of photos showing off the reinvigorated submarine—the 9th of the Ohio class boats and one of 14 that comprise America’s second-strike nuclear deterrent. The post reads: USS Tennessee Completes Historic Dry Dock Phase: USS Tennessee (SSBN 734) – undergoing the longest and most extensive work package in TRF-KB history – completed its dry dock maintenance period July 1 … A full 10 days ahead of schedule! Tennessee will be the last submarine in the dry dock for the next 15-months as the dry dock undergoes an extensive $592 million overhaul. Highlights of the Tennessee Extended Refit Period (ERP) include: • 239,500 man-hours to date • 149 total days in dry dock (projected 159) • Completed full preservation efforts to include entire external hull • Major upgrades to include Ship Control System and sonar array • Overhauled entire AFT High Pressure Air System • Removed/repaired/installed propeller • Completed overhaul of MBT vent valves • Removed and reinstalled more than 220K pounds of lead • Emergency Diesel Engine overhaul • Torpedo tube upgrades • Removed/overhauled stern planes ram, rudder and all linkages • Coordinated more than 4000 crane and rigging evolutions• And much, much more! All of the USS Tennessee dry dock work was completed through careful planning and close coordination with Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command (NAVFAC) to prepare and turnover the dry dock and surrounding areas for the Dry Dock Recapitalization Project. If you look closely at the images, you will notice there is now a bulge that wraps vertically around each side of Tenessee’s hull, midway down the boat’s length. The bulges appear to end when they reach near the bottom of the hull and do not connect together. There is even a cutout in the upper fairing that sits flush with the launch tube doors for where the bulge begins before dropping below the waterline. Trident Refit Facility Facebook Page Trident Refit Facility Facebook Page Trident Refit Facility Facebook Page Trident Refit Facility Facebook Page Trident Refit Facility Facebook Page Trident Refit Facility Facebook Page This feature does not exist on other Ohio class boats, as far as we can tell, and appears to be one of a number of enhancements that will see these absolutely critical assets through until their replacements, the Columbia class ballistic missile submarines, become available . Although the date could and likely will move, the Navy doesn’t expect the first of these new American SSBNs to be ready until 2030, at the earliest. As to what this new feature is, we cannot say for certain, but it does appear very similar to the conformal, or flank, sonar arrays found on some modern submarines. In fact, the blended bulges look similar to the flank arrays on the Virginia class, with one huge difference—they are oriented vertically in a continuous strip, not horizontally and made up of multiple arrays. For instance, the Virginia class has six of them that line the hull from the sail to the stern. This odd arrangement could represent a new technological evolution, with this passive array working in concert with the main bow sonar array and the towed array to provide enhanced detection and tracking capabilities. This would also fit with the statement from the TRF that the boat’s sonar system has been upgraded. We know there has been a big push to develop more reliable and economical flank array systems. It is quite possible that this could be our first glance at a new configuration that leverages these improvements. A shot of a Virginia class nuclear fast attack submarine out of the water shows its flank arrays, one of which is prominently seen as the lower side bulge amidships. Flank arrays are usually conformal configurations that run laterally in sections along the hull, not vertically as seen in the images of Tenessee above., NORTHROP GRUMMAN It’s also possible that this intriguing addition could be something else entirely, maybe having to do with ballast, but that would seem less likely. After our initial analysis, we reached out to veteran submariner Aaron Amick , proprietor of Sub Brief , and an occasional contributor to The War Zone , about what he thought he was seeing in the images. Here is his take: The photos show a bulge near the midpoint of the missile compartment of USS Tennessee . The bulge is symmetrical on both port and starboard sides covered topside by the missile battery fairing suggesting that is one complete piece crossing the top of the submarine. While it is not clear what function this addition provides the submarine, its appearance is similar to synthetic aperture sonar arrays used on other submarines. The location is ideal for near 360-degree sonar coverage reducing the sonar ‘blind spot’ in the baffles, the region aft of the submarine. If this is a sonar array, it can provide two major benefits to the USS Tennessee . Based on the size of the array, this is most likely a Medium to High-Frequency passive sonar array. This gives the sonar operators another set of data to examine increasing their situational awareness across the broadband and narrowband sonar spectrums. This means USS Tennessee has increased detection capability. The second benefit of the array position is the data can be digitally merged in the advanced beamformer processors with the bow-mounted sonar and towed array, increasing the directivity of the sonar system. This gives sonar more accurate bearings at very low frequency. The potential combination of near-360 sonar coverage and increased VLF bearing accuracy gives USS Tennessee a tactical advantage we’ve not enjoyed since the Cold War. USS Tenessee pulling into Kings Bay in 2019 without the modification., USN Regardless, the fact that the Ohio class SSBNs—the most destructive weapons on Earth—are getting entirely new hull features as they enter into the twilight of their service life is a reminder of just how valuable and adaptable these boats truly are.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A picture shared online shows what a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk looks like through the U.S. Army’s newest night vision goggles , known as Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binoculars, or ENVG-Bs. The image shows the helicopter as viewed through a pair of ENVG-Bs in the so-called “outline” mode, which has brightly illuminated the edges on every surface of the aircraft. This setting is designed to make it easier for troops to quickly identify objects and highlights the revolutionary nature of these optics, which offer capabilities that previously seemed to be more in the realm of science fiction or video games. The image was posted to Twitter by the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, more commonly referred to as simply “Lancer Brigade,” which is based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, or JLBM, in Washington State. The Tweet says the UH-60 belongs to the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, another unit at JBLM. The Lancer Brigade had also previously shared footage of exercises conducted over Seattle with the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, demonstrating the goggles’ ability to clearly and brightly outline objects against dark backgrounds. Soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, part of the 101st Airborne Division, train with the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (ENVG-B) and associated systems at Aberdeen Proving Ground., US Army/Courtney Bacon The ENVG-Bs, which the Army first began fielding in 2019 and evolved from the earlier ENVG III , offer impressive new capabilities over older night vision goggles that allow for greater optical fidelity and the ability to see through obscurants like dust or smoke. The ENVG-B accomplishes this through an improved image intensifier, the view through which can also be fused with that from a thermal sensor. Images from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team’s exercises alongside the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade., Lancer Brigade via Twitter A comparison of a Black Hawk through ENVG-B, left, and an older night vision system, right., Lancer Brigade via Twitter/US Army/Sgt. Ken Scar A UH-60 Black Hawk, US Army/2nd Lt. Joshua Hill The system also has what the Army refers to as “augmented reality” functionality, but which, in its present form, simply puts various types of information right in front of a soldier’s eyes, more akin to what is already available to military aviators using helmet-mounted displays . This includes a video-game-like “radar,” as seen in the video below, which can show the locations of friendly troops in relation to the user, as well as possible hostile units and other waypoints. Such a capability, if deployed in a fully operational state, would literally change the game for soldiers in terms of situational awareness. The ENVG-B’s manufacturer, L3Harris Technologies, says that the ENVG-B can be linked to a wide variety of sensors and data feeds that use the Army’s Nett Warrior situational awareness system, including possibly from video captured aboard unmanned vehicles . This could offer Army units new levels of situational awareness, allowing them to conduct scout operations or avoid threats well ahead of their positions on a level not previously possible. L3Harris also says the goggles can offer new capabilities when paired with feeds from the Family of Weapon Sight-Individual (FWS-I) system, allowing for picture-in-picture displays or even allowing Army soldiers to use the feed from their FWS-I as their primary view in their goggles. This means soldiers using the system can use their weapons to peer around corners or over obstacles without putting themselves in harm’s way. Lt. Gen. James Richardson, the deputy commander of Army Futures Command, said in 2019 that the new goggles are “better than anything I’ve experienced in my Army career.” US Army As the images and footage shared by the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division show, the Army’s new ENVG-B system could forever improve the way soldiers view the battlefield. Situational awareness can be easy to lose in the heat of battle, particularly when soldiers’ vision is obscured by dust, smoke, or weather conditions, creating risks of friendly fire incidents or collateral damage. Even just more clearly defining an object, allowing for a split second faster comprehension of a threat or potential target, can be hugely valuable and even mean the difference between life and death. All told, the new ENVG-B could someday help make those concerns a thing of the past by bringing new levels of battlefield awareness firmly into reality.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still emerging, but authorities in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates say that a large explosion in a container on a ship anchored in the Port of Jebel Ali, which shook surrounding buildings, subsequently caused a major fire to break out. Officials now say that the blaze has been brought under control and that there are no reported casualties, as of yet, but the full extent of the damage, which appears to be significant, remains unclear. “We are taking all necessary measures to ensure the normal movement of ships in the port continues without any disruption,” an official statement from the Port of Jebel Ali read. The port is a major commercial hub in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is the biggest of its kind in the Middle East. A fireball above the port of Jebel Ali, captured by an eyewitness. , via Twitter/@ModernEraNews Initial reports had indicated that an oil tanker had exploded or caught fire, which has now been shown not to be the case. Authorities in Dubai have not identified the ship in question, but at least one unconfirmed report suggested that it could be the Comoros-registered container vessel Ocean Trader . Whatever the cause of the incident, various unverified videos show a huge ball of orange flame rising over the port, while eyewitness accounts report that the explosion could be heard, and felt, from several miles around. It is also worth noting that another vessel now thought to be in the same port, the Liberia-flagged CSAV Tyndall , had a fire break out last Saturday while it was headed to Jebel Ali. While the cause of that fire has not been established, Israeli officials reportedly blamed Iran for the incident. That would not be the first time that Tehran has been linked with an attack on a commercial vessel in the region, where there have been apparent tit-for-tat operations by both Iran and Israel targeting shipping. Regardless, so far there is no evidence either way at present that this was anything but an accident, and the identity of the vessel on which the fire broke out is yet to be confirmed. We will continue to update this developing story as more details become available. UPDATE: 7/8/2021 — Authorities in Dubai have confirmed that the Comoros-flagged container vessel Ocean Trader was the ship at the center of this incident. The fire, as well as the explosion that caused it, was a “normal accident, General Mona Al Marri, head of the Dubai Media Office had told Saudi Arabia-based Al Arabiya television. “Our priority now is to ensure that the accident will not impact the marine environment,” Suhail al-Mazrouei, the UAE’s Minister for Energy and Infrastructure, said in a statement . He added that normal operations had otherwise resumed at Jebel Ali. The exact cause of the explosion remains unclear, but General Al Marri said that the container that blew up had held unspecified flammable materials. Al Arabiya had reported that police in Dubai had suggested that “friction or high temperatures” might have contributed to the accident. “Casualties were avoided also due to the quick action of Jebel Ali Port’s officials who ordered an evacuation of the vessel and the immediate area when a leakage and smoke was seen,” a Tweet from the Dubai Media Office read. “Jebel Ali Port authorities are continuing an extensive investigation on the cause of the fire and its circumstances.” Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 30, 2021",Warhead For Air Force’s First Hypersonic Missile Tested For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says that it has conducted its first test of the high-explosive blast-fragmentation warhead that will go inside the boost-glide vehicle that sits at the tip of its AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic missile, or ARRW. This comes as the service is expected to try again to conduct a live-fire test of the weapon’s rocket booster later this month, following its first failed attempt back in April. The 780th Test Squadron, based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, conducted a so-called “ arena test ” of the prototype warhead. This involves setting off a warhead on the ground inside what is typically a circular array of barriers set up to collect data about its effects, such as the size and force of the blast and the range and distribution of the shrapnel produced by the detonation. The Air Force did not say where or when specifically the test had occurred. “Some of the firsts were the new and unorthodox design and construction of the test arena, the test procedures and equipment, the warhead’s fragmentation data collecting and the post-test data processing to ensure the warhead’s effects have been accurately characterized,” the Air Force said in a brief news item regarding the test. Airmen work to prepare an AGM-183 captive carry test missile for a flight. The glide vehicle will be installed on the operational missile under the nosecone and will separate before going on its way to its target. The warhead is contained within the glide vehicle. , USAF “The unique nature and shape of the warhead required a lot of firsts for everyone involved, according to the test’s manager,” David Spiker, a member of the 780th Test Squadron, also said in a statement . The Air Force did not provide any other details about the warhead’s construction or capabilities. However, it is interesting to note that, in 2018, Northrop Grumman demonstrated an advanced 50-pound-class Lethality Enhanced Ordnance (LEO) blast-fragmentation warhead that it said had a scalable design and would be well-suited to use in future hypersonic weapons. That same year, Lockheed Martin received its first contract to begin developing the ARRW. It’s not clear if Northrop Grumman is involved in work on the AGM-183A. The company is part of the Lockheed Martin-led team heading up the tandem development of the U.S. Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) missile and the U.S. Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), but is working on the rocket boosters for those weapons, not their warheads. “LEO is a fairly generic technology: PBXN-110 explosive fill and fragmentation layer,” Pat Nolan, the Vice President and General Manager of Northrop Grumman’s Missile Products division, told Jane’s after the company’s warhead test in 2018. “It’s how we array those fragments that determines the desired effects.” LEO, originally developed by Orbital ATK, which Northrop Grumman bought in 2018, has its origins in the development of alternatives to cluster munitions . This kind of technology offers one way to create lethal effects across a broad area without the potential to leave unexploded ordnance scattered about, which can be hazardous to friendly forces and innocent bystanders. “Northrop Grumman has conducted more than a dozen demonstrations of our LEO technology that has proven it is a safer alternative, which is policy compliant , and delivers the same or better results on target,” Northrop Grumman’s Nolan had also told The War Zone directly back in 2018. “Currently, we are working across all three services [Air Force, Army, and Navy] to transition this new warhead improvement to a variety of missile and bomb platforms.” The development of an “ Alternative Warhead ” for the 227mm Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) artillery rocket, another Lockheed Martin product, which was originally designed to carry a payload of cluster munitions, was one of the earliest applications of this technology. It has since been used on other artillery ammunition, among other munitions, and is set to be a feature of the warhead inside the future AGM-88G Advanced Anti-radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) missile. “Preliminary results indicate that the new warhead will defeat medium to medium-heavy targets while maintaining the original performance,” Northrop Grumman had explained to Jane’s in 2018. “LEO also provides penetration survivability against buildings for greater warfighter flexibility and predictable patterns for low collateral damage mission capabilities, providing a safer alternative to some legacy munitions, which can cause unintended harm to civilians and infrastructure.” Of course, it is also entirely possible that ARRW’s warhead does not use Northrop Grumman’s LEO technology and is instead a different advanced blast-fragmentation design developed separately. It is worth remember that, by definition, hypersonic weapons fly at speeds of Mach 5 or greater and, as a result, they are inherently capable of being employed simply as kinetic weapons designed to damage or destroy targets through the sheer force of slamming into them and their associated shockwaves. Still, as The War Zone noted back in 2018 , relying on kinetic force alone would restrict the ability of an individual hypersonic weapon to engage multiple targets distributed across even a very limited area. A blast-fragmentation warhead would provide weapons, such as ARRW, was increased flexibility against various target sets. Something like Northrop Grumman’s LEO technology, which the company has said can be scaled and optimized for use against different threats, could be especially valuable. Individual fragments could potentially be more destructive given then how fast the weapon would already be traveling before the warhead detonates. The video in the Tweet below is of a test of a prototype of the common hypersonic boost-glide vehicle being developed for the Navy’s IRCPS and the Army’s LRHW and shows it impacting at the end of its flight. It’s not clear if this shows the detonation of a high-explosive warhead inside the vehicle or not. Whatever the exact configuration of the ARRW warhead is, this test comes as the Air Force continues to push ahead with the program, as a whole. Later this month, the service is expected to launch a prototype AGM-183A, primarily to test the function of the weapon’s rocket booster. If this goes ahead as planned, this would be the first successful live-fire test of the weapon. In April, the service failed in its first attempt to carry out this test, citing an unspecified issue with the B-52H bomber carrying the prototype missile. A B-52H bomber with an AGM-183A ARRW captive-carry test article under its wing., USAF Boost-glide vehicles are unpowered and typically use a rocket booster to get them to an optimal altitude and initial speed. The vehicle, which is highly maneuverable, then breaks away and glides back down toward its target at hypersonic speeds along an atmospheric trajectory, while also making sudden and erratic maneuvers. This all makes it difficult for enemy forces to track, let alone attempt to intercept these threats, and also reduces the amount of time they have in which to react, overall. This could make it hard, if not impossible for an opponent to attempt to relocate critical assets or otherwise seek cover, with these weapons catching them out in the open where blast-fragmentation warheads would be most effective. Yesterday, navigational warnings were issued for various sections of the Eastern Pacific, which could indicate a forthcoming missile test emanating from Southern California on July 10, 2021. It is possible that this could be the upcoming ARRW test launch. However, the designated areas appear to form a track leading to the Navy’s Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands , a test range off Hawaii. The Air Force has previously said that the first AGM-183A test would not involve the launch of an actual boost-glide vehicle. A dummy vehicle, designed to disintegrate after detaching from the booster, would be installed instead. It is also worth noting that the designated warning areas are in similar locations to the ones that were outlined in earlier notices that were issued in May, which also appeared to point to an imminent missile test. No such testing occurred at that time, at least that we know about. It is possible that the planned ARRW test, as we understand it now, could still send debris flying an appreciable distance out into the Pacific. The Air Force could also now be planning to conduct a more robust test due to the various delays. The War Zone has already reached out to the service for more information. Whatever the case, the Air Force is still looking to keep to its aggressive schedule for the program. The service has said in the past that it hopes to reach an early operational capability with the weapon by the end of Fiscal Year 2022. Its budget request for that fiscal cycle, which it released in May, includes $161 million in proposed spending to buy 12 AGM-183As . As of last year, the plan had been to buy eight full-up prototypes , with the goal being to only expend four of them in testing. The remaining four could then be made available for potential limited operational use. With all this in mind, it will be very interesting to see what the outcome of the next ARRW flight test is and what new details about the weapon, including its warhead, continue to emerge in the coming months.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jan 25, 2022",Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Funds Redirected By Army To Buy New Humvees,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is looking to shift funds away from the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program in order to fund the continued modernization and procurement of the iconic High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, or Humvee. While the JLTV was originally expected to replace at least the vast majority, if not all of the service’s Humvees, something that has steadily turned out not to be the case, questions remain about how to fit the new mine-resistant platform in its existing fleet of ground vehicles. These latest funding deferments only complicate those questions further. A reprogramming request sent to Congress has asked for $36 million to be added to programs to buy new Humvees and retrofit older ones with new systems. If approved, the Humvee program would receive $66 million for fiscal year 2020, enough to purchase 216 new production Humvees. $23 million of that Humvee funding would be diverted from the JLTV program if the reprogramming request is approved, curtailing the purchase, at least for the time being, of some 471 specialized JLTV trailers, according to Inside Defense . A JLTV at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina., USMC/LCpl Zachary Zephir If the reprogramming request isn’t approved, there could be a Humvee production break in February. “The Army is deferring production of these JLTV trailers to reallocate resources towards the HMMWV program to help alleviate a production break for that program and avoid a near-term bill for potential start-up costs should that production break occur,” the reprogramming request states. By law, the Pentagon is required to ask for Congressional approval any time it wants to reallocate funding from one part of the budget to another. The Humvee reprogramming request also states that “recent program developments, including the loss of projected Foreign Military Sales (FMS) in September 2020, have put HMMWV production at risk.” In 2017, the Humvee’s manufacturer AM General received a $2.2 billion contract from the Army to produce as many as 11,560 Humvees for international customers through 2022. The Humvee first entered service in 1983 and became popular worldwide thanks to being a highly reconfigurable platform. Throughout its four decades, some of the many Humvee configurations include weapon carrier models, heavy-duty cargo transport, mobile command center, special operations vehicle, and even ambulances. There are a plethora of standard Humvee variants, and the platform has also proven adaptable beyond those, including a “build-your-own Humvee derivative” called the Multi-Purpose Truck (MPT), which you can read about in our prior reporting . However, the nature of the battlefield has changed in recent decades, especially in terms of threats to vehicles, and technological advances have made some features of the original Humvee obsolete or outdated, hence why there is a need to retrofit or modernize older models. A chart depicting a portion of the U.S. military’s official Humvee types, circa the early 2010s., US Army via HMMWV in Scale The funds the Pentagon wants to divert away from the JLTV program are intended for what the Army terms as a Humvee “recapitalization” program, or RECAP. This program began in the early 2000s, initially as a way of updating older portions of the fleet and converting them into a standard M1097R1 configuration that included various improvements and system upgrades, as well as the ability to accommodate various add-on armor packages. According to the 2013 Army Weapon Systems Handbook , the program would “incorporate the latest technical insertions common to the fleet” including relocating Humvee air conditioning condensers to the engine compartment, installing high-load rating run-flat tires, adding an improved geared fan drive, and making “electrical improvements.” The U.S. Army’s FY 2022 budget request documentation states that the program in its current form can include “replacement of the entire chassis, or power pack replacement, Anti-lock Brake System/ Electronic Stability Control (ABS/ESC) integration, low risk technology inserts, address obsolescence concerns and Inspect and Repair Only As Necessary (IROAN).” The budget request also states that newer M1152A1/M1165A1 models will be procured in order to phase out the “oldest non-armored HMMWVs that currently pose readiness challenges and cannot be up-armored.” DOD The Army requested $884.4 million for the JLTV program in FY 2021 and $574.5 million in 2022, with plans to acquire close to 49,000 JLTVs by 2041. The 2022 budget request notes that “Current contract options may be exercised through 30 November 2023 assuming contractual quantity headspace is still available.” DOD The Army is the central manager for the JLTV program, but the platform is also operated by the United States Marine Corps . In addition, the Air Force has decided to replace some of its Humvees with JLTVs, and there have been a number of sales to foreign countries including the United Kingdom and Lithuania . The JLTV was originally envisioned as a replacement for Humvees nearly across the board, with initial estimates putting the total number of JLTV purchases at 54,600 vehicles – 5,500 for the USMC and the 49,100 for the Army. That number has been walked back to just over 49,000 as the Army decided that some Humvees would remain in service indefinitely for various roles. Size and weight have been factors in this decision, as the 22,000-lb JLTV is significantly larger than the Humvee, which isn’t small itself. The size and weight issue is also evidenced by the Army’s decision just recently to procure a smaller vehicle , the Infantry Squad Vehicle, as an alternative to both the JLTV and the Humvee, particularly for airborne units . In early 2020, the Army reduced its JLTV budget request by 863 vehicles in order to fund other modernization efforts. Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, then serving as Secretary of the Army, justified the cuts by saying the JLTV wasn’t as relevant in the current National Defense Strategy since it was designed and procured for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some would challenge the idea that the Humvee is somehow better suited to an Army that is supposed to shift focus to higher-end conflicts, especially against potential near-peer adversaries, such as Russia or China, if the decades-old vehicle was too vulnerable for low-end conflicts like Iraq. An argument could be made that mine and small arms resistance is less of an issue in a peer state fight where more advanced weapons pose a greater threat. In that case, lighter, cheaper, and simpler vehicles that have less logistical demands than their larger more complex counterparts may be advantageous. For instance, if holding an island in the Pacific, extra under-hull armor would have little impact on survivability. An Oshkosh JLTV at Camp Lejune, USMC/LCpl Scott Jenkins The Army has looked to scale back funding for JLTV in recent years, pushing acquisition timelines back by several years into the early 2040s. At the same time, the Army has already posted a follow-on contract opportunity in order to find a second manufacturer to compete alongside Oshkosh Defense , the current sole manufacturer of the JLTV. Questions about the JLTV’s role alongside the Army’s existing fleet of Humvees have been posed since the JLTV acquisition program announced its first contracts in 2015. While the Army’s former acquisition chief, Dr. Bruce Jette has said that the JLTV is a “significant improvement over the Humvee when it comes to transportability, speed and agility as well as protection,” Jette told Defense News in 2020 that the Army still has “an objective of 50,000 Humvees still in place or alternative, light, less expensive vehicles to be able to perform mission requirements in the future.” Like others, Jette himself wondered at the time “how do we maintain the existing fleet effectively as we modernize with the JLTVs?” Despite having been in service for nearly 40 years, the Humvee continues to prove itself as a mainstay of the U.S. Army. As these recent funding reprogramming requests show, the Army isn’t done with the Humvee yet despite having already chosen an eventual replacement in the JLTV. It very well could be that the two vehicles will continue to co-exist as the Humvee recapitalization efforts extend the iconic vehicle’s use well into the next several decades.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Oct 7, 2021",Pentagon Warns Of An “Increased Potential” For Nuclear Conflict In Newly Disclosed Manual,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. military manual that only recently became public says that the world now faces a higher probability of conflicts involving nuclear weapons. The document points to multiple nuclear weapons systems and policies being pursued by adversaries and potential adversaries as signs that the world is moving away from de-escalation and is instead moving closer to the reality of a nuclear exchange. While the document avoids placing any weight on United States policy in helping to increase the likelihood of nuclear conflict, it does note that the “flexible” nuclear weapons the US has pursued could be used to defend America and its interests in the event of a regional conflict involving nuclear arms. A copy of the manual, titled “Joint ­Publication 3-72, Joint Nuclear Operations,” was obtained by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) last week through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and posted online on July 6. This and other Joint Publications are meant to outline U.S. military-wide doctrine and are put out through the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This latest iteration of this particular manual , published in April 2020, says it was created to help establish “joint doctrine to govern the activities and performance of the Armed Forces of the United States in joint operations,” and provide “military guidance for the exercise of authority by combatant commanders and other joint force commanders.” In addition, the publication offers advice for “military interaction with governmental and non-governmental agencies, multinational forces, and other inter-organizational partners.” The official W76-2 program logo. Mk 4A refers to the reentry vehicle that the warhead sits inside when loaded into the Trident D5 missile., NNSA In this manual’s executive summary, the authors say that, despite United States-led de-escalation and non-proliferation efforts, “since 2010 no potential adversary has reduced either the role of nuclear weapons in its national security strategy or the number of nuclear weapons it fields.” Instead, the publication asserts, these potential adversaries have “moved decidedly in the opposite direction.” Ultimately, the document claims there is an “increased potential for regional conflicts involving nuclear-armed adversaries in several parts of the world and the potential for adversary nuclear escalation in crisis or conflict” due to these trends. Cover of “Joint ­Publication No. 3-72 Nuclear Operations”, DOD The document notes that “While the United States has continued to reduce the number and salience of nuclear weapons, others, including Russia and China, have moved in the opposite direction.” The publication claims that these nations have developed new types of nuclear weapons, placed increased strategic importance on their nuclear weapons, and have all “engaged in increasingly aggressive behavior.” The manual then lists specific technologies and policies being pursued by these nations which it claims are leading to “increased potential” for nuclear conflict to occur: In addition to modernizing ” legacy” Soviet nuclear systems, Russia is developing and employing new nuclear warheads and launchers. It is also developing three new intercontinental-range nuclear weapon systems; a hypersonic glide vehicle; a nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered ground-launched cruise missile; and a nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous torpedo. […] China has developed a new road-mobile, strategic, intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM); a new multi-warhead version of its DF-5 silo-based ICBM; and its most advanced ballistic missile submarine armed with new submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). It has also announced development of a new nuclear-capable strategic bomber, giving China a nuclear triad. […] In the past few years, North Korea has dramatically increased its missile flight testing, most recently including the testing of intercontinental-range missiles capable of reaching the US homeland. […] Iran retains the technological capability and much of the capacity necessary to develop a nuclear weapon within one year of a decision to do so. Iran’s development of increasingly long-range ballistic missile capabilities, and its aggressive strategy and activities to destabilize neighboring governments, raises questions about its long-term commitment to forgoing nuclear weapons capability. A copy of the 2019 edition of the same manual, then simply titled “Nuclear Operations,” appeared online briefly before being labeled “For Official Use Only” and getting taken down. FAS still hosts that version on their website, however. One of the more glaring changes between the 2019 and 2020 versions can be found in the introduction to the first chapter, “Overview of Nuclear Strategy.” The introduction to the 2019 version notes only briefly that “Adversaries increasingly rely on nuclear weapons to secure their interests,” while the 2020 version of the document cites the specific weapons systems and policies quoted above. Chinese Dong Feng 17 hypersonic missiles, which the US government believes are nuclear-capable, being shown off in a parade in 2019 commemorating 70 years of Chinese Communist Party rule., AP/Ng Han Guan The 2019 version of the publication also contained language about how nuclear weapons could be employed to “prevail in conflict” in Chapter III, “Planning and Targeting.” That language was changed in the 2020 version, removing all mentions of using nukes to obtain victory: 2019: “Using nuclear weapons could create conditions for decisive results and the restoration of strategic stability. Specifically, the use of a nuclear weapon will fundamentally change the scope of a battle and create conditions that affect how commanders will prevail in conflict.” 2020: “Flexible and limited US nuclear response options can play an important role in restoring deterrence following limited adversary nuclear escalation. Limited nuclear use will create conditions that affect how commanders conduct operations.” Steven Aftergood, head of FAS’s Project on Government Secrecy, said the change is likely due to the fact that the document was never intended to become public and still requires a Department of Defense (DOD) Common Access Card to obtain. “Once it was disclosed in 2019,” Aftergood told The War Zone , it seems the “DOD made an effort to remove language that seemed to embrace nuclear warfighting.” Aftergood agrees with the manual’s claim of increased potential for the use of nuclear weapons, stating that “it’s clear that many regional conflicts are intensifying while foreign nuclear arsenals are growing, not shrinking. And in recent years arms control efforts have been in retreat. So from a military perspective, it follows that the potential for nuclear conflict may also be on the rise.” Diplomatic efforts on arms reduction have stalled in recent years, but show signs of improving. Both Russia and the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 2019, but the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) was extended for five years by both the US and Russia in early 2021 , after the joint manual on Nuclear Operations was published. Open launch tubes on the US Navy’s ballistic missile submarine USS Ohio . , USN As the newly disclosed joint publication on Nuclear Operations notes, “the highest US nuclear policy and strategy priority is to deter potential adversaries from nuclear attack of any scale,” and the modernization of the US arsenal is a cornerstone of that deterrence. In 2018, the White House updated its Nuclear Posture Review to include deterrence strategies tailored to specific adversaries, a more modernized nuclear arsenal and nuclear enterprise, and plans for a more “flexible” posture that could make it easier for the United States to use nuclear weapons. The new language in the 2020 version of the manual also uses the term “flexible” to describe US nuclear response options. Those options now include tactical low-yield nuclear warheads aboard submarine-launched ballistic missiles that fly along “depressed” low-altitude trajectories capable of reaching targets much more quickly than conventional trajectories. Personnel at the Pantex plant in Texas load a Mk 4A reentry vehicle containing a W76-1 warhead into a container for transport. The low-yield W76-2 warhead fits inside the same reentry vehicle., YouTube Capture Of course, the United States isn’t the only nation modernizing its arsenal, and all of that buildup comes with immense risks. Like Aftergood, Dr. Steve Fetter, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland and member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, agrees with the manual’s assessment of an increased potential for conflict. Fetter said in a 2021 press release that “the modernization and expansion of nuclear arsenals in multiple countries, combined with the lack of diplomatic efforts to reduce nuclear risks, have increased the likelihood of catastrophe,” adding that the “development of hypersonic glide vehicles, ballistic missile defenses, and weapons-delivery systems that can use conventional or nuclear warheads raise the probability of miscalculation during a crisis.” The issue of how to deescalate conflicts between nuclear-armed nations to prevent miscalculation took center stage in 2019 when a crisis erupted between India and Pakistan , prompting India to conduct a strike within Pakistan’s borders. Pakistan responded by implicitly threatening the potential for nuclear retaliation, prompting real fears that the situation could have escalated to a nuclear exchange, which could have a massive impact globally. The manual notes that any use of nuclear weapons could affect the entire planet, stating that “the use of nuclear weapons has specific, tangible implications that go well beyond the actual effects of the detonation,” creating “harmful effects that conventional weapons do not have.” Radioactive fallout, widespread electromagnetic pulse (EMP) damage, and “incidental harm to civilians” are all cited as potential global consequences that commanders have to plan for when considering the use of nuclear weapons. “The potential consequences of using nuclear weapons will greatly influence military operations and vastly increase the complexity of the operational environment,” the manual claims. The Pentagon’s “Joint ­Publication No. 3-72 Nuclear Operations” document unearthed by FAS is a rare peek at the actual operations and policies DOD leadership has prepared for the ever-present threat of a nuclear weapons exchange. Alongside all the talk of de-escalating arms races and re-establishing arms control policies, the United States military must constantly be prepared for nuclear war, either between itself and a hostile adversary or between two or more other nations. While the CJCS publication states that the United States “would only consider the employment of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend US, allied, and partner vital interests,” it also claims that “Flexible and limited US nuclear response options can play an important role in restoring deterrence following limited adversary nuclear escalation.” The fact that the US is pursuing these “flexible,” low-yield, tactical warheads capable of reaching targets more quickly could be taken as a sign that the US may be more quick to use its nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict, a development that should be considered in any discussion of nations raising the likelihood of nuclear exchange. No matter how small, any nuclear weapons exchange would affect how the DOD conducts operations worldwide and could have disastrous consequences for the entire globe, two eventualities the Joint Chiefs of Staff are clearly planning for.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 22, 2024",Israel Might Ditch Its New Air Force One Jet Before It Even Enters Service,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Before it has even entered service, Israel’s “Air Force One” could be abandoned, and the adapted Boeing 767 airframe sold off. That, at least, is the plan of at least one prominent Israeli lawmaker, although the proposal will likely face opposition from the Israeli Ministry of Defense, which wants the jet to transport the prime minister, president, and other high-ranking officials. So far, the country has invested over $300 million in the aircraft, roughly double the figure originally projected. Israeli news website Ynet reports that Israel’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid is trying to sell off the 767-300ER twinjet, which was acquired secondhand and arrived in Israel in July 2016 after having served with the Australian airline Qantas, which received it in 2000. 767-300ER “Wing of Zion” at Ben-Gurion International Airport., LLHZ2805/Wikimedia Commons The aircraft, officially named the “Wing of Zion,” has not yet entered Israeli Air Force service and has been undergoing extensive modifications in the country. Work is being undertaken by Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI), including installing a conference room and seating for an entourage of 116. Lapid is a long-term opponent of the VIP jet, announcing back in October 2019, before taking his current position, that he planned to scrap it. “When we are in government, we will sell it and transfer the money to where it really is needed,” Lapid said at the time. A decision on the fate of the 767 will now have to be taken by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who began his tenure last month, together with President Isaac Herzog, who took office today. Herzog’s predecessor, Reuben Rivlin, stated that he would not fly in the Wing of Zion and would instead travel on regular commercial flights, although with the 767 yet to enter service, this was ‘academic.’ According to Ynet , “the defense establishment strongly opposes the sale of the aircraft and recommends using it,” on the basis that the prime minister requires an aircraft with a comprehensive self-protection suite , hardening against cyber-attack, and secure communications equipment, of the kinds not available on a standard commercial airliner. It’s worth noting, however, that anti-missile systems are a standard fit on certain Israeli-operated commercial airliners too. The communications suite is expected to allow the Israeli leadership to securely manage state affairs while airborne or on the ground, much like the U.S. Air Force’s own VC-25A Air Force One jets. On the other hand, the fact that these types of systems have begun to be installed could complicate the process of selling the aircraft on the commercial market, especially to a foreign customer. In the meantime, aside from the contentious issue of cost, the 767 is still some way away from actually being ready for service. The delays, amounting to several months, are reportedly due to “licensing proceedings,” as well as the requirement to build a dedicated new operating area at Ben-Gurion International Airport, outside Tel Aviv, where the jet will be based. Furthermore, the process of getting the 767 into service was held up by a decision to suspend test flights last summer, in order to focus instead on the COVID-19 pandemic, although testing has now resumed. Even before that, there were other setbacks in the program, including a brake malfunction on landing in October 2019, reported in AirForces Monthly . Last November it was reported that the 767 would be used by then Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his trip to the United Arab Emirates, but the jet was still not ready. The choice of the 767 for the Wing of Zion has also been criticized. Since this aircraft is not operated by Israeli flag-carrier El Al, it requires specific infrastructure and support equipment, as well as aircrew training. First flown 20 years ago, the individual airframe selected is also fairly old. In some respects, the potential pitfalls of acquiring secondhand airliners for the state VIP transport mission have been made clear by the U.S. Air Force’s new VC-25B Air Force One jets, which are being converted from existing 747-8i airframes, not built to their unique specifications off the line. Still, those were new airframes put into storage, while the Wing of Zion has had an operational career. The Wing of Zion in its previous incarnation as VH-OGV, was operated by Qantas between 2000 and 2003 and again between 2006 and 2013., Edwin Leong/Wikimedia Commons The question of whether an air force needs a dedicated long-range VIP transport for state missions is a contentious one in Israel and in other countries , too. Until now, however, these missions have been fulfilled using either chartered commercial airliners or the Israeli Air Force’s KC-707 tanker/transports. Plans are now underway to begin replacing the KC-707 fleet with KC-46 tankers . Although a troubled program itself, the KC-46 will at least provide a limited degree of commonality with the 767, being derived from the same general airframe, although in a totally unique configuration. A dedicated head of state aircraft has unique importance for nuclear powers, as the deterrent those weapons provide is only as relevant as the command and control ecosystems that underpin them. Having a hardened airframe with highly secure communications would help in providing a more robust command and control capability for the use of those weapons, which Israel doesn’t formally acknowledge having. That being said, Israel’s nuclear apparatus has functioned without such a plane in the past, so it isn’t an absolute necessity. Lapid’s plan to cancel the new VIP transport still needs to be approved by the prime minister and president. However, the well-publicized delays and cost overruns that have afflicted the program will hardly help its case. There’s little doubt, however, that the aircraft, once ready, will offer niche capabilities beyond the reach of a standard airliner or military transport. This might just be enough to save the Wing of Zion. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Air Force One Transports"
Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 21, 2021",New B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber Rendering Released By The Air Force (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released what is only the third official rendering of its future B-21 Raider stealth bomber, which shows a previously unseen and extremely curious cockpit windscreen configuration. The latest image depicts one of the aircraft flying over Edwards Air Force Base in California , where initial testing of these bombers is set to begin after the type’s first flight, which is presently expected to occur in May 2022. The Air Force released the new B-21 artwork on July 6, 2021, to go along with an official online fact sheet on the Raider. The service had released the second artist’s conception of the jet in January 2020, with the same rendering of the aircraft individually depicted inside hangars at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. Ellsworth is expected to be the first base to host an operational B-21 squadron after the type enter service in the mid-2020s, followed by Whiteman and Dyess. The Air Force’s new rendering of a B-21 Raider stealth bomber, showing the aircraft flying over Edwards Air Force Base in California., USAF “Nuclear modernization is a top priority for the Department of Defense and the Air Force, and B-21 is key to that plan,” Randall Walden, the director of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, said in a statement accompanying the artwork and fact sheet releases. “The built-in feature of open systems architecture on the B-21 makes the bomber effective as the threat environment evolves. This aircraft design approach sets the nation on the right path to ensuring America’s enduring airpower capability.” By far the most eye-catching detail in this new rendering is the windscreen configuration, which is notably different from the ones seen in the two earlier artists’ conceptions of the B-21. The earlier art showed only a pair of cockpit windows, while the latest art shows at least one new narrow, slanted window on the left side of the cockpit. The assumption is that there is likely to be an identical one on the other side. A closer look at the rendering also indicates that there are still two separate windscreens at the front. This would all be more in line, in general, with the four cockpit windows found on the existing B-2 Spirit stealth bomber . Northrop Grumman is the company behind both the B-2 and B-21 designs. A comparison of the B-21 cockpit window configurations from, left to right, the 2021 concept art, the 2020 rendering, and the original artist’s conception of the jet., USAF/Northrop Grumman However, it’s not clear what purpose these windows would serve or why it would be useful for them to be shaped in this way. This downward to upward slanted shape would appear to provide almost no upward visibility and be below the pilot’s eyeline. It’s also unclear why this would’ve been the preferred design versus two windscreens that extend on either side of the cockpit, as seen in the earlier renderings. The framing in between the additional windows would only increase the number of joint areas that would have to be smoothed over, and kept immaculately that way , in order to preserve the jet’s stealth characteristics. At the same time, relatively large, single-piece curved windows are complex structures to produce. Beyond that, the new art offers few, if any other potential substantive details. We get no additional looks at the aircraft’s stealthy inlets for its engines, or their shrouded exhausts, which are highly sensitive and especially complex features of the design. The rendering does show more of a pronounced bulge in the aircraft’s belly, which is similar, in broad respects, to the otherworldly shape of the B-2 . Still, we can expect it to be more pronounced due to the aircraft’s single weapons bay and smaller payload and overall size, compared to the B-2. A picture of the B-2’s “beak,” which also shows the bulged fuselage., Major Allen Clark The artwork does not show any significant changes to the aircraft’s general planform from the one seen in the second official rendering, which is very reminiscent of Northrop’s original high-altitude Advanced Technology Bomber design of the 1980s that preceded the final B-2 configuration. This design was later adapted to accommodate a low-level penetration capability requirement that was added mid-development by the USAF. The final design that would become the B-2 also gained the type’s trademark sawtooth trailing edge, which lowered the aircraft’s operating ceiling and degraded its stealthiness, especially from the rear aspect. You can read all about this and how the B-21’s ‘back to the future’ design will likely restore the high-altitude ambitions lost in the B-2 program, in this past special feature . The latest B-21 rendering also notably has the same highly-pronounced, almost bill-like chine line leading edge, as opposed to the B-2’s pronounced ‘beak,’ that was seen in the second artist’s conception that the Air Force released last year. You can read our full analysis made at the time of the release of those renderings here. It is, of course, also important to remember that this is just a rendering and may not be entirely representative of the final design. In fact, some of it could represent deliberate misdirection. Regardless, when it comes to stealth technology, it is also about the complex structures that hide beneath the outer mold line of the aircraft that play a major part in giving it its low-observable qualities, as well as its radar absorbent material (RAM) coating. In other words, there is so much more than what meets the eye. An artist’s conception of the B-2 bomber from a period in its development relatively close to its public unveiling., USAF When it comes to the information in the fact sheet, the most notable detail is the updated projected unit cost of $639 million in 2019 dollars. This is almost $673 million in today’s dollars. In 2010, the projected unit cost of what was then referred to as the Long Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) was $550 million, or close to $580 million in today’s dollars. That price point also assumed the Air Force would procure at least 100 of these aircraft. The service’s current plan is to buy as many as 149 B-21s . “Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates directed B-21 Average Procurement Unit Cost as a key performance parameter as the best means to control costs,” the fact sheet stresses. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates., DOD Beyond that, the details about the B-21 program, as well as the aircraft itself, all appear to have been previously reported. “The B-21 Raider will be a component of a larger family of systems for conventional Long Range Strike, including Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, electronic attack, communication and other capabilities,” the fact also states. “It will be nuclear capable and designed to accommodate manned or unmanned operations. Additionally, it will be able to employ a broad mix of stand-off and direct-attack munitions.” Both its early nuclear capability and its optionally manned concept were confirmed by The War Zone four years ago while speculation was rife that the aircraft would not have those features, at least for some time. The larger family of systems also is thought to include the secretive RQ-180 drone, which you read more about in detail in this War Zone feature . “The B-21 is being designed with open systems architecture to reduce integration risk and enable competition for future modernization efforts to allow for the aircraft to evolve as the threat environment changes,” it adds. The first two B-21s are currently in different states of production at Plant 42 in California. The Air Force hopes to publicly roll out the first of them sometime early next year. When that happens, it will be very interesting to see how the renderings we’ve seen so far, and any that are still to come, line up with the Raider’s actual design. Update: The idea of having no windscreen at all for a stealthy aircraft has been a possibility for some time, especially when it comes to the very cutting-edge B-21.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 3, 2021",The Onion Predicted America’s Middle Of The Night Pullout From Bagram In Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New details about the U.S. military’s sudden, nighttime departure from Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, which had been a major hub for the United States and the NATO-led coalition in the country for nearly 20 years, emerged over the weekend. The last Americans reportedly left unannounced, ostensibly for operational security reasons, but they turned off the power, which in turn cut the running water at the base, as they departed. The nature of this withdrawal came as a shock to Afghan troops who are now stationed at the base and created chaos that allowed looters to break in. However, all of this may not have been surprising to whoever wrote a story for the famed satirical “news outlet” The Onion a decade ago that described a very similar end to the U.S. military’s presence at this base. The Wall Street Journal was the first to reveal that American forces had killed the power and shut off the water to the sprawling base late on Friday, July 2, as they withdrew. Other outlets have since reported additional details about what happened at the facility, which, among other things, houses a prison with approximately 5,000 inmates, most of whom are believed to be members of the Taliban or ISIS’ franchise in Afghanistan. U.S. officials insist that, while the exact timing of the departure had been kept secret, they had been closely coordinating with their Afghan counterparts regarding the plan for weeks. Afghan authorities, including the new commander at Bagram, have offered very different views of the events. An Afghan soldier stands on top of the wall of a checkpoint at Bagram Airfield after the departure of US forces., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul “We (heard) some rumor that the Americans had left Bagram,” Afghan General Mir Asadullah Kohistani, who is now in charge of Bagram, told The Associated Press . “Finally by seven o’clock in the morning, we understood that it was confirmed that they had already left Bagram. This was two hours after the last Americans had reportedly gone. An Afghan soldier who The Associated Press interviewed, named Abdul Raouf, said U.S. military officials subsequently called to say “we are here at the airport in Kabul.” Whatever the plan had been, Afghan forces at Bagram were incapable of preventing looters from almost immediately gaining access to the facility. “It just went dark,” another Afghan soldier, only identified as Sergeant Ehsanullah, told The Journal about what happened. The unexpected loss of power reportedly came just as Afghan forces at the base were preparing for dinner. The U.S. military reportedly left some 3.5 million individual items, ranging from Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored trucks to bottles of water, at Bagram, and much more in between, all of which now belongs to the Afghan government, whether it wants it or not. “Afghan officials said they don’t know what to do with much of the American stuff they now own,” according to The Journal . “Gen. Kohistani said he appreciated some of the remaining infrastructure, including a 50-bed hospital, fuel storage tanks, other military and civilian equipment and radars for the flight operations.” Vehicles that US forces left behind at Bagram, which now belong to the Afghan government., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul “Kohistani said the U.S. also left behind small weapons and the ammunition for them, but the departing troops took heavy weapons with them,” The Associated Press ‘ report added. “Ammunition for weapons not being left behind for the Afghan military was blown up before they left.” There were previously reports about U.S. forces in Afghanistan destroying military vehicles and other materiel not destined to be turned over to the Afghans. It is often U.S. government policy to physically destroy defense and security-related equipment if it determined, for whatever reason, that it cannot be transferred from one entity to another, internally, or to foreign allies or partners. The remains of a vehicle at a scrapyard near Bagram in May., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul It’s not hard to see how much of what was leftover at Bagram would’ve been of interest to looters. There were also concerns initially that these individuals were actually Taliban militants. The group has been making significant gains across Afghanistan in recent weeks as U.S. and coalitions forces withdraw from bases throughout the country. Its forces are reportedly operating in the general vicinity of the base , which lies just 40 miles or so northeast of Kabul. Afghan authorities insisted that they had complete control over the facility by the end of Friday. “In one night, they [the Americans] lost all the goodwill of 20 years by leaving the way they did, in the night, without telling the Afghan soldiers who were outside patrolling the area,” another Afghan soldier, who The Journal identified simply as Naematullah , said. A member of the Afghan National Army Commando Corps, with a sports drink in hand, at Bagram after the withdrawal of US forces., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul If the nature of this U.S. withdrawal of Bagram came as something of a shock to people inside and outside of Afghanistan, it may not have been so unexpected for the person who wrote a piece for The Onion titled “U.S. Quietly Slips Out Of Afghanistan In Dead Of Night,” which was published on July 18, 2011. That entirely fictitious story described a farcical departure of American troops from Bagram, who left only a “Dear John” letter behind. “By the time you read this, we will be gone,” the note read, according to the piece. “We regret any pain this may cause you, but this was something we needed to do.” “According to firsthand accounts, the 90,000 American troops stationed in Afghanistan lay in their beds pretending to be asleep until well after midnight Tuesday,” the piece continues. “They then reportedly tiptoed out to a fleet of awaiting Humvees, tanks, armored cars, and stealth aircraft; gently eased the doors shut; and departed as silently as possible so as not to wake the 30-million-person nation.” “We just couldn’t bear to look the Afghan people in the eye and tell them flat out that we were packing up and leaving,” a fake quote attributed to then-U.S. Army General David Petraeus, head of U.S. forces in Afghanistan at the time, reads. “So we decided to sneak out the back through Tajikistan while the country was asleep.” US Army General David Petraeus in Afghanistan in 2011. Later that year, he would be confirmed as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He resigned from that post in 2012 over his extramarital affair with Paula Broadwell, who had written a biography about him., USN Yesterday, the real-world President of Tajikistan, Emomali Rakhmon, called up thousands of reservists to be deployed to the border with Afghanistan after more than 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces fled into the country in the face of the advancing Taliban. There had also been some discussion in the past about the potential of basing American troops in Tajikistan, or other countries in Central Asia, to be better positioned to respond to future contingencies in Afghanistan. “We could have slowly and steadily withdrawn from Afghanistan, but trust me, that would have needlessly prolonged what we both knew deep down was an unhealthy, dead-end relationship,” The Onion ‘s fictional Petraeus adds. “We’re not proud of it, but it was the least painful option for everyone.” “We couldn’t go on like this forever,” according to The Onion ‘s fake Dear John letter. An Afghan soldier plays a guitar at Bagram Airfield after the depature of US forces from the base in July 2021., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul Though satirical, all of this does, in many ways, appear to reflect the actual current thinking within President Joe Biden’s Administration, which has been pushing ahead with a near-total withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan after nearly two decades of operations there. “The president has judged that a conditions-based approach, which has been the approach of the past two decades, is a recipe for staying in Afghanistan forever,” a senior U.S. official had told reporters about Biden’s withdrawal plans back in April . The initial plan had been for the pullout to be complete on or before the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which prompted the American intervention, to begin with. Now, it looks as if the entire process will be done by August. “I want to talk about happy things,” President Biden had said, exasperated, during a press conference on Friday, when asked about the withdrawal and the deteriorating security situation in the country. “I’m not going to answer any more questions about Afghanistan.” “Look, It’s the Fourth of July,” he continued. “We’re bringing our troops home. All across America, people are going to ballgames and doing good things … I’ll answer all your negative questions – not negative, legitimate questions [later on.]” The President had already made it very clear how he felt about the U.S. mission in Afghanistan on the campaign trail last year in an interview with CBS News ‘ “Face The Nation.” Then-candidate Biden said he felt he would bear “zero responsibility” if the Taliban were to return to power after an American withdrawal. “I opposed the surge in the first place,” Biden said, referring to President Barack Obama’s decision to send additional forces to Afghanistan in 2009, when he was Vice President. “When we went into this, everything seemed so perfect—that first democratic election in 2004, Operation Anaconda—those were great times. But we’ve grown so far apart since then. Sometimes it’s hard to remember why we even got involved in the first place,” another fake quote in The Onion ‘s 2011 piece, attributed to U.S. Marine Corps General James Mattis, who was head of U.S. Central Command at that time and later became President Donald Trump’s first Secretary of Defense , reads. “He assured the war-torn nation Americans would never forget about them and promised the U.S. would send several hundred million dollars back to Kabul from time to time to make sure they were getting along okay.” The Pentagon said last week that Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, who is the current CENTCOM head and is not physically in Afghanistan, is set to take over direct command authority for continued U.S. military activity in the country this month. The main office for coordinating U.S. security assistance to the government in Kabul will be relocated to Qatar. A small American military force will be positioned at Hamid Karzai International Airport in the Afghan capital. What exactly will happen to other armed U.S. personnel, including members of the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. State Department, as well as the contractors working for them, is unclear, as you can read about more in this recent War Zone piece . What might happen to the government in Kabul is equally uncertain, with the U.S. Intelligence Community having warned that it could collapse within six months of the completion of the American pullout. In addition to the reports of the members of the Afghan security forces recently fleeing into Tajikistan, there has been substantial other evidence of other units across the country collapsing entirely. The Taliban have seized hundreds of military vehicles , as well as weapons, ammunition, and other material as a result. Just today, a picture emerged online that purported to show militants with a captured Afghan Air Force Mi-8/Mi-17-type helicopter . At least some of the Taliban’s new acquisitions have also come from Afghan government forces directly as part of deals to secure their safe passage out of certain areas. This, coupled with how the withdrawal is proceeding, has opened the U.S. government up to criticism, including from major geopolitical competitors. “We are worried about this, because IS [the Islamic State] is actively acquiring territories – mostly in Northern Afghanistan, right on the borders of countries that are our allies, amid the irresponsible behavior of some officials in Kabul and amid the hasty withdrawal of NATO, who is unable to report the achievement of at least some goals,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week. There are also reports that China could be poised to increase its influence in the country after the U.S. pullout is complete. “The U.S. told us they cared and that they had our best interests at heart,” The Onion quoted a fictitious Pashtun tribal leader named Ashraf Rahman Durrani as saying in the 2011 piece. “We’re a strong, proud nation, though. We’ve been through a lot, and we’ll find a way to get through this, too.” “We have to solve our problem,” Bagram’s new real-life commander, General Kohistani, told The Associated Press . “We have to secure our country and once again build our country with our own hands.” Afghan General Mir Asadullah Kohistani, the current officer in charge of Bagram Airfield., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul Whatever happens now, the American departure from Bagram seems indicative of the inexorable nature of the current overall withdrawal plan, a decision that The Onion oddly predicted nearly 10 years ago.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Navy’s Type 45, or Daring class , destroyers will receive additional surface-to-air missiles as part of a weapons refit, marking a major increase in firepower for the warships. Once the new Sea Ceptor weapons are fitted, the six Type 45s, which provide area defense for the U.K.’s Carrier Strike Group , among other duties, will increase their air defense missile payloads by 50 percent. The U.K. Ministry of Defense today announced the $692-million refit for the Type 45s, with the 11-year contract to integrate the Sea Ceptor missile going to MBDA UK, the British arm of the pan-European missile house. The half-dozen warships will each get 24 launch cells for the new missiles, for a total of 72 air defense missiles per ship. The Type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan underway in the Persian Gulf in 2019., Crown Copyright “Enhancing our destroyer capabilities, this investment reaffirms our commitment to equip the Royal Navy with the most advanced and powerful defensive systems,” said Minister for Defense Procurement, Jeremy Quin. “This upgrade ensures the Type 45 remains hugely respected by naval fleets across the globe and secures highly-skilled jobs and investment.” “These programs will provide an exceptional capability to the front line, ensuring the RN remains poised to defend the surface fleet, and most importantly the Carrier Strike Group, against complex air threats both now and into the future,” added the Royal Navy Fleet Commander, Vice Admiral Jerry Kyd CBE. Under the refit, the Type 45 destroyers’ Sea Viper weapon systems will be fitted with a new 24-round silo for MBDA UK’s Sea Ceptor, also known as the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile, or CAMM. This launcher will be added in front of the existing 48-cell Sylver launcher for short-range Aster 15 and long-range Aster 30 surface-to-air missiles. HMS Duncan, the sixth of the Type 45 destroyers, fires an Aster 30 missile in the Atlantic., Crown Copyright In the future, the Type 45s will be armed with the 24 Sea Ceptors for close-in and local-area defense, while the original 48 Sylver cells will be used exclusively for the longer-range Aster 30 . The Sea Ceptor is derived from the air-launched ASRAAM , used by the United Kingdom and Australia, and the naval version was originally developed to replace the Cold War-era Sea Wolf missile. Compared to the ASRAAM, the Sea Ceptor family utilizes a British-made active radar seeker, rather than an American infrared seeker. Weighing around 220 pounds, the CAMM flies at a speed of Mach 2.5 and can hit a target at over 15 miles, according to official figures, although unconfirmed reports suggest it may have destroyed targets at over 35 miles during trials. In contrast, the Aster 15 weighs around 680 pounds, including its separate booster section, and has a range of around 18 miles. The Aster 30 tips the scales at around 1,000 pounds and is able to engage targets at more than 75 miles. MBDA has also confirmed that the Sea Viper command and control (C2) system will be subject to a technology upgrade, giving it “a major increase in processing power.” The 48-cell Sylver launcher on a Type 45 destroyer. There is space in front of this launcher for the new Sea Ceptor silos. , Crown Copyright As well as the new Sea Ceptor missiles, the Type 45 destroyers will also receive “a refresh” for the Aster 30s already in use. This is being covered by a separate, 10-year contract, signed with Eurosam. That work is being completed as part of a wider program, together with the navies of France and Italy, which also use the missile for outer-layer defense. This will keep the Aster 30 in service throughout the life of the Type 45s. Currently, these warships are expected to be replaced by the new Type 83 destroyer in the late 2030s. According to the U.K. Ministry of Defense, the weapons refit is enabled by an increase in defense spending amounting to around $33 billion over the next four years, a plan that was first announced last November . The plan to “boost the lethality of the surface fleet” was further outlined in the Defense Command Paper, the U.K’s latest defense review document that was released last March. There had been speculation in the past that the additional space in the Type 45s may have been used to install the American Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS), instead of Sea Ceptor cells. That would have permitted the destroyers to carry Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) as well as SM-3 or SM-6 missiles for defense against ballistic missiles and hypersonic weapons. For the Royal Navy, there remains the option to add in the future the Aster 30 Block 1NT which will also offer an anti-ballistic missile capability, while the Mk 41 will meanwhile be installed in the new Type 26 frigates . Nevertheless, the introduction of Sea Ceptor, which is already used on the Royal Navy’s upgraded Type 23 class frigates, will provide the Type 45s with an additional defensive layer. As well as tackling conventional high-speed aerial threats, the missile is also expected to engage “small, fast inshore attack craft, hovering helicopters, and low-speed targets.” In ground-launched form, the CAMM is already in service with the British Army , while the Sea Ceptor will also arm the future Type 26 and Type 31 frigates and the missile has recently been ordered by Brazil and Canada . An artist’s concept of a Sea Ceptor/CAMM launched from the forthcoming Type 26 frigate., MBDA The first Type 45 destroyer is expected to have been overhauled with the new missiles by summer 2026. The relevance of the weapons upgrade will be felt particularly by the Carrier Strike Group , the U.K.’s newly regenerated maritime task forces based around the pair of Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. F-35B jets operate from HMS Queen Elizabeth , with the aircraft carrier escorted by the Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon , during the WESTLANT maneuvers in 2019., Crown Copyright “The introduction of the UK produced CAMM missile in conjunction with the current Aster 30 missile will provide the Type 45 with a significant uplift in anti-air capability into the future as the Type 45 delivers the backbone of air defense to the Royal Navy’s Carrier Strike Group,” said Sir Simon Bollom, CEO of Defense Equipment & Support (DE&S), the Ministry of Defense’s procurement arm. In the past, The War Zone has looked at some of the deficiencies in the organic air defenses of the 70,000-ton Queen Elizabeth class carriers. These warships are equipped with three Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon systems (CIWS) , capable against traditional anti-ship cruise missiles and small unmanned aircraft and boats, but generally installed on warships as a last-ditch measure against any threats that might have “leaked” through the outer defensive layer, rather than the only defense. What is more, in a high-threat environment, an attack against a carrier is likely to involve barrages of different weapons, requiring a number of weapons and tactics to counter them. Increasingly, these threats may include higher-end hypersonic and stealthy cruise missiles . The Sea Ceptor, in particular, is claimed to offer an anti-cruise missile capability . As such, defense of the carrier rests, to a significant degree, on the Type 45s, two of which will routinely accompany each Carrier Strike Group, bolstered by other NATO vessels. For its part, the Type 45 has had problems with maintainability in the past, with some well-publicized reliability issues , especially when on deployment, leading to difficulties in putting to sea . These problems have since been addressed with an upgrade to the diesel generators as part of a two-phase program, called Project Napier. As it stands, increasing the Type 45’s air defense missile capacity from 48 to 72 weapons will provide a significant increase in total firepower to these in-demand warships, as well as helping reinforce the defensive umbrella around the Carrier Strike Groups. At the same time, the U.K. destroyer fleet is still relatively small, especially if the plan is for two of them to be part of any future Carrier Strike Group. However, outside of the Carrier Strike Groups, adding Sea Ceptor is certain to be a valuable additional defense for any grouping that a Type 45 is part of, as well as just for these ships operating independently, in general. This is especially true when operating in more contested waters, as evidenced by recent encounters with Russian warships and aircraft in the eastern Mediterranean , and in the Black Sea .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A publicly accessible webcam shows what appears to be a Chilean Navy Scorpene class submarine sailing into the Port of San Diego in southern California earlier today. Though we don’t know for sure what the purpose of its visit is, the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet has engaged with Latin American navies in the past as part of a program that offers valuable opportunities to work with, and train against, advanced diesel-electric submarines . Since 1990, the U.S. Navy has only operated nuclear-powered submarines. The submarine first appeared on the feed from San Diego Web Cam at around 3:30 PM local time. At multiple points in the stream, the Chilean national flag is seen flying atop the boat’s sail. At present, the Chilean Navy operates two Franco-Spanish Scorpene class submarines and a pair of German-made Type 209/1400-Ls , known in the country as the Thomson class. The Scorpenes are easy to separate from the Thomsons , with the former type having dive planes on the sail, while the latter does not. San Diego Web Cam capture The Chilean Scorpenes , the first of which, the O’Higgins , entered service in 2005, are fairly modern diesel-electric attack submarines. Among other things, they feature air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems, which allow them to dive for days at a time while remaining very quiet and, and as a result, difficult to detect and track. AIP-equipped diesel submarines are now proliferating around the globe and are considered major threat. Each one of the Scorpene class has six torpedo tubes that can be used to fire Black Shark heavyweight torpedoes or Exocet anti-ship cruise missiles . The reason for this submarine’s visit to San Diego is unclear and we have already reached out to U.S. Third Fleet, which is headquartered there, for more information. In 2001, the U.S. Navy did begin working with boats from various Latin American nations as part of the Diesel-Electric Submarine Initiative (DESI), a combined training program that units on the West and East Coasts take part in. Ostensibly, these combined training events are meant to give all of the participants opportunities to practice various core skills sets relating to submarine and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations, as well as help broaden ties, in general, between the U.S. military and its partners in the Southern Hemisphere. The Chilean Navy’s Scorpene class submarine Carrera ., SSBN via Wikimedia However, since the U.S. Navy does not have any diesel-electric boats of its own, DESI has also provided particularly valuable opportunities over the years for it to train against these kinds of submarines, which have distinct operational characteristics and signatures from nuclear-powered ones. “During these visits, we are able to simulate a variety of wartime scenarios against diesel submarines which adds an additional degree of difficulty and reality to fleet ASW, as diesel submarines have proven to be quiet and elusive,” Navy Lieutenant Alexander Papadakos, a member of Submarine Squadron 11, said during a DESI engagement with the Chilean Navy’s Thomson class submarine Simpson , in 2018. The Chilean Navy’s Thomson class submarine Simpson ., DOD The U.S. Navy has sought out these kinds of opportunities in different ways since 1990, when it decommissioned the Barbel class USS Blueback , its last diesel-electric attack submarine. Blueback , one of just three Barbels the Navy acquired, had served for a time at the end of its career as an aggressor due to its unique characteristics among the rest of the service’s submarine fleet. In the mid-2000s, the Navy then leased Sweden’s AIP-equipped HSwMS Gotland to serve as a diesel-electric aggressor. That period highlighted the value of being able to train against these kinds of submarines, with Gotland famously managing to sneak right into the middle of an aircraft carrier strike groups during exercises, as well as scoring simulated kills against various surface ships and other submarines during training engagements. The Navy has acquired at least two large-scale training targets designed to mimic diesel-electric submarines in the past two decades, as well. The service also operated the specialized research and development submarine USS Dolphin until 2007, which was its last commissioned diesel-electric boat of any kind. More recently, in 2019, the service stood up a new dedicated submarine aggressor squadron, or AGGRON , to help in training submarine and anti-submarine forces. However, as it exists now, this unit’s primary job is schooling Navy personnel in enemy tactics, techniques, and procedures, and helping submarines acting as the “opposing force,” or OPFOR, to better represent potential threats. At least as of last year, it has no submarines permanently assigned to it and the Navy still has no plans to acquire its own diesel-electric types, which could add greater realism to exercises. In the meantime, combined training programs, such as DESI, remain the most readily available ways for Navy submarine and anti-submarine forces to train against these threats. So, while we don’t know why exactly this Chilean Scorpene class boat is in San Diego, it is very likely there to, at least in part, provide very useful training for Navy personnel against a type of submarine they might not otherwise encounter on a routine basis during training. UPDATE: 7/2/2021 — The Chilean Navy has now officially confirmed the arrival of one of its Scorpene class submarines at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego. A Spanish-language Tweet from that service simply says that it is there “to participate in an international operation with the @USNavy.” However, after our initial story was published, a reader also alerted us to a story in the Spanish-language defense and security magazine Infodefensa that said the Chilean Navy’s Scorpene class submarine O’Higgins had left that service’s base in Talcahuano in early June and that it was heading to the United States for exercises over the next five months. “For more than five months it [the O’Higgins ] will be deployed to operate with the most modern Navy in the world and even carry out submarine rescue operations,” Rear Admiral Juan Pablo Zúñiga Alvayay, the head of the Chilean Navy’s submarine force, was quoted as saying that story. “For this, a crew of more than 40 men, and with an average age of 32 years, will represent us. We wish them success, a good hunt, and a safe return home.” Infodefensa does not specifically mention the U.S. Navy’s DESI program, but how Rear Admiral Zúñiga described the nature of the O’Higgins ‘ current deployment, especially plans to conduct submarine rescue training, is well in line with previous Chilean Navy participation in that initiative. “The highlight of the DESI deployment is CHILEMAR VIII, a submarine search and rescue exercise that will take place in August,” the U.S. Navy news item regarding the arrival of the Chilean Navy’s Thomson class submarine Simpson in San Diego in 2018 said. “Chile remains the only South American submarine-operating country to conduct frequent live submarine rescue exercises with U.S. Navy rescue assets at Undersea Rescue Command.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Diesel-Electric Submarines Navies Sea Submarines"
Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 7, 2021",South Korea’s Mysterious Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile Tested From Underwater Platform: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea has apparently joined an elite group of military powers to have successfully developed a practical submarine-launched ballistic missile , or SLBM. Although details remain scarce, local media report that a waterborne test of the missile was successful. Should Seoul now progress to fielding an operational SLBM capability on its submarine fleet, it will notably become the only non-nuclear-armed nation to introduce this type of weapon. South Korea’s YTN news broadcaster reported the successful underwater launch of an SLBM, citing confirmation from an unnamed military official. What’s not clear is the exact type of missile involved, although it appears to have been launched from a submerged barge, rather than a Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) submarine. This is standard procedure for initial tests of weapons in this class before they are taken aboard a submarine. A South Korean Hyunmoo 2 ballistic missile (left) is launched together with an MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System during a joint South Korean/United States military exercise in 2017., US Army YTN describes the SLBM involved in the test as a modified Hyunmoo 2B ballistic missile to which it attributes a maximum range of around 300 miles. The SLBM version of this weapon is reportedly known as the K-SLBM or Hyunmoo 4-4. An earlier, land-based launch of a Republic of Korea Army Hyunmoo 2B ballistic missile: This latest reported development follows the launch of an SLBM from a ground test facility at Anheung late last year . According to YTN , the ROKN is due to receive the first of its indigenous Dosan Ahn Changho class conventionally powered submarines later this month and this is expected to be the service’s first vessel capable of carrying SLBMs. Currently, the initial boat is “completing the evaluation of the torpedo decoy launch system,” according to the same source. “I assume that the Navy is still not in the phase of being able to launch SLBMs from a dived submarine,” another unnamed military official told Yonhap News . “As far as I know, however, technical development to acquire necessary capabilities is ongoing.” That would also seem to point to the fact that the ROKN will gain a submarine-based SLBM capability once the first of these new submarines is commissioned into service, possibly in the next few weeks. With that in mind, Yonhap further reports that the lead submarine in the Dosan Ahn Changho class could perform a test launch of the new SLBM “imminently.” The Dosan Ahn Changho class, which was developed under the third phase of the Korean Attack Submarine program, or KSS-III , has provision for six vertical launch system (VLS) cells that will be able to accommodate SLBMs or cruise missiles. Subsequent vessels in the class are expected to increase the capacity to 10 VLS cells. A model of the Dosan Ahn Changho class submarine., Teukwonjae707/Wikimedia Commons The Dosan Ahn Changho class is significantly bigger than any previous ROKN submarines, at around 3,000 tons, and is equipped with an advanced lithium-ion battery-based air-independent propulsion system. Despite a lack of official details, the fact that Seoul has been working on an SLBM program has been known for over five years — you can read our initial reporting on it here . Its development has paralleled studies into the practicality of a future nuclear-powered submarine . So far, however, there has been no official acknowledgment from Seoul that it intends to field SLBMs on the Dosan Ahn Changho class, although this would seem to be the only realistic option, at least in the short term. Moreover, since last month South Korea is permitted to develop ballistic missiles capable of reaching targets far beyond the Korean Peninsula after U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to scrap the previous restrictions that had been in place since 1979. Although these guidelines had been updated on several occasions, most recently they limited Seoul to developing missiles with a maximum range of 500 miles. This change could open the door to South Korea developing SLBMs with a range greater than 500 miles, and certainly in excess of the 300 miles attributed to the Hyunmoo 2B. “Without the restrictions on missile ranges, observers believe South Korea is likely to prioritize the development of intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a maximum range of 1,000-5,000 kilometers capable of reaching targets beyond the Korean Peninsula,” Defense News reported last month . “It is also possible Seoul could try developing longer-range submarine-launched ballistic missiles or conduct research on hypersonic weapons.” Still, exactly how large a missile these new submarines can hold remains to be understood, but future submarine designs could expand on its vertical launch capabilities. South Korea’s apparent SLBM ambitions have to be seen in the context of increased tensions with North Korea in recent years, as well as that country’s own submarine-launched ballistic missile developments . Of course, outside of its still-mysterious SLBM program, Pyongyang is also highly active in the development of various land-based nuclear weapons and delivery systems. An extended-range SLBM, of the type that would now be permitted with the demise of the previous restrictions, would also provide South Korea with a means of deterring potential enemies further afield, such as China and Russia. What is likely to be North Korea’s first operational nuclear-armed submarine seen under construction during one of Kim’s inspections., NK State Media Above all, though, there is the question of how South Korea would really benefit from an SLBM capability. The ROKN already has its submarine-launched cruise missiles, providing another survivable means of delivering a conventional warhead. And, should a conflict with the north escalate to a nuclear exchange, South Korea supposedly receives protection from America’s nuclear umbrella. While the status of Seoul’s nuclear-powered submarine program is currently unclear, a conventionally powered design like the Dosan Ahn Changho class once provided with SLBMs, would provide something akin to a second-strike capability , albeit conventional, to help to deter an attack from the north. During a conflict, South Korea sees its increasingly capable ballistic missile arsenal as essential to hitting critical targets throughout the north, and the kinetic energy provided by a ballistic missile allows for far greater penetration against bunkers and critical regime targets than cruise missiles or most direct attack weapons. They are also far harder to defend against. You can read all about this strategy here . A Republic of Korea Navy test of a domestically designed submarine-launched land-attack cruise missile: Then there is the prospect that, ultimately, Seoul is eyeing a nuclear payload for its emerging SLBMs. It’s possible that South Korea views an independent nuclear deterrent as the ultimate safeguard against North Korean aggression but, again, there is no official word on this. However, an argument could be made that an advanced submarine armed with nuclear-tipped SLBMs would be one way of warding off the threat from the north without the need to rely on the United States. This all comes as North Korea looks set to deploy its first nuclear-armed submarine in the not too distant future. It remains to be seen just how South Korea will continue with its SLBM program, when we might see these weapons deployed, and if there are longer-term plans for increased-range missiles and even nuclear warheads. It could be the case that Seoul is pursuing an SLBM onto which a nuclear warhead could be added as an insurance option of sorts, should North Korea dramatically expand its own undersea nuclear arsenal and/or if the geopolitical winds change between it and its long-time national security partner, the United States. As it is, a conventional SLBM offers only limited deterrence value and doesn’t significantly alter the strategic balance in the region. For now, however, reports of this successful underwater missile test suggest that the country has joined the select group of nations able to design and successfully test its own SLBMs. Bearing in mind the difficulties in mastering these technologies, this is a significant achievement in itself.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",MREs Are Fine Dining Compared To What Troops Ate In The Revolutionary War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s nearly July 4th, happy birthday America! As we all celebrate Independence Day in our own ways, it’s important to remember the brave men and women who made immense sacrifices during the American Revolution. Like in any conflict, soldiers fighting for American independence saw their share of hardships and horrors. The Revolutionary War in many ways was a testing ground for a variety of new heavy weaponry , small arms , and even naval mines that would lead to new levels of destruction and change warfare forever. Aside from these advances in weapons, it also brought about another major sea change in terms of how armies wage war: the reliance on preserved foods that could be carried by soldiers and last for extended periods of time. One of the many firsts the war for American independence brought about was U.S. soldier ration requirements, established by a Congressional Resolution in 1775. In some ways, the American Revolution can be seen as the birthplace of modern MREs. George Washington, the first President of the United States and the General who led the Continental Army to victory, wrote an order in 1776 declaring each man should carry two days’ worth of provisions upon hand. While these foods were most often flavorless, preserved staples that were difficult to stomach, they nonetheless were vital in keeping Continental soldiers fueled for battle. Hardtack and salt pork were common fare for the Continental Army, Military Collector & Historian /John Rees In An Edible History of Humanity , Tom Standage writes that “For most of human history, food was literally the fuel of war.” Before the advent of industrialized food production and modern food preservation, many wars were won or lost based on which force could keep its soldiers fed. “Logistical considerations alone do not determine the outcome of military conflicts,” Standage writes in the book, “but unless an army is properly fed, it cannot get to the battlefield in the first place.” The American Revolutionary War was no different. Continental Army leaders made plans to keep soldiers adequately fed in the field, but of course, best-laid plans often go awry. According to Defense Logistics Agency historians, the Continental Congress made attempts to ensure troops were given “simple but portable and shelf-stable fare” at the beginning of the conflict with Great Britain. In 1775, the Continental Congress wrote a resolution declaring that daily rations for each soldier would be: 1 lb. of beef, or 3/4 lb. pork, or 1 lb. salt fish, per day. 1 lb. of bread or flour per day. 3 pints of peas, or beans per week, or vegetables equivalent, at one dollar per bushel for peas or beans. 1 pint of milk per man per day, or at the rate of 1/72 of a dollar. 1 half pint of Rice, or 1 pint of Indian meal [corn meal] per man per week. 1 quart of spruce beer or cyder per man per day, or nine gallons of Molasses per company of 100 men per week. 3 lb. candles to 100 Men per week for guards. 24 lb. of soft or 8 lb. of hard soap for 100 men per week. These plans sound decadent in comparison to what troops would later encounter in the field as the war raged on and supplies ran scarce. There were plenty of times when these weren’t available. Vegetables were especially difficult to come by, so much so that soldiers were given a ration of vinegar in an attempt to ward off scurvy. The Continental Congress penned a November 4, 1775 resolution establishing standard rations., Public Domain In situations when rations were scarce, which was more often than not, many Continental Army soldiers had to resort to subsisting on what was known as biscuit, fire cake, or hardtack . This simple flour and water dough was baked into hard, flavorless cakes that were often so dry that soldiers had to soak each bite in water, broth, or tea in order to eat it. If Continental soldiers were lucky, the mixture wouldn’t be absolutely ridden with insects. They often weren’t. A hardtack biscuit from 1784, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London Writing in the journal Military Collector & Historian, author John Rees notes that “For troops on the move, commanders preferred biscuit and salt meats; especially in warm weather when they needed to issue several days rations at one time and there were inherent food spoilage problems.” The need to have ready-to-eat rations on hand was underscored by General George Washington, who wrote on September 2, 1776 that “the commanding Officers of Corps will never, in future, suffer their men to have less than two days provisions, always upon hand, ready for any emergency – If hard Bread cannot be had, Flour must be drawn, and the men must bake it into bread, or use it otherwise in the most agreeable manner they can.” A reenactor cooks simple corncakes at the American Revolution Museum in Yorktown, Virginia., Library of Congress One soldier’s account states that his rations consisted mostly of “mostly corned beef and hard bread,” which could be “hard enough to break the teeth of a rat.” A German Hessian soldier fighting in the Revolutionary War on behalf of the British wrote that he “received biscuit instead of bread for entire years,” eventually becoming so used to it that he eventually “preferred biscuit to bread.” Pennsylvania Fifer Samuel Dewees of the 11th Pennsylvania Regiment wrote an account of what Continental soldiers’ ate during the war, including how biscuit was often made of “shipstuff,” the lowest quality flour available: Sometimes we had one biscuit and a herring per day, and often neither the one nor the other. Sometimes we had neither the one nor the other for two days at a time, and in one or two instances nothing until the evening of the third day. This was previous to our drawing a biscuit and a herring each day, the biscuit was made of shipstuff and they were so hard that a hammer or a substitute therefore was requisite to break them. This, or throw them to soak in boiling water, upon these, a biscuit and a herring each day, the soldiers lived until their mouths broke out with scabs, and their throats became as sore and raw as a piece of uncooked meat. A recipe for biscuit from 1815 describes the process for making the semi-edible dough as follows: BISCUIT, Sea, is a sort of bread much dried, to make it keep for the use of the navy, and is good for a whole year after it is baked. The process of biscuit-making for the navy is simple and ingenious, and is nearly as follows: A large lump of dough, consisting merely of flower and water, is mixed up together, and placed exactly in the centre of a raised platform, where a man sits upon a machine, called a horse, and literally rides up and down throughout its whole circular direction, till the dough is equally indented, and this is repeated till the dough is sufficiently kneaded. In this state it is handed over to a second workman, who, with a large knife, puts it in a proper state for the use of those bakers who more immediately attend the oven. Adequate food supplies were most difficult to come by during the brutal winter that spanned from late 1777 to mid-1778 when General George Washington and his men were encamped at Valley Forge. During this time, food was so scarce that many of Washington’s soldiers threatened mutiny, and were known to chant “No bread, no meat, no soldier.” Like in many conflicts throughout history, the Continental Army resorted to foraging when food was difficult to come by, or worse, pillaging or theft. Officers often turned a blind eye to their troops raiding colonial settlements for sustenance. A recreation of a Revolutionary War-era Quartermaster’s quarters, Library of Congress British forces likewise struggled to keep their troops fed, compounded by their requirement to keep their Army supplied from across the Atlantic. In Major Eric A. McCoy’s article “The Impact of Logistics on the British Defeat in the Revolutionary War” published in Army Sustainment Magazine, McCoy writes that “the problems of supplying the army from Great Britain were great, and the most serious challenge was that of shipping food over such a tremendous distance.” This reliance on imported foods and supplies proved to be a compounding factor in Britain’s defeat during the American Revolution. “In theory, the British should easily have been able to put down the rebellion among their American colonists,” Tom Standage claims in An Edible History of Humanity . “Britain was the greatest military and naval power of its day, presiding over a vast empire. In practice, however, supplying an army of tens of thousands of men operating some three thousand miles away posed enormous difficulties. […] The British failure to provide adequate food supplies to its troops was not the only cause of its defeat, and of America’s subsequent independence. But it was a very significant one.” A reenactment of Continental Army troops storming Yorktown., Public Domain It wasn’t just shipping challenges that hindered the British food supply, however. The American colonies hired private citizens to engage in piracy, an act known at the time as “ privateering .” These civilian ships were authorized to harass or capture British ships, seizing their cargo and selling it back to the colonies. Writing in Army Sustainment , McCoy outlines the losses these privateers were able to inflict on British supply lines: American privateers authorized to intercept British cargo also took their toll. Only 13 of the convoy’s ships eventually made it to Boston, and very little of their cargo survived. Only the preserved food (such as sauerkraut, vinegar, and porter) arrived intact. Most of the other provisions were rotten, damaged, or dead; only 148 of the livestock survived. Out of 856 horses shipped, only 532 survived the voyage. This convoy marked the last time that Britain attempted to ship fresh food and livestock to its army. When supplies ran low, British forces resorted to foraging. This exposed many Redcoats to ambushes and other guerilla tactics carried out by Colonial forces, and McCoy notes that “British losses in these types of skirmishes soon equaled those suffered in larger pitched battles.” A Revolutionary War-era camp at a reenactment, AP/Mel Evans Fast forward to today, and rations have come a long way. While modern MREs (Meal, Ready to Eat) earn nicknames such as “Meals Rejected by Everyone,” “Meals Rarely Edible” or variations of digestive euphemisms like “Meals Refusing to Exit,” these rations are nonetheless a massive improvement on the salted, dried meats and semi-edible hardtack carried by the soldiers of the Revolution. A modern “Ham and Shrimp Jambalaya” MRE, Public Domain That’s not to say hardtack has completely gone away. The simple, shelf-stable “bread” is still a common item for survival kits used in maritime operations or even by long-distance backpackers. Hardtack can still be found in some MRE kits around the world today. A Vietnam-era airman’s C-ration kit containing hardtack biscuits, Public Domain The role that food supplies played in the American Revolutionary War underscores the fact that wars aren’t always won by weaponry and tactics alone. Logistical concerns like how to ensure soldiers are properly fed in the field take just as much precedence as combat supremacy does. General George Washington and the Continental Congress saw this need for soldiers to have ready-to-eat foods with a long shelf life 225 years ago, paving the way for modern MRE delights such as the reviled Chicken a la King or the infamous Veggie “vomelet” Omelette . This Independence Day, as you’re firing up the grill and cracking a cold one, remember the culinary sacrifices made not just by the Continental Army, but by all U.S. troops in the field. If you really want to honor their sacrifice, maybe even consider adding some hardtack to your menu. Bon appétit! Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com Brett Tingley Land Land Warfare History"
