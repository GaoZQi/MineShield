By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of the newest additions to the U.S. Department of State’s Air Wing , ex-U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters of various types, are now flying in Afghanistan. Though the department has been conducting a variety of aviation operations there for more than a decade now, the Black Hawks provide support to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. This is a mission that could be even more important in the coming weeks and months as the withdrawal of American military forces from the country continues to move ahead at a brisk pace and if the security situation continues to deteriorate. The presence of the State Department Black Hawks in Afghanistan, which are painted in a distinctive blue-over-gray paint scheme with a red cheatline along the center of the fuselage, was highlighted back in April when U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to the country. At least three of these helicopters, with the U.S. civil registration codes N35WN, N36LN, and N771WC, all of which are HH-60L variants , helped shuttle Blinken, members of his entourage, and other officials around Kabul during that visit. A US State Department HH-60L Black Hawk helicopter in Afghanistan during Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit in April 2021., US State Department In Army service, the HH-60Ls, which have been steadily replaced by newer HH-60Ms , were primarily configured for casualty evacuation missions. They are readily distinguishable from standard UH-60 utility variants by the duckbill-like sponsons on their noses. A sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras can be installed underneath, though the available pictures and video of State Department examples do not show them with any such systems fitted. A US Army HH-60L Black Hawk at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan in 2006., Stephan de Bruijn via AirHistory.net The State Department HH-60Ls, which are used primarily as personnel transports, have a variety of antennas on top and below their fuselages not found on their Army counterparts, suggesting they have received a more robust communications package. This would make good sense, especially for the ones in Afghanistan, which, as already noted, can find themselves moving around senior officials, including the Secretary of State. At least some of these State Department Black Hawks, which are all contractor-operated, have 7.62mm M240 machine guns mounted in the crew chief windows on either side of the helicopter. They also have launchers for decoy flares on the tail boom . It’s not clear when the first State Department Black Hawks arrived in Afghanistan, but it appears to have occurred sometime in the last year or so. The Air Wing, formally known as the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs’ Office of Aviation, or INL/A, had begun acquiring these helicopters by 2018, as you can read more about in this past War Zone feature . It presently has nine of them, all HH-60Ls, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). However, during a visit in March 2020, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rode in ex-U.S. Marine Corps CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, which had been the primary State Department helicopter in use in the country for years at that point. It’s also unclear whether any of the CH-46s, or any other Air Wing helicopters, also remain in use in Afghanistan now that the Black Hawks have arrived. A State Department Air Wing CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter inside the US Embassy complex in Kabul in March 2020 during then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit. Note that this helicopter is also armed with at least one M240 machine gun and fitted with dispensers loaded with decoy flares., US State Department For years now, primarily for security reasons, Air Wing helicopters have been the default means of getting between Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul and the U.S. Embassy, despite the distance between the two only being around two miles. This operation is known as Embassy Air and a similar arrangement also exists in Iraq. The extremely short State Department helicopter rides in Afghanistan have been relatively pricey, with the individual round-trip “ticket” cost to the U.S. government for these brief jaunts reportedly rising to $2,250 in 2019. As a result, Embassy Air has been somewhat controversial in the past, as you can read about more here. Any past controversies notwithstanding, the Air Wing’s Black Hawks in Afghanistan, and any other helicopters it operates there, could become very significant assets in the near future. After almost two decades of operations in the country, the U.S. military is on pace to meet President Joe Biden’s deadline of having withdrawn almost entirely by September , a pullout that has already been moving ahead very quickly and that may well be complete as soon as August . Other members of the NATO-led coalition in the country are also steadily withdrawing . Just today, U.S. officials announced that there were no more American or other foreign military personnel at Bagram Airfield , a large base in Afghanistan Parwan Province just north of Kabul that had long served as one of the coalition’s major operational hubs. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby also revealed at a briefing today that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had approved a plan to shift command authority for operations in Afghanistan from U.S. Army General Scott Miller , the current head of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan and the NATO Resolute Support Mission, to U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). This transfer of authority to a much higher-level officer outside of the country, which is set to take place this month, is a clear reflection on the dwindling size of the U.S. military’s presence in Afghanistan. The main office in charge of U.S. military security cooperation with the Afghan government will also move to Qatar. A smaller U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (Forward) command element will subsequently be established in Kabul. What the exact U.S. military force posture will look like in the end is unclear, with reports suggesting that up to 1,000 personnel could remain to perform various missions. These could include advising and liaising with Afghan security forces and providing security for any remaining American facilities in the country, such as the Embassy. In April, CNN had reported that the U.S. military was actually deploying a 650-person contingency force, primarily drawn from the U.S. Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment, an elite special operations unit, to bolster security amid the ongoing withdrawal. Whatever that precense is “will remain focused on four things over the course of the coming period. One, protecting our diplomatic presence in the country,” Press Secretary Kirby said at his briefing today. “Two, supporting security requirements at Hamid Karzai International Airport. Three, continued advice and assistance to Afghan National Defense and Security Forces as appropriate. And four, supporting our counterterrorism efforts.” What other U.S. forces, such as Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) paramilitary personnel and specialized units from the State Department, to include elements of the Air Wing, will remain is also still unclear. The Embassy in Kabul itself has been operating at a reduced level since April, when non-essential staff made an “ordered departure” from the country. Approximately 4,000 personnel, including Afghan nationals and private contractors, in addition to diplomatic staff, continue to work there, according to Politico . It’s also worth noting that the United States does not presently have a formal ambassador to Afghanistan, with chargé d’affaires Ross Wilson presently running the Embassy. Chargé d’affaires Ross Wilson., US Department of State Politico had also reported today about potential events that could force the U.S. Embassy to further reduce its staff or shut down entirely based on a list of unclassified “decision points” from a three-year-old version of an Emergency Action Plan that the outlet obtained. These points, which include more mundane triggers, such as acts of terrorism or violent protests, would not all automatically lead to dramatic action. However, some of them, including the outbreak of a pandemic, a major factor facing anyone working there now , are clearly more serious than others. The “anticipated long-term or actual disruption of utilities, fuel, water, goods, and services (including means of communications), which eliminates [the embassy’s] ability to maintain safe and healthy conditions for staff” would certainly prompt major discussions about the viability of continued operations at the Embassy, as would if “the security situation in Afghanistan deteriorates such that security forces in Kabul are diminished or otherwise unavailable, weakening the host government’s ability to respond to … requests for security support.” When it comes to the Air Wing’s mission, another one of the decision points has to do with whether or not there is “ground and/or air access” to Hamid Karzai International Airport or if “commercial flights become limited or stopped.” Separately, U.S. and NATO officials have been negotiating with Turkish authorities about having that country’s forces continue to help secure Hamid Karzai International Airport after all the other withdrawals are complete. As it stands now, there are already significant concerns about the ability of the government in Kabul to continue providing security across the country, with the Taliban having made significant territorial gains in recent weeks. That militant group, the chief opponent to Afghanistan’s current central government, has also seized hundreds of vehicles , as well as other weapons, ammunition, and other equipment, from Afghan security forces, who, in some cases, have turned that materiel over directly in exchange for safe passage out of certain areas. “A civil war is certainly a path that can be visualized if this continues on the trajectory it’s on right now, that should be of concern to the world,” General Miller said earlier this week . “We are looking very carefully at the security on the ground in Afghanistan and we’re also looking very hard at whether the Taliban is, at all, serious about a peaceful resolution of the conflict,” Secretary of State Blinken said at a separate press conference last week. These security concerns are not limited to Afghanistan’s countrysides, either. The Associated Press reported that a local Afghan official had claimed that there had been little to no coordination regarding the transfer of Bagram to the country’s central authorities and that looters had quickly gained access before government forces could secure the base. Kabul itself has long been at risk of insurgent and terrorist attacks. In 2017, the U.S. military had announced plans to expand the boundaries of the highly secure “green zone” area in the city, in which the U.S. Embassy, other foreign diplomatic missions, and major government facilities are situated, over concerns about Afghan authorities ability to police adjacent areas. The U.S. Intelligence Community has also reportedly assessed that the Afghan government could collapse within six months of the end of the U.S. military withdrawal. That, in turn, has prompted many to make comparisons to the fall of Saigon in 1975, which spelled the end of South Vietnam as a state and produced iconic, if embarrassing imagery of the scramble by Americans and others to flee the country. This includes the famous image of a mob of people attempting to reach a Bell Huey helicopter belonging to CIA front company Air America sitting on a helipad on top of the CIA’s annex in Saigon. At the very end, there was similar pictures and video of U.S. military helicopters evacuating the nearby Embassy as part of Operation Frequent Wind . A fear now, of course, might be that similar scenes involving the State Department’s Black Hawks could soon emerge from Afghanistan. Of course, even if the country’s central government persists for a protracted period of time after the end of the planned pullout of U.S. troops from the country wraps up in the next few months, Air Wing helicopters are likely to become an even more important means of getting U.S. personnel safely around Kabul.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 13, 2018",Watch Pilots Get Rescued After Their Ditched 737 Sank Off Oahu (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still emerging about the dramatic rescue of the pilot and co-pilot of a Boeing 737 freighter belonging to Transair Cargo after they to ditched their plane off the coast of Hawaii early this morning. The U.S. Coast Guard says that personnel onboard one of its MH-65 Dolphin helicopters had to hoist one of the individuals out of the water after the plane sunk in waters 150 feet deep. They offered to do the same for the other Transair crew member, who had scrambled on top of cargo that the plane had been carrying that was floating nearby, but they declined and were subsequently picked up by a boat from the Honolulu Fire Department. Transair Flight T4810, a Boeing 737-275C that carries the U.S. civil registration code N810TA, came down off Hawaii at around 1:40 AM this morning, local time. The crew had reported an unspecified engine malfunction shortly after taking off from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. They attempted to return to the airport before being forced to ditch, according to a statement the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provided to CNN . FAA, as well as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), will investigate the mishap. “Around 1:40 AM local time the USCG Joint Rescue Coordination Center [JRCC] Honolulu received a report of a downed Boeing 737 inter-island transport plane with 02 POB [personnel on board] approximately 02 NM [nautical miles] south of Kalaeloa, Oahu,” the public affairs office for the 14th Coast Guard District, which is headquartered in Honolulu, told The War Zone . The JRCC immediately directed the launch of the MH-65, as well as an HC-130 Hercules fixed-wing search-and-rescue aircraft, from nearby Air Station Barbers Point. A stock photo of a US Coast Guard MH-65 helicopter conducting hoist operations., DOD A Coast Guard HC-130 Hercules search-and-rescue aircraft., USCG The Sentinel class cutter USCGC Joseph Gerczak was conducting routine operations in the area and was also redirected to the area and another small boat was deployed from Honolulu to where the plane had ditched. “Sector Honolulu requested assistance through local first responders,” the 14th Coast Guard District. The Sentinel class cutter USCGC Joseph Gerczak , USCG The Coast Guard has offered details about what sounds like a dramatic rescue of the Transair crew. “Around 2:30 AM the MH-65 located the white/orange Boeing 737 TransAir cargo plane in a debris field and observed the two persons,”  the 14th Coast Guard District explained to The War Zone . “The MH-65 made visual contact with the two persons.” The video below shows a Transair Cargo 737 landing at Kahului Airport in Hawaii last year. “One survivor was located on the tail of the aircraft, went into the water as the plane sunk, and was hoisted by the MH-65 and transported to Queen’s Medical Center for evaluation; the other survivor was located on top of some floating packages, declined a hoist, and was picked up by a Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) rescue boat for transport to shore,” the statement continued. “The aircraft apparently sunk approximately 1.5NM south of [sic] Ewa Beach, in approximately 150 FT [feet] of water.” “Our crews often train closely with our counterparts in the Honolulu Fire Department for situations just like this one,” Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Masato Nakajima, a Sector Honolulu watchstander, said in a separate statement . “That training paid off and we were able to quickly deploy response assets to the scene and recover the two people aboard the aircraft.” Hawaii News Now subsequently reported that the crew member that the Coast Guard pulled from the water is presently in critical condition, while the individual that the Honolulu Fire Department Boat rescued is in serious condition “with a head injury and multiple lacerations. The Coast Guard said that it planned to evaluate the extent of any possible pollution resulting from the mishap when the sun came up. Exactly what happened remains unclear, publicly available air traffic control recordings indicate that the engine issue developed quickly and was very serious. “We’ve lost number one engine and we’re coming straight to the airport,” one crew member can be heard saying at one point in the audio, which you can listen to in full below. “We’re going to lose the other engine, too. It’s running very hot.” Transair Cargo, which started operations in 1982, regularly flies cargo between Hawaii’s individual islands on its fleet of Boeing 737 and Shorts SD3-60-300 cargo planes. The company’s 737’s are definitely aging, with the one that went down today having rolled off the assembly line in 1975. The War Zone has reached out to the company for comment about the incident. In the meantime we can only hope that the two Transair crew members will now fully recover from their ordeal and that the crash will not have any lasting environmental impact. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 3:30 PM EST — Transair Cargo has provided the following statement from CEO Teimour Riahi: Early this morning one of our cargo aircraft made an emergency water landing offshore of Oahu after reporting engine trouble. Two employed flight crew were aboard. Both were rescued by first responders and are receiving medical care. We are working with the Coast Guard, the FAA and NTSB to secure the scene and investigate the cause. Our most immediate concern is the care and recovery of our colleagues. We will provide additional information as soon as it becomes available. UPDATE: 5:45 PM EST — Twitter user @JCTorrisi has alerted us to interviews that KHON2 News , a local Fox/CW affiliate in Hawaii, did with Coast Guard MH-65 pilots and rescue swimmers that were involved in the response to this mishap. You can watch those interviews in full, which provide interesting additional perspectives, below.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 15, 2020",Flanker Fighter Appears Among Unmanned Aircraft At China’s Secretive Test Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States is publicly pursuing its Skyborg artificial intelligence program —among other associated initiatives —that is mainly focused on infusing unmanned combat aircraft with advanced autonomous capabilities , but it could also work as a copilot of sorts for manned platforms. Now there seem to be indications that China could be test-flying a similar concept on a J-16 Flanker fighter. This is part of a broader push by both countries’ air arms to rapidly enhance their unmanned capabilities, including the development of manned-unmanned teaming and optionally manned air combat concepts. The War Zone obtained a satellite image dated June 1 of China’s secretive test base near Malan in Xinjiang province, which is known to be on the leading edge of the country’s unmanned military aircraft development efforts. The photo shows a lineup of various drones being tested at the base, all of which have been previously identified, outside of the large unmanned aircraft hangars that line a long taxiway that services the western extension of the base. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION These line-up displays of unmanned aircraft that the site is actively working to develop are hardly new . In fact, they have become an odd staple of the facility. What makes this lineup different from those in the past is that it includes a variant of a manned Flanker fighter among the unmanned aircraft. While manned fighters do visit the main ramp of the base fairly regularly for training and development purposes, we have never seen the base’s unmanned aircraft intermixed with a manned aircraft like this before, and there could be a very good reason for it. A 2019 satellite image showing a highly impressive lineup of unmanned aircraft being tested at Malan. , Uncredited/Chinese Internet Another impressive lineup of unmanned aircraft arranged on the runway at Malan for some sort of photo opportunity. The image was taken on 10/27/2020 and shows a few types that are not easily identified, including some flying wings drones. , PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION At first glance, we thought this could be an unmanned or optionally manned Flanker derivative that is undergoing testing, or something to do with aerial teaming of manned and unmanned aircraft—a capability that China is actively developing . While any of those possibilities remain possibilities, it also appears that an AI infusion program may indeed be underway that leverages just such an aircraft as a surrogate. Such a program has huge potential to impact other aerial unmanned systems, as well as manned ones, in the PLA’s inventory. @Rupprecht_A, who keeps a very close eye on airpower developments out of China, posted about a possible J-16 AI testbed last March: Could this be the same aircraft seen at Malan? It’s possible. It would also make sense why it would be tested at a base that spearheads the country’s unmanned air combat development initiatives. Using a surrogate fighter for a synthetic pilot AI ‘brain’ before it is moved to an unmanned asset also makes sense. Still, we can’t say for sure what this aircraft is capable of or why it ended up among some very unique counterparts on the UAS ramp at Malan, but it seems somewhat unlikely to be just a coincidence or a chase plane or something along those lines, but that’s always possible. We also do know that China has piped up recently about its own trials that pit its pilots against an AI adversary in simulated combat. While these tests could have been simulated, we have no clue about the broader focus of such an initiative and if it mirrors Skyborg, which is now flying on actual unmanned platforms. An image on what appears to be Malan’s main runway of Wing Loong drones and their crews. The base’s use as a drone development center dates back at least to the early stages of the Wing Loong program., Uncredited/Chinese Military With all that being said, even an optionally manned or completely unmanned Flanker—a type which serves as the heavy fighter backbone of China’s air arms—could work as a valuable surrogate testbed for other unmanned concepts and it could have valuable combat capabilities in its own right even without an AI-enabled ‘brain.’ So, the lone Flanker among advanced Chinese drones at Malan will remain a bit of mystery, at least for now.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 14, 2021",Space Force Plans To Place New Early Warning Satellites Into Non-Traditional Orbits Closer To Earth,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Space Force is considering tests of Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared System early-warning satellites in Medium Earth Orbit, or MEO, as early as 2022. Placing the satellites in these non-traditional orbits would allow them to observe potential missile launch sites for longer periods of time than would be possible from Low Earth Orbit, or LEO. In addition, placing early warning and other missile defense satellites in MEO could ensure the service’s ability to detect and track threats with a smaller number of satellites than would be needed if a constellation was placed in LEO. At the same time, they could provide much-needed increased flexibility and fidelity over their forbearers that remain in geostationary orbit. Breaking Defense was first to report that officials at the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) had stated they could start building “real flight hardware” for MEO missile defense missions after contractors deliver digital models of prototype satellites in November 2022. Medium Earth Orbits (MEO) fall between traditional Low Earth Orbits (LEO) and Geostationary Orbits (GEO), in the range of around 3,100 miles to 12,400 miles. The focus on MEO shows Space Force’s growing commitment to utilizing a wider range of orbits for space-based missions, a goal Space Force Lieutenant General John Thompson, head of SMC, emphasized last year when he said that “all orbital regimes are on the table” when it comes to the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared System, or Next-Gen OPIR. Concept art from Raytheon, Raytheon via YouTube “The ability to combat future threats that span from cruise and ballistic to fast-flying hypersonics requires a diverse, resilient missile warning/track custody architecture,” Paul Meyer, vice president of Space & C2 Systems for Raytheon Intelligence & Space, also said in a press release announcing Raytheon’s prototype agreement with Space Force. “And operating in Medium Earth Orbit is a critical layer in that architecture.” SatelliteToday.com As part of this effort to develop a missile tracking layer in MEO, SMC awarded contracts in May 2021 to Raytheon and Millennium Space Systems for digital models of Missile Track Custody Prototype (MTCP) designs. These models will be used to test Next-Gen OPIR sensor designs in a digital environment before any real satellites are built. Next-Gen OPIR sensors are designed to detect the bright infrared plumes generated by missile launches and pinpoint their locations, passing that data on to other satellites and ground-based sensors for continuous tracking. SMC will be reviewing those designs to determine which, if any, could satisfy the requirements for an MEO Missile Track Custody Prototype. Space Force Colonel Brian Denaro, Division Chief for the Strategic Systems Division at SMC’s Space Development Corps, said that the center could, at that point, “theoretically pivot to building real flight hardware, because we’ll have the maturity of that design that we’re confident … can be launched into orbit.” Space Force Colonel Timothy Sejba, SMC’s program executive officer for space development, said in May that these digital prototypes are “a key component of SMC’s Digital Engineering strategy, enabling the government to incorporate and connect multiple contractor models in an automated digital environment.” Using digital prototypes offers SMC what Sejba calls a “digital ‘try it before you buy it’ approach” allowing Space Force to estimate costs, schedule, and performance variables with precise computer modeling. The Department of the Air Force designated its first block of Next-Gen OPIR satellites as a “Go Fast” acquisition program in 2018. As part of that program, Lockheed Martin was awarded $2.9 billion to develop three of these satellites intended for GEO, while Northrop Grumman is building an additional two intended for polar orbits. SMC plans to launch the first of the GEO satellites in 2025 or 2026, and to have the entire constellation in orbit by 2029. Documentation from Space Force’s FY 2022 budget requests show the service requested $2.45 billion for the Next-Gen OPIR program next fiscal year: DOD The mainstays of the United States’ existing space-based early-warning capabilities are relatively small number of large GEO satellites known as the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), which you can read about in more detail here . SBIRS sensors are sensitive enough to detect events ranging from ballistic missile launches , to even artillery fire or aircraft exploding in the sky . In addition, the Air Force has operated Defense Support Program (DSP) infrared early-warning satellites. which orbit the Earth 22,000 miles away in GEO. Still, there are some emerging threats, such as highly maneuverable hypersonic boost-glide vehicles , which these existing GEO satellites are not designed to detect and track. “Hypersonic targets are 10 to 20 times dimmer than what the U.S. normally tracks by satellites in geostationary orbit,” former Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Mike Griffin had stated in the past, according to the Congressional Research Service . Thus, aside from the existing GEO SBIRS satellites, the Space Development Agency (SDA) awarded close to $350 million in 2020 to develop an LEO Tracking Layer that consists of constellations of small satellites capable of wide field of view (WFOV) OPIR detection. These LEO satellites could be used to provide fire control tracking data for interceptors launched to neutralize hypersonic glide vehicles, a planned capability you can read more about here . Each satellite in LEO passes overhead very quickly, however, meaning a large number of satellites are needed for wide-area coverage. Maintaining these large, distributed constellations during a time of war could require rapid space launch capabilities , which Space Force has been developing at a break-neck pace . An illustration of the planned National Defense Space Architecture featuring satellites and assets in a range of orbits., DOD Space Force’s recent focus on missions in non-traditional orbits , including some at the farthest reaches of orbital space , underscores the increasingly vital role that space assets will play in a wide range of operations moving forward. The many different layers of space-based sensors and satellites continue to be a critical enabler of America’s missile defenses. Existing early warning satellite systems are primarily designed to remain stationary to stare at large swathes of the globe for infrared plumes generated by ballistic missile launches, but even these satellites have difficulty tracking ballistic missiles once they detach from their boosters and go “cold” during the midcourse phase of their flight . The U.S. military is developing a Midcourse Tracking Sensor system to help address this problem, but it remains unknown when that system could be deployed operationally. The longer dwell times of MEO satellites across broader areas could offer improved persistence and tracking potential compared to LEO systems, while their closer proximity to the planet could help better enable them to detect and track dimmer objects, such as hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, which are difficult to impossible to track post-boost phase for existing GEO satellites. This could give a missile defense architecture that includes an MEO satellite layer the capability to track threats beyond ballistic missiles and hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, potentially including hypersonic cruise missiles. Even if this is a secondary capability beyond their primary early warning function that overlaps with an LEO tracking constellation. MEO also adds a layer of survivability to satellites compared to LEO or even GEO. Of course, large constellations of small satellites in LEO also have their advantages in terms of resiliency and survivability. Matters of persistence and total coverage, as well as tracking capabilities and survivability, are key considerations for any missile defense-related satellite layer, and different orbits enable their own unique capabilities. Ultimately, no one layer or constellation is going to be optimized to detect and track every type of threat. For that reason, it’s increasingly looking like missile defense duties will rely less on the small numbers of GEO satellites that make up existing systems like SBIRS and fall instead to a layered network of satellites in LEO, MEO, and GEO, offering a wide range of capabilities and coverage, some of which may overlap, from multiple levels of space.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 2, 2021",Is China Reviving America’s Cold War-Era “Shell Game” ICBM Deployment Strategy?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent satellite imagery indicates that China may be building a large intercontinental ballistic missile , or ICBM, field, with more than 100 silos in the northwestern portion of the country. The appearance of the site, much bigger than anything like it that China has ever built before, suggests that Beijing might be eying concept for a more survivable ICBM deterrent, in which potentially large numbers of silos are filled with only a few functional missiles, presenting enemies with a much more challenging target, should they wish to destroy it in a first strike. Intriguingly, that would echo an idea that the United States was looking to implement for its own ICBMs toward the end of the Cold War. The apparent ICBM field was identified in satellite images of a patch of the Gobi Desert near Yumen in China’s Gansu province and was brought to wider attention by an article in the Washington Post yesterday. The original analysis came from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies and is based on imagery provided by private firm Planet Labs. The upper stage of a DF-5B ICBM, as shown in a military parade in Beijing in 2015. DF-5 series missiles are currently China’s only silo-based ICBMs., IceUnshattered/Wikimedia Commons According to those researchers, the evidence, so far, reveals that construction has begun on at least 119 silos, over an area of more than 700 square miles, which would represent a significant expansion of the country’s strategic nuclear firepower. Until now, the country’s non-mobile ICBMs have been limited to around 18 silos for DF-5A and DF-5B missiles, also referred to by the U.S. government as the CSS-4 Mod 2 and CSS-4 Mod 3, respectively. The latter type carries a number of multiple independent reentry vehicles , or MIRVs. There have also been reports that the Chinese might be developing an improved DF-5C missile, as well as a silo-based version of their new DF-41 ICBM , which U.S. officials also call the CSS-X-10. As well as the new silos, a close examination of the Yumen site by the U.S. researchers at the James Martin Center has revealed apparent construction of underground bunkers, cable trenches, roads, and a small military base. “We believe China is expanding its nuclear forces in part to maintain a deterrent that can survive a US first strike in sufficient numbers to defeat US missile defenses,” Dr. Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on missiles and nuclear weapons at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies told the Washington Post . It is notable that China is one of the few, and perhaps even the only nuclear-armed power to have declared no first use policy. A potentially intriguing aspect of the construction is that the thinking behind it could be revisiting America’s Cold War-era ‘shell game’ concept, in which a significant number of silos would be built, but only a few of them would be actually loaded with ICBMs. This would leave opponents unsure of where the missiles actually were at any point, forcing them to target every silo if they hoped to destroy all of the missiles before they were launched. This, in turn, would sap an enemy’s resources during any exchange, without having to actually procure and maintain large numbers of ICBMs, to begin with. Under the original U.S. plans , dating from the late 1970s, 200 examples of the proposed MX ICBMs (which ultimately evolved into the LGM-118A Peacekeeper ) would have been transported around oval ‘racetracks,’ each around a dozen miles long, and each provided with 23 underground shelters where the weapons could be hidden from spy satellites. The situation for the potential enemy would have been made more complex by interspersing the real ICBMs with dummy missiles. Shell game concept for the MX missile., DoD Shell game concept for the Minuteman missile. , DoD U.S. officials estimated that, to ensure the entire complex and every missile was destroyed, the enemy, then the Soviet Union, would have to expend a staggering 4,600 warheads. The original U.S. shell game concept would have also included anti-ballistic missile (ABM) interceptors, as well as ICBMs, to provide an additional degree of protection for the site and to force the Soviets to use more than one warhead against each individual target if they were to be sure of its destruction. The shell game was just one of a large number of potential MX basing concepts that were explored, which also included mobile launchers on trains and mobile or fixed ones in buried trenches . In the end, however, the United States chose to field the MX Peacekeeper missiles in more traditional silos. A succession of arms control agreements with the Soviet Union and then Russia ultimately led to the early retirement of the LGM-118As, with the last of them withdrawn from service in 2005 . “While it might seem that 120 silos means 120 missiles, it could very easily be 12,” Lewis told Foreign Policy , referring to the potential Chinese shell game. “We just don’t know. And even if China were to deploy only a handful of missiles, its forces could over time grow into the silos. Yet whether the number is 12 or 120, this is an alarming development.” The possibility of Beijing adopting the shell game approach seemed to be echoed by John Culver, a retired CIA analyst on East Asian affairs, who pointed to the close proximity of buildings at the site. “Grouped so closely they situationally almost dare an adversary to think about counterforce attack,” he tweeted. A counterforce attack is one directed against targets of military value, such as ICBM silos, or strategic bomber bases , with the aim of destroying an enemy’s nuclear weapons before they can be launched in turn. A shell-game type of ICBM deployment could make sense for China, which, with an estimated 250 to 350 nuclear weapons, has far fewer than the United States or Russia. Beyond the potential cost savings from only having to build a relatively small number of actual IBCMs, keeping the silos in relatively close proximity would also make things cheaper and more straightforward in terms of maintaining command and control over the site and general logistics. A map showing the respective ranges of China’s nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including the CSS-4 (DF-5) ICBM, CSS-5 (DF-21) MRBM, and CSS-10 (DF-31) ICBM, in addition to the DF-26 IRBM and DF-41 ICBM., DoD Adding ABM systems to the shell game could also be an attractive option for China, which is already busy developing these types of weapons . Seeding doubt in the minds of rival powers’ war planners would also be in line with the Chinese government’s policy of ambiguity around how its existing nuclear forces are postured. Some experts and observers have raised the possibility that the entire desert silo complex could actually be part of an elaborate ABM system, similar to the controversial U.S. Ground-based Midcourse Defense missile defense system, or GMD, rather than housing ICBMs, at all. However, the site’s general location would seem to be less than optimal for this use, especially given the likely approach trajectories of incoming threats from the United States. However, if the new silos are primarily related to ICBMs, it would also seem to tally with previous Pentagon assessments regarding increasing numbers of Chinese warheads, ICBM silos, and a change in deterrence posture. According to last year’s Annual Report to Congress on Chinese military and security developments: “New developments in 2019 […] suggest that China intends to increase the peacetime readiness of its nuclear forces by moving to a launch-on-warning (LOW) posture with an expanded silo-based force.” Launch-on-warning involves ordering a ‘retaliatory’ nuclear strike by launching missiles when an incoming nuclear missile attack is detected, but before any of the incoming warheads have actually detonated. A LOW posture would be bolstered by further development of silo-based forces, as well as more survivable mobile delivery systems, but would also require the establishment of more robust enhanced early warning capabilities. Last year’s Pentagon report on China to Congress also indicates the U.S. military believes that China may be considering additional DF-41 launch options, “including rail-mobile and silo basing.” The DF-41 might therefore be one of the more likely options to be fielded at the new ICBM site. It’s thought that this missile might already have been tested from an ICBM silo in 2019, with a test site near Jilantai in the west of the country “probably being used to at least develop a concept of operations for silo basing this system.” Satellite imagery of a silo at the site near Jilantai where a new version of the DF-41 might have been tested., DoD There are also reports about the DF-41s being MIRVed and an expanded silo-based MIRVed ICBM force would likely be among the factors driving the U.S. Department of Defense assessments about China looking to significantly expand the number of deployed warheads it has. On the other hand, the aforementioned Annual Report to Congress also notes that there are some indications that China may also be building new silos for the DF-5 ICBM that’s already in service in this capacity. Compared to the solid-fuel DF-41, the older DF-5 is a liquid-fueled weapon and therefore less suitable for the LOW posture. Unlike solid-fuel missiles, ones that use liquid fuels, which generally contain very caustic chemicals, typically cannot stay in a ready-to-launch state for protracted periods of time, and are only fueled right before launch, which could be too long process to work through reliably in the face of incoming nuclear strikes. The latest development near Yumen comes amid worsening relations between China and the United States and warnings about the speed at which Beijing’s growing nuclear arsenal. However, analysts have also urged caution against alarmism over the new ICBM field. “There are lots of reasons to question whether China is about to expand its nuclear arsenal this rapidly, although it is expanding it a bit,” said James Acton, a co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Lewis, meanwhile, also pointed to the influence on China of U.S. developments in the fields of new types of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, including air-launched cruise missiles , new warheads for submarine-launched missiles, as well as updated missile defense systems . “We’re stumbling into an arms race that is largely driven by U.S. investments and missile defense,” he warned. The new missile field is certainly broadly in keeping with previous predictions about China’s expanding nuclear armory, and in particular its aims to modernize the silo-based element of its ICBMs. Overall, however, it’s too early to say what China plans to do with its additional 100-odd ICBM silos, and how they might fit into its wider strategic thinking.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 20, 2019",Meet The MC-145B Wily Coyote Armed Special Ops Transport Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Sierra Nevada Corporation, or SNC, has given us the first look at its MC-145B Wily Coyote. This armed aircraft, which is derived from the Polish PZL M28 Skytruck, as is the U.S. Air Force’s existing fleet of C-145A Combat Coyote special operations light transport planes, is the company’s entry into the U.S. Special Operations Command’s Armed Overwatch trials. In May, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) awarded a contract to SNC to demonstrate the MC-145B as part of the Armed Overwatch program, which is ostensibly seeking to acquire a new manned light attack aircraft to support U.S. special operations forces in permissive environments. SOCOM also picked four other companies – L3Harris, Leidos, MAG Aerospace, and Textron – to supply aircraft for tests at Eglin Air Force Base, where had been scheduled to begin earlier this month and wrap up at the end of July . It’s unclear how much each firm received, by SOCOM said that the total combined value of all five deals was just under $19.2 million. A US Air Force C-145A Combat Coyote, which is based on the same design as the MC-145B, airdrops cargo during a training exercise., USAF Until now, SNC was the only one of these firms that did not appear to have released any pictures or concept art of its design. The artwork that the company has now provided to The War Zone , seen at the top of this story, shows a distinctly modified version of the basic twin-engine turboprop M28/C-145A aircraft with an extended nose. The new front section, in particular, is similar in many respects to existing maritime patrol and search and rescue (SAR) variants of the M28. A Polish M28B-1RM bis Byrza maritime patrol plane with a nose similar to the one on the MC-145B. , Grzegorz Jereczek via Wikimedia There is a sensor turret under the plane’s new snout and another one under the fuselage. At least from the art, these both appear to be WESCAM MX-15s from L3Harris, which can be configured to carry a mixture of electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as laser designators. The MX-15 is already an option for installation in the nose on M28s configured for maritime patrol and SAR duties. A 2014 PZL Mielec briefing slide noting that the L3Harris MX-15 sensor turret, as well as the Teledyne FLIR Star SAFIRE turret, is an option for installation on certain variants of the M28., PZL Mielec No other intelligence, surveillance, or reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities are specifically mentioned in SNC marketing materials about the aircraft. It is possible that the MC-145B could be large enough to carry aerial versions of SOCOM’s Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS) family of signals intelligence systems, some of which are able to fit inside the slightly larger C-146A Wolfhound light transport. SNC does say that the Wily Coyote has a robust communications and data-sharing suite and is designed to be able to readily accommodate new and improved capabilities on that front as time goes on. The MC-145B configuration also has four underwing hardpoints for external stores. The SNC marketing materials for the aircraft say that it can carry AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and pods filled with AGR-20 Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) laser-guided rockets under its wings. It adds that there are also “provisions” for loading GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) precision-guided glide bombs on these hardpoints. The aircraft can also be configured to launch various kinds of precision-guided munitions, as well as small drones, via the increasingly popular Common Launch Tube (CLT), through eight apertures in the floor of the main cabin. This setup also allows the launchers to be reloaded in flight. The SNC marketing material specifically mentions Dynetics GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition (SGM) glide bomb and Raytheon’s AGM-176 Griffin missile, as well as Coyote unmanned aircraft, another Raytheon product, as potential payloads. Marketing material showing potential weapons and other stories options for the MC-145B Wily Coyote., SNC As a brief aside, it’s interesting to note that the MC-145B depicted on this page of the marketing materials is painted in a scheme that includes a series of distinctive diagonal white stripes on the tail, which is clearly based on the ones worn by aircraft assigned to the U.S. Army Air Force’s 1st Air Commando Group in the China, Burma, and India (CBI) theater of operations during World War II. In March, it had emerged that SNC had painted one of the three A-29B Super Tucano light attack aircraft that it is set to deliver to U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) in a similar scheme. AFSOC’s 1st Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field in Florida traces its roots back to the 1st Air Command Group. The acquisition of these A-29Bs is unrelated to the Armed Overwatch program. An A-29B Super Tucano light attack aircraft for the US Air Force painted in a scheme based on the ones worn by aircraft assigned to the World War II-era 1st Air Commando Group., SNC SNC has also highlighted that the MC-145B retains the M28/C-145A’s rear ramp, which it says could enable it to deploy larger payloads simply by rolling them out the back. Raytheon’s ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and Dynetics’ X-61A unmanned aircraft, are depicted as things the aircraft could employ using this method. The MALD is effectively a small cruise missile that carries an electronic warfare package that can jam enemy radars or try to trick them into thinking waves of planes or missiles are heading at them from certain directions, depending on the variant, as you can read more about here . The X-61A has been in development for years now as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Gremlins program, which is exploring the idea of swarms of drones with various capabilities that can be deployed and recovered by a mothership aircraft in mid-air. The primary concept of operations envisioned for Gremlins, which you can learn more about here , is centered on overwhelming or otherwise neutralizing enemy air defenses. As such, SNC’s mention of the MC-145B potential ability to employ either of these systems in the future is particularly interesting given the stated focus of SOCOM’s Armed Overwatch program on operations in permissive environments against lower-end threats. Beyond the rear ramp, SNC says that the MC-145B can be readily reconfigured for non-armed overwatch missions, such as light transport, aerial resupply, and casualty evacuation duties, if desired, as well. What the Wily Coyote’s exact performance specifications or operational capabilities might be in any of these configurations while performing any of these mission sets is unclear. SNC SNC says the aircraft will able to operate from austere locations with limited infrastructure and will be self-deployable, while also boasting significant overall range and loiter time. The belly sensor turret is notably designed to retract into the fuselage when not in use and protection is provided for the one on the nose to help ensure it can operate from unimproved airstrips. The cargo carrying capacity of the aircraft would also help with deploying to forward locations with limited support. SNC In the past, PZL Mielec has touted the M28, broadly, as having “best in class distance per payload STOL [short takeoff and landing] capability,” as well as a range of up to 800 nautical miles with as much as 1,000 kilograms, or around 2,200 pounds, of mission equipment installed. That company has also said the design has operational endurance of between five and 10 hours, depending on fuel load and flight profile. PZL Mielec PZL Mielec All of these could easily be points in the MC-145B’s favor during the Armed Overwatch trials, which SOCOM has said will evaluate the ability of the selected aircraft to operate from austere locations, demonstrate appreciable range and endurance, and show off a variety of ISR, munitions, and communications and data-sharing capabilities. The reconfigurable nature of the Wily Coyote could be particularly attractive given the plan for the Armed Overwatch program is for the winning design to replace AFSOC’s existing single-engine turboprop U-28A Dracos , which have relatively robust ISR suites and a secondary ability to operate as light transport planes, if required. AFSOC also continues to operate C-145As in a light transport configuration, primarily now to support training engagements with foreign allies and partners. With this in mind, it is perhaps most interesting to highlight how the MC-145B is, by far, the largest of the five entrants and that the rest of the field is extremely diverse. MAG Aerospace is also pitching a more multi-purpose platform, its MC-208 Guardian , which is based on the single-engine Cessna 208 Cavaran and is capable of performing missions beyond armed overwatch. The other three entries are two-seat single-engine turboprop light attack aircraft. Leidos lead a team offering the Bronco II, an unusual pusher-prop design originally developed in South Africa that you can read more about here . L3Harris partnered with Air Tractor to submit AT-802U Sky Warden , the latest iteration of the latter company’s armed derivative of the AT-802 crop-duster. Textron’s submission is the AT-6E Wolverine , its most recent light attack variant of the T-6 Texan II trainer. An artist’s rendering of the Bronco II aircraft., Paramount Group The AT-802U Sky Warden., Air Tractor Textron’s AT-6E Wolverine demonstrator., Textron More details about the performance and capabilities of all of these aircraft, as well as exactly what SOCOM might be looking to get out of them, are likely to emerge if the initial round of flight testing wraps up next month as planned. The results of those demonstrations will also undoubtedly inform how the Armed Overwatch program proceeds. In February, Air Force Lieutenant General James Slife, head of AFSOC, said he hoped to begin buying the first of what could become a fleet of 75 Armed Overwatch aircraft in the 2022 Fiscal Year, which begins on Oct. 1. Congress had blocked funding to purchase any planes as part of this program in the 2021 Fiscal Year, with legislators saying, in part, that they wanted more information about SOCOM’s need for these aircraft, though they did agree to fund this initial demonstration. A draft of the 2022 Fiscal Year defense spending bill that the House Appropriations Committee put out yesterday would, if it passed and becomes law, provide another $166 million for this effort. It’s worth noting that SNC could market the MC-145B to other customers, including foreign armed forces, that might be interested in the capabilities it has to offer, as well. Back in 2013, AFSOC had actually explored the possibility of converting C-145As into small side-firing gunships , a sort of miniature take on the AC-130 concept , with an eye toward potentially being able to transfer that capability to American allies and partners. A 2013 SOCOM briefing slide discussing the test of a C-145A configured a side-firing gunship., SOCOM No matter what happens now, it still very interesting to get our first real look at the MC-145B Wily Coyote concept.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 6, 2021",Switzerland Chooses F-35 As Its Next Fighter Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In something of a surprise result, the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter has won the competition to provide the Swiss Air Force with its next fighter jet. The fifth-generation fighter fought off competition from the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , Dassault Rafale , and Eurofighter Typhoon . After what was described as a “comprehensive technical evaluation,” Switzerland’s Federal Council announced today that it planned to recommend to the country’s parliament that it procure 36 F-35As as part of the Air2030 program. The package also includes five Patriot air defense systems from Raytheon, which will provide the Alpine nation with a new long-range ground-based air defense capability. The Patriot was selected in favor of the rival SAMP/T offered by France’s Eurosam. Three Swiss Air Force F/A-18Cs fly alongside a U.S. Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker after aerial refueling during a training mission over Germany., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Justine Rho “An evaluation has revealed that these two systems [F-35A and Patriot] offer the highest overall benefit at the lowest overall cost,” the Federal Council explained in a statement . “The Federal Council is confident that these two systems are the most suitable for protecting the Swiss population from air threats in the future.” The Air2030 program will replace the Swiss Air Force’s existing fleet of 30 ‘legacy’ F/A-18C/D Hornets , scheduled to be withdrawn in 2030, as well as its aging F-5E/F Tiger II jets. The new F-35As are expected to arrive in the country from 2025. The F-35A had only recently emerged as the favorite for the Swiss deal, with reports in the local media that the stealth fighter had performed best out of the candidates during the in-country evaluation. Citing three anonymous sources, Swiss broadcaster SRF revealed last Monday that the Joint Strike Fighter was the preferred option. “According to insiders, Switzerland can buy a larger number of F-35s with the budgeted 6 billion Swiss francs [$6.53 billion] than would be the case with the three competitors,” SRF reported . “The F-35’s simulator could also be an asset: it would allow the F-35 to carry out significantly more virtual training missions than the competition,” the broadcaster added. The Federal Council confirmed today that all four fighter jet candidates had met the air force’s requirements. However, the F-35 (like the Patriot) came out as not only the most effective, but also the lowest-cost option. An F-35A from Hill Air Force Base Utah, takes off during the evaluation in Switzerland in 2019., Lockheed Martin “With 336 points, [the F-35A] showed the highest overall benefit and was the clear winner with a lead of 95 points or more over the other candidates,” the council’s report stated, although it didn’t provide points for the other fighters in the competition. Also absent was any kind of detailed breakdown as to how that score was determined. Neverthess, the Lightning II scored highest in three of the four main criteria evaluated, which were effectiveness, product support, cooperation, and offsets. The Federal Council described the stealth jet as having a “marked technological advantage over the other candidates,” pointing to its “entirely new, extremely powerful and comprehensively networked systems for protecting and monitoring airspace.” “In addition, because the F-35A is comparatively easy to operate and is able to provide information superiority, it requires less training and has a better ratio of flight to simulator hours,” the report continues. “Because of this, the F-35A requires about 20% fewer flight hours than other candidates, and about 50% fewer takeoffs and landings than the air force’s current jet aircraft, which the F-35A will be replacing.” An airman practices on an F-35 full mission simulator at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida., U.S. Air Force The F-35A was also judged better able to maintain its technological edge over the planned 30-year service life, compared to its rivals. In the product support category, the Swiss evaluation judged the F-35A best on account of its “efficient operation and maintenance, modern training design, and the high security of supply throughout its service life.” Part of this advantage comes from the F-35 already being established with different air forces in Europe and having been built in greater numbers than the other competitors. “The F-35A was also the best performer in terms of cooperation, offering extensive opportunities for operational collaboration and broad access to data and technical resources,” the analysis added. The one category where the F-35A failed to come out on top was direct offsets, although all entrants were required to provide offsets worth 60 percent of the order value within four years of the final delivery. In the past, as seen in the slide below, Lockheed Martin offered Switzerland the option to undertake “limited assembly” of four F-35s locally, but it’s not clear if this has been taken up. Lockheed Martin That the F-35A might win the evaluation based on its technical attributes is perhaps not so surprising; after all, it was the only fifth-generation stealth jet in the running. What might raise more eyebrows is the fact that it scored highest on financial terms, too. According to the Federal Council’s findings, the fleet of 36 F-35As was priced at around $5.48 billion, well within the $6.53-billion price cap. Although the unit prices of all variants of the F-35 have been steadily decreasing, the cost of actually sustaining the jets once in service has remained a cause for concern. In 2019, for example, the U.S. military assessed it would cost $1.196 trillion just to operate and maintain its full planned fleets of F-35s, including B and C versions, across the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy through 2070. These costs have led even the U.S. Air Force to look at other options to more F-35s, while both that service and the United Kingdom are weighing up whether the cost of upgrading early-model F-35s is worth the investment in the Block 4 upgrade package for the jet. Only recently, U.S. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith slammed Lockheed Martin over the lifecycle costs of the F-35. “There’s no question that everyone involved — certainly Lockheed Martin ― could be doing a better job on getting sustainment costs down,” Smith told the Defense Writer’s Group. He pointed to operating costs as high as $38,000 an hour, according to Defense News . F-35s during the Swiss flight evaluations, June 2019., Lockheed Martin Furthermore, the timeline for the Block 4 upgrade remains uncertain and could well come after the Swiss begin receiving their jets, which would require them to either upgrade or decide against getting that capability boost. While Switzerland is a wealthy country, it’s also a small one, and it seems remarkable that keeping a relatively small fleet of F-35As in service will prove cheaper than an alternative fourth-generation jet. However, the Federal Council indicates that the F-35A also has the lowest operating costs of all of the candidates, with procurement plus sustainment amounting to around $16.72 billion over 30 years — this is approximately $2.16 billion cheaper than the next lowest-cost offer, which has not been disclosed. We do know, however, that based on U.S. Government Accountability Office figures, the F-35A is significantly more expensive to operate than the F/A-18E/F — at least, within the U.S. Department of Defense ecosystem . Furthermore, since Switzerland is already an established Hornet operator, introducing the Super Hornet would entail certain advantages in terms of commonality within infrastructure and especially training. The considerable infrastructure costs of the F-35A are well known and it’s so far not clear if the Swiss will be able to continue to have two main operating bases for their frontline fighters, and to what degree they will be able to use their wartime cavern facility at Meiringen. GAO In the past, there have been criticisms that the F-35 is potentially vulnerable in terms of cybersecurity and there have been concerns around data autonomy , too, and the ability for operators to access critical information and make their own changes to aircraft software , for example, without having to consult the manufacturer and the wider U.S. defense enterprise. The Swiss evaluation rejects these concerns, stating that all four candidates “were able to guarantee data autonomy.” In the case of the F-35, these may refer to the “firewall” that Italy and some other customers have received. On the other hand, the F-35 is still heavily intertwined with a cloud computing backend that has been repeatedly cited as a key factor in higher than expected sustainment costs, and a replacement for it remains under development . Lockheed Martin As for the F-35, “the security of its computer architecture and its cyber protection measures combine to ensure an especially high level of cybersecurity,” according to the report. “With the F-35A, Switzerland controls which information to exchange with other air forces via datalink, and what logistics information to report back to the manufacturer,” the Federal Council states, noting that maintenance will be handled in-country by the Swiss Air Force and RUAG Switzerland. In the Joint Strike Fighter program specifically, there has been a push to develop supporting infrastructure in Europe to help sustain F-35 fleets in that region. Switzerland might be able to leverage that to help reduce costs to some degree, while the fact they appear to be due to get some kind of domestic depot maintenance capability is also significant for such a small country. Then there is the question of whether Switzerland needs a fighter as sophisticated as the F-35. The Federal Council points to its ability to “ensure information superiority; this means pilots benefit from a higher situational awareness in all task areas when compared with the other candidates,” before noting that “this is especially true for day-to-day air policing.” That mission, after all, is the primary one flown by Swiss Air Force fighters, but the F-35 is a low-observable jet optimized for strike missions against sophisticated enemies. The council says that the jet’s “high survivability is a great advantage for the Swiss Air Force,” although it’s hard to see how this would have a significant benefit for air policing missions. There are indications, however, that at least some limited air-to-ground capability might be part of the Swiss F-35 plans. When the U.S. State Department approved a possible Foreign Military Sale of 40 F-35As and related equipment to Switzerland last year, the official statement noted that “the proposed sale will […] enhance its air-to-air and air-to-ground self-defense capability.” Among the munitions listed in the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notification were the GBU-54 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II), also known as the StormBreaker . The decision in favor of the F-35 is also in stark contrast to Switzerland’s previous, abortive fighter competition. That was for the partial replacement of the F-5 fleet and the Saab Gripen E/F was chosen, with a decision to buy 22 examples, before the entire project was rejected by a referendum in 2014. A Saab Gripen E/F demonstrator aircraft flies in the Swiss Alps., Saab In an unusual quirk of Swiss procurement, the latest fighter purchase also first had to win the backing of the country’s voters, who went to the polls in a referendum last September 27. The electorate voted narrowly in favor of a new fighter, clearing the government to spend a maximum of $6.53 billion on the jets, before the type had been selected. There could still be other opposition to the fighter purchase, however, with SRF reporting that at least some of the Cabinet members would prefer a European fighter, and critics have suggested another referendum to potentially overturn the decision to buy American. Regardless of how the Swiss came to their conclusions in the evaluation, and whether the F-35 represents the right choice for the country’s relatively modest requirements, it is a significant victory for the Joint Strike Fighter program and one that should provide more momentum as it takes on other competitions. In particular, it would seem the odds of the F-35 going on to win Finland’s fighter procurement battle must now have narrowed considerably.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 5, 2021",Draken Becomes The Next Red Air Private Contractor To Acquire F-16 Fighter Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Draken International, the adversary air support contractor which boasts one of the world’s largest private tactical jet air forces, is now set to add F-16A/B fighters to its roster after the Dutch government announced it had agreed to transfer 12 of the jets to the North American company. Draken will join fellow private contractor Top Aces in operating F-16s for “red air” adversary support, which is now in great demand, especially to fulfill the U.S. Air Force’s mammoth adversary air contract . In a letter published today , the Dutch Secretary of State for Defense, Barbara Visser, confirmed that an agreement had been reached for the sale of a dozen ex-Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) F-16A/Bs plus associated unspecified items. A Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16AM taxies down the flight line at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan., U.S. Air Force/Sgt. Richard Andrade “Draken International has been contracted by the U.S. government for years to take on the role of the enemy in U.S. Air Force and Navy exercises,” the letter explains. “These aircraft will be used exclusively on the basis of government contracts for support tasks during (inter)national exercises and training on American territory.” The F-16A/Bs are becoming available as part of the RNLAF’s planned phase-out of the jet, or End Life of Type (ELOT) program. The 12 jets in question are due to become surplus next year, as deliveries of F-35A stealth fighters to the RNLAF continue. The Dutch have committed to buying at least 46 F-35As, and deliveries to the Netherlands began in late 2019. The latest divestment of the Dutch Vipers has already begun, with one single-seat example having been sold to Belgium under a deal announced last August. Previously, batches of aircraft had also been sold to Chile and to Jordan, as part of an earlier fleet reduction during the 2000s. As well as the 12 Vipers earmarked for Draken, the Dutch government has announced an option for the same firm to acquire another 28 examples, which are planned to be retired from RNLAF service by the end of 2024. Should that follow-on deal be taken up, Draken would end up with a fleet of 40 Vipers, compared to the 29 ex-Israeli F-16A/Bs that were acquired by rival Top Aces. Now that details of the transfer of the first 12 jets have been agreed, and approval received from the relevant agencies in the Netherlands, the contract signature is likely to follow in the coming weeks, with deliveries to Draken beginning in 2022. Since the jets are covered by the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), approval for this sale has been requested from the U.S. government. A Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16AM pulls away from a U.S. Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker after an aerial refueling over Germany., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Luke Milano The value of the deal has not been disclosed, the Dutch Ministry of Defense noting that this information is commercially confidential. The Dutch acquired a fleet of 213 F-16s, beginning in 1979, and the original F-16A/B jets underwent the Mid Life Update (MLU) beginning in 1998, receiving the unofficial designation F-16AM/BM in the process. This effectively brought the jets up to a standard similar to the U.S. Air Force’s F-16C/D Block 50/52 and included a new modular mission computer, targeting pods, datalinks, GPS, night-vision goggle compatibility, and new precision-guided weapons. Incremental improvements have continued since via successive software upgrades. Headquartered at Lakeland Linder International Airport, in Lakeland, Florida, Draken’s fleet already boasts two supersonic fighter jets for adversary work: a dozen ex-South African Atlas Cheetahs , and 22 ex-Spanish Air Force Mirage F1Ms . One of the latter jets was lost in a fatal crash near Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, last month. Draken’s extensive fleet also includes A-4 Skyhawks , L-159 Honey Badgers, L-39s , and MB339s . The company also owns dozens of MiG-21s, although they are not part of its regular operations. A Draken A-4 Skyhawk pilot prepares for take-off in support of operational test of the F-35A for the Royal Netherlands Air Force., U.S. Air Force/Rebecca Amber The company’s Cheetahs and Mirage F1s already offer a high level of performance and are equipped with radars, with updates in the works to better represent fourth-generation threats. The F-16, on the other hand, is already a fourth-generation jet and its agility is legendary. It is no surprise that the Viper is an aggressor of choice for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy , as well as civilian contractors. In particular, more capable red air assets are required to adequately train pilots of advanced U.S. fighters like the F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor . Older equipment, like Draken’s hard-worked A-4s, are simply unable to replicate the required level of threat. Even the Cheetah and Mirage fall short of the kind of all-round performance and capabilities offered by the F-16, which will be a much better match to the kinds of aircraft flown by potential near-peer adversaries. It is notable that, not so long ago, it seemed that the growing demand for red air might be satisfied by older jets that could be upgraded to replicate fourth-generation platforms for this kind of work. When Draken acquired its Cheetahs, for example, much was made about how they could successfully emulate fourth-generation platforms . Similarly, in 2018 the U.S. Navy decided that upgraded F-5s were perfectly suitable for this work , passing on an F-16-based proposal. In the meantime, it seems there has been something of a change, or at least a realization that true fourth-generation jets are the best option for high-end aggressor work. This could be as a result of China’s growing capabilities and to a lesser extent those of Russia , or perhaps just a reflection that more second-hand F-16s are now becoming available. There is also the factor of a lack of corporate knowledge as regards types like the Cheetah and Mirage, with few U.S. pilots and maintainers having experience of them. The case of the F-16 is very different indeed. Meanwhile, the Air Force has, more generally, been pursuing a crawl, walk, run approach to its dealings with contractor-supplied adversary firms, as Lieutenant Colonel Jan ‘Kuts’ Stahl explained to The War Zone in a wide-ranging interview : “The fielding of contract aggressor forces was always intended to be a multi-year process in which initially we put jets on the line to fill more of the demand for quantity as opposed to the demand for quality. We then put measures in place that over a period of multiple years to stimulate the contract adversary industry to put some of these specific requirements and demands that we need in order to meet that quality benchmark, as well.” Lieutenant Colonel Jan ‘Kuts’ Stahl What is less clear, though, is whether the Air Force and Navy will be happy to pay the additional costs involved in operating high-end aggressors of this type. Until now, contractors have managed to provide financially attractive red air offers, leveraging the lower costs of operating less sophisticated types, like the A-4. The F-16s will likely cost substantially more to operate than even the third-generation jets, however. As yet, we don’t know what kinds of upgrades will be undertaken for the Draken F-16A/Bs, although it’s likely they will follow a path similar to that taken by Top Aces for its ex-Israeli jets. This is based around an open mission system architecture with a new mission computer, AESA radar, helmet-mounted sight, and Link 16. First flight of an F-16 from Top Aces’ F-16 Center Of Excellence at Mesa Gateway Airport in Arizona, last May 18., KYLER NOE In the background to all this, of course, is the U.S. Air Force’s huge $6.4-billion contract opportunity for red air and close air support training at 12 different airbases throughout the United States. Draken is one of the companies to have received a share of an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract , alongside Air USA , Airborne Tactical Advantage Company , Tactical Air Support , and Top Aces. The contract runs until October 2024 and is likely to involve between 40,000 to 50,000 flying hours per year. Beyond these requirements, there will be additional Air Force demand for contractor red air at other stateside bases, too, as well as in support of the U.S. military and its allies in Europe and the Pacific. The U.S. Navy has its own contractor adversary contract, as well, with ATAC and TacAir currently supporting this, but with further opportunities to follow in the future. Although already at a NATO standard, the process of certifying the former Dutch F-16s for contractor aggressor work, and then upgrading them accordingly, won’t necessarily be a quick one. But with deliveries of the jets due to begin next year, we might not have to wait too long until a second contractor begins flying F-16 aggressor jets in the United States.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Oct 28, 2021",Skyborg AI Computer “Brain” Successfully Flew A General Atomics Avenger Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has announced that its Skyborg autonomy core system , or ACS, successfully completed a flight aboard a General Atomics Avenger unmanned vehicle at Edwards Air Force Base. The Skyborg ACS is a hardware and software suite that acts as the “brain” of autonomous aircraft equipped with the system. The tests add more aircraft to the list of platforms Skyborg has successfully flown on, bringing the Air Force closer to a future in which airmen fly alongside AI-controlled “ loyal wingmen .” The Skyborg-controlled Avenger flew four two and a half hours on June 24, 2021, during the Orange Flag 21-2 Large Force Test Event at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Orange Flag is a training event held by the 412th Test Wing three times a year that “focuses on technical integration and innovation across a breadth of technology readiness levels,” according to an Air Force press release . You can read more about this major testing event in this past feature of ours . The Avenger started its flight under the control of a human operator before being handed off to the Skyborg “pilot” at a safe altitude. A command and control station on the ground monitored the drone’s flight, during which Skyborg executed “a series of foundational behaviors necessary to characterize safe system operation” including following navigational commands, flying within defined boundaries known as “ geo-fences ,” adhering to safe flight envelopes, and demonstrating “coordinated maneuvering.” An Avenger in flight during Orange Flag 21-2 at Edwards Air Force Base. The tail number has been blurred out by General Atomics., General Atomics The Avenger made its first flight in 2009 as a jet-powered follow-on to General Atomics’ Predator/Reaper family, featuring greater speed than its family members, a 20-hour flight time, some low-observable features, and a much higher flight ceiling of 50,000 feet. It can carry weapons internally in a weapons bay and externally. Only a handful of Avenger airframes have been produced and are used mostly out of the public eye and as testbed aircraft . As of 2017, General Atomics had confirmed the sale of only one Avenger drone to the Air Force, but “up to seven” additional airframes were sold to an undisclosed U.S. government entity. However, General Atomics has previously eyed sales to unspecified international customers . Most of the details of the Avenger’s operational use remain classified. In December 2020, General Atomics, as well as Boeing and Kratos, had received a contract to supply unmanned aircraft to the Skyborg program to actually carry systems developed under that program in future tests. It had not previously been clear what design the company planned to provide to the Air Force. The Avenger flown in the tests at Orange Flag was designated as an MQ-20, according to the Air Force. This is a curious nomenclature given that the U.S. military has already assigned the “Q-20” slot in its aircraft designation system to the AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma AE . The service has also previously applied the YQ-11 designation to the Avenger, which it has employed in various testing roles, which also conflicts with the RQ-11 nomenclature for the AeroVironment Raven . Of course, unusual and out-of-sequence designations are not unheard of, especially for experimental and test aircraft . The Avenger’s flight at Orange Flag was part of the AFRL’s larger Autonomous Attritable Aircraft Experimentation (AAAx), a program that has already seen the Skyborg ACS tested aboard a Kratos UTAP-22 Mako unmanned aircraft . The AAAx program appears to be aimed at eventually fielding autonomous air vehicles that are low-cost enough to operate in environments where there is a high chance of aircraft being lost, but are also reusable. As part of that goal, the Skyborg program is developing an artificial intelligence-driven “ computer brain ” that could eventually autonomously control “loyal wingman” drones or even more advanced unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). The AFRL wants the system to be able to perform tasks such as taking off and landing, to even making decisions on its own in combat based on situational variables. The Air Force envisions Skyborg-equipped UAVs to operate both completely autonomously and in networked groups while tethered via datalinks to manned aircraft , all controlled by what the AFRL calls a “modular ACS that can autonomously aviate, navigate, and communicate, and eventually integrate other advanced capabilities.” Skyborg-equipped wingmen fitted with their own pods or sensor systems could easily and rapidly add extended capabilities by linking to manned aircraft flying within line-of-sight of them. After the program was first revealed in 2019, the Air Force’s then-Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Will Roper stated he wanted to see operational demonstrations within two years . The latest test flight of the Skyborg-equipped Avenger shows the service has clearly hit that benchmark. The General Atomics Avenger was used in experiments with another autonomy system in 2020, developed as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) program that sought to develop drones that could demonstrate “collaborative autonomy,” or the ability to work cooperatively. Brigadier General Dale White, Skyborg Program Executive Officer says that the successful Skyborg ACS implementation aboard an Avenger demonstrates the Air Force’s commitment to remaining at the forefront of aerospace innovation. “This type of operational experimentation enables the Air Force to raise the bar on new capabilities, made possible by emerging technologies,” said White, “and this flight is a key milestone in achieving that goal.” The 412th Test Wing’s Emerging Technologies Combined Test Force (ET-CTF) carried out the Skyborg-controlled Avenger tests. Brigadier General Matthew Higher , Commander of the 412th Test Wing at Edwards AFB, said that the tests demonstrate the Wing’s commitment to pushing the envelope: As we have throughout our history, the test and evaluation enterprise is adapting our people and capabilities to compete at the speed of relevance. The execution of this flight test is a great milestone for our closely integrated development and acquisition team. Safely executing this test in conjunction with Orange Flag both expands the envelope for autonomous vehicle flight testing and improves warfighter confidence working with autonomous wingmen. As always, we’re highly motivated to help bring tomorrow’s technology to the warfighter today. General Atomics’ Avenger platform has also conducted flight tests equipped with Lockheed Martin’s Legion Pod , an infrared search and track sensor , or IRST, designed to detect and track other aircraft at long range. The Avenger was designed with a focus on air-to-ground strikes and surveillance, but could also be configured to fire air-to-air weapons . A General Atomics Avenger in flight., USAF Now that the remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) has also demonstrated itself capable of being flown by the Skyborg ACS, it very well could be that it finds itself operating in a wide variety of roles in the future, all controlled autonomously from its onboard “computer brain.” While the Avenger hasn’t found a major customer, these demonstrations show that there is no reason why the UCAV couldn’t be examined again for more autonomous operations in semi-contested environments. Then again, General Atomics is already looking towards what comes after the MQ-9 Reaper under the MQ-Next program , which will likely be a higher-end UCAV that is more survivable than the Avenger. Concept art of notional successor to the MQ-9., General Atomics For the time being, the tests of the Skyborg ACS aboard an Avenger shows that the modular, open system can be successful employed aboard a variety of unmanned aircraft. As it develops further, Skyborg could very well prove itself to be a defining capability in terms of how the Air Force fights in the future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2021",U.S. Destroyer Shows Up Right Off Crimea On Vessel Tracking Sites But It Never Left Port (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A couple of hours ago, in what appeared to be the latest development in the cat-and-mouse naval activities being played out by Russia and NATO in the Black Sea, online ship tracking services showed the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Ross (DDG-71), sailing together with a Ukrainian patrol boat just five miles off the coast of the contested Crimean Peninsula in the middle of the night. The Navy has denied that ship was ever anywhere near Crimea. What looked at first sight like a deliberate passage through what NATO recognizes as Ukrainian territorial waters, but which are also claimed by Russia, now seems to have been a case of deliberate spoofing of maritime tracking data, something that also occurred two weeks ago in the same area. Earlier this evening, MarineTraffic and VesselFinder , aggregators that provide real-time information on ship movements, showed USS Ross sailing very close to the Crimean coast, causing a big stir in the online open source intelligence community. If true, this would have put the ship closer to the Russian-occupied peninsula than the U.K. Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyer HMS Defender had been on June 23. In that instance, the British ship had sailed within around 10 miles of Crimea, prompting a response from Russia’s security forces. The Kremlin claimed that its military aircraft dropped bombs in front of the warship and that its patrol boats fired warning shots to ward it off. Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and now considers the waters around it to be part of its national territory. The United States and the United Kingdom, among many other members of the intentional community, do not recognize Moscow’s authority over Crimea. USS Ross during a previous visit to the Black Sea, April 25, 2019. , U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Krystina Coffey However, while online ship tracking appeared to show that USS Ross was underway very close to Crimea, accompanied by the Ukrainian Matka class hydrofoil patrol boat Priluki , also known by its hull number U153, in reality, the U.S. Navy destroyer was sitting in a harbor. This was initially evidenced by a live webcam feed hosted on YouTube that shows the vessel in the Ukrainian port of Odesa. USS Ross is currently in the region to take part in the latest iteration of the annual U.S. Navy-led Sea Breeze exercise , which began yesterday. The destroyer, which is forward-deployed at Naval Station Rota, Spain, and assigned to Commander, Task Force 65, entered the Black Sea on June 26, according to the U.S. Navy . The official Twitter account for the exercise has also now confirmed that the destroyer was in the port of Odesa when the online tracking showed it off Crimea. As for the Ukrainian patrol boat, it seems highly unlikely that it would attempt a solo mission, even by night, so close to Russian-controlled Crimea. The two countries are effectively at war and, in 2018, Russia seized two other Ukrainian patrol boats , as well as a tug, and detained their crews after a violent altercation in the Kerch Strait, which links the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov . This strongly suggests that the location data available online for Priluki tonight was also spoofed. Interestingly, a previous case of apparent automatic identification system (AIS) spoofing in the Black Sea took place on June 18 and was reported several days later by USNI News . This incident involved HMS Defender together with the Royal Netherlands Navy frigate Evertsen . In that instance, MarineTraffic showed the warships sailing within just two nautical miles of the Russian naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea. In reality, they were some 180 miles away, also in Odessa, where they arrived earlier in the day. Once again, live webcam feeds showed that the two warships remained in the harbor the entire time. Both Defender and the Evertsen are in the Black Sea having temporarily detached from the U.K. Royal Navy-led Carrier Strike Group 21 , or CSG21, which is based around the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and that is currently undertaking operations in the eastern Mediterranean, closely monitored by Russia. Of course, as already noted, after the previous AIS spoofing incident, HMS Defender did indeed sail close to Crimea. The United Kingdom has insisted that the warship was “conducting innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters in accordance with international law.” Claims and counter-claims have followed, including Russia releasing video of supposed warning shots fired from a Russian Border Guard patrol boat. Defender was so far away at the time that it may well not have been aware that this fire was being directed at it, which is what the British authorities had claimed at the time. As for the Evertsen , the Royal Netherlands Navy only today released details of an apparent incident in international waters on June 24. The Dutch claim that the frigate was harassed by Russian fighter jets, and released photos of the flybys by Su-30SM fighter jets, one of which, at least, was armed with anti-ship missiles. The Ukrainian Matka class hydrofoil missile boat Priluki , which, according to the spoofed AIS data, was accompanying USS Ross ., Ukrainian Ministry of Defense At this point, we can’t say how sophisticated these spoofing incidents may have been, but in the past, there has also been GPS spoofing traced to the Russians in the Black Sea. The application of electronic warfare, in general, is extremely widespread in the region . We also don’t know how or why these attempts to falsify the AIS data might have been made. According to the USNI News analysis of the first spoofing event, AIS positions were provided to MarineTraffic by a receiver station in Chornomorsk, close to Odessa, and the same data was also shared with other AIS aggregators, too. Ultimately, the efforts failed, due to a combination of live webcam feeds, plus keen-eyed observers on the ground and in the digital domain. The incidents do, however, reinforce the need for caution when it comes to examining real-time information relating to ship or aircraft movements since they don’t necessarily show us the real picture of what’s happening. As for the goals of such an operation, that remains to be seen, but eroding the trust in this data among foreign observers and the military could benefit Russia. Regardless, we’ll keep you updated on this strange situation as we continue to learn more. UPDATE: 6/30/2021 — U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/U.S. Sixth Fleet’s public affairs office has confirmed to The War Zone that USS Ross was in port in Odesa from June 27 until this morning, when it left to join the Force Integration Training phase of the Sea Breeze 2021 exercise.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 9, 2021",DoE’s Extreme-Security Nevada Test Site Touts The “Ultimate Playground” For Drone Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has appeared on the official YouTube channel of the Department of Energy’s Nevada National Security Site , or NNSS, that highlights the unique counter-unmanned aerial systems, C-UAS, research being conducted in the remote Nevada desert inside highly secure airspace. It says that the site is the most capable and secure testing facility for UAS and C-UAS platforms, largely through being so isolated. It’s essentially a “blank canvas” in the desert where one can operate and test a wide variety of drone and anti-drone technologies outside of the kinds of oversight applied to other test facilities or areas. The video gives an overview of the work being done at Port Gaston (36.808821, -116.154816) , a testing facility within the NNSS just northwest of the Department of Energy (DOE) controlled closed village of Mercury, Nevada. This is the same general area where hundreds of nuclear weapons were tested during the Cold War. The area all lies within a block of restricted airspace called R-4808N , inside which sits R-4808A, also known as “The Box.” That zone makes up the heavily restricted airspace around Area 51 . The very high-security NNSS is also partially cocooned within the Air Force’s sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR). A VFR flight map showing the range areas of the NTTR and the DOE’s area around R-4808N., VPRMap.com According to an NNSS press release , authorities there established the testing site at Port Gaston in coordination with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) in order to meet the need for “an extensive and agile outdoor testbed that allows for rapid validation of prototype sensors, information aggregation and analysis, and identification of requirements and flexible concepts of operations.” Port Gaston personnel say in the footage that they are able to accommodate almost any type of testing involving drones or anti-drone technologies. The site offers a rare, nearly restriction-free environment for research and development to take place in a real-world setting. “We literally have the ultimate playground for national security testing,” says Jim McDonnell, Strategic Advisor for Global Security at the site. “If you can imagine it, we can do it here.” A dedicated Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) system at Port Gaston allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) tested at the site to carry out beyond visual line of sight (BVOLS) operation within the site’s own airspace, which stretches 16 miles away to another UAS test facility known as Area 25 , all while being tracked with site-specific transponders. The site also has its own weather station that can record data down to one-second intervals. The video states that Port Gaston regularly schedules tests up to 14,000 feet, but that they also own the airspace with an unlimited ceiling should customers need something higher. Whereas the video states that getting the required permits and airspace clearances in less controlled areas can take months, a similar test could be coordinated in mere days at Port Gaston, making it the ideal location for iterative, rapid testing of new capabilities and concepts. NNSS via YouTube “You do not have to interface with the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], which saves you four months” says C-UAS Program Manager Von Suddreth in the footage. “When it comes down to it, you get on our calendar, you can come out and do what you need to do and get your data. […] I think we protect the nation by providing this venue for people to game against UAS.” The area is free from Federal Communications Commission (FCC) restrictions. This means various forms of directed energy C-UAS systems can be tested under the NNSS’s experimental license from the FCC. In addition, Port Gaston is able to host testing of explosives . “To be able to have a private airspace, a non-FAA  corridor 16 miles long, and be able to fly high-hazard within that, that’s a dream,” infrastructure analyst Scott Duncan says in the footage. “We should attract some interesting customers. I know we will – we already have.” It’s also worth noting that another far more secretive base for testing more advanced drone systems sits on the DOE’s NNSS property along the edge of Yucca Dry Lake. You can read more about that shadowy installation here . Satellite view of Port Gaston, center, Google Maps With the creation of Port Gaston, the NNSS could allow commercial and governmental UAS developers the chance to flex their technological muscles largely outside of strict FAA protocols, potentially leading to the development of the types of more capable drone defenses needed to protect critical infrastructure and military facilities. Given the many recent examples of drone incursions into airspace around military operations , civilian population centers , and even nuclear facilities , it’s no surprise that one of the most secure test sites in America would establish a premier research and development facility to help find new ways of defending against the growing drone threat.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2021",U.S. Navy Ballistic Missile Submarine’s Gibraltar Visit Is First In Over Two Decades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following the arrival of the USS Alaska in Gibraltar yesterday, the U.S. Navy has confirmed that this is the first time in more than 20 years that an Ohio class ballistic missile submarine , or SSBN, has visited the U.K. Royal Navy’s base in this British Overseas Territory. The service has also now said that this extremely rare stopover was a previously scheduled port visit for logistics purposes. The Navy had officially announced that USS Alaska had sailed into Gibraltar yesterday, itself an unusual bit of publicity regarding the operational activities of one of its SSBNs, which generally seek to avoid any kind of attention during their nuclear deterrent patrols. Navy Lieutenant Commander Lenaya Rotklein, a spokesperson for U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/U.S. Sixth Fleet, told The War Zone that this was the first time an Ohio class SSBN had paid a visit to the Her Majesty’s Naval Base Gibraltar since 1999. It’s unclear which of the 18 Ohios traveled there some 22 years ago. The Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Alaska sails into Gibraltar on June 28, 2021., USN It is important to point out that this does not count visits to Gibraltar since then by any of the four Ohios that were converted into guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs. These boats, which you can read about in much more detail in this past War Zone feature , are truly multi-mission platforms that have robust conventional strike, special operations forces support, intelligence-gathering, and command and control capabilities. “USS Alaska (SSBN 732) conducted a previously scheduled brief stop for logistics at the Port of Gibraltar [on] June 28, 2021,” Lieutenant Commander Rotklein added. “Alaska is on a routine patrol in the U.S. Sixth Fleet area of operations in support of U.S. national security interests in Europe and Africa. This brief stop strengthens cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom-Gibraltar.” Rotklein did not elaborate on what the submarine’s “logistics” needs were that required it to stop in Gibraltar. The scheduled nature of the stop could indicate this was simply a visit to onload various supplies. It is also worth noting that other types of American submarines do regularly stop at this Royal Navy base, which can accommodate nuclear-powered vessels, for various reasons, including for maintenance . A picture, seen below, of Alaska at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Gibraltar does show it venting what appears to be steam from its sail. However, this is completely normal for nuclear-powered submarines, especially those in port , and is associated with the boat’s auxiliary diesel generators. USS Alaska vents what appears to be steam from its sail while pierside in Gibraltar., William Jardim That image and others also show a Mexeflote barge loaded with shipping containers along the opposite side of the submarine’s hull from the pier. It’s not entirely clear what the purpose of this is, but it seems highly likely that it is a force protection measure. Modern military submarines, in general, typically have significant force protection requirements while sailing on the surface, where they are limited in their ability to maneuver, have limited close-in defenses, and are generally more vulnerable to a variety of threats, overall. This goes double for Alaska , which is not only nuclear-powered, but is almost certainly carrying dozens of thermonuclear nuclear weapons. Each of the Navy’s Ohio SSBNs can carry up to 20 Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Each Trident D5 can carry up to 14 individual W76-1 or W88 nuclear warheads , with estimated yields of around 100 kilotons and 475 kilotons, respectively. Various arms control agreements between the United States and Russia mean that these missiles typically only have five or six installed at any one time. In addition, since January 2020, at least some Ohio SSBNs have been conducting patrols with some number of Trident D5s armed with lower-yield W76-2s . These warheads, which are believed to have yields of only around five kilotons, are particularly controversial with proponents arguing that they give the U.S. government valuable additional deterrent flexibility, while critics say that they increase the likelihood of a nuclear exchange. You can read much more about the debate surrounding the W76-2 here . The official W76-2 program logo. Mk 4A refers to the reentry vehicle that actually holds the warhead., NNSA With all of this in mind, it is hard to see this visit, scheduled or not, as simply a logistical matter. As already noted, an Ohio SSBN visiting Gibraltar is an exceedingly rare occurrence. In fact, the very first time one of these boats sailed into port there was when USS Maryland arrived in 1995. This was also the first time one of them had ever sailed into the Mediterranean Sea. An individual who shared a picture from that stopover on Reddit last December wrote that “it was a show of force. We were supposed to ‘sneak’ through the straits undetected. However due to a medivac [sic; medevac; medical evacuation] we had had to alter plans.” Even without the unexpected need to get a seriously ill or injured crew member off the boat, it can be tricky for a submerged submarine to get through the highly strategic and heavily trafficked Strait of Gibraltar, which links the Atlantic Ocean, to the West, to the Mediterranean, as you can read more about here . Alaska ‘s arrival in Gibraltar now comes amid a flurry of other maritime military activity on the part of the Navy, as well as other U.S. allies, and Russia, both in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The Russians have been carrying out anti-ship drills at the eastern end of the Mediterranean that have notably involved Tu-22M3 bombers loaded with anti-ship cruise missiles and MiG-31K combat jets carrying Kinzhal hypersonic missiles flying from their expanded Khmeimim outpost in Syria , among other aircraft, ships, and submarines. The U.K. Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth and its multi-national strike group , which includes U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters embarked onboard and escorting allied warships, is in that area , too. Just days before Alaska’s appearance in Gibraltar, on June 23, the Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyer HMS Defender had an altercation with Russian security forces in the Black Sea off the coast of the Crimean Peninsula, which the Kremlin seized from Ukraine in 2014. The Dutch Navy says that its De Zeven Provincien class frigate HNLMS Evertsen was also harassed by Russian forces in the same general region a day later. Both of these warships are part of Queen Elizabeth ‘s strike group. Yesterday, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/U.S. Sixth Fleet also kicked off the largest ever iteration of the annual Sea Breeze exercise in the Black Sea, which is focused on Ukraine. A total of 32 countries are participating this year. Russian officials say they are now monitoring this drill, which the Navy says will involve 32 ships and dozens of aircraft. In addition, as The War Zone reported yesterday , Alaska’s visit to Gibraltar is only one of a number of unusually public activities involving Ohio SSBNs just in the past week or so. This includes two brief visits, one on June 21 and another on June 26, by what may have been the same Ohio class submarine to San Diego, which is not a usual port of call for those boats, as well as the Navy’s curious official announcement about the departure of the USS Maine on its latest deterrent patrol on June 25. It is important to stress that all this may not be directly related. At the same time, it is indisputable that the activities of the Navy’s Ohio SSBNs, in general, have been oddly public as of late. Whether planned in advance or not, the first visit by America’s most destructive weapon system to Gibraltar in more than two decades is a significant show of force in the region at a time when geopolitical friction between the United States, as well as its allies, and Russia seems to be building.

The U.S. Air Force’s Strategic Development Planning & Experimentation Office, or SDPE, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, has announced a successful demonstration of a new concept of operations for Precision, Navigation and Timing, or PNT. The concept combines new software architectures with existing PNT technologies that could allow the services to operate in GPS-denied environments, which is becoming a growing concern as peer-state rivals continue to advance GPS spoofing and denial techniques. An Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) press release states that six successful Phase I sorties were conducted that saw the new PNT systems fused together inside AgilePod modular open-architecture pods aboard an airborne testbed. The system was then fit-tested aboard a T-38 jet aircraft at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico for planned Phase II flight tests scheduled for August 2021. According to Air Force Major Andy Cottle, SDPE’s Operational Experimentation Lead for Complementary-PNT, the tests successfully demonstrated that these new navigational systems being developed by the service “could perform within the reconfigurable AgilePod throughout a wide range of aircraft and environmental conditions.” An AgilePod aboard a Textron AirLand Scorpion at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, USAF/David Dixon The AgilePod is a modular, open architecture system, that offers ‘plug-and-play’ configurations into which multiple sensors, communication, and other payloads can be rapidly integrated. The Air Force has previously experimented with AgilePods aboard the RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-9 Reaper drones , the U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane, a World War II-era DC-3 , an RC-26 surveillance aircraft , and Textron’s Scorpion light jet to quickly add new capabilities to these existing aircraft. Rudy Klosterman, SDPE’s Experimentation & Prototyping Division Chief, said the new PNT concepts tested aboard the pods could “help the Air Force pivot as needed to ensure capabilities being developed meet the ever changing demands of the battlefield.” An illustration of the modular architecture of the AgilePod, USAF/David Dixon Bringing PNT technologies to the AgilePod architecture could enable the service to rapidly adapt to situations in which GPS capabilities might be denied or spoofed. “PNT isn’t a new challenge for the Air Force, but we know uncontested Air Force dominance isn’t assured and we can’t be complacent,” Cottle said . “This concept recognizes that a single alternative-PNT technology isn’t going to give us the edge against our adversaries as they attempt to disrupt traditional GPS sources; we need to think differently about ways to employ those technologies together to achieve our desired effects.” In the USAF’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Documentation, $204.7 million was requested for the “Lifecycle Prototyping” line item which includes developing PNT prototypes for use both aboard airborne podded platforms and space: DOD The new demonstrations conducted by AFMC tested three different PNT concepts: Vision Navigation (VisNav), Signals of Opportunity (SoOP) and magnetic anomaly navigation (MAGNAV). VisNav is one of the most rudimentary forms of navigation and involves building a database of terrain features or landmarks that can then be tracked by onboard sensors in order to calculate vehicle position, velocity and altitude. As satellite imagery databases and image processing algorithms continue to advance, visual navigation could likely become more automated and sophisticated. SoOP, on the other hand, leverages the wide range of radiofrequency (RF) emissions that propagate freely in the air, such as WiFi, TV signals, RFID, cellular networks, and more. By calculating the relative distance between an aircraft and those signals against an initial estimate of that aircraft’s original position, these “wild” RF signals can be used to determine one’s location . However, SoOP requires sophisticated antennae and processing equipment, and opportunistic signals are generally only found around populated areas, not necessarily over the open sea or an unpopulated stretch of desert or in the Arctic , making this concept not practical for every mission. The third PNT concept that AFMC is looking at is Magnetic Anomaly Navigation, or MAGNAV. This navigation method uses onboard magnetometers, or magnetic field sensors, to measure variations in the Earth’s magnetic field as an aircraft travels over the surface of the planet. Those readings can then be compared with existing maps of the Earth’s geomagnetic field to determine one’s location relative to magnetic field anomalies. MAGNAV wasn’t demonstrated in the recent AgilePod PNT tests, but AFMC says this sophisticated form of navigation will be assessed “for potential incorporation in future tests.” Air Force Major Aaron J. Canciani told Forbes last year that while he understands MAGNAV sounds outlandish, the Air Force Institute of Technology has seen promising results. “Magnetic navigation has been a bit of a hard sell. It’s met with skepticism until I can really [inform] people about the results I’ve had with it. We’re hoping some realistic testing on realistic platforms will open the doors to further research and funding.” The Air Force Research Laboratory has also previously looked at quantum clock technologies as part of expanding its PNT capabilities, but these weren’t mentioned specifically in AFMC’s recent press release. The Air Force has employed or experimented with other concepts to ensure navigation without GPS, such as the millennia-old technique of using the stars to navigate. The now-retired SR-71 Blackbird spy plane and B-2 Spirit stealth bomber , among other strategic aircraft, use an automated celestial navigation system, or “ astro-nav,” and more advanced versions of the same concept are being eyed for use in denied environments. Both China’s and Russia’s GPS spoofing capabilities continue to advance and in some cases be deployed against rival forces in contested areas, and the U.S. military has been conducting exercises that simulate operations in GPS-denied areas. New jam-resistant GPS systems have already been installed aboard Marine Corps F/A-18 fighter jets, and the military uses encrypted GPS technologies that are much harder to disrupt than civilian networks. Still, given that GPS relies on satellites which are increasingly under threat from peer-state rivals’ space technologies , a future conflict that involves orbital warfare could see satellite-based GPS networks knocked out entirely, hence the need for a more versatile PNT concept of operations. Ensuring the United States and its armed forces can operate in the absence of GPS has become a pressing concern for the Department of Defense and federal government alike, even domestically. In 2020, the White House signed an Executive Order that aimed to “ensure that disruption or manipulation of PNT services does not undermine the reliable and efficient functioning of [American] critical infrastructure” and “manage the associated risks to the systems, networks, and assets dependent on PNT services.” The USAF’s demonstration of new position, navigation, and timing concepts show that GPS spoofing or jamming is advancing to the point where the United States can no longer count on the decades-old system for consistent and secure operation both internationally or at home. It could be that future operations depend on a variety of navigation and position concepts like the ones being demonstrated by the Air Force in order to ensure uninterrupted operation worldwide.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Netherlands Navy has now confirmed that its De Zeven Provincien class frigate HNLMS Evertsen , which has been sailing in the Black Sea together with the U.K. Royal Navy destroyer HMS Defender , was harassed by Russian fighter jets last week. The announcement comes after Russia and the United Kingdom entered something of a war of words last week when the Type 45 destroyer HMS Defender conducted maneuvers in an area close to Russian-controlled Crimea . Both of these ships are currently part of the British aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth’s multinational strike group , also known as Carrier Strike Group 21, or CSG21. The Royal Netherlands Navy today released a statement highlighting the events that occurred last Thursday, June 24. That was the day after Russia claimed to have dropped bombs and fired warning shots to ward off HMS Defender , which Moscow claimed had violated the Russian maritime border around the Crimean Peninsula. The Kremlin seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, an annexation that neither the Netherlands nor the United Kingdom recognizes as legal. A pair of Russian Navy Su-30SMs fly over the Evertsen. , Royal Netherlands Navy According to the Royal Netherlands Navy’s account, HNLMS Evertsen was “southeast of Crimea” on June 24 when Russian fighter jets “created unsafe situations” in the Black Sea. No further details are provided of the warship’s location at this point, although it seems, at least, the Dutch vessel did not follow the same course as HMS Defender . A series of photos released by the Royal Netherlands Navy today shows a pair of Su-30SM multirole fighter-bombers, likely from the Russian Navy, flying low over the warship, with at least one of the aircraft armed with a pair of Kh-31 (AS-17 Krypton) supersonic anti-ship missiles under the engine nacelles. A Kh-31 missile., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons In what the Dutch Ministry of Defense describes as “repeated harassment,” between around 3:30 PM and 8:30 PM that day, the Su-30SMs flew “dangerously low and close by, performing feint attacks.” Su-30SMs were also involved in last week’s incident with HMS Defender , with at least one example seen shadowing the warship in an official Russian Ministry of Defense video. These Russian Navy jets are assigned to the 43rd Independent Naval Assault Aviation Regiment based at Saki in Crimea. A Su-30SM armed with Kh-31 missiles passes alongside the Evertsen ., Royal Netherlands Navy The Dutch account describes the Russian aircraft being armed with bombs (not immediately visible) and air-to-surface missiles. The jets also used their onboard electronic warfare systems to disrupt electronic equipment onboard the Evertsen , according to the Dutch. The Su-30SM is equipped with an internal Khibiny-U electronic warfare suite that includes powerful jammers to blind and confuse adversary radars. An earlier video of Russian Navy Su-30SMs operating from their base in Crimea: https://youtube.com/watch?v=3oFDwJZltCs “ Evertsen sailed on the open sea in international waters,” added Captain-Lieutenant George Pastoor, the commander of the Dutch vessel. “There was no reason whatsoever for these aggressive actions. Despite this, the mock attacks continued for several hours. It was irresponsible and unsafe behavior at sea.” The Dutch Minister of Defense, Ank Bijleveld-Schouten also described the Russian actions as “irresponsible,” arguing that the Evertsen was within its rights to sail there. “The Netherlands will address Russia about this,” she added. “The Russian actions violated the right to the free use of the sea,” the Dutch Ministry of Defense contends. “In addition, they go against mutual agreements, as laid down in the INCSEA [Prevention of Incidents On and Over the Waters Outside the Limits of the Territorial Sea] treaty. The agreement must prevent unsafe situations at sea.” Among the provisions in the INCSEA treaty is the requirement that “aircraft commanders [use] the greatest caution and prudence in approaching aircraft and ships of the other party.” The terms of the treaty prohibit “simulated attacks against aircraft or ships, performing aerobatics over ships, or dropping hazardous objects near them.” Not mentioned in the Dutch account is the presence of a Russian Navy warship, a Black Sea Fleet Buyan-M class corvette, apparently the Ingushetiya . The Black Sea Fleet Buyan-M class corvette Ingushetiya ., Royal Netherlands Navy While tensions between Russia and the United Kingdom in the Black Sea were increasing last week, it was known that the Evertsen was in the area, having temporarily broken away from CSG21 in the Mediterranean to enter the Black Sea, along with HMS Defender . The whereabouts of the Dutch warship after that were unclear, however, and the Russian reports about the actions taken against HMS Defender did not mention the Evertsen . Last week, the Russian Ministry of Defense, as well as Russian politicians, took the opportunity of the incident involving HMS Defender to emphasize its tough response to what was described as “a flagrant violation of international norms and standards.” In turn, the British side stated that its warship was “conducting innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters in accordance with international law.” So far, no official reference has been made by Moscow to the Dutch warship’s actions, and those of the Russian Navy in response to it. A member of the crew of the Evertsen keeps watch., Royal Netherlands Navy However, the Dutch account indicates that the Evertsen was in international waters, outside of the territorial waters around Crimea that are claimed by both Russia and Ukraine. That is in contrast to HMS Defender , which was within around 10 nautical miles of the Crimean coast, albeit in what the British government described as an “internationally recognized traffic separation corridor.” With that in mind, it is possible that Moscow is less willing to draw attention to the actions of its navy. It’s also almost certain that, unlike in the HMS Defender incident, the Russian side would not have issued warnings to the Dutch warship to leave these waters, since there was seemingly no violation of the Russian state border, claimed or otherwise. HNLMS Evertsen , nearest camera, as part of the U.K. Carrier Strike Group during a rendezvous with ships from NATO Standing Maritime Groups One and Two, on May 28, 2021., Crown Copyright Like the incident last week, the encounter between the Evertsen and the Russian Navy seems to have led to an official complaint from one of the governments involved. It is also, perhaps more significantly, another example of escalation in the Black Sea region. This comes amid increased activity in this area in general, with the Russian military recently conducting drills in Crimea, while the latest iteration of the annual U.S.-led Sea Breeze exercise, centered on Ukraine, got underway yesterday. A total of 32 countries are participating in what is the largest Sea Breeze drill to date, which will involve 32 warships, plus dozens of aircraft. There have been other recent incidents in these waters, too, including in January, when two Arleigh Burke class destroyers — the USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) and the USS Porter (DDG-78) — entered the Black Sea and were met by an aggressive Russian response . They were also buzzed by a Su-24 strike aircraft, while Su-30SMs armed with anti-ship missiles carried out drills in the vicinity. With the Russian Navy already taking a keen interest in CSG21 in the eastern Mediterranean — and this interest clearly being reciprocated by the British side — the potential for yet more standoffs between Russian and NATO forces in both these bodies of water is perhaps at its highest in recent history.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2021",American Ballistic Missile Submarine Makes Rare Stop In Gibraltar,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Alaska has made a very unusual stop in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar . The Navy took the equally unusual step of publicly announcing the submarine’s arrival there today. This is the latest in a string of curiously public movements of members of the Navy’s ‘boomer’ fleet, which typically conduct their deterrent patrols loaded with nuclear-armed Trident ballistic missiles with few, if any, port visits and even less fanfare. The captions for the official Navy pictures of Alaska ‘s arrival in Gibraltar describe the submarine as making a “brief stop” that “strengthens cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom-Gibraltar, and demonstrates U.S. capability, readiness, flexibility, and continuing commitment as part of NATO.” At the time of writing, the service does not appear to have provided any additional information about this stopover. The War Zone has already reached out to U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/U.S. Sixth Fleet, which oversees American naval operations in and around Europe and Africa, for more details. The Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Alaska sails into Gibraltar on June 28, 2021., USN U.S. Navy submarines, broadly, do regularly visit the U.K. Royal Navy’s base Gibraltar, which is formally known as Her Majesty’s Naval Base Gibraltar and can accommodate nuclear-powered submarines, including for maintenance . The territory, as a whole, occupies a strategic location at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar, which links the Atlantic Ocean, to the West, with the Mediterranean Sea.Â USN USN However, visits by American boomers to Gibraltar, publicized or not, are, by every indication, very rare. It’s unclear when the last time an Ohio class ballistic missile submarine, or SSBN, visited this port. The Ohio class USS Florida has made at least two stops there in the past 12 years , but both of these were after its conversion into a guided-missile submarine, or SSGN, in 2006. Gibraltar is at the center of a long-standing territorial dispute between Spain and the United Kingdom and a Spanish Guardia Civil patrol craft reportedly tried to cut in front of Florida twice immediately ahead of the boat’s visit there in 2016, before being warned off by the British Scimitar class patrol boat HMS Sabre .Â At least one British patrol craft was also seen escorting Alaska into Gibraltar today. Even outside of Gibraltar’s unique geopolitical situation, it is standard procedure to closely guard submarines sailing on the surface, including in and out of ports, where they are more vulnerable and generally limited in their ability to maneuver. A small British patrol craft is seen sailing behind USS Alaska as she enters Gibraltar on June 28, 2021., USN @USNavy Ohio Class SSBN berthing at #Gibraltar .

Ohio SSGNs are readily distinguishable from their SSBN cousins by the modified areas on top of their hulls immediately after theirs sail that are designed to accommodate Dry Deck Shelters . The SSGNs can have up to two DDSs installed at a time, which they can use deploy divers, swimmer delivery vehicles, and more, and almost always have at least one fitted. Ship spotters caught a glimpse of an Ohio class ballistic missile submarine sailing on the surface in the Atlantic off the coast of Rota, Spain, a few weeks ago. It seems very probable now that this was USS Alaska . It’s worth noting that is also very uncommon to see American submarines of any kind, or those belonging to any other navy , on the surface in open waters . Â Later confirmed as USS Alaska — David Parody ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡® (@dparody) June 28, 2021 As already noted, submarines, as a general rule, are very vulnerable on the surface, as well as being much easier to spot and track. Beyond that, ballistic missile submarines, especially, typically seek to remain as concealed from prying eyes while on their patrols as possible in order to prevent opponents from targeting them and neutralizing the second-strike nuclear deterrent they provide. Though there are no indications that any of this activity is or isn’t related, Alaska ‘s arrival in Gibraltar is just the latest instance of oddly public movements involving Ohio SSBNs. On June 26, one of these boats, which has not been identified, was spotted making a very brief stopover in San Diego.

However, as The War Zone reported at the time, this is not a common port of call for these submarines, all of which are homeported at either Naval Base Kitsap in Washington state or Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia. In both cases, it remains possible that these stops were made in order to onload or offload personnel or relatively small pieces of equipment, for various reasons, though we still can’t say for sure. “The Ohio -class ballistic-missile submarine is operating in the Pacific Ocean and conducted a brief stop in San Diego,” a spokesperson for U.S. 3rd Fleet, which is headquartered in San Diego, told The War Zone when asked about the short visit there by one of these SSBNs there on June 21. “U.S. military forces are present and active in and around the Pacific in support of allies and partners and a free and open Indo-Pacific.” On June 25, the Navy had also publicly announced the departure of the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Maine from Naval Base Kitsap to begin its latest deterrent patrol. While the service does often publicize the return home of SSBNs, it seems much more unusual for there to be an official notice of the beginning of such a deployment. Tugs help move the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Maine away from her berth at Naval Base Kitsap as she begins her latest deterrent patrol on June 25., USN USS Maine (SSBN-741) Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine leaving Naval Base Kitsap today – odd that they publicized this – June 25, 2021 #ussmaine #ssbn741 * photo posted by @SUBGRU9 pic.twitter.com/s5Q9BRyOIa — WarshipCam (@WarshipCam) June 26, 2021 Any one of the events would be notably out of the ordinary, so it is certainly interesting to see so many happen within such a short space of time, whether they are directly related to each other in any way or not.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 13, 2021",F-35B From British Carrier Flies Over Russian Forces Training To Sink Enemy Warships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian naval task force deployed to Syria in recent days appears to have stepped up its drills in the eastern Mediterranean. At the same time, a recent video shows that at least some of the Russian participants have been shadowed by F-35B stealth jets operating from the U.K. Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth that’s conducting combat operations in the region , against ISIS targets. The latest Russian maneuvers come as tensions between Moscow and the United Kingdom remain high, after a Royal Navy destroyer sailed in waters close to Russian-occupied Crimea last week, and as large-scale, U.S.-led maneuvers in the Black Sea kick off today. The latest official video of the Russian deployment reveals that at least some of the three Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers and two MiG-31K Foxhound jet fighters armed with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles that deployed to Khmeimim Air Base in Syria’s coastal Latakia province last week are now conducting joint maneuvers with Su-35S Flanker fighters. The latter type is seen flying as an escort, carrying various air-to-air missiles, and operating from the same base. Also evident is at least one Su-34 Fullback strike jet, albeit armed with only a pair of short-range missiles for self-defense. Unlike the Tu-22M3 and MiG-31K, the Su-35s and Su-34s have been seen at the Syrian airbase regularly for years now . A MiG-31K Foxhound takes off from Khmeimim Air Base armed with a Kinzhal hypersonic missile., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP Previously, we have seen Tu-22M3s operating from Syria with a single example of the Kh-22 (AS-4 Kitchen) or improved Kh-32 anti-ship missile, but the video reveals a two-missile loadout. Theoretically, each Tu-22M3 can carry three of these weapons, two under the wings and one under the fuselage, but with a considerable reduction in range, since the fuel load has to be reduced accordingly. Therefore, two missiles are normally the maximum practical load, while one missile provides for a range of almost 1,400 miles. The MiG-31K is seen with its standard load of a single Kinzhal missile carried on the centerline. These missions also included an A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and control aircraft, which is seen in the video operating from Khmeimim, as well as over the eastern Mediterranean. This aircraft, which is a familiar presence in Syria, could be coordinating the exercise, as well as keeping an eye on other movements in the air and at sea, such as CSG21 and its F-35Bs. Russian Aerospace Forces A-50 operating from Khmeimim., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP One brief sequence shows an F-35B flying in a steep bank, apparently filmed from a Russian Navy warship. The distance at which the jet is shadowing the vessel means it’s unclear it was from the Royal Air Force or U.S. Marine Corps, but examples from both services are now onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth. An F-35B apparently filmed from a Russian Navy vessel in the Mediterranean., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP Finally, there is a sequence in the video from an unspecified Russian Navy warship, allegedly the Admiral Makarov , one of the two Admiral Grigorovich class frigates that are involved in the current drills, the other being Admiral Essen . As well as commands being issued from the bridge, we see the crew racing to battle stations and close-ups of AK-630 multi-barrel gun , though no live-firing is seen. One of these same weapons was used to fire a ‘warning shot’ toward HMS Defender in the Black Sea last week. The remaining three Russian Navy warships involved in the maneuvers are the Slava class guided-missile cruiser Moskva and the Improved Kilo class submarines Stary Oskol and Rostov-on-Don . All these are from Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Two other Russian assets that have been announced as taking part in the maneuvers have not been seen so far — these are the Il-38 May and Tu-142MK Bear-F long-range anti-submarine aircraft. The official statement provided by the Russian Ministry of Defense reiterates the fact that the current exercises are focused on defending friendly ships against aerial attacks. The carriage of hypersonic missiles (Kinzhal) is also mentioned but it’s not clear if these were used to replicate hostile attacks on the surface combatants. That would, however, fit in with reports last week of simulated enemy aircraft flying a mock attack against a frigate with anti-ship missiles. Moreover, the defense of surface combatants against targets flying at hypersonic speed — generally taken to mean in excess of five times the speed of sound — is a growing area of concern for navies around the world. For its part, the Kinzhal, which is a converted short-range ballistic missile, is claimed to be able to fly at 10 times the speed of sound. “Particular attention was paid to countering airplanes, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles of the imaginary enemy,” the latest report explains. The same drills also include ensuring the security of Khmeimim Air Base and the Russian Navy’s logistics hub in the Syrian port of Tartus . While this is the second time that the Tu-22M3 has been deployed to Syria, the emphasis on the type’s maritime strike mission is noteworthy, especially as it coincides with the high-profile appearance of HMS Queen Elizabeth in the Mediterranean for the first time, as first of its first operational cruise, as part of Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21). The MiG-31K and its Kinzhal missile have not been deployed outside of Russian territory before this, and it seems highly likely they are also on hand to practice the anti-shipping mission, too. An F-35B on the flight deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth during a night replenishment at sea in the Mediterranean on June 21, 2021., Crown Copyright We have discussed previously the significant power-projection capability that even irregular deployments of small numbers of Tu-22M3 and MiG-31K aircraft, and their respective missiles, can bring to the Russian outpost in Syria. While the Kh-22/32 and Kinzhal missiles are dual-role, allowing them to be configured to attack targets at sea or on land, the current deployment is stressing maritime missions, and these aircraft provide another way of both protecting Russian Navy ships and submarines operating in the wider region, as well as offering the potential for offensive actions against enemy shipping. All these missiles can also be fitted with nuclear warheads if required. Another view of a MiG-31K with a Kinzhal missile., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP Now that the runway and its facilities at Khmeimim have been modernized , the airbase is better able to host deployments like this in the future. It could also pave the way to having long-range Tu-95MS Bear and Tu-160 Blackjack strategic missile-carriers operating out of Syria, too. The fact that the Russian exercise is happening simultaneously with CSG21 being in the Mediterranean is unlikely to have been a simple coincidence. After all, official Russian accounts note that “one of the objectives of the exercises will be to monitor the actions of the [British] aircraft carrier group.” A pair of Tu-22M3s, each armed with two Kh-22/32 anti-ship missiles, seen from the cockpit of a Russian Flanker., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap So far, there does not appear to be any corresponding imagery released by the Royal Navy or U.S. Marine Corps showing their perspective of the Russian maneuvers, but we can be confident that both sides are watching each other closely. The War Zone will keep you updated as the exercise continues to unfold, during a period of notable tensions between Russia and the United Kingdom.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Jul 28, 2021",The CIA’s Bird-Shaped Aquiline Drones Could Still Be Caged Up At Area 51,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Documents declassified about the CIA’s Project Aquiline, which sought to develop a small, stealthy drone that resembled a bird in flight, ended up being stored at Area 51 after the project was cancelled. Like so many other aerospace projects that were kept from the public eye, the Aquiline drones could very well still be kept at the secretive Nevada base collecting dust in a storage facility or even buried in the dirt. According to the CIA’s paper trail, Aquiline was intended for “multi-sensor collection and advanced emplacement capability for collection of intelligence” and to “enable an almost completely surreptitious penetration” into unfriendly skies. Aquiline’s designers attempted to mimic the characteristics of a bird in order to allow it to remain as undetectable as possible, a feature that can clearly be seen in some of the drone’s prototypes. While the project was terminated before it ever reached operational status, the Aquiline documentation released by the CIA shows that after it ended, all Project Aquiline assets were stored at Area 51 “semi-permanently.” It’s unknown what became of them after that. The CIA hosts the full collection of declassified documents related to Aquiline on its online reading room site. CIA/Public Domain/Roadrunners Internationale In the midst of the Cold War, the CIA found itself in need of an unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicle that could be sent deep into adversarial airspace. The U-2 spy plane was proving itself too vulnerable to missile defense systems, particularly after the Soviet Union shot one down flown by pilot Gary Powers, marking the end of manned overflights of America’s Cold War adversary. While the A-12 Oxcart and SR-71 programs were underway at the time the Aquiline project began, Aquiline was designed to offer a very different capability: the ability to conduct overhead penetrating surveillance completely undetected. Reconnaissance satellites were becoming more prevalent at the time, but early designs had limited capabilities, not to mention the fact that satellite launches require a much larger share of resources and time to prepare than the deployment of a small unmanned aircraft system. Most of all, the enemy knew when spy satellites were overhead and they could only capture a moment in time. Thus, throughout the 1960s, the Department of Defense (DOD) continued to be interested in more flexible options that could be deployed rapidly, in an unpredictable fashion, and could provide persistent reconnaissance right over the enemy’s heads without them even knowing. It is worth noting that by the early 1980s, Northrop’s Tacit Blue demonstrator would finally prove that a penetrating, persisting, and survivable airborne reconnaissance capability was possible via leveraging stealth technology, as well as low probability of intercept datalinks and radar. Even so, the concept of using stealth technology to do this dates back to two decades earlier, via the far ahead of its time Quiet Bird concept . Regardless, Tacit Blue would go on to secretly change the reality of what airborne reconnaissance in denied environments could be. Today, the RQ-170 Sentinel fills this role in an operational sense, among potentially even more clandestine, strategically oriented assets . Quiet Bird was an early 1960s stealth concept by Boeing for a battlefield scout aircraft. It never flew, but was wildly ahead of its time. , Boeing Back to 1965—in order meet the need for a penetrating, low-observable (of sorts) vehicle for intelligence gathering in denied airspace, the CIA’s Office of Special Activities (OSA) began working together with the Office of Research and Development’s Applied Physics Division to develop an unmanned aircraft referred to by the codename Aquiline. The Aquiline project, from the Latin word meaning “eagle,” specifically sought to develop a small stealthy drone that resembled a bird and had low radar, acoustic, infrared, and visual signatures. While the Aquiline program ended prematurely, as so many other ambitious aerospace projects of the era did, it nonetheless had a long-lasting influence on future surveillance drone designs. Building The Bird In 1969, the CIA signed a contract with the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Corporation (MDAC) to begin developing technologies for the Aquiline program. Personnel were deployed to Area 51 the next year to begin flight testing, which was set to end in early 1971 when the contract reached completion. It was thought that a working Aquiline drone would have been developed by that date, at which point the program would have entered operational status. CIA The Aquiline drones were intended to have first entered into service on a “limited capability” capacity in early 1971 , meaning that some of the planned capabilities would have not been ready by this point. Full capability was planned to be ready by July 1, 1972, including a full-range airborne communications relay. It was thought that the drones would be able to fly one mission per month during this phase. CIA Exact specifications and design details are scarce, but what is known is that Aquiline drones were made to resemble birds and featured a single tail propeller. Initially, the prototypes were powered by chainsaw motors. In one memo in the CIA’s reading room, the Aquiline drone is referred to as a “high characteristic operating model plane with a lot of expensive gadgetry.” CIA Sensor systems were embedded in the aircraft’s nose, and included optical cameras and infrared sensors, and even electronic intelligence packages. The drones were intended to have also been able to drop “black box” sensor systems into hostile territory, as well, so some form of payload carrying capability must have been included in at least some of the Aquiline designs. Specifically, one of the CIA’s documents states that one of the test drones was designed to carry payloads weighing up to five pounds. CIA In a research and development study published in 1967, it’s stated that Aquiline’s low-altitude and low-speed capabilities would give it long loiter times, allowing for unprecedented levels of intelligence gathering for the time. “Further,” the authors wrote, “its small size and innocuous nature would make it more politically palatable in tense situations than conventional aircraft.” The CIA even planned for Aquiline to help support on-the-ground operations by providing clandestine overhead surveillance for agents conducting missions in the field. A flight test range was established for Aquiline at Randsburg Wash at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, California in 1967. “The facilities and facilities support are being supplied by the Navy under a task order from the Agency,” one document states about the range. The Aquiline drones were so difficult to observe visually during testing that engineers once had to paint one of the drones bright orange so that it could be more easily seen by a chase plane during a test flight. Despite the paint, the crew of the chase plane still found it difficult to see the drone in the air. CIA The exact range of the Aquiline drones remains unknown, and is redacted in all of the CIA’s declassified documents. CIA However, one account states that Aquiline was able to fly for 130 miles while obtaining “very high resolution photography,” while another document states one of the proposed mobile control units would have a range of 1,200 miles. A dedicated satellite was planned to offer a long distance communications link for Aquiline drones, but was never launched. CIA There were even plans to use radioisotope propulsion systems later in the program’s development, which were claimed to be able to give the drones 50-day endurance . These types of propulsion systems are powered by the heat given off by radioactive isotopes as they decay, and have been used for decades by NASA and the DOD for space missions. The Apollo missions to the moon and the Viking and Curiosity missions to Mars all used radioisotope systems to power various systems, which have no moving parts, can last decades, and can be miniaturized to fit in a variety of vehicles and systems. CIA Another document declassified by the CIA states that by 1971, Aquiline drones would have an unlimited range and be able to reach “any target.” This document is incredibly telling as it gives potential target locations, ranges with different powerplants, and payload types., CIA That same document lists several potential targets for Aquiline, including the coasts of Cuba, the Barents Sea in the Arctic near the border of the then-Soviet Union and Norway, the Lop Nor nuclear facility in northwestern China, and Sary Shagan, a Soviet anti-missile weapons testing facility. The Aquiline program intended to have secure communications and sensor emplacement capabilities by 1969, and unlimited loiter times by 1970. While initial intelligence-gathering capabilities in 1968 would have been limited to “low altitude imagery” in addition to signals intelligence (SIGINT) and electronic intelligence (ELINT), the Aquiline program intended its drones to be capable of collecting missile telemetry reconnaissance, nuclear staging and yield intelligence, and even real-time “intelligence processing.” It’s unknown exactly what form these more advanced capabilities would have taken. Despite these impressive planned capabilities, Aquiline drones had a major drawback: they possessed no landing gear of their own, and so they had to land by careening into nets. This caused frequent damage to the wings and propellers of the drones, creating major testing delays due to constant repairs being made. Three Aquiline prototypes were destroyed entirely from these net landings. In a personal account hosted on RoadrunnersInternationale.com , a site which preserves “the history of the aviation pioneers and programs that developed the U-2, A-12 and YF-12 during the Cold War,” John H. Meierdierck , retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, offers a brief recollection of the Aquiline program as he remembered it, writing: The vehicle was a six foot long plane that had a small pusher prop and actually looked like an Eagle or Buzzard when it was in the air. It was designed to fly at very low levels along communications lines and intercept their messages. It also had a small television in the nose as an aid to navigation and to photograph targets of opportunity. There were several successful flights and some crashes [reason unknown] and some lousy landings. Accompanying Meierdierck’s account is a series of images depicting a small, bird-like model, and the note “The fotos [sic] shown are of the only model ever made of the ‘BIRD’. I have the model at home, on my bar.” RoadrunnersInternationale.com Fast forward to today, and some smaller reconnaissance drones commonly use nets for recovery. While it may have not worked out for the material and mechanical capabilities of its time, the concept was, without a doubt, ahead of its time. Area 51: The Perfect Cage For A Secret Bird Like a number of highly classified programs centered around intelligence-gathering aircraft, the Aquiline project was housed at Area 51, the existence of which was still largely unknown to the American public at the time. That level of security was exactly what a program as sensitive as Aquiline needed. A 1969 CIA document outlining the objectives of the project states that “An important element in the security of the vehicle’s operation is that its existence, configurations and unique operating characteristics not be known, thus, every effort is being made to avoid any publicity or knowledge of the vehicle.” To that end, all of the program’s activities were classified at the Secret level . The CIA’s Aquiline Concept of Operations document even states that the final drones, when built, would live at Area 51 in between being flown to and from mission areas along with their control units. In the end, Aquiline was doomed like so many other ambitious military or intelligence programs due to rising costs and the difficulty in making new technologies practical for deployment. In 1971, after being estimated to take two to three more years and require $35 million more in funding, Aquiline was cancelled. Project Aquiline phaseout documents reveal that after the program’s termination, all assets were transferred to Area 51 to “protect the Agency role in the Program and prevent unauthorized individuals from becoming aware of the existence of the AQUILINE vehicle, the covert testing site and the Agency’s overt/covert procurement and contracting methods.” Another memo laying out the disposition of the program’s assets states that all Aquiline hardware would be stored at Area 51 “semi-permanently” in one of the base’s buildings. CIA Individuals from the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps were briefed on the Aquiline program upon its cancellation and offered all remaining Aquiline assets. None of the branches was interested in the Aquiline program as a whole, but “low key inquiries” were made into various subsystems and components developed for or used aboard the Aquiline drones. “Therefore, predicated on the absence of any demonstrated interest in acquiring the program intact,” one Disposition of Project Aquiline Assets memo reads, “it is believed that the AQUILINE Program assets should be made available for redistribution on a subsystem, subcomponent level, effective on or about 1 July 1972.” The Aquiline program apparently had a little-known successor program, Axillary, another CIA effort to build a “Miniature Multi-Purpose Airborne Vehicle.” In the now-declassified document titled “The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance:  The U-2 and OXCART Programs, 1954-1974,” the authors write that while the Axillary drone’s radar cross section and acoustic signatures rendered it useless as a covert recon vehicle, it could have been armed with a small warhead and repurposed as a remotely-piloted munition for targeting surface-to-air missile radar systems in North Vietnam. However, like Aquiline, it seems Axillary was cancelled before it ever saw deployment. Nevertheless, Axillary can in some ways be seen as the grandfather of modern suicide drones and loitering munitions as we know them today. CIA The fact that the Aquiline assets came to be stored at Area 51 would seem to confirm at least some of the longstanding rumors that the base serves as an exotic boneyard and museum of sorts, at least in a secondary role, alongside its primary mission as a development and flight test facility. One popular, but still unconfirmed, rumor states there is a facility known as “ Dyson’s Dock ,” named after test pilot Norman “Ken” Dyson, at Area 51, in an extension of Hangar 18. Supposedly, it houses some of the still classified prototypes and other experimental vehicles from the installation’s long legacy of clandestine American aerospace innovation. Bird of Prey and Tacit Blue , which were declassified years after their last flights, were rumored to have been stored there before being migrated to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force following declassification. The facility may serve as something of a treat for distinguished visitors and those who find themselves working at the base in certain capacities. There’s arguably no better way to make the base’s massive value clear for high-ranking visitors. It is largely understood that the desert surrounding the base is pockmarked with the unmarked “graves” of buried aircraft whose existences were too secret to leave out in the open and for which there was no room inside the facility’s hangars for long-term storage. Properly declassifying them or destroying using traditional channels was likely deemed too costly and/or too risky. As such, base personnel just buried them around the very high security facility, especially those aircraft that were involved with mishaps. It’s certainly possible that some of the Aquiline drone prototypes are among those buried within Area 51’s perimeter, or, just maybe, put on display in what would be the ultimate of all aviation museums—if it does indeed exist. CIA Regardless, the documents about Aquiline’s storage at Area 51 lend credence to the real possibility that the clandestine test base serves as a long-term depository of sorts for its one-time active residents. Aside from being stored at Area 51, it could be that at least one of the Aquiline prototypes made it to the CIA’s internal museum, known as the “ best museum you’ll never see ,” in which artifacts from throughout the Agency’s history are preserved for distinguished visitors. While this would make sense, we could not determine that conclusively at this time. Aside from that possibility, as far as we can tell from the CIA’s documentation, the majority of the Aquiline drone prototypes likely lived out their lives cooped up at Area 51 surrounded by miles and miles of Nevada desert sand. Tracing Aquiline’s Legacy While the Aquiline drone never made it past the development and testing phase, it was nonetheless an important milestone in the history of unmanned aerial vehicle and reconnaissance aircraft development. In fact, the CIA describes Project Aquiline as a distant ancestor to modern unmanned aerial vehicles on their reading room landing page : Based initially on the study of flight characteristics of birds, Aquiline was envisioned as a long-range vehicle that could safely and stealthily provide a window into denied areas such as the Soviet Union through photography and other capabilities, and would even support in-place agent operations. While it never became operational, the concept proved invaluable as a forerunner to today’s multi-capability UAVs. Acquiline’s command and control and communications architecture, at its most basic organizational level, resembles that of the MQ-1 Predator . It entered operational service in 1995 and was a game-changer for the CIA, revolutionizing the Agency’s operations, especially in the post 9/11 era of the Global War on Terror. As such, its roots can be traced tangetially to Aquiline just as the CIA mentions. Aquiline’s legacy can also be seen in many recent innovative animal-inspired UAV designs that could potentially hide in plain sight. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has developed small, hummingbird-like winged drones small enough to fit in a human hand, for example. Meanwhile, the Air Force Research Laboratory has experimented with a wide variety of animal- or insect-inspired micro air vehicles, including some small enough to fit on a human fingertip. AFRL Private aerospace firms have developed similar concepts for tiny, sensor-packed UAVs that resemble birds and are incredibly difficult to spot. In 2013, a Florida-based firm was awarded a $4.5 million contract from the U.S. Army’s now-defunct Rapid Equipping Force to produce 36 bird-like drones with flexible wings for “ an urgent, but undisclosed, need. ” Global defense contractor Expal Systems sells its realistic-looking SHEPHERD-MIL autonomous bird drone to customers worldwide. Start-ups have also popped up exclusively devoted to developing bird drones , such as the aptly-named Bird Drone Company in the Netherlands. The Bird Drone Company designed their falcon-like UAVs with animal control in mind, although the firm notes that its other models are ideal for “covert surveillance, reconnaissance, and other types of monitoring.” America’s adversaries have pursued similar biomimicry designs for micro UAVs intended for surveillance. China has developed tiny UAVs that look just like doves in flight, even as far as having robotic flapping wings. Meanwhile, Russia has shown off prototype surveillance drones that mimic the appearance of owls . It’s unknown if any of these drone designs ever made it to operational status. After all, if you at least think your adversaries have stealthy, bird-shaped drones in deployment, then it could make you wonder about every bird you see overhead in the field. In 2011, a bird-shaped drone crashed in southwest Pakistan , and was later reported to be similar to a separate bird drone which turned up in Iraq in 2009. The operators of those bird drones were never identified. A downed bird-shaped drone found in Pakistan in 2011, Kalam TV Bird drones have also been deployed in Somalia, as shown in 2016 when a crashed dual-propeller bird drone was found in Mogadishu . Like in Iraq and Pakistan, it remains unknown who was operating it. A bird drone found crashed in Mogadishu in 2016, Sawirro The U.S. Navy is currently pursuing a wide range of “bio-inspired” autonomous vehicles, including some that are planned to transition between air and water and others that resemble marine life to conduct essentially similar types of surveillance Aquiline was planned for using innocuous designs that could go unnoticed – except underwater in this case. Given the wide range of animal-inspired designs the DOD has openly researched, there’s no telling what could be deployed in the classified realm. Too Weird To Live While ambitious bird-inspired drone designs like Aquiline have long been pursued by militaries and intelligence agencies worldwide, we’ve yet to see evidence that any of them have been deployed operationally in a major capacity. However, given the capabilities of modern UAV technologies, the basic concept behind Aquiline is certainly within reach, especially for tactical applications. But there are other ways of conducting penetrating intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) duties on a higher end level using larger, more traditional and capable UAV designs . Still, in a new era of menacing loitering munitions and the constant threat of low-end drone surveillance on the battlefield, masquerading as a bird may have more importance than ever. Nevertheless, the influence that the Aquiline program has had on small, low-observable surveillance drones is clear to see. Given that all four branches of the Armed Forces were interested in at least some of the subsystems involved with Aquiline, it’s possible that some of the drone’s components or concepts made their way into UAV designs that could still be classified to this day. In addition, distributed surveillance and swarming capabilities could also make such a concept more relevant than it had been in decades past and more technologically achievable. In an age when visual stealth is becoming somewhat more important than it has been for some time, surveillance systems like penetrating UAVs don’t have to disappear completely to reduce their visual signatures, but instead can simply mimic something common and innocuous like a bird in flight or even something far stranger to mask their true nature. This is especially relevant for countries that cannot acquire or develop advanced stealth technologies. A CIA image depicting Aquiline in flight., CIA In the end, it seems that Aquiline failed simply because it was too ahead of its technological time. The program also serves as another reminder that Area 51 is built not just for keeping hardware secret, but also for radical designs like the bird-shaped drones to have a safe place to fail in testing outside of the scrutiny of extreme oversight found in the unclassified realm. If the rumors are to be believed, there’s a chance an example or two of Aquiline still exists among the other strange birds caged up in the darkness at Area 51.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Images shared by the U.S. Navy’s Sixth fleet show the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Montpelier conducting exercises with dummy Mk 67 Submarine Launched Mobile Mines, or SLMMs, while deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. Submarine-launched mines, such as the Mk 67, and other anti-submarine weapons are seeing a resurgence of sorts in recent years as naval competition between major powers continues to heat up in the region and worldwide. While we don’t know if Montpelier left port with the dummy mines to conduct exercises, the images seem to be the Navy’s way of showing off that deployed submarines can show up to bases within the region and onload mines, should that ever be required. The SLMM “expeditionary ordnance on-load” exercises conducted by the USS Montpelier took place last week in Souda Bay, Greece. Images shared by the U.S. Sixth Fleet show seamen loading the 13-foot, 1,765-pound torpedo-shaped mine into the Montpelier’ s torpedo room while docked. A Mk 67 Submarine Launched Mobile Mine being loaded onto the USS Montpelier. , USN/Joel Diller Souda Bay is home to several military installations including the NATO Maritime Interdiction Operational Training Centre (NMIOTC). According to its website , NMIOTC’s mission statement is “To conduct the combined training necessary for NATO forces and Partners to better execute surface, sub-surface, aerial surveillance, and special operations activities in support of Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO).” In addition, the U.S. Navy operates Naval Support Activity (NSA) Souda Bay , a 110-acre facility on the north end of a peninsula that also includes the Hellenic Navy’s Crete Naval Station and the Hellenic Air Force’s Souda Air Base. Souda Bay sits on the northern coast of the Greek island of Crete, west of Turkey and Syria., Google Maps The Mk 67 SLMM was first deployed in 1983 and is the only submarine-launched mine currently in U.S. Navy service. The mines have a depth range of up to 600 feet and carry a 330-pound high explosive charge triggered by a combination magnetic/seismic/pressure target detection device. SLMMs are modified electrically-powered Mk 37 torpedoes and can therefore be deployed in a clandestine manner deep a denied area, such as a port or shipping lane inside hostile territory, from a stand-off position. The exact range of the SLMMs is unclear, but different versions of the Mk 37 had maximum ranges in the thousands of yards , depending on their set speed. In general, even unpowered submarine-launched mines inherently have the ability to be deployed in a way that significantly reduces the chance that the enemy will be aware of them compared to air-launched varieties. The deployment of mines from surface vessels or aircraft is much easier to detect, and it’s more difficult for those platforms to seed mines in denied areas than it is for submarines. A Mk 67 Submarine Launched Mobile Mine being loaded into the USS Montpelier in Souda Bay, Greece., USN/Joel Diller Still, in recent years, the Navy has been pursuing multiple types of new mines , including two air-dropped versions of the Quickstrike family of mines that offer game-changing capabilities such as the ability to be dropped from any altitude and be launched from up to 40 miles away. With their precision guidance, highly intricate minefields can be laid, even up rivers, from standoff ranges. The Navy is also developing another air-dropped mine called Hammerhead to replace the Mk 60 Encapsulated Torpedo which is intended to lie in wait for months at a time after being deployed. The Clandestine Delivered Mine (CDM), a shadowy system believed to be in the prototype phase and intended for deployment aboard large unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), reportedly finished testing last year. A slide from a “U.S. Navy Mine Warfare Programs” presentation made by the Navy’s Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants (PEO USC)., USN The Clandestine Delivered Mine (CDM) and Hammerhead are both parts of the Navy’s FY 2022 Unmanned Systems (UxS) payloads project., DOD The development of these new anti-submarine capabilities coincides with expanding submarine threats from potential “great power” adversaries such as Russia and China , with smaller nations also becoming increasingly able to harness effective naval power via underwater means. It’s possible the Sixth Fleet’s recent publicized exercises with the Mk 67 SLMM were intended as a reminder of this capability to adversary submarine forces in the area. The U.S. Sixth Fleet, which operates in support of U.S. national security interests in Europe and Africa, has been increasingly tasked with projecting power in the eastern portion of the Mediterranean as a counterbalance to the Russian buildup in and around Syria. “We’re watching them [the Russians] very very closely,” said U.S. Navy Rear Admiral William Houston in 2019 while serving as the Deputy Commander of Sixth Fleet. “There’s really not a day where we’re not watching them, every single day.” In response to this uptick in Russian submarine activity in the Mediterranean, as well as similar increases in the Atlantic and Arctic regions, the Navy also reactivated the Second Fleet in 2018. The U.S. Navy’s existing and new mine capabilities could provide an additional layer of defense around strategic assets like naval bases, ports, or even surrounding temporary outposts or forces deployed on small islands like those that dot the Mediterranean or the Pacific. Mines have long been a major component of denying access to certain areas or deterring amphibious landings, for instance. Most importantly, the use of standoff mines or those covertly emplaced by a submarine could prevent adversaries from projecting their own forces, including even leaving their harbors, during a time of war. The location of the mine-loading exercises in Souda Bay is significant given that the Eastern Mediterranean is now a hotbed of Russian, and often Russian-US submarine activity. These new images of the Navy’s submarine-launched mines suggest the service is seeking to highlight this capability at a time when growing geopolitical tensions are drawing more attention to submarine activity in the region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 20, 2018",U.S. Is Betting Big On Naval Mine Warfare With These New Sub-Launched and Air-Dropped Types,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With naval mines seeing a renaissance of sorts in recent years , the U.S. Navy has been work to modernizing its mine-hunting and sweeping capabilities. At the same time, the service is also developing its own new and improved air-dropped and submarine-launched mines, which could be important weapons for itself and the U.S. Air Force to have in any future high-end conflicts against a major adversary with a large conventional navy . U.S. Navy Captain Danielle George, the service’s Major Program Manager for Mine Warfare, gave an overview of the systems in development now and projects that have just recently begun at the National Defense Industry Association’s (NDIA) annual Expeditionary Warfare Conference on Oct. 16, 2018. NDIA just posted her presentation online earlier this week. At present, the Navy fields the Quickstrike family of air-dropped naval mines and the Submarine-Launched Mobile Mine (SLMM). The U.S. Air Force also employs Quickstrike types on various aircraft, but the program is Navy-managed. The Quickstrike family includes 500-, 1,000-, and 2,000-pound class types, known as the Mk 62, Mk 63, and Mk 64 respectively. Theese converted from Mk 80-series high-explosive bombs and feature a fuzing system that detonates the weapon when it detects an appropriate acoustic, seismic, or pressure signatures from a passing vessel. A fourth type, Mk 65, is another 2,000-pound class Quickstrike mine, but is based on an actual purpose-built mine casing rather than an existing bomb. An airmen prepared to load a Mk 65 Quickstrike mine onto a B-1 bomber during a drill., USAF For more than four years now, the Navy has been pursuing two related upgrade programs, known as Quickstrike-J and Quickstrike-ER, for the Mk 80-series members of the Quickstrike family. The first of these simply combines the mine with a GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance package, while the latter adds a pop-out wing kit. These are game-changing upgrades that allow aircraft to precisely employ the mines from any altitude and, in the case of the -ER types, loft them at targets up to 40 miles away. This speeds up the process of laying the minefields overall and dramatically reduces the vulnerability to the aircraft carrying the weapons, which would otherwise have to fly low-and-slow to perform the mission. You can read about both of these mines in more detail in a recent profile of them here at The War Zone . In addition to these upgraded Quickstrikes, the Navy is developing a new air-dropped mine called Hammerhead. This will serve as a replacement for the Mk 60 Encapsulated Torpedo, or CAPTOR , which the service retired years ago. A very different type of weapon from the Quickstrike mines, CAPTOR consisted of a Mk 46 lightweight torpedo inside a launch canister. After hitting the water, an anchor would deploy, holding it in place at depths up to 2,000 feet. Airmen prepare to load a Mk 60 CAPTOR onto a B-52G bomber during an exercise in 1989., USAF The weapon had a Reliable Acoustic Path (RAP) passive sonar targeting system that could discriminate between hostile submarines and surface vessels and friendly submarines that might also be operating in the area. Once it detected an enemy target, it would fire the torpedo, which would then use its own guidance package to home in on the opponent. Unlike the shallow-water Quickstrike mines, CAPTOR did not require the target vessel to pass directly overhead. Its deep-water capability also made it more effective against enemy submarines and difficult for opponents to detect in general. The Navy’s Hammerhead program plans to leverage the older CAPTOR’s basic casing and air-drop components, such as the lugs to attach it to an aircraft. However, the new weapons will have improved targeting sensors, electronics, and software, along with better batteries to power the upgraded systems. The mine will also have a modular design and use open-architecture software with an eye toward adding in new and improved detection and other capabilities in the future. Depending on the improvements made to the batteries in Hammerhead, the weapon could potentially lie in wait even longer than the CAPTOR, which could remain active for months. A graphic showing Hammerhead’s internal configuration and what components it will leverage from the earlier Mk 60 CAPTOR , USN Work on the Hammerhead only began in 2018. The Navy expects to issue a classified request for information to defense contractors interested in building the weapons in 2019, Captain George’s briefing explained. It’s not clear whether submarines will be able to launch Hammerhead, as well, at which point it might be able to serve as a replacement for the Mk 67 SLMM. However, the Mk 67s are modified Mk 37 electrically-powered torpedoes and their concept of employment is more centered on their ability to be launched into denied areas clandestinely, from a stand-off distance. The Navy had initially planned to retire these existing submarine-launched mines in 2012, but U.S. Navy Admiral Jonathan Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations, interceded personally to save that capability. Separately, the Navy is developing a new mine that both submarines and future large unmanned undersea vehicles will be able to employ, known as the Clandestine Delivered Mine (CDM). A low-quality image of one of the CDM prototypes that accompanied Captain George’s breifing. , USN Very little information appears publicly available on this particular system, development of which began in 2016. Prototypes are in testing now, according to Captain George’s briefing. In its budget request for the 2018 Fiscal Year , the Navy asked for $5.8 million specifically to work on developing an unmanned underwater vehicle that could carry two CDMs at once. That same request also outlined plans to investigate integrating the Mk 67 SLMM into an underwater drone. A full end-to-end test of the system is scheduled to occur in 2019. The Navy hopes to begin taking delivery of the first production mines in 2020. The Navy is already set to gain a major boost in capability with the Quickstrike-J and -ER. Being able to rapidly emplace complex minefields over a wide area can only prompt an opponent to reconsider their plan of action and make them leery of operating in certain areas. It also requires them to dedicate additional resources to searching for and clearing the hazards, which can be a time-consuming and dangerous process under the best of conditions. A Quickstrike-ER mine under the wing of a B-52H bomber., USAF Since these Quickstrike mines don’t require a low-altitude release, stealthy aircraft will also be able to penetrate deeper into hostile territory and lay them down in rivers and canals. Add in submarines or unmanned undersea vehicles, or submarine motherships carrying underwater drones, able to discreetly seed mines in certain areas, potentially well away from a main theater of operations, and the threat to enemy naval movements and logistics chains would be even more pronounced. The Hammerhead will likely have a major anti-submarine role just like CAPTOR did previously. This comes at a time when the Navy, in particular , is sounding the alarm about expanding submarine threats from potential “great power” adversaries, such as Russia and China . Advanced non-nuclear submarine technology is steadily proliferating, too, meaning that smaller states will increasingly be able to field more capable types. A graphic from the US Navy’s 2004 roadmap for unmanned undersea vehicles discussing possible payloads for underwater drones, including mines., USN Altogether, the Navy’s forthcoming naval mine arsenal will be extremely valuable in constrained naval environments, such as the Baltic Sea , where minefields could effectively block access entirely to an opposing force. The mines will be just as important in expeditionary and distributed operations across large maritime environments, such as in the Pacific Ocean , where the known presence or threat of mines could slow down a hostile force or help channel them in specific directions. Naval mines also have defensive applications and being able to rapidly emplace them could provide an additional layer of defense around strategic naval bases and ports, as well as established or temporary outposts on small islands, during a crisis. In the latter case, they could be useful in deterring immediate enemy amphibious counterattacks and give ground units some extra breathing room to continue establishing a beachhead for follow-on forces. With American aircraft able to rapidly create shallow-water minefields and the threat of submarines and underwater drones covertly emplacing threats in deeper waters or behind the front lines, an opponent might find themselves wary of just leaving port when it matters most. The Navy’s new and improved stockpile will help ensure the service maintains these important capabilities to deny enemies freedom of movement and force them to reconsider their plans of attack.

The War Zone staff,"Updated on Aug 9, 2021",Here Is The Much-Anticipated Government Report On Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Director Of National Intelligence has finally released a much-anticipated report on just what information the U.S. military and U.S. Intelligence Community has regarding unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, more commonly referred to as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, and what they’ve done with that data, as well as what sort risks the phenomenon might pose to national security. You can read the unclassified version of the report, which the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence had requested last year, for yourself and the link below. Read the entire report here . A copy of the report can also be found here . “For years, the men and women we trust to defend our country reported encounters with unidentified aircraft that had superior capabilities, and for years their concerns were often ignored and ridiculed,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement ahead of the report’s release. “This report is an important first step in cataloging these incidents, but it is just a first step. The Defense Department and Intelligence Community have a lot of work to do before we can actually understand whether these aerial threats present a serious national security concern.” Hype for this review, the Senate’s interest in which had first emerged in June 2020 , has been steadily building all year. “Frankly, there are a lot more sightings than have been made public,” John Ratcliffe, who had been Director of National Intelligence between May 2020 and January 2021, under President Donald Trump, told Fox News in March . “There are instances where we don’t have good explanations for some of the things that we’ve seen,” he added. “And when that information becomes declassified, I’ll be able to talk a little bit more about that.” “What is true, and I’m actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don’t know exactly what they are.” former President Barack Obama had also said in May during an appearance on CBS ‘ “The Late Late Show with James Corden.” The request for this report had first appeared in a separate report that Senator Rubio had submitted on behalf of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence as an accompaniment to a draft of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. The Senators on the Intelligence Committee had demanded that this UAP review be submitted in an unclassified form, though it could have a classified annex, within 180 days of that legislation becoming actual law. The final version of that bill was included in the larger Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 , which President Donald Trump signed in December 2020. When it first emerged that the Senate Intelligence Committee was interested in getting this information, the U.S. Navy had already publicly confirmed that it had provided multiple members of Congress with classified briefings on the topic of UAPs in recent years. The news was also the latest addition to a years-long burst of mainstream reporting, and general public interest, into what the U.S. government, to include the U.S. military, has or hasn’t been doing on the matter of sightings of unexplained aerial objects and related issues. This had been prompted by series of stories, starting in 2017, centering largely on the disclosure of the existence of a number of still very murky U.S. military initiatives, primarily one known as the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program , or AATIP, which reportedly delved in the matter of UAPs/UFOs. Its predecessor, known as Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Application Program, or AAWSAP, which was the pet program of then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, also dealt with fringe and pseudo-scientific topics . Adding to the media frenzy, Luis Elizondo , a veteran counter-intelligence officer who says he ran AATIP – something the Pentagon has disputed, but without providing hard evidence – came out publicly after quitting his job within the Department of Defense in protest. Not long after, he joined Christopher Mellon , who was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence between 1999 and 2002, and other ex-government officials, among others, to establish To The Stars Academy with the at times bizarrely outspoken rocker Tom DeLonge at its helm. The enterprise was established to promote awareness surrounding the UFO cause and to monetize it for entertainment purposes. A television show on the History Channel quickly followed that ran for two seasons. Since then, the fellowship and business venture has fallen apart and now Elizondo and Mellon have been working independently to promote the issue and its potential national security implications, and they have been amazingly successful at it, clearly. That original reporting on AATIP and the founding of To The Stars Academy largely focused on a trio of leaked videos that had been shot from U.S. Navy fighter jets over the years that purported to show UAPs/UFOs and the experiences of various Navy pilots who had been involved in sightings of such phenomena . The Pentagon formally released those clips , one of which was filmed in 2004 and shows an object that is now commonly referred to as the “ Tic Tac ,” in April 2020, over three years after the last one had been unofficially leaked. Then, in August of that year, the Pentagon announced it had established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) within the U.S. Navy. This task force, the official mission of which is “to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security,” is housed within the larger Office of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare/Director of Naval Intelligence, also known as N2/N6. The UAPTF sounds robust, but it is really just a few people, some of which have other assignments, as well. The potential that UAP sightings represent “a threat to U.S. national security,” and potential malign activity by American adversaries is a very real concern. It is possible, if not highly probable that a not insignificant number of these sightings involve unmanned aircraft capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance of sensitive areas in and around the territory of the United States, as you read about in great detail in this War Zone feature . In fact, in the past year or so, new reports or additional details about previous incidents, many of which The War Zone has been first to report on, have continued to emerge about what are likely to have been interactions with drones in sensitive areas. This includes our reports about previously undisclosed incidents near the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant in Arizona and the U.S. Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) air defense battery on Guam , as well as on new information about the swarming of Navy destroyers off southern California , all of which occurred in 2019. The Navy has said the flying objects involved in the latter incident remain unidentified . Regardless of what each unique incident involved, we know for a fact, through our reporting, that man-made systems are being encountered disproportionately in remote military operating areas where America’s most capable weaponry is utilized in training on a daily basis. Whether there are more exotic and unexplainable events occurring in these areas as well is yet to be understood. Hopefully this report will help clear up some of the lingering questions regarding what is actually going on regarding this issue, but it is also likely to result in more questions than it answers. There is also the issue of just how horribly the DoD has handled this issue historically and especially in recent years that remains to be dealt with. The Department of Defense Inspector General has taken up the UAP issue and how the military has dealt with it recently. It could very well turn out that we learn more about all of this from its findings than from this much-anticipated report. We will give this historic report a close examination and will be back soon with further analysis. UPDATE: 6:10 PM EST — With the release of this report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks has sent out a memorandum detailing the Pentagon’s plans to respond to its recommendations. This includes a plan to “formalize the mission currently performed by the UAPTF” and otherwise improve the “collection, reporting and analysis” of UAP- related intelligence and other information. You can read the full memo below: DOD “Incursions into our training ranges and designated airspace pose safety of flight and operations security concerns, and may pose national security challenges. DOD takes reports of incursions – by any aerial object, identified or unidentified – very seriously, and investigates each one,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby also said in a statement . “The report submitted today highlights the challenges associated with assessing UAP occurring on or near DOD training ranges and installations. The report also identified the need to make improvements in processes, policies, technologies, and training to improve our ability to understand UAP.” Other members of Congress are now responding to the report’s contents, as well. “I was first briefed on these unidentified aerial phenomena nearly three years ago. Since then, the frequency of these incidents only appears to be increasing,” Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in an statement, according to U.S. News & World Report . “The United States must be able to understand and mitigate threats to our pilots, whether they’re from drones or weather balloons or adversary intelligence capabilities.” “Through the Intelligence Authorization Act , the Congress and the Intelligence Committee required the preparation and release of today’s report, as it has become increasingly clear that unidentified aerial phenomena are not a rare occurrence and our government needs a unified way to gather, analyze, and contextualize these reports,” Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a press release . “We should approach these questions without preconceptions to encourage a thorough, systematized analysis of the potential national security and flight safety risks posed by unidentified aerial phenomena, whether they are the result of a foreign adversary, atmospheric or other aerial phenomena, space debris, or something else entirely.” Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com The War Zone staff"
Adam Kehoe,"Updated on Jun 28, 2021",Government Report On UFOs Offers Limited Answers While Drawing The Public Spotlight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A long-awaited preliminary assessment from the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force was published yesterday by the Director of National Intelligence. The nine-page document was limited in detail, but appeared to be at odds with expectations that the report would eliminate U.S. classified programs as an explanation of some sightings. The underlying conclusion was one of uncertainty and a still-nascent effort to respond to the UAP issue. The report defined “UAP” in an appendix as “airborne objects [that are] not immediately identifiable.” Given the broad definition, it is unsurprising that the analytic framework of the report focused on multiple possible explanations of UAP sightings. The report enumerated the following possibilities: Airborne clutter: objects including birds, balloons, recreational drones or even plastic bags Natural atmospheric weather phenomena like ice crystals or thermal fluctuations that can interfere with some sensor systems Assets operated by U.S. entities Foreign adversary systems All other explanations The analysis cited 144 reports, 80 of which involved observations based on multiple sensors. The number of reports with multiple sensor systems increased the UAPTF’s confidence that UAP often are “physical objects.” Of the 144 reports, the analysis only mentions one incident that was resolved; it was found to be a large balloon deflating. In terms of defense equities, the report had very unclear conclusions. With respect to foreign adversary systems, the report claimed, “we currently lack data to indicate any UAP are part of a foreign collection program or indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary.” In regard to U.S. assets, the report also conceded that “we were unable to confirm, however, that these systems accounted for any of the UAP reports we collected.” In fact, the report made no strong conclusions at all, with its apparent aim to promote further investigation and to seek greater resources. The report emphasized the limitations of the available data, stating “there was wide variability in the reports and the dataset is currently too limited to allow for detailed trend or pattern analysis.” That said, the report did find there is “clustering” of UAP observations around “U.S. training and testing grounds” but cautioned that the pattern may be the result of a collection bias due to the greater number of advanced sensors operating in those areas. The War Zone recently reported nearly two dozen incidents like these recorded by the Federal Aviation Administration, clustered in conspicuous military hotspots off the East Coast and in the Southwest. The East Coast has been a particular nexus of activity dating back at least until 2013, prompting repeated safety concerns by Navy pilots. There were several curious references in the document. Despite the limited data, the UAPTF claimed it was possible to perform some clustering of data around “shape, size, and particularly, propulsion.” It was unclear what kind of propulsion the report is referencing. Examples might include prop, rotor, lighter than air, jet or some unknown category. In areas like these, the report did not offer specifics. Further, the authors of the report stated that 18 incidents described in 21 reports involved “unusual UAP movement patterns.” These unusual patterns are not described in detail, but are loosely characterized as involving abrupt maneuvering, remaining stationary against the wind, and moving at considerable speed without “discernible means of propulsion.” Earlier in the report, the UAPTF notes that observations of unusual flight characteristics “could be the result of sensor errors, spoofing, or observer misperception and require additional rigorous analysis.” The report itself again provides no details about the data underlying the 21 reports. The UAPTF stated that a “small amount of data” supported UAP “demonstrating acceleration or a degree of signature management.” The reference to “signature management” likely refers to some aspect of stealth technology, traditionally having to do with reducing a craft’s radar, infrared, visual, and/or audible signature. However, the report also cautioned that additional analysis would be necessary, including by multiple teams or groups of technical experts. The report states: “we are conducting further analysis to determine if breakthrough technologies were demonstrated.” Although much of the underlying data appears in doubt, the report asserts one strong conclusion: “UAP threaten flight safety and, possibly, national security.” The report again offered few details, but indicated that 11 incidents involved “near misses with a UAP.” Further, the report acknowledged that there could be a broader danger from espionage against military activities and facilities, or from a potential “breakthrough aerospace technology.” The UAPTF emphasized the need to standardize and consolidate reporting of incidents in order to deepen the analysis. The report mentions the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to “cluster and recognize similarities and patterns.” In terms of data, the report stated that the U.S. Navy has provided the majority of information to date. The United States Air Force, again somewhat absent from the conversation, has apparently begun a six-month pilot program as of November 2020 to collect information in the “most likely areas to encounter UAP.” It is unclear from the report where these areas are, or what intelligence the program is based on if the USAF has not been systematically tracking reports until recently. The Air Force has been notably tight-lipped on anything to do with the UAP issue, even though it is their mission to defend America’s sovereign airspace during peacetime, not the Navy’s. You can read more about this strange situation in this past piece of ours. The FAA also featured prominently as both a collector and manager of data. Again, the UAPTF does not offer detail but mentions that it has “begun receiving data” from the FAA. As might be expected, given the preliminary nature of the report and the lack of a firmly established center for UAP analysis, it concludes with a request for increased investment. Here, too, details are scarce. Little is mentioned beyond references to an intelligence collection strategy, technical roadmap and a program plan that were not included in the public report. While the report makes several useful contributions to the public record, such as the number of cases evaluated, it does not offer much indication of a response in proportion to the larger problem. For example, in March The War Zone reported on a dramatic series of events involving unidentified aircraft apparently harassing Navy vessels off the coast of Southern California. As part of our reporting, we persistently asked public affairs officials in the Navy as well as the Department of Defense three basic questions: What happened? What is being done about this? If something similar happened tomorrow, would the Navy and the Department of Defense be better prepared? Those officials acknowledged our questions but never answered them. Applying the same questions to the report is a sobering exercise. By and large, this report tells us that the UAPTF knows relatively little about what has happened in the past. In their words, the dataset is “too limited” to allow for detailed analysis. The UAPTF is similarly uncertain if breakthrough technologies have been observed. It doesn’t know if UAP belong to foreign competitors, and it cannot confirm if U.S. assets explain any of the reports. It has solved one case out of 144. In terms of what is being done, the answer is an effort to better collect and organize data, including from the FAA. That said, we know from our coverage of incidents reported to the FAA that it does not retain records on many incidents beyond forty-five days. Further, the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT), the Navy’s main aviation command on the East Coast, also told us it had no records on many recent incidents of interest. Why? According to internal communication obtained via FOIA, “there are no current procedures in place to gather and maintain those records on file.” They further stated that “there are no procedures/requirements in place to maintain that data for more than 1 year unless an incident resulting in a hazrep [hazard report] was involved.” In short, both the Navy and the FAA continue to have short institutional and archival memories, despite repeated claims that the military is amending and improving its reporting practices. Still, with an increased focus on this problem, there is some hope that will change. Strikingly, the report makes no mention of what should be done about the UAPs that it concedes could potentially be a national security threat. The report offers no potential physical solutions to a problem that, at the very least, somewhat routinely threatens aviation safety. Even in a world where the FAA and the DOD collect better data, presumably pilots and U.S. facilities will be at the same risk until something is done to actually identify and stop aircraft from being where they should not be. In short, we still don’t know much about what has been happening. There are attempts to gather better information, but details are anything but clear. There is nothing planned in the report that will decrease the possibility of a midair collision or of sensitive intelligence collection on a U.S. facility. It is difficult to fault the UAPTF itself too strongly for these problems. By many accounts , the entire task force consists of less than three people at any given time. Clearly, the task force did not have extensive access to classified programs, leading to their inability to rule them out in any particular case. Additionally, we have little idea what access the task force had to the best analytical capabilities in the threat intelligence community. The inconclusive nature of the report suggests that access was limited. It is unsurprising that the issue has attracted the attention of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. It is prudent to ask if it makes sense to entrust questions of breakthrough technology, espionage, or potentially lethal and recurrent issues of aviation safety to three people with limited access to classification information. To be sure, there are several major positive aspects of the report. Despite its lack of detail, it does establish that there are significant defense and safety equities involved in this problem. The clear statement of the problem stands in stark contrast to the lack of data or a larger plan to address that problem. That gap should be an impetus for lawmakers and the Department of Defense to act more decisively. Encouragingly, the Department of Defense has already announced plans to formalize the mission of the UAPTF and enhance its access to information. You can see the Deputy Secretary of Defense’s memo, which was published shortly after the UAP report went public, below: DoD The statements of the two chairs of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence have underscored the need to find out more, and to take the issue seriously, as well. Other lawmakers have seemed to of reacted positively to report, as well. These are very early indicators of what will hopefully be an increasingly sophisticated response to the problem. This should not be taken for granted, and clearly, the UAPTF process has served a function as a focusing mechanism, if nothing else. It has been easy to discount reports of unidentified aircraft as ghost stories. Given the evolution of technology over time, the skies have become more complex due to the proliferation of advanced drone and balloon technologies, as well as a number of other maturing capabilities. Recent stories we have covered involving unidentified aircraft paint a sobering picture . For example, they involve multiple aircraft hovering over Navy warships . They involve aircraft orbiting active nuclear reactors with spotlights. They involve aircraft coming within 15 feet of an F-35 . They involve apparent reconnaissance of strategic anti-missile batteries. Other stories continue to develop, and known incidents now number in the dozens. One enduring problem is the circus-like atmosphere that still pervades the issue, with decades of attendant baggage. It is difficult to avoid, given that “UAP” is used widely by the media, the public and even some former defense officials to connote extraterrestrials. This tendency still stands in the way of clear-sighted evaluation of the facts. Few of the countless articles written on the topic have tackled the details of the defense and intelligence issues — despite the report being jointly prepared by the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Defense for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence — the focus has largely alluded to aliens, instead. UAP, as the UAPTF points out, are likely many things. They do not have a single explanation, something we have stressed heavily in the past. One thing is sure: these incidents are a test of our collective maturity and intelligence. It is easy to lapse into facile debate and speculation about aliens. While we debate, warships and nuclear reactors receive unwelcome visits from unidentified aircraft, and pilots continue to have harrowing encounters with them. Our three unanswered questions remain pressing: what happened? What is being done? Are we better prepared if it happens again? While the preliminary report does not fully address these questions, it offers some hope that lawmakers may begin asking them more forcefully.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 13, 2021",‘R2-D2’ Spotted On Scaled Composite’s ARES Test Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Scaled Composites, the storied ‘bleeding-edge’ aircraft design firm, is known for their absolutely ecclectic array of exotic airframes . Some of them, created for one purpose, have then gone on to serve long lives as test aircraft for various systems and concepts, with the Department Of Defense being their most persistent customer. One such aircraft, ARES, which stands for Agile Responsive Effective Support, was built 30 years ago as a very light and affordable close air support proof of concept aircraft . Fast forward to today and the little jet’s 25mm cannon may be long gone, but it has continued to serve brilliantly as a testbed, at times being highly modified with various systems. Now it appears that it has received its very own version of Star Wars’ most iconic ‘astromech droid.’ ARES is quite modular in nature and has been fitted with all types of satellite communications systems over the years. It’s thought to have served as a surrogate testbed for a number of classified unmanned aircraft programs, in particular. As such, it isn’t that odd to see a satcom dome mounted on its spine. James Reeder What is new is that this particular satcom dome looks like the top of R2-D2, the loveable droid from Star Wars that acts as a sort of navigator and flight engineer, and that clearly wasn’t lost on the Scaled Composites team. The dome wears a paint pattern that is a dead ringer to the Star Wars fan fav. The placement is also absolutely spot on, with R2-D2 riding above behind the cockpit of Luke’s X-Wing starfighter in the original films and other media. Lucas Film The shots come to us from aviation photographer James Reeder, who goes by the handle @boreeder on Instagram . He snapped these pictures of ARES while it was landing at Mojave Air And Space Port, home to Scaled Composites, on June 24th, 2021. James Reeder Scaled Composites has a very creative culture and a lot of thought seems to be put into the lore and naming of their unique aircraft, which sport monikers like Proteus and Firebird . Just take ARES ‘children,’ the Model 401 ‘Son Of ARES’ demonstrators, Deimos and Phobos , as an example (yes it is a father!). In fact, just look at one of the stencils painted ARES’ fuselage showing pride of its offspring—the ‘chemtrail tank’ is also a nice touch. Deimos and Phobos have gone on to do all types of shadowy work since their birth four years ago. No wonder their father is proud. With all this in mind, it’s not too surprising that the folks at Scaled Composites would have a little fun with what is a glaring resemblance of ARES’ satcom installation to the classic R2-D2 and X-Wing configuration. It’s certainly isn’t the first time such a connection has been made in the military aviation world, either. Now can it lock down a stabilizer? That’s classified.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 25, 2021",Marine Osprey Flies With New Radar-Scrambling Intrepid Tiger System For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Marine Corps MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor has flown for the first time with an Intrepid Tiger II electronic warfare system . The Marines have previously fielded versions of Intrepid Tiger on the AV-8B Harrier jump jet, F/A-18C/D Hornet fighter jet, the KC-130J Hercules tanker-transport, and the UH-1Y Venom armed utility helicopter. The hope is that the variant for the Osprey, which includes new radar jamming functionality, will be a stepping stone to further expanding the electronic warfare capabilities available to the Marine Corps’ current and future aircraft fleets. The U.S. Navy’s Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), in cooperation with the Marine Corps, conducted the flight test at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland on June 15. The formal designation of the Intrepid Tiger variant for the Osprey, which has been years in the making now , is AN/ALQ-231(V)4 and is also commonly referred to as the Intrepid Tiger II (IT II) (V)4. An older AN/ALQ-231(V)3 Intrepid Tiger II pod on a UH-1Y Venom helicopter., USMC “The significance of this developmental test flight was two-fold,” U.S. Navy Captain Michael Orr, head of NAVAIR’s Airborne Electronic Attack Systems Program Office, said in a statement. “Not only was this the first time we’ve integrated the Intrepid Tiger II capability onto an Osprey but also the first time the capability has been incorporated internal to a platform.” The MV-22B, in its present form, does not have the ability to carry external stores of any kind operationally, though the Marine Corps has carried out various tests in the past, including the launching of laser-guided 70mm rockets from a pod mounted on a pylon attached to the side of the aircraft’s forward fuselage. An MV-22B Osprey fires a 70mm laser-guided rocket from a pod mounted on a pylon on the side of the aircraft’s forward fuselage., Public Domain This means that the Osprey cannot readily carry either of the two distinct versions of Intrepid Tiger II that are in use now, both of which are podded. The AN/ALQ-231(V)1, originally fielded on the AV-8B, is also used on the F/A-18C/D and the KC-130J. The UH-1Y is presently the only platform to use the improved AN/ALQ-231(V)3. An AV-8B Harrier jump jet with an AN/ALQ-231(V1) pod on the inboard station under its left wing., USN There is no description readily available of what the AN/ALQ-231(V)2 variant might have been, or what aircraft it was intended to be used on. There had previously been discussion about developing a version of the Intrepid Tiger system for use on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as part of the plans for replacing the Marines EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare planes. It is of course, worth noting, that all of the variants of the F-35, including the Bs and Cs that the Marine Corps flies, already have robust internal electronic warfare suites . A slide from a 2017 Marine Corps briefing discussing the (V)1 and (V)3 versions of the Intrepid Tiger II system., USMC A page from the US Marine Corps’ 2016 Aviation Plan, showing plans to integrate Intrepid Tiger into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter after the retirement of the EA-6B Prowler., USMC Regardless, there is no indication that the Marines are pursuing an IT II (V)2 variant for use on any platform now. There had been plans for a version of the RQ-21A Blackjack drone, which was previously in line to be designated as the (V)4 type, too. However, that effort appears to have been shelved and the Marine Corps is now in the process of divesting its entire RQ-21A fleet . Instead, the IT II (V)4 system is designed to be a roll-on/roll-off payload that is centered on an equipment rack that goes inside the Osprey’s main cabin. It’s unclear where the antennas associated with the system are mounted. An operator then uses a laptop computer to control its functionality. A laptop control system has also been observed in use with the IT II (V)3 variant. A Marine Corps MV-22B during its first test flight equipped with the AN/ALQ-231(V)4 Intrepid Tiger electronic warfare system., USN A Marine onboard a UH-1Y helicopter uses a laptop to operate the Intrepid Tiger II electronic warfare system. The AN/ALQ-231(V)3 pod mounted on the helicopter is seen in the background., USMC At its core, the Intrepid Tiger family of systems are primarily electronic warfare jammers. The initial versions were developed and fielded quickly to provide additional electronic warfare capacity in support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan . As such, they were primarily tailored toward communications jamming and could also be used to disrupt remotely-triggered improvised explosive devices (IED). They also had secondary intelligence-gathering capabilities, allowing operators to actually snoop on enemy communications chatter. Intrepid Tiger II can selectively jam certain frequencies and the total frequency range that the system could cover was expanded in the IT II (V)3 version. That variant also added in direction-finding capability, allowing equipped UH-1Ys to detect and attack hostile transmissions. That capability enables the system to help locate the exact position of enemy forces, which could then be struck or avoided, as well as provide general increased situational awareness. At the same time, Intrepid Tiger was also part of a broader “system of systems” concept for replacing the robust electronic warfare capabilities that the EA-6B Prowler had offered. With this in mind, the IT II (V)4 system for the Osprey notably adds long-planned self-protection capabilities in the form of a new ability to detect and jam enemy radars. This improved functionality, which has been referred to in the past as the Block X upgrade for the Intrepid Tiger II system, is also set to be integrated into existing IT (V)1 pods. Another Marine Corps briefing slide from 2017 discussing the plans for the Block X upgrade to Intrepid Tiger II, including as a payload for the MV-22B. The planned Intrepid Tiger II variant for the RQ-21A Blackjack drone is also mentioned here., USMC This is a significant development that takes Intrepid Tiger II from being primarily geared toward use in lower-end conflicts and moves it toward a system that would be more useful in higher-end scenarios where more robust hostile air defenses and ever more advanced enemy aircraft may be significant threats. This of course comes as the U.S. military, as a whole, continues to shift its focus toward preparing for potential fights with larger, more capable adversaries, including potential near-peer opponents, such as China or Russia . Many smaller countries , and even non-state actors , are increasingly fielding more capable anti-air weaponry , as well. “As the 21st Century Battlespace becomes more complex and more contested, military assets must support themselves across the entire spectrum of threats,” U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Brian Taylor, V-22 Joint Program Office Program Manager, said in a statement after the flight test of the Intrepid Tiger II-equipped Osprey. “The fielding of this upgrade provides a significant and incremental improvement in the V-22’s organic electronic warfare capability, providing commanders more options to support our Marine Corps ground forces. This improves both operational safety to our aircrews and operational success to the commander, our ultimate goals in everything we do.” For Marine Ospreys, which are non-stealthy platforms, Intrepid Tiger would give the tilt-rotors a valuable additional layer of protection when working in more contested environments. This could be especially valuable when conducting what the Marines refer to as tactical recovery of aircraft personnel, or TRAP, as well as combat search and rescue (CSAR). In the past, the Corps has described TRAP as distinct from CSAR , with the latter involving the expectation of enemy resistance, while the former does not. However, TRAP missions could still be conducted in areas where there might be a risk of threats suddenly emerging. The Navy and Marines are now hoping to be able to port over the IT II(V)4 variant to the KC-130J, which would give those aircraft this added defensive electronic warfare capability, as well as remove the need for them to carry a podded version of Intrepid Tiger. That would also eliminate the need to use one of the aircraft’s underwing pylons for this purpose, freeing it up to be able to carry other stores. That could particularly important for KC-130Js with the roll-on/roll-off Harvest Hawk sensor and armament kit, which you can read more about here . A KC-130J equipped with the Harvest Hawk kit., Lockheed Martin It has already proven to be relatively easy for new and improved capabilities to be added into podded versions of Intrepid Tiger and it could be equally simple to upgrade the roll-on/roll-off payload as time goes on. Future variants of the system could also make use of modular, open-architecture systems, which are increasingly the default when it comes to electronic warfare suites , as well as sensor and communications packages , among other electronics, to further speed up the integration of added functionality. The basic roll-on/roll-off nature of the IT II(V)4 package could make it more adaptable to other platforms, as well, something that may be of interest to other branches of the U.S. military, as well as foreign allies and partners. The Marines are hardly the only component of the American armed forces that are looking to develop and field improved electronic warfare capabilities with a particular eye toward employing them in potential higher-end conflicts . In the meantime, this recent flight test of the new version of Intrepid Tiger II on Osprey already marks a significant step forward in adding important electronic warfare capabilities to that aircraft and in expanding the overall capabilities of all of the variants of this already very valuable system.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 25, 2021",Russian MiG-31s Armed With Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles Join Tu-22M3 Bombers In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A pair of Russian MiG-31K Foxhound jet fighters armed with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles has touched down for the first time in Syria, which is also the first trip anywhere outside of Russia for these aircraft and weapons. These converted interceptors are joined by Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria’s coastal Latakia province, marking the second time the latter type has been deployed to the country in the space of a month. These aircraft are ostensibly in the country to take part in exercises in the eastern Mediterranean Sea that will also include other types of planes, as well as Russian warships and submarines. The deployment to Syria of these aircraft — reportedly together with Il-38 May anti-submarine planes — comes just days after the U.K. Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth launched its first combat missions against ISIS militants in Iraq from its position in the eastern Mediterranean. According to official Russian accounts, “one of the objectives of the exercises will be to monitor the actions of the [British] aircraft carrier group.” A MiG-31K taxies at Khmeimim Air Base., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap With the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Defender having broken off from providing an escort to HMS Queen Elizabeth and entering the Black Sea, where earlier this week it incurred Russian wrath for its transit off the coast of Crimea , this show of force in the eastern Mediterranean has an added resonance, providing another demonstration of Moscow’s military power projection to the United Kingdom in particular. News of these deployments to Khmeimim first emerged earlier today, with the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television station, TV Zvezda , posting a video showing MiG-31Ks and Tu-22M3s arriving at the base. The clip also noted that joint exercises by the Russian Aerospace Forces and Russian Navy units had already begun. Two different MiG-31Ks are seen in the footage, with the Russian registrations on their tailfins censored, but with the individual aircraft’s codes ‘Red 90’ and ‘Red 96’ clearly visible on the forward fuselages. A subsequent video directly from the Russian Ministry of Defense shows one of these aircraft taking off with its huge Kinzhal missile, a single example of which can be carried on the centerline. A separate official statement said that the MiGs “have begun to fulfill the tasks of mastering the airspace of the region.” Three Tu-22M3s are also seen in the footage — aircraft ‘Red 15,’ ‘Red 28,’ and ‘Red 50’ — two of which are armed with Kh-22 or Kh-32 series long-range cruise missiles. Of these Backfires, both ‘Red 15,’ wearing the Russian registration RF-94149, and thought to be home-based at Shaykovka in western Russia, and ‘Red 50,’ RF-34091, from Belaya in the Russian Far East, participated in the previous deployment to Syria, late last month . A pair of Tu-22M3s during the latest deployment to Syria. Both are armed with Kh-22 or Kh-32 series long-range cruise missiles., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap The Backfires have already been flying simulated combat missions, according to the defense ministry. “Airplane pilots have gained practical skills to perform missions in new geographic areas,” said the commander of Long-Range Aviation, Lieutenant General Sergei Kobylash. “Tasks were carried out to destroy the conditional enemy. The tasks were completed with high quality. Aviation technology has once again confirmed its high reliability. The flight personnel gained invaluable experience.” Russian personnel attend to a Tu-22M3 at Khmeimim., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap TV Zvezda ’s reporting has outlined the Russian maneuvers, which are also said to involve five Russian Navy warships, including the Slava class guided-missile cruiser Moskva , the Admiral Grigorovich class frigates Admiral Essen and Admiral Makarov , as and the Improved Kilo class submarines Stary Oskol and Rostov-on-Don . All these are from Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. In one of the first elements of the exercise that apparently began today, surface warships practiced their air defense skills “to repel enemy air attack weapons,” according to the defense ministry. In this scenario, simulated enemy aircraft flew a mock attack against a frigate with anti-ship missiles. The Admiral Grigorovich class frigate Admiral Essen and Admiral Makarov. , Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap Also reportedly taking part in the drills are Il-38 and Tu-142MK Bear-F anti-submarine aircraft, though neither type has been seen in the imagery that has been released so far. According to the same source, the aircraft in the exercise will conduct “combat training tasks to ensure the security of the Khmeimim Air Base and the Russian Navy’s Tartus logistics center .” “During training flights, aviation technology and equipment will be tested in difficult climatic conditions, including those caused by exposure to high temperatures and the possibility of long flights over the water,” the TV Zvezda report adds. “Aircraft crews will acquire practical skills to practice training tasks in new geographic areas.” A satellite image of Khmeimim Air Base on the morning of May 24, 2021.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Earlier this year, The War Zone reported on how the airbase at Khmeimim was undergoing runway extension as part of a refurbishment of the base that will help it to accommodate bombers, like the Tu-22M3. The MiG-31, too, will likely benefit from these infrastructure improvements. The basic MiG-31 requires almost 4,000 feet of runway to take off, but that figure is certainly increased when carrying the Kinzhal. When Russia first deployed Tu-22M3s to Syria, The War Zone suggested that it might be timed to coincide with the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth , which is the centerpiece of Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21). That turned out not to be the case, but Russia has acknowledged that the second visit of Tu-22M3s (plus MiG-31Ks) to Khmeimim will include monitoring the British-led task group as it conducts operations in the eastern Mediterranean. MiG-31K crew salute on their arrival in Syria., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap As we discussed before , the Tu-22M3 offers a powerful long-range anti-shipping strike capability, although now these aircraft all serve with the Russian Aerospace Forces, not the Russian Navy. Nevertheless, the aircraft is able to launch the 38-foot Kh-22 (AS-4 Kitchen) and the improved Kh-32. These are powered by a liquid-fuel rocket and can reach a speed of over Mach 4 for the final run-in to the target. The missiles carry either a nuclear or high-explosive warhead. The maximum range after launch from high altitude is over 300 miles for the earlier Kh-22 and reportedly over 500 miles for the Kh-32. The Kinzhal missile, meanwhile, which is currently carried exclusively by the MiG-31K, is one of the weapons unveiled by President Vladimir Putin in 2018, at which time he said it could deliver “nuclear and conventional warheads to a range of over 2,000 kilometers [1,243 miles],” flying at a hypersonic velocity, “10 times faster than the speed of sound.” The exact performance of the missile has not been verified, but, as The War Zone was first to report , it is adapted from the Iskander ballistic missile and its hypersonic velocity likely comes during the terminal phase of its attack as it dives on its target. ‘Red 90,’ one of the jets now in Syria, carried a Kinzhal during the 2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade., Russian Presidential Press and Information Office The Kinzhal — which has the Western reporting name Killjoy —  can be used to attack ground or naval targets, with an active radar seeker enabling it to carry out anti-ship missions. While there are plans to field the MiG-31K and Kinzhal combination in Russian Navy units, so far, it has been deployed by the flight-test unit at Akhtubinsk in Astrakhan, southern Russia. The two aircraft at Khmeimim, ‘90 Red’ and ‘96 Red,’ are known to be associated with this unit, which carries out combat tests and evaluations. Put together, the Tu-22M3s and MiG-31Ks with the warships and submarines of the Black Sea Fleet now reportedly in the eastern Mediterranean represent a very capable anti-shipping force, capable of launching a range of hypersonic, supersonic, and subsonic anti-ship missiles. In a combat scenario, these would be used in combination in an attempt to overwhelm the air defenses of a carrier group, for example. Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap With tensions between the United Kingdom and Russia already heightened as a result of the controversial passage of the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Defender through waters claimed by Russia off the coast of Crimea, the situation in the eastern Mediterranean is likely to be similarly pressured. Beyond the immediate vicinity, the stationing of long-range maritime strike aircraft in Syria has provided another vector from which to project Russian military power in various directions. While the current exercise focuses on maritime warfare, the MiG-31K and Tu-22M3 are also equally capable of attacking objectives on land, with enough range to put most of Western Europe as well as a considerable chunk of North Africa and the Middle East at risk. As long as CSG21 remains in the eastern Mediterranean and long-range Russian aircraft are operating from their deployment base in Syria, the two sides are likely to carefully monitor each other during the days to come.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Aug 20, 2021",Police Helicopter Crew Says Mysterious Craft They Chased Was “Not Like Any Other” Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In February 2021, what was described as a “highly modified drone” was able to evade and outrun helicopters operated by both U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Tucson Police Department (TPD) after entering sensitive airspace . An FBI investigation was announced shortly after, in which the bureau sought the public’s help for information related to the case. The War Zone has now obtained the TPD’s official Case Summary Report from the incident, which shows the air crews aboard the two helicopters that chased the drone were mystified by the capabilities it displayed. The drone was first spotted above fuel tanks just west of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, and flew into controlled airspace surrounding the base and Tucson International Airport after the TPD and CBP helicopters began their pursuit. The law enforcement helicopters followed the drone northwest out of the city before losing it in the clouds around 14,000 feet. The CBP was operating an Airbus AS350 on the night of the incident, while sources close to the investigation tell us the Tucson PD Air Support was flying a Bell 206B-3 Jet Ranger. A Bell 206B-3 Jet Ranger operated by the Tucson Police Department Air Support., TPD via Facebook The story of the mysterious drone encounter above Tucson was first broken by Dan Marries of KOLD News , a local CBS affiliate out of Tucson. Marries shared details about the drone with The War Zone following our initial reporting , telling us that the FBI agents involved with the case said that the drone was reported to be “highly modified,” made “erratic maneuvers,” and even strayed into military airspace while reaching an altitude of 14,000 feet and maintaining speeds in excess of 100 mph into a headwind. In an interview on KOLD, an FBI agent familiar with the case reported that the FBI isn’t sure if the drone was a quadcopter or hexcopter configuration. Thanks to a TPD records request, The War Zone can confirm details about the drone’s alleged flight capabilities and flight path as reported by the TPD helicopter crew in their official Case Summary Report. For one, we can now pinpoint the initial location the drone was spotted by the Tucson PD air crew: the corner of East Ajo Way and South Palo Verde Road, directly adjacent to a fuel terminal operated by energy company Kinder Morgan and just west of Davis-Monthan AFB. TPD Satellite imagery showing the locations of the corner of E Ajo Way and South Palo Verde Rd (1); the Kinder Morgan fuel terminal (2); and runway 12 at Davis-Monthan AFB (3)., Google Maps The Case Summary also confirms our earlier reporting that the drone featured a single green light on its underbody and was difficult for the TPD helicopter’s spotter to observe through night vision goggles. Note that the report states that no video recording was made of the incident by the TPD. TPD The report’s “Notes/Narrative” section, authored by the TPD helicopter’s Tactical Flight Officer, then details how the drone “maneuvered all over the city” while flying above 10,000 feet, all while behaving “in a manner to hamper [the TPD crew’s] ability to track it visually.” The TPD crew also reported that the drone “appeared to move in an erratic pattern as if the signal with its home station was getting weaker” as it flew northwest out of the city. The flight officer then reports the drone was last seen at an altitude “in excess of 12,000 feet” flying over 65 knots (74 mph). TPD The report’s “Supplement Notes” section was authored by the helicopter’s pilot and details the coordination between the TPD, Tucson Air Traffic Control (ATC), and the CBP helicopter crew. The TPD helicopter pilot wrote that the crew “had hoped the uas would exhaust its battery reserves and be forced to land,” but that “unfortunately, this was not the case.” The pilot also stated that the drone “was very sophisticated/specialized and able to perform like no other uas” he had observed previously, able to fly circles around his helicopter as the TPD pursued it up to 14,000 feet at speeds “well in excess of 100mph.” The pilot also felt that it was “obvious that the controller had clear sight of both the helicopters tracking it by the way it would orbit us and abruptly fly behind us and attempt to avoid our visual contact.” TPD The pilot recounts that the TPD helicopter tracked the drone for over an hour as it flew into 40mph headwinds while maintaining 100mph airspeeds. Despite tracking the drone extensively, the pilot notes that the crew was unable to get a good visual on it. “Although we could not determine its exact size or characteristics we primarily tracked it by a single green non-blinking light illuminating from the craft,” the report reads. Eventually, both the TPD and CBP helicopters had to disengage their pursuit in order to refuel after losing the drone in cloud cover around 12,000 feet. TPD “It is unknown what the intentions of the sophisticated uas were during its time near the Air Force Base, or how far away its origination/destination spot was,” the pilot concluded, adding “It was quite clear though that this was not like any other uas that we have experienced.” Sources close to the investigation tell The War Zone that while the TPD regularly encounters drones in the air, they are typically small, off-the-shelf quadcopter models. Despite these details coming to light in the case of the mysterious “highly modified drone” seen above Tucson, it remains unclear what exact type of configuration could allow for the flight characteristics described in this newly-obtained police report. It certainly seems as if its pilot was highly experienced given the fact that the drone was able to run circles around the helicopters at high altitudes and speeds. The drone must have also possessed the ability to supply its pilot with superior situational awareness in order to pull off such feats. The fact that the drone appeared to maintain a high-quality command and control link suggest some fairly sophisticated hardware above what is commonly found on consumer quadcopter or hexcopter configurations, even higher-end models. It’s also unlikely that this craft ran on battery power. Whatever it was, the flight characteristics the mysterious craft displayed above Tucson on the evening of February 9 are truly eyebrow-raising and only increase the bizarre and currently unexplained nature of the incident. We continue to investigate and are pursuing multiple FOIA requests related to this puzzling event. Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com Brett Tingley Air Helicopters Unmanned"
Brett Tingley,"Updated on Oct 28, 2019",Space Force Wants Its Operations To Extend To The Expanse Between Traditional Orbits And The Moon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force Research Laboratory’s Space Vehicles Directorate has released a report detailing how the U.S. military is preparing to develop spacecraft and concepts of operations for missions beyond traditional orbits that could span all the way to the space surrounding the Moon. While the document doesn’t offer any specifics in terms of how the U.S. military might be planning to project power in space or protect its space-based assets, it does highlight the complexities that the U.S. Space Force will face as it expands into the uncharted territory of operating beyond Earth’s orbit. The report, titled “ A Primer on Cislunar Space ,” was written as a guide for military space professionals to help them better understand what cislunar space actually is and how they can better develop operating concepts and relevant capabilities for this relatively new area of operations. Because traditional Space Domain Awareness (SDA) systems were designed for geosynchronous orbits much closer to Earth, future operations beyond this region of space will require entirely new models for planning and tracking the trajectories of satellites or other craft. A satellite in cislunar space, NASA Air Force Colonel Eric Felt, director of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate, told SpaceNews recently that operating spacecraft in this area of space “poses unique challenges,” but that “as commerce extends to the Moon and beyond, it is vital we understand and solve those unique challenges so that we can provide space domain awareness and security.” Cislunar space is generally defined as the area between Earth’s atmosphere and the Moon, which orbits the Earth at an average of 238,855 miles away in a slightly elliptical, or oval-shaped orbit. Cislunar space covers some 1,728 times more volume than what is found within one geosynchronous orbit radius, or 1 GEO. As the report notes, expanding from orbits closer to the Earth into this much larger region of space means that military and civilian space agencies have to alter their “intuition and sense of distance and time” and “further expand the volume of space [they] consider when discussing cislunar topics.” An image from “A Primer on Cislunar Space” illustrating the scale of this region of space., AFRL The primer document goes into immensely technical detail about why this area poses new challenges, but it is best summed up in more general terms by its statement that “motion in cislunar space is highly chaotic,” meaning that “even the slightest deviation in the object’s current position or velocity could cause very large differences in its future propagated position and velocity.” It’s not just trajectory calculations that are vastly different in cislunar space as opposed to in geosynchronous orbit. As AFRL’s report points out, the vastness of this new space frontier means “there is no single sensor location that can observe all cislunar space.” Because the motions and locations of the Sun, Earth, and Moon create gaps in coverage for both electro-optical (EO) and radiofrequency (RF) sensor systems, AFRL identified the need for a “collaborative network of sensors” to ensure continuous coverage in cislunar space. Even ground-based sensor systems have a difficult time tracking objects in cislunar space, the report notes, due to the enormous distances it covers, and because the differences in relative motion between the Earth and objects in this area make it difficult to detect objects so far from Earth: As the objects get farther from the observer, they will naturally get fainter (both for EO as well as RF sensors) and thus will put a strain on remote sensing capabilities to the point of potentially being undetectable entirely. Also, cislunar objects will generally have much longer orbital periods than GEO, thereby creating the need for more observations to cover significant fractions of orbits. One further challenge, specific to near-Earth EO sensors, is not being able to look near the Moon due to its reflection of sunlight (i.e., albedo). To attempt to better understand this space and how to operate within it, AFRL has previously developed spaceflight experiments known as the Cislunar Highway Patrol System , or CHPS, designed to demonstrate “foundational space domain awareness capabilities in the cislunar regime” by testing object detection and tracking in this new frontier. AFRL’s Colonel Felt stated in 2020 that CHPS is merely the first step in the laboratory’s attempt to grasp domain awareness in cislunar space, and that it is “also starting to explore basic science and technology in autonomy, on-orbit processing, and logistics in all orbits, which become even more important the further you are from the Earth.” Space Force has also turned to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for help in better understanding cislunar space and how to operate within it. Specifically, a memorandum of understanding signed in 2020 between NASA and Space Force stresses the need for the two organizations to work together to develop new operations that can cover a much larger distance including cislunar space: Until now, the limits of that mission have been in near Earth, out to approximately geostationary range (22,236 miles). With new U.S. public and private sector operations extending into cislunar space, the reach of USSF’s [U.S. Space Force] sphere of interest will extend to 272,000 miles and beyond – more than a tenfold increase in range and 1,000-fold expansion in service volume. USSF now has an even greater surveillance task for space domain awareness (SDA) in that region, but its current capabilities and architecture are limited by technologies and an architecture designed for a legacy mission. AFRL’s new “Primer on Cislunar Space” and initiatives like CHPS show that even as the Space Force and Department of Defense (DOD) plan to expand military operations into farther reaches of space, even beyond traditional orbits , it still remains largely unknown what warfare operations in space will look like. It’s also unclear what particular technologies will be needed to protect American assets in Earth’s orbit and beyond, despite the fact that the Space Force already has units devoted to “orbital warfare.” The Air Force has even run internal competitions to explore new concepts for military activities in new non-traditional orbits, including very-low Earth orbit and cislunar space. “We in AFRL are working on technologies to expand space domain awareness above the GEO belt – so from the GEO belt all the way to the Moon and even a little bit beyond,” Felt stated at the time. “It’s what we call the xGEO, or the cislunar, area of operations. And as commercial people move there, and our adversaries move there, that becomes an area where we need to know what’s going on up there.” Even with the uncertainties of what it would actually look like, it’s clear DOD leadership is expecting to wage warfare in space. At the recent Defense One Tech Summit held on June 22, the AFRL’s Colonel Felt offered a very hopeful sentiment about how this potential war could take shape, stating : Space war is going to look a lot like the Cold War in a couple of different ways… First of all, we hope nobody’s actually exchanging destructive weapons with each other and that we don’t just hope, but we take active actions to deter that from happening. The nature of conflict in space is that there is an offensive advantage, or a first-mover advantage, in that it is a lot easier to attack somebody else than to defend your own stuff. And we’ve seen that before—that’s the same as with…nuclear weapons. Colonel Felt’s optimism about not getting to the point of exchanging destructive weapons may be misplaced, considering our peer adversaries in space are preparing for just that . A Pentagon image satellite layers in different levels of orbit around the Earth., DOD The United States isn’t the only nation eyeing to expand into new frontiers in cislunar space, and the potential for threats emanating from this region has been raised by actual US military officials in the past publicly. China is rapidly expanding into this area of space, prompting some concern that America’s satellites in geosynchronous orbit, including early warning sensors, could be “stabbed in the back” in the event of a conflict, which we sounded the alarm about in this past feature of ours. While it would take a threat originating from cislunar space days to reach satellites or other assets in orbits closer to Earth, it could also be that there are adversary capabilities there that we aren’t aware of that could carry out attacks on American satellites and other craft in the same region relatively rapidly and undetected. The growing concern among the DOD seems to be that it has no sense of what’s going on out there, hence the need for the Cislunar Highway Patrol System and other sensor systems capable of monitoring this region of space. “We’ve seen [reports] in open press…that say the Chinese have a relay satellite flying around…the flipside of the moon. That’s very telling to us,” said Jeff Gossel, senior intelligence engineer in the Space and Missile Analysis Group at the Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center, at an Air Force Association event in 2018. “You could fly some sort of a weapon around the moon and it comes back — it could literally come at [objects] in GEO…and we would never know because there is nothing watching in that direction.” It’s no wonder, then, that DOD leaders like former Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson have previously stated that a “ show of force ” might be needed to deter adversary nations from attacking or tampering with America’s space-based assets. “That capability needs to be one that’s understood by your adversary,” Wilson said in 2019. “They need to know there are certain things we can do, at least at some broad level, and the final element of deterrence is uncertainty. How confident are they that they know everything we can do? Because there’s a risk calculation in the mind of an adversary.” That sentiment has been echoed by other top DOD officials more recently. “It’s important for your adversary to know a lot about what your capabilities are,” the AFRL’s Colonel Felt said this week . “Whereas if you keep everything secret, they might think that they can take a gamble and win with a first strike.” Kelly D. Hammett, director of AFRL’s Directed Energy Directorate, speaking at the same conference as Colonel Felt this week, had a more definitive statement about the Space Force’s and DOD’s role in protecting American space assets. “If you look at the National Space Strategy that was signed by the Trump administration in December…it actually commits us—commits the Space Force and the Department of Defense—to…monitoring what’s going on out there,” Hammett said . “And if somebody is a bad actor in the international realm: to monitor, detect, and respond.” The uncertainties surrounding space-based warfare are compounded by the fact that many of the Space Force’s and other American space capabilities remain classified . The DOD has previously been coy about even admitting the very existence of some space assets. It remains unknown how the military plans to respond to the potential destruction or disabling of of space-based assets that “don’t exist” at all and which the public might not even know about if the Pentagon doesn’t bring it up. To compound the uncertainty, there still seems to be ambiguity about even the most basic definitions of conflict in space. With all this in mind, the recent AFRL’s Primer on Cislunar Space shows that all of these uncertainties will have to be addressed in the near-term as the U.S. military expands its operations into the vastness of space between Earth and the Moon.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 23, 2021",Russian Video Proves Patrol Boat Was Far From British Destroyer When It Fired Warning Shots,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The fallout from yesterday’s incident in the Black Sea involving the U.K. Royal Navy Type 45 destroyer HMS Defender and elements of Russia’s military and internal security forces has taken its next turn, with the release of a video showing some of the events from the perspective of a Russian Border Guard patrol ship. The footage clearly shows the Russian vessel opening fire, as the Kremlin had asserted, but it’s also obvious that Defender was so far away at the time that it may well not have been aware this were being directed at it, in line with what British authorities have said. The video in question was published online by the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television station, TV Zvezda , and the state-run media outlet RIA Novosti . It was taken from the bridge of a Russian Border Guard Rubin class patrol boat , one of those that purportedly “stopped” HMS Defender yesterday from sailing within what the Kremlin claims are its territorial waters around Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. The United Kingdom, among many other members of the intentional community, does not recognize Russia’s authority over Crimea. A Project 22460 Rubin class border patrol vessel moves in close to HMS Defender , as seen in BBC News footage., BBC NEWS SCREENCAP The video includes the discussions between the Russian Border Guards and the crew of the British destroyer, with repeated demands from the Russian security forces that HMS Defender leave the area. Two Border Guard vessels are seen trailing the destroyer, while Russian jets pass overhead, and at one point, one of the Russian vessels shadows the British warship closely — a BBC journalist’s account yesterday spoke of one of the Russian vessels getting as close as 100 meters (328 feet). One of the Border Guards is heard to say that HMS Defender is breaking the rules of innocent passage, a part of international maritime law that allows warships to move through another country’s territorial waters so long as the transit meets various criteria , particularly that it is not intended to challenge the legitimacy of any such maritime boundaries. After several more warnings, apparently ignored by the British, one of the crew members aboard the Border Guard vessel says, in Russian: “Perform precautionary fire! Perform precautionary fire! Avoid hit! Avoid hit! Fire!” At that point, we see the AK-630 six-barrel 30mm Gatling gun on the bow of the Border Guard vessel opening fire with several bursts, although at this point the British destroyer is seen on the horizon. Interestingly, in the BBC News report, it’s confirmed that shots were fired by the Russian side, “but they were well out of range.” After the shots, HMS Defender confirms that it will continue to follow its internationally recognized route into international waters. This suggests that the warship continued its planned passage and the available maritime tracking data doesn’t show it making any obvious changes in course. The available tracks are also consistent with official British accounts that the destroyer was sailing around 12 miles off the coast of Crimea. While Russia considered this to be “a flagrant violation of international norms and standards,” in the words of Sergei Tsekov , a Russian senator from the Crimea region, for the British, this amounted to “a routine transit [in] an internationally recognized traffic separation corridor,” according to the U.K. Minister of Defense Ben Wallace. Furthermore, since, as already noted, the United Kingdom does not recognize Russia’s claims over Crimea, the waters in question are considered Ukrainian from the British government’s perspective. A Crimea-based Russian Navy Be-12 Mail amphibian flies over HMS Defender ., BBC NEWS SCREENCAP All in all, the video shows that Russia did at least go through the motions of taking some aggressive action, but doesn’t provide conclusive evidence that this was sufficient to actually force HMS Defender out of waters that it claims as its own. While it’s clear that some kind of warning shots were fired, it’s also plausible that the British may not have realized what these were, and instead connected them to training exercises that were already happening in the vicinity. At least, the British would have been aware of the threat of warning shots, but their response may have been intended to deliberately provoke the Russians. “We believe the Russians were undertaking a gunnery exercise in the Black Sea and provided the maritime community with prior warning of their activity,” the U.K. Ministry of Defense tweeted yesterday. “No shots were directed at HMS Defender and we do not recognize the claim that bombs were dropped in her path.” Those bombs were, according to Russian accounts, dropped across the path of the destroyer by a Su-24M Fencer combat jet , to provide an additional warning to the British warship. So far, we have seen no evidence of the bombs actually being dropped, although video from a BBC News report yesterday does at least show a Su-24M in the vicinity seemingly carrying high-explosive bombs. The BBC also reported that the crew of the Defender was aware of the presence of at least 20 Russian military aircraft flying the area over the course of the incident. A Russian Navy Su-24M buzzes HMS Defender , apparently carrying unguided bombs under its wings and below the fuselage., BBC NEWS SCREENCAP An OFAB-500 freefall bomb, as reportedly used by a Russian Su-24M as a warning to the destroyer., Rosoboronexport All in all, it seems that this latest footage released by Russia is intended to bolster its account of what happened yesterday, which is based around its military and security forces taking strong action to ward off HMS Defender from what it deemed a territorial violation. Since the incident yesterday, Russian news outlet Kommersant has also published a map showing areas around Crimea that were reportedly temporarily closed for military drills, one of which HMS Defender apparently passed through. While the British side has not mentioned these apparent restrictions, or whether it was aware of them, it was seemingly entirely deliberate in choosing this particular route for its warship and would have known that it would trigger a response of some kind from Russia. For the British, however, the importance of this incident was in demonstrating its right to innocent passage using a route through internationally recognized waters, while signaling its resolve to its partner Ukraine . With the largest-ever Sea Breeze exercise due to start next Monday, there is every indication that tensions around Crimea and in the wider Black Sea region will only increase in the coming days, as 32 warships, plus dozens of aircraft, enter these region to commence U.S. Navy-led drills under the watchful eyes of the Russians. As for the warning shots yesterday, while their effectiveness must be considered debatable at best, the fact that such belligerent actions are now being taken confirms the very differing views that Russia and NATO have when it comes to the movements of naval vessels and aircraft in the Black Sea region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 11, 2021",Guam’s New Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System Could Go Underground And Mobile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The head of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency has suggested that portions of a future Aegis Ashore site on the strategic American island of Guam in the Pacific could go into bunkers underground or onto mobile platforms. Ostensibly, this is due to Guam’s terrain and limited overall space, but it also speaks to the potential vulnerabilities of such a facility, especially in a major conflict with a near-peer adversary, such as China . The Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) director, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill, provided these and other details about the current state of plans for an Aegis Ashore capability on Guam at an event that Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank hosted earlier this week. U.S. military officials have publicly said in the past that their goal is for this site, whatever its configuration might be in the end, to be operational by 2026 . The US Navy’s Aegis Ashore facility in Romania., USN “I can see Aegis being underground or mobile,” Hill said. “It’s not new science separating radars from weapons .” The existing “Aegis Ashore may not be sufficient,” he added, referring to the general structure of the existing and planned sites. At present, the U.S. Navy operates one Aegis Ashore site in Romania . A second one is presently under construction in Poland. These facilities, as well as a dedicated test site in Hawaii, all have the same general configuration, consisting of a main “deckhouse” and associated support building, along with a Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) array installed in a vertical, above-ground structure. At present, the complete system is primarily designed to engage ballistic threats at different points of their flight using SM-3 interceptors . The modular nature of the Mk 41 means that additional anti-missile interceptors, such as the SM-6 and the in-development Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), the latter of which is intended to knock down certain incoming hypersonic threats , as well as other weapons , could be integrated into these sites in the future. The Aegis Ashore deckhouse, which is where the Aegis Combat System and AN/SPY-1 radar, among other things, are installed, was designed to mimic portions of Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers. The USS John Finn , also known by its hull number DDG-113, served as the template, specifically. This provided a relatively simple way to port over the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system into a land-based configuration. An MDA briefing slide showing the commonality in components, as well as general configuration, between the Arleigh Burke Flight IIA destroyer and the land-based Aegis Ashore system., MDA Building a similar facility on Guam presents challenges, according to Vice Admiral Hill, due to the island’s relatively small size and mountainous terrain. The current type of Aegis Ashore site that the U.S. military has developed does require a not insignificant amount of relatively flat open space. It also needs to be positioned in such a way as to maximize the coverage of its radars relative to prospective threats. Geographical factors were among a number of issues that led Japan to cancel plans to build two of its own Aegis Ashore sites last year. Another MDA briefing slide showing a notional layout of the Aegis Ashore site in Poland, as of 2013, given a sense of the physical space requirements., MDA Placing portions of a future Aegis Ashore system on Guam in facilities underneath mountains or on mobile platforms on land, or even just off the coast, could certainly help with figuring out exactly how to make it work, from a basic design perspective, within the physical limitations that the island imposes. It’s worth noting that, after canceling plans for its land-based Aegis missile sites, Japan began exploring more novel alternatives to the existing Aegis Ashore concept, including installing the systems on unpowered floating platforms at sea , as well as building new Aegis-equipped destroyers capable of ballistic missile defense. On Guam, it could be possible establish at least some portions of an Aegis Ashore system as an addition to or extension of the U.S. Air Force’s already large Andersen Air Fore Base. Another option could be to build an underground facility at the southern end of the island. Actual Launchers for interceptors could be also constructed to fire through apertures in the mountainsides . A satellite image of Guam., Google Earth A view of Andersen Air Force Base at the northern end of Guam., Google Earth At the same time, though Vice Admiral Hill did not speak to it directly, a bigger driving force behind developing a new Aegis Ashore site design for Guam could also help address its potential vulnerabilities. The existing site in Romania, as well as the one being build in Poland, are intended to provide an additional line of defenses against limited ballistic missile strikes launched by smaller “rogue” actors, such as Iran , rather than provide a broader deterrent or more robust missile defense capability in the context of an all-out war. Their entirely static and above-ground nature would make them prime targets and give them a very low degree of survivability in any sort of large-scale conflict. “Its fixed missile magazine and radar would be vulnerable to attack and would fall short against the bombardment possible from China,” Timothy Walton and Bryan Clark, a fellow and a senior fellow, respectively, at the Center for Defense Concepts and Technology within the Hudson Institute think tank wrote in an op-ed for Defense News last year. “Instead of Aegis Ashore’s large, single C2 node, a distributed architecture would virtualize the Aegis Combat System to allow multiple facilities or mobile vehicles to serve as miniature air operations centers. The mobility of sensors, effectors [interceptors or other anti-missile weapons ] and C2 nodes in this architecture would enable the employment of camouflage, concealment and deception, including decoys, to complicate enemy targeting and increase the number of weapons needed to ensure a successful attack.” A distributed, open-architecture concept would also provide a way to link Aegis Ashore components to other anti-missile defenses on Guam, as well as provide greater coverage when it comes to detecting a potentially diverse array of incoming threats and then attempting to knock them down. There is already a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery on the island, but it is only capable of intercepting ballistic missiles in the terminal stages of their flight. Its primary sensor, the AN/TYP-2 radar , is also unidirectional, meaning it does not provide 360-degree coverage against incoming threats. A transporter-erector-launcher for interceptors associated with the THAAD system., DOD In his remarks earlier this week, Vice Admiral Hill made clear that he felt a multi-layered defense architecture would be required to adequately protect Guam against existing and future threats. However, it’s also worth noting that the potential vulnerability of these existing air and missile defenses has been raised before, as well, including here at The War Zone after we obtained information about worrying incidents in 2019 involving mysterious drone overflights of the THAAD battery’s positions. How an Aegis Ashore system with underground and/or mobile components might actually work remains to be seen and does also raise questions about potential negative impacts to operational capabilities. Even with mobile platforms, it could be difficult to distribute the complete system in such a way within the confines of Guam that would make it truly difficult for an opponent to target it. As already noted, there is simply limited physical space on the island to work with, at all. Land-based mobile elements could be kept more safely in underground or otherwise hardened garages until needed, a deployment concept the Air Force used for the BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM) at the end of the Cold War. However, in missile defense, the time between when a threat is first detected and when it enters the optimal engagement window is often very limited. The available time to then attempt an intercept is likely to be even more truncated. Even with personnel on standing alert, the time it would take to move vehicles out of their bunkers could make this concept impractical, at best. An artist’s conception of a hardened GLCM Alert and Maintenance Area (GAMA), a type of facility that was constructed in multiple locations in Europe to support US Air Force units armed with the BGM-109G GLCM during the Cold War., Public Domain Beyond that, during a high-end conflict in the Pacific, any near-peer opponent, particularly China, would likely launch saturation strikes across the entire island, which is home to numerous key U.S. military bases, launching multiple weapons at individual targets to further increase the chances of successfully neutralizing them. This is a reality that is already pushing the U.S. military, as a whole, to work on expanding its available basing options to mitigate the optional impacts of losing access to established facilities during any major future conflict, including ones in the Pacific. The Air Force is notably building up alternate air base facilities on the island of Tinian , just 100 miles or so north of Guam, for the exact reason. The costs and complexities associated with significant underground construction mean that any major work to bury Aegis Ashore components, or any other missile defense systems, under Guam’s surface away from threats could be a major undertaking. MDA has asked for just under $120 million, a relatively small amount, for activities on the island, which are not limited to plans for Aegis Ashore, in its budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year. U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), the top American military command in that region, has previously said it wants at least around $1.6 billion just for Aegis Ashore on Guam. INDOPACOM has said that this missile defense capability is key to its proposed Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI), which is aimed at countering China and that you can read more about here . “Guam is a target today. It needs to be defended, and it needs to be prepared for the threats that will come in the future,” Navy Admiral Phil Davidson, head of INDOPACOM, told members of Congress at a hearing in March. “China’s own Air Force has put out a propaganda video showing their H-6 bomber force attacking Andersen Air Force Base at Guam and distributed that quite publicly.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=fj1wCjIitIU It’s also worth noting that the Navy has also been advocating for a land-based Aegis missile defense capability in Guam in order to free up Arleigh Burke class destroyers for other missions, during peacetime and war. “We need to free up those guided-missile destroyers, who have multi-mission capability to detect threats and finish threats under the sea, on the sea and above the sea, so that they can move with a mobile and maneuverable naval forces that they were designed to protect and provide their ballistic missile defense,” Admiral Davidson said at a separate event that the American Enterprise Institute think tank hosted in March. “It’s [a] return on investment,” he continued. “For the cost it takes to build that facility and flesh it out, I free up at least three [ Arleigh Burke ] ships in conflict and probably more ships in crisis. You know, in the deterrence phase, they keep up a rotation and do all that kind of stuff going forward.” How the U.S. military’s plans for Aegis Ashore on Guam, or for a derivative system integrated with other missile defenses, ultimately take shape remains to be seen. “I don’t think anyone is going to be surprised,” Vice Admiral Hill said at the CSIS event earlier this week. Whatever configuration the system takes on in the end, the U.S. military clearly seems very committed to establishing a more robust missile defense capability on this highly strategic island as competition with China in the region continues to heat up.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 8, 2021",Air Force Finds New Need For Low-Cost Engine Tech Used On Nazi Buzz Bombs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking at the potential of pulsejet technology as part of broader efforts to provide reliable, low-cost powerplants for future drones and missiles. The service is kicking off its new foray into pulsejets by funding the development of a new air-launched decoy drone. While a decoy is the immediate focus, there is also scope for the decoy, and its propulsion system, to have other potential applications, too. The Air Force Armament Directorate recently awarded the Wave Engine Corporation startup a $1-million contract to develop and then demonstrate the pulsejet decoy, known as the Versatile Air-Launched Platform (VALP). The award followed what the company describes as a “highly competitive process with hundreds of applicants” as the Air Force seeks to fund promising new technologies for possible use in future capabilities. A Schreder glider was first tested with Wave Engine Corporation’s new pulsejet engine last year., Wave Engine Corp. Concept artwork supplied by the company shows a pair of VALPs being launched as decoys from an F-16 fighter jet, as seen at the top of this story. While hard to judge the scale of the decoy from the image, it clearly has a narrow but unusually deep forward fuselage containing the pulsejet, low-mounted swept wings, and a slender rear body possibly carrying a V-shaped tail unit. Wave Engine Corp. The limited description suggests a role similar to the existing ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), which is dropped by aircraft and operates much like a mini-cruise missile, albeit designed to distract and deceive enemy air defense systems to protect a strike package. The ADM-160 is powered by a small turbojet engine. A Miniature Air-Launched Decoy is loaded onto a B-52H bomber July 13, 2020 at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana., U.S. Air Force/A1C Celeste Zuniga It’s not exactly clear how VALP would operate as a decoy, but there are various options that could be used to spoof enemy air defenses, including simply mimicking the combat flight profiles and signatures of the launch or other aircraft, employing electronic warfare jammers , or even dropping chaff countermeasures . “VALP is a multi-mission, air-launched vehicle that leverages the company’s proprietary engine technology to demonstrate high-performance, low-cost propulsion for future generations of high-performance aerial vehicles,” Wave Engine said in a statement confirming the contract award. “The future of aircraft is smaller, more capable, and more affordable,” explained Daanish Maqbool, CEO of Wave Engine. “The aviation industry has long been stymied by the lack of high-performance engines for small aircraft, and we are here to break through this barrier.” Clearly, the engine is the major focus of this effort, and it could be spiraled out to other projects if it works as anticipated. Generally speaking, pulsejet technology has been around for a long time and was used to power Nazi Germany’s infamous V-1 flying bombs , or “buzz bombs,” early cruise missile that were used to attack targets in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the final months of World War II. A wartime British cutaway drawing of the Fiesler Fi 103 flying bomb, better known as the V-1., Air Ministry Second World War Official Collection A pulsejet — so-called because its combustion occurs intermittently, in pulses — has few or no moving parts, in contrast to a conventional jet. Fuel and air are combusted within a simple hollow tube, and hot gases are pushed out of the back to produce thrust. This confers on them the advantages of simplicity and light weight, but on the other hand, they traditionally have a poor compression ratio , which limits their power output. They are also typically very loud. Pulse jet schematic. The first part of the cycle: (1) air intake, mixed with fuel (2). Second part: the valve (3) is closed and the ignited fuel-air mix (4) propels the craft. , Cyrille Dunant and Gregor Shapiro/Wikimedia Commons Exactly how Wave Engine has updated the basic technology to meet modern needs is unclear, but a company statement talks about “jet performance” and confirms that its pulsejet uses Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC), in which a computer controls engine performance. On its website , the firm claims that it can now offer Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) that’s “competitive with turbine (jet) engines.” “Wave Engine Corp.’s technology enables an order-of-magnitude reduction in the cost and complexity of jet propulsion, making it practical for a wide variety of aviation platforms for which jet propulsion was previously cost-prohibitive,” the company says. Ultimately, it would be imagined that the company is seeking to achieve the kinds of efficiency and power that would be possible using a turbine engine. These have many moving parts and are more expensive but are the powerplant of choice for many high-performance drones as well as cruise missiles. The company’s pulsejet technology has already received investment from the U.S. military, with a $3-million award from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 2019 that led to successful flight demonstrations last year. These involved a pulsejet mounted above the fuselage of a manned glider. Wave Engine Corp. Clearly, if the pulsejet proves itself in a decoy, there is potential to migrate the same technology into other vehicles, such as drones or cruise missiles. The low cost of these engines would make it especially suitable for missiles as well as attritable drones that are not necessarily expected to complete more than one mission. Indeed, while Wave Engine says the VALP is intended “primarily as a decoy,” its name alone indicates there is scope to further develop the same platform to fulfill other roles, as well. The company also provides concept art of a notional fixed-wing combat aircraft, seen below, as well as vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) applications, on its website. An artist’s impression of an apparent pulsejet-powered “fighter” that appears on the company website., Wave Engine Corp. Ultimately, the pulsejet-powered VALP might have more in common with in-development weapons such as Gray Wolf , an Air Force program for a low-cost cruise missile, in this case, powered by a miniature turbine. Again, Gray Wolf is intended to be low-cost and highly fuel-efficient compared to traditional weapons in this class, such as the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) series. An expendable test article from Northrop Grumman loaded on an F-16 as part of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Gray Wolf effort. , U.S. AIR FORCE At the same time, the Air Force is also working on networked swarming under the Golden Horde project. Here, again, there would seem to be some parallels with VALP. The aim of Golden Horde is to demonstrate how different precision-guided munitions, such as the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb and JASSM, as well as MALD, can be networked together, to operate as an autonomous swarm after launch. The swarm could then be used to attack or otherwise overwhelm enemy air defenses. With potentially very large numbers of munitions involved in this kind of cooporative scenario, an option that is cheaper than existing guided munitions could be very attractive. An F-16D carrying four specially configured Collaborative Small Diameter Bombs (CSDB) as part of the he Air Force’s Golden Horde swarming air-launched munitions program, last February., 40TH FLIGHT TEST SQUADRON/PUBLIC DOMAIN The return of the pulsejet may come as something of a surprise, but Wave Engine’s latest efforts could be well timed to exploit growing interest not only in air-launched decoys but also the growth areas of low-cost missiles and swarming munitions. Above all, the simplicity of the design may well make it suitable for a host of expendable applications, as well as providing a cheaper source of power for reusable vehicles.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 28, 2021",The Most Replayed Carrier Crash In History Happened 70 Years Ago Today,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Exactly 70 years ago today, U.S. Navy Commander George Chamberlain Duncan escaped from one of the most dramatic and widely publicized carrier aviation accidents of all time. Watching the footage today, it’s almost miraculous that the naval aviator, a two-time World War Two ace, was pulled from the blazing hulk of his Grumman F9F Panther jet fighter with only burns — and that he would be flying again within six months. Back in the early 1950s, military aviation was an especially risky profession , even outside of the Korean War , and operating jets from aircraft carriers, which were little changed from World War Two, was especially so . Carrier decks were a lot smaller than they are today and angled decks and steam catapults were only starting to be introduced, as were other features to aid safety for faster, heavier aircraft, such as mirror landing aids . A pair of F9F-2 Panthers from VF-51 over Korea, in 1951-52, flying from the aircraft carrier USS Essex (CV-9). The pilot of the aircraft in the background is future astronaut Ensign Neil Armstrong., U.S. Navy As of June 23, 1951, Commander Duncan was a test pilot at the Naval Air Test Center in Patuxent River, Maryland, assigned to Fighter Squadron 51 (VF-51), and was proving out the F9F-5 version of the Grumman jet aboard the aircraft carrier USS Midway — a vessel completed at the end of World War Two — during a cruise off the Virginia Capes in the Atlantic. The F9F-5 was the latest version of the straight-wing Panther, which had first flown in 1949 and soon bore the brunt of Navy and Marine Corps jet fighter operations during the conflict in Korea. Having been moved onto the carrier by crane, Duncan’s assigned F9F-5, Bureau Number 125228, successfully launched, and then recovered, aboard the Midway on the first attempt. https://youtube.com/watch?v=SIy1wRXXxYY On the second attempt to land, Duncan was expecting to catch the third arrestor wire when an apparent downdraft suddenly interrupted the approach, just feet away from the end of the deck. The Panther sunk below the level of the flight deck as the pilot pulled back on the stick in an effort to recover. It seems Duncan probably did just enough to avoid slamming into the stern of the warship. Still, an instant later, the jet had impacted the edge of the deck, known as the round-down, and was torn in two, breaking apart behind the cockpit, and bursting into flames in the process. U.S. NAVY A series of photos of Duncan’s June 23, 1951, ramp strike., U.S. NAVY With Duncan still strapped into the cockpit, the forward fuselage of the Panther hurtled down the wooden deck of the carrier, rolling over several times as it went. The other half of the jet, including the engine and wings, meanwhile continued after it, spewing colossal flames in the process. U.S. NAVY By the time the front end of the jet had skidded to a stop, Duncan’s helmet had been torn off, but he was alive, albeit burnt. Deck crew pulled him out of the cockpit and brought him to the sickbay, where his injuries were found to be limited mainly to scorched ears. U.S. NAVY Since cameras were recording the incident, Duncan’s crash became a familiar learning aid for other naval aviators and went onto find a much wider audience, too, after it was used in films including Korean War drama Men of the Fighting Lady (1954), Midway (1976), and even The Hunt for Red October (1990). In the latter, the 1950s-era Panther stood in for the considerably more modern F-14 Tomcat . Duncan’s later career saw him command VF-51 and Carrier Air Group Five during the Korean War, head up VF-101, and then captain the aircraft carrier USS Ranger . He finally retired from the Navy in 1968 and, after working as a lawyer, he died of natural causes in December 1995, aged 78. Captain George Chamberlain Duncan as commander of the aircraft carrier USS Ranger , during 1962-63., U.S. Navy As for the Panther, it survived in frontline service until 1956, having also provided the first jet equipment for the Blue Angels demonstration team, and continued to perform second-line duties into the early 1960s, by which time much more capable equipment was available to operate from a new generation of carriers tailored for them. The F9F ramp strike was just one of several crashes that George Chamberlain Duncan survived during his peacetime career as a naval test pilot. His was a dangerous job at a time when all kinds of technological and performance barriers were being pushed, extracting a heavy toll on aviators’ lives. While carrier operations today are much safer in comparison, Duncan’s accident continues to remind us that in this unique working environment things can still go wrong in a fraction of a second.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jun 24, 2021","Russia Claims Bombs Dropped To Warn Off British Warship, Royal Navy Says It Never Happened (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has flatly denied Russia’s claims that its military and internal security forces took aggressive action against a U.K. Royal Navy Type 45 destroyer , HMS Defender , sailing in the Black Sea earlier today, to “stop” it from conducting further maneuvers in an area close to Russian-controlled Crimea. Initial reports citing the Russian Ministry of Defense said a Russian Border Guard vessel and an Su-24 Fencer combat jet both fired warning shots, with the latter purportedly dropping four high-explosive bombs across the British warship’s path. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has stated that HMS Defender was “conducting innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters in accordance with international law.” However, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the British destroyer had violated the Russian maritime border near Cape Fiolent, close to the heavily militarized city of Sevastopol , in the territory of Crimea, which was seized and subsequently annexed by Russia in 2014. A Royal Navy Wildcat helicopter drops flare above HMS Defender while in the Mediterranean last May., Crown Copyright Unverified maritime tracking data appears to show HMS Defender approaching to within around 10 nautical miles of the Crimean coast, putting it inside Russian’s claimed territorial waters, which extend out to 12 nautical miles from the coast. However, Crimea’s status is itself a matter of dispute, with most members of the international community not recognizing Moscow’s claims over it. “This morning, HMS Defender carried out a routine transit from Odessa towards Georgia across the Black Sea,” the U.K. Minister of Defense Ben Wallace said in a statement. “As is normal for this route, she entered an internationally recognized traffic separation corridor. She exited that corridor safely at 0945 BST. As is routine, Russian vessels shadowed her passage and she was made aware of training exercises in her wider vicinity.” However, an earlier report from Russian state-run news agency TASS said that the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet , together with the Border Service of the Federal Security Service (FSB), responded to stop the alleged violation and explained their sequence of events. “At 11:52 on June 23 the destroyer HMS Defender of the British Navy, operating in the northwestern part of the Black Sea, crossed the state border of the Russian Federation and entered the territorial sea in the area of Cape Fiolent for 3 kilometers [1.9 miles],” the Russian Ministry of Defense told TASS . The same TASS report stated that a warning was issued to the British destroyer, threatening the use of weapons if it violated the Russian state border, but according to the Russian Ministry of Defense there was no response from the British side. A video including unconfirmed radio chatter, claimed to be from the incident today, in which the Russian side requests HMS Defender to change course. That request appears to be ignored: https://youtube.com/watch?v=6G2qPT-Brbo “At 12:06 and 12:08 the border patrol ship performed warning fire. At 12:19, the Su-24M aircraft carried out warning bombing (four OFAB-250) along the course of the destroyer HMS Defender ,” the ministry added. OFAB-250 freefall bombs, each of which weighs around 550 pounds, prepare to be loaded onto Russian jets in Syria., Russian Ministry of Defense At 12.23, according to the Russian account, HMS Defender left Russian territorial waters. Video released by the Russian Ministry of Defense shows the Royal Navy destroyer shadowed by what appears to be a Russian Navy Su-30SM Flanker fighter jet: There is additional footage, possibly taken from a drone, showing what appears to be a Coast Guard patrol boat trailing HMS Defender , while a Su-24M and a Su-30SM fly past it: While all this was going on, it appears that at least one NATO intelligence-gathering aircraft was monitoring the activities in the area. Publicly available flight-tracking data indicated that a U.S. Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint was airborne off the coast of Crimea, having flown in from Souda Bay on the Greek island of Crete. “This is a flagrant violation of international norms and standards,” Sergei Tsekov , a Russian senator from the Crimea region, told news agency RIA Novosti , another Russian state-owned outlet, in reference to the purported action by the British warship. “By such illiterate actions they can provoke a serious conflict.” That same news agency reported that the Russian Ministry of Defense had summoned the U.K.’s military attaché to explain the incident. An official video, seen in the Tweet below, was subsequently released of that meeting. Based on the information from the Russian side, this incident appears to mark a significant escalation in an area of considerable strategic importance. While the firing of warning shots in response to potential threats or territorial violations is not unheard of, dropping apparently live and unguided bombs from a jet is an extremely provocative — not to say, potentially high-risk — action to take under the circumstances. The crew of HMS Defender take part in a Small Arms Firing At Sea (SAFAS) whilst in the Bay of Biscay, in May 2021., Crown Copyright However, as well as disputing the claim that HMS Defender illegally entered Russia’s territorial waters, the U.K. Ministry of Defense says that no warning shots, let alone bombs, were actually directed at the Royal Navy warship. “We believe the Russians were undertaking a gunnery exercise in the Black Sea and provided the maritime community with prior-warning of their activity,” the U.K. Ministry of Defense tweeted. “No shots were directed at HMS Defender and we do not recognize the claim that bombs were dropped in her path.” At the time of the incident, the BBC journalist Jonathan Beale was onboard HMS Defender , and he provided the following eyewitness account: The crew were already at action stations as they approached the southern tip of Russian occupied Crimea. Weapons systems on board the Royal Navy destroyer had already been loaded. This would be a deliberate move to make a point to Russia. HMS Defender was going to sail within the 12-mile (19km) limit of Crimea’s territorial waters. The captain insisted he was only seeking safe passage thorough an internationally recognized shipping lane. Two Russian coastguard ships that were shadowing the Royal Navy warship, tried to force it to alter course. At one stage one of the Russian vessels closed in to about 100m (328ft). Increasingly hostile warnings were issued over the radio — including one that said “if you don’t change course I’ll fire.” We did hear some firing in the distance but they were believed to be well out of range. As HMS Defender sailed through the shipping lane it was buzzed by Russian jets. The captain, Vincent Owen, said the ship detected more than 20 military aircraft nearby. Commander Owen said his mission was confident but non-confrontational. If accurate, the British accounts could suggest that Moscow might have been using a live-fire exercise taking place in the same general area at the time the British warship was identified approaching Crimea as a means of embellishing their story. The Russian military had announced publicly yesterday that coastal defense troops were conducting drills in Crimea. Regardless, the principle of innocent passage allows for warships to move through anyone’s territorial waters so long as the transit meets various criteria , particularly that it is not intended to challenge the legitimacy of any such maritime boundaries. Under maritime law, therefore, being in someone’s territorial waters does not automatically constitute a violation of sovereignty. In addition, intriguingly, USNI News reported on Monday that another set of maritime tracking data involving HMS Defender had been faked. Appearing on the MarineTraffic.com ship-tracking website, the tracks showed the warship, together with the Royal Netherlands Navy frigate Evertsen , within just 2 nautical miles of the Russian naval base at Sevastopol, whereas they were actually 180 miles away in a Ukrainian port. While it’s unclear how sophisticated or deliberate this incident may have been, in the past there has also been GPS spoofing traced to the Russians in the Black Sea. HMS Defender crashes through waves in the Bay of Biscay as it heads to the Mediterranean last May 23. , Crown Copyright The Royal Navy confirmed earlier this month that HMS Defender had left Carrier Strike Group 21 , centered around the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth in the Mediterranean, and had headed to the Black Sea “to carry out her own set of missions.” The British destroyer entered the Black Sea on June 14 and it made a visit to the Ukrainian port of Odessa earlier this week. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention , countries without access to a Black Sea coastline are required to give advance notice of when they are deploying naval vessels in and out of that body of water. The same agreement also restricts how many warships countries outside of the region can have there at once, via limits on the total displaced tonnage of the vessels, and how long these deployments can last. In January this year, two Arleigh Burke class destroyers — the USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) and the USS Porter (DDG-78) — entered the Black Sea and were met by an aggressive Russian response . This included being buzzed by a Su-24 and nearby drills involving Su-30SM Flankers armed with anti-ship missiles and coastal defense missile batteries in Crimea. Levels of activity in the Black Sea are only set to become more intense with the beginning of the largest-ever Sea Breeze exercise , starting next Monday. This U.S. Navy-led drill is centered around Ukraine and will involve 32 countries and 32 warships, along with dozens of aircraft. In the past, the Russian Navy has unsurprisingly taken a keen interest in these maneuvers, shadowing it with its own ships and planes. We will continue to update this story as more details emerge and keep a close eye on activities in the Black Sea in the days to come. Update, 15:30 pm PST: Further images have emerged from today’s incident, including footage from BBC News showing HMS Defender being closely accompanied by different Russian ships and aircraft. These include one of the rare Russian Navy Be-12 Mail amphibians, a handful of which continue to serve in Crimea only. Also seen are one of the service’s Project 22160 class large patrol ships, as well as a Russian Border Guard Project 22460 Rubin class patrol boats. Also now available is satellite imagery from the Sentinel-2 Earth observation mission that appears to confirm earlier tracks indicating that the Royal Navy destroyer was around 10 nautical miles off the Crimean coast.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps plans to arm variants of its 8×8 LAV-25 wheeled armored vehicle, as well as 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles and Long-Range Unmanned Surface Vehicle drone boats with Israeli-designed loitering munitions, sometimes referred to as “ suicide drones .” All of these platforms will deploy these munitions, a variant of the UVision Hero-120 , from a common Multi-Canister Launcher against various ground and maritime targets. UVision confirmed that a version of its Hero-120 , as well as its Multi-Canister Launcher, had been selected as the winning entry for the Marine Corps’ Organic Precision Fires-Mounted (OPF-M) program on June 21, 2021. Israel-headquartered UVision, which also has its own U.S. subsidiary, is working together with Maryland-based Mistral, Inc. to deliver the Marine-specific Hero-120s, which the latter company has referred to as Loitering Strike Munitions. The broader OFP program, which dates back to at least 2018, also includes plans to acquire smaller, man-portable loitering munitions for dismounted use. A mockup of a launcher for UVision Hero-series loitering munitions on a 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle., UVision “We are proud to be selected by the Marines to provide advanced solutions for the US frontline forces” Avi Mizrachi, CEO of UVision and a retired Israel Defense Forces Major General, said in a statement on June 21. “The contract is a testament of our customers’ strong belief in our  systems and their impressive technical performance. Our subsidiary, UVision USA, is in a process of establishing our US based production facility to support the USMC OPF-M program.“ “Mistral is privileged by the USMC selection of our solution for the OPF-M program,” the President of Mistral, identified only as Ms. Banai, said in a separate statement on June 17. “Mistral and our teammates are honored to provide our Warfighters with the OPF mission-critical precision strike systems.” It’s not clear how Marines’ Loitering Strike Munition differs from the standard Hero-120 and how substantial the distinction between the two actually is. The Hero-120 is the largest suicide drone in UVision’s “Tactical” product line , weighing in at around 27 and a half pounds, including a high-explosive warhead that is just under 10 pounds. The Hero-120 is powered by an electric motor running a single propeller at the rear of the munition and can stay aloft for up to an hour. UVision says that the weapon’s maximum range is just under 25 miles when using a line-of-sight control system. Beyond-line-of-sight data links are also available for the Hero-120. A “man-in-the-loop” control system allows the operator to “see” what the drone sees through the electro-optical and infrared cameras in its nose and issue instructions to it, including to strike a target, throughout the course of a mission. In this way, loitering munitions, which Israeli companies pioneered and continue to be world leaders in the development and manufacture of, can perform typically associated with drones or missiles, but not both. Marines, for instance, could use Hero-120s to scout ahead or surveil specific positions, with the suicide drones then having the option to immediately prosecute any targets that might emerge. These suicide drones, which can be recovered and reused if they complete a mission without engaging a threat, also offer even small units a way to execute indirect precision strikes at targets, including against ones that might be sheltering inside buildings or otherwise hiding behind cover, at extended ranges. With the control system’s man-in-the-loop functionality, the Hero-120 and other loitering munitions can also achieve an extreme degree of precision, with an actual operator able to make course corrections right up until the moment of impact. This also provides an added margin of safety against inflicting collateral damage, with that same individual more readily able to abort a strike, even very late in the terminal phase of the weapon’s flight, should innocent bystanders emerge nearby. Employing these munitions from multi-round launchers on vehicles and small boats can only add flexibility, as well as valuable magazine depth. It’s unclear if the launchers the Marines plan to use on the LAV-M mortar carrier variant of the LAV-25, JLTV, and LRUSV will be identical or will simply use a common architecture. UVision’s press release included a picture, seen at the top of this story, of a test launcher with what appeared to 16 cells. A US Marine Corps LAV-M., USMC However, in 2019, Oshkosh, the manufacturer of the JLTV, unveiled a six-round launcher concept for the Hero-120 for use on that vehicle, which it had developed in cooperation with UVision. It seems very possible, if not probable, that the launchers can be scaled up or down to have more or fewer individual canisters depending on the actual platform they’re installed on. The Oshkosh six-round launcher concept for firing Hero-120 loitering munitions from a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle., Oshkosh The installations themselves are also likely to be installed or removed, as desired, with relatively limited effort. With that in mind, it is perhaps interesting to note that Mistral was the company that was responsible for the integration of the advanced Israeli-designed 120mm RMS6-L mortar into the mortar carrier variants of the U.S. Army’s 8×8 Stryker wheeled armored vehicle. You can read more about that weapon, which Mistral also helped develop into a turreted base-defense weapon for U.S. special operations forces, here . The planned integration of the Marine version of the Hero-120 onto the LRUSV is also particularly notable. In January, the Marine Corps hired Metal Shark, a Louisiana-headquarter shipbuilder, to build these drone boats, which the company described as a single “tiered, scalable weapons system [that] will provide the ability to accurately track and destroy targets at range throughout the battle space” and that would be capable, in part, of “transporting loitering munitions to address targets at sea and on land,” in a press release at the time. The LRUSV program has also been linked to programs within the Pentagon and the Department of the Navy , of which the Marine Corps is a part, that are aimed at giving those unmanned boats the ability to launch swarms of small drones, as well as providing surface swarming capabilities themselves. The inclusion of the LRUSV, among the other planned future launch platforms for its Hero-120 variants, also makes clear that the Marine Corps sees loitering munitions as a valuable tool for ground and maritime operations, as well as those that span both domains. A Hero-series loitering munition is seen about to strike a floating target during a test., Mistral, Inc. The Marine Corps, as a whole, is reforming its entire force structure around new concepts of expeditionary and distributed operations in littoral environments where units, even small ones, might be called upon to engage both naval and ground-based targets in order to help control a particular portion of the battlespace. The service is already exploring how it might employ Javelin anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) in novel ways in these environments, including firing them from small inflatable boats, as you can read more about in this War Zone feature. Marines armed with a Javelin anti-tank guided missile ride in a small inflatable boat during an exercise earlier this year., USMC Loitering munitions would also be extremely applicable in the same general scenarios. It’s particularly important to note that, while munitions, such as the Hero-120, may not be capable of outright destroying a warship of any appreciable size, they could still potentially affect a mission kill by destroying or otherwise disabling radars, communications antennas, or other key systems. Depending on the complexity of the systems in question, this could render a ship combat ineffective for a protracted period of time until repairs could be made. Beyond that, as with ATGMs, suicide drones present another option for engaging smaller maritime targets, ranging from landing craft to potentially explosive-laden unmanned boats. UVision and Mistral are not the only companies that are marking suicide drones for use in the naval arena . The Marines are not the only ones within the U.S. military that are interested in the capabilities that loitering munitions have to offer, either. The U.S. Army, in particular, is working to develop various loitering munitions, primarily for air-launched applications , but which could also be employed using ground-based launchers . The service revealed after one recent test that at least one of these systems was a joint effort, indicating interest in that still-classified design from other branches. In March, Northrop Grumman also announced that it had partnered with UVision and that they were developing a hybrid of the Hero-120 and Hero-400 loitering munition designs to meet the Army requirements. In its press release about the Marine Corps’ OPF-M program, Mistral also mentioned in passing the development of another version of the Hero-120, known as the Hero-120SF, for U.S. special operations forces. UVision first disclosed it was working on that version, which also differs in unclear ways from the standard variant, last year in response to unspecified U.S. military requirements. Loitering munitions, as well as missiles with man-in-the-loop control systems, are already seen increasing use in combat around the world. Suicide drones, especially the Israeli-made Harop , were particularly notable components of the brief war between Azerbaijan and Armenia last year . Their use prompted major discussions within military and national security circles, including the U.S. military itself , about the growing significance of these weapons, as well as other unmanned platforms , in current and future conflicts. All told, the Marine Corps’ planned adoption of a version of the Hero-120, as well as a modular launch system, is just one part of larger and still growing push to field loitering munitions across the U.S. military.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jan 6, 2022",The National Guard Just Simulated A Cyberattack That Brought Down Utilities Nationwide,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. National Guardsmen just completed a two-week training exercise which saw them respond to a simulated cyberattack that took out critical utilities across the United States. The exercises have become an annual event, but this year took on even more significance after coming on the heels of several major ransomware and cyber attacks that crippled large parts of American infrastructure in recent months. The exercises were part of the seventh Cyber Yankee, an training event that brings together guardsmen from throughout the New England region to test their responses against simulated cyberattacks. This year’s exercises simulated a cyber attack that targeted utilities on the West Coast before spreading east across the United States towards New England. In addition to offering hands-on training on how to respond to active cyberattacks, the exercise was also intended to build cyber defense collaboration between the National Guard and private sector partners, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and U.S. Cyber Command, among others. Marine Forces Reserve and Army National Guard personnel taking part in Cyber Yankee 2021., Marine Forces Reserve/LCpl Mitchell Collyer “We do it in an exercise environment so that when it does happen, we’ve already got those relationships established not just from a National Guard but from all of our critical infrastructure, our federal, local, state partners,” said Maj. Ryan Miler, state cyber operations officer for the Connecticut Army National Guard. “We’ve established those lines of communication and then it’s that much easier to get together and respond.” This year’s Cyber Yankee saw the annual exercise’s first use of the new Cyber 9-Line system developed by U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). Cyber 9-Line offers National Guard cyber units a template of questions that allow them to quickly communicate the specifics of a suspected cyberattack up the chain of command to USCYBERCOM. Once CYBERCOM has that information from Cyber 9-Line, it can then more quickly and efficiently diagnose that attack and offer information back to the reporting unit, who can then share that intel among affected local governments and industry partners. “The Cyber 9-Line is still in its infancy, but after standing up this program a few months ago, we have already [seen an impact],” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Jeff Pacini, CNMF Future Operations Deputy Chief in a USCYBERCOM press release last year. “Ultimately, the goal is to provide mutual support to each other.” The Cyber 9-Line questionnaire is similar to other nine-line formats used by U.S. armed forces for requests such as medical evacuation or close air support . A USCYBERCOM slide detailing the questions the Cyber 9-Line tool poses., USCYBERCOM Lt. Col. Cameron Sprague, Chief Information Officer for the Connecticut Air National Guard and deputy exercise director for this year’s Cyber Yankee, said that the simulated cyberattacks were designed to be as realistic and complex as possible in order to prepare for the types of incidents becoming more and more common across the country: It’s really hard to do an exercise like this effectively. Many cyber exercises involve activities that resemble a game of capture the flag, which are too easy and aren’t necessarily applicable to real-world crises. Operating effectively in incident response environment is really hard. That’s what a lot of teams first take away when they’re walking through this is how we’re actually going to do an incident response plan. That’s the big point of this. Exercise leaders said that the teams conducting mock attacks offered the National Guard an opportunity to have a better idea what to expect in the event of actual cyber attacks and ransomware operations. If you know how your enemies conduct attacks, you can be better prepared to defend against them. Last year’s Cyber Yankee exercises saw over 200 guardsmen come together to combat various cyber threats. The guardsmen were divided into four Blue Teams tasked with responding to simulated cyberattacks, a Red Cell which conducted those attacks, and a White Cell which “regulated and assessed event operations.” U.S. Army Col. Woody Groton, who directed last year’s Cyber Yankee, said in 2020 that the exercise is designed to pit guardsmen against the same types of cyber threats currently faced by U.S.-based companies and infrastructure: Cybersecurity, especially in critical infrastructure and state government, is a huge issue right now. You can see it in the news every day. Ransomware attacks are on the rise; loss of data, loss of intellectual property. It’s hard to keep up with the adversary. We’ve also, in the last several years, seen significant uptick in cyberattacks and attempted cyberattacks against the electrical industry and water. By training on this ahead of time, we’re better prepared in case of an actual incident. Marines address visitors during Cyber Yankee 2021., Marine Forces Reserve/LCpl Mitchell Collyer Cyber attacks on civilian infrastructure have taken precedence as a national security concern in recent years as they have become more common and crippling. A ransomware attack shut down the United States’ largest fuel pipeline in May 2021, leading to fuel shortages on some parts of the East Coast. Officials for Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline eventually paid close to $5 million in ransom to end the cyberattack, of which the FBI was later able to recover some 85% in the form of cryptocurrency. A similar ransomware cyberattack followed on the heels of the Colonial Pipeline attack in June 2021, this time against the world’s largest meat processing company. It’s not just large private sector entities who are under attack, however, as ransomware attacks against local governments and institutions are increasing at an alarming rate across the US. In one example, a National Guard unit in Louisiana thwarted a cyberattack on government offices in 2020 that was suspected to have originated from North Korea and possibly have been related to elections in that state. While many of these attacks have been reported to have perpetrated by criminal organizations rather than state actors, many fingers have been pointed in the direction of the Russian government. Some attacks have even been presumed to have originated directly from Russian intelligence services, such as the 2020 cyberattack on the information technology management company SolarWinds which led to breaches of servers owned by U.S. government entities and private companies alike. Russia denied any involvement in that attack. “I can assure you that we are raising this through the highest levels of the U.S. government,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in the wake of the meat processing ransomware attack in June. “The president certainly believes that President Putin has a role to play in stopping and preventing these attacks.” Biden and Putin meeting in Geneva in June 2021, AP/Patrick Semansky Cyberattacks and ransomware plots took center stage at the recent summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva. Biden reportedly gave Putin a list of 16 critical American infrastructure sectors that White House wants Russia to accept as “off limits” from cyberattacks, including energy and water utilities. Putin, meanwhile, said Russia had nothing to do with the Colonial Pipeline attack and instead claimed the United States is responsible for most of the world’s cyberattacks. The White House recently announced that it would elevate ransomware attacks to a similar priority as terrorist attacks and would create a new task force to allow various government agencies at multiple levels to coordinate information sharing and responses to cyberattacks. “It’s a specialized process to ensure we track all ransomware cases regardless of where it may be referred in this country, so you can make the connections between actors and work your way up to disrupt the whole chain,” said John Carlin, principle associate deputy attorney general at the Justice Department. The Biden administration signed an Executive Order in May 2021 aimed at strengthening and modernizing cybersecurity defenses throughout the federal government including the intelligence community and Department of Defense. As recent events have shown, cyber attacks don’t have to disable missile defense systems or satellites to inflict damage and cause major disruptions. Cyberattacks on private companies like Colonial Pipeline can do just as much harm by interrupting fuel supply operations, while a ransomware attack on a commercial electrical utility companies could no doubt cause massive damage as the basic sustainment and public safety systems the nation depends upon daily go dark. We can likely expect exercises like Cyber Yankee to ramp up and become more complex as the cyber threat continues to proliferate and the U.S. government finds more ways to mitigate and defend against it.

"Joseph Trevithick, Tyler Rogoway","Updated on Jun 29, 2021",An Ohio Class Ballistic Missile Submarine Just Made A Rare And Very Quick Stop In San Diego (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Navy Ohio class missile submarine made a rare and very brief stop in San Diego today. The Twitter ship spotting account @WarshipCam was the first to spot the submarine on a live feed of the Port of San Diego available through @SanDiegoWebCam . Timestamps on still images from the video show that the submarine arrived just before 11:50 AM local time and was headed back out shortly before 12:30 PM. Which is a bizarrely quick turnaround. It’s not clear which of the Navy’s 18 Ohio class boats is seen in the video. However, the four Ohios that the service converted into guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs, which you can read more about in this War Zone feature , almost always have at least one Dry Deck Shelter (DDS), which can be used to deploy divers, swimmer delivery vehicles, and more, mounted immediately aft of their sails. A screengrab from a webcam video showing an Ohio class missile submarine arriving in San Diego on June 21, 2021., @SanDiegoWebCam via @WarshipCam The area of the hull behind the sail is also enlarged and flattened to better accommodate the DDS. No DDS is present on the submarine in the video and it does not appear to have the modified hull associated with the four SSGNs, indicating that this is one of the remaining 14 Ohios configured to carry nuclear-armed ballistic missiles , also referred to as SSBNs. The Ohio SSBNs and SSGNs are split between two bases, Naval Base Kitsap in Washington state and Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia, on the West and East Coasts of the United States, respectively. The SSGNs also do standing forward deployments, including to Diego Garcia and Guam . As such, San Diego is not a common port of call for these big submarines and the hugely destructive arsenals some of them carry . When asked, @WarshipCam, who spotted the submarine entering San Diego Bay, was kind enough to provide the following additional information: Basically, the Ohio class submarine came into San Diego today and did a quick turn and headed back out. Ohio class subs don’t come into there all that often – with the last one I’ve seen being in May of 2020. At that time the incoming Ohio was involved in a missile test. Without knowing which Ohio class submarine this for sure, it is difficult to try to determine what its reason or reasons for visiting San Diego might have been. We have reached out to U.S. 3rd Fleet, which is headquartered in San Diego, seeking more information about this brief stopover. The very short turnaround time, as well as the absence of any particularly unusual escorts, would seem to suggest this did not have to do with any sort of major accident or maintenance issue. A pair of tugs and small Navy patrol boats, typical of the types and number of vessels that are usually seen helping Navy submarines get safely and securely in and out of ports, are visible in clips and still frames from the webcam in San Diego. A pair of tugs sail alongside the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Alabama as it returns to its homeport at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia in 2019., USN It is possible that there was a need to load or offload relatively small items, such as spare parts or special gear, for some reason, or to get a small number of individuals on or off the boat . Someone suffering some kind of medical emergency could be one reason for a very brief port visit, but, at least in some cases, they could have been offloaded onto a ship or helicopter for transfer instead of going through the hassling of bringing the submarine into port. The Ohio class boat could be about to execute some unique training and testing in the ranges off San Diego and may have taken on some folks and supplies to do so. That is a major submarine operations area, with large exercises and testing evolutions taking place quite regularly. It’s also worth noting that a number of U.S. missile tracking vessels have taken up station in the Central Pacific, west of Hawaii, in preparation for what appears to be an imminent missile defense test originating from Alaska. One could imagine a test involving an SSBN and a Trident missile intercept, although it would be unprecedented. The big issue is that it appears the missile defense test will involve a surrogate missile and an intercept that will both be fired and follow a track between the Alaskan coast and the Reagan Test Site located at Kwajalein Atoll. As such, the orientation doesn’t seem anywhere near what it should be for an intercept test of a missile originating from off the coast of Southern California. We also don’t know of any cautionary notices of an imminent launch emanating from off the west coast of the continental United States. So, these are just some possibilities and we really can’t with any certainty say what the submarine was doing in San Diego based on the information we have at this time, aside from it being a somewhat rare and peculiar event. We will certainly update or follow up on this piece with any new information we receive about this rare visit to San Diego by an Ohio class SSBN. UPDATE: 6/23/2021 — U.S. 3rd Fleet’s public affairs office has now provided a brief statement on the brief stopover of this Ohio class ballistic missile submarine in San Diego. “The Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine is operating in the Pacific Ocean and conducted a brief stop in San Diego,” a 3rd Fleet spokesperson told The War Zone . “U.S. military forces are present and active in and around the Pacific in support of allies and partners and a free and open Indo-Pacific.” This confirms that the boat in question was one of the 14 Ohio class SSBNs, not one of the four Ohio class SSGNs, though which submarine it was, specifically, remains unknown.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 17, 2021",Russian Warships Came Within Just 34 Miles Of Hawaii During Recent Drills,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The top U.S. military command in the Pacific says that Russian naval vessels passed between 23 and 34 miles of the Hawaiian Islands at one point during their recent exercises in the region, but have now departed the area. This disclosure follows reports over the past 10 days or so that the presence of Russia’s warships, as well as its combat aircraft, in the region had prompted the scrambling of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters on at least two separate occasions and the movement on short notice of an entire carrier strike group to the waters off Hawaii. It was previsouly understood that the Russia flotilla was hundreds of miles from Hawaii, not anywhere near as close as we now know was the case. U.S. Navy Captain Mike Kafka, a spokesperson for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), which is headquartered in Hawaii, confirmed to The War Zone just how close the Russian warships had gotten to U.S. territorial waters, though they stayed in international waters the entire time. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper had been the first to get this official confirmation. “At the closest point, some ships operated approximately 20 to 30 NM [nautical miles; 23 to 34 statute miles] off the coast of Hawaii,” Kafka said. “As part of our normal daily operations, we continue to track all vessels in the Indo-Pacific area of operations through maritime patrol aircraft, surface ship, and joint capabilities.” This is much closer than the Kremlin had previously acknowledged, having only said that the ships from the Russian Navy’s Pacific Fleet were conducting major exercises, including practicing to destroy enemy aircraft carriers , some 2,500 miles southeast of the Kuril Islands. This would have put them hundreds of miles away from the Hawaiian Islands. Earlier reports from U.S. outlets had said that the Russian ships and aircraft were operating in and over the Pacific between 300 and 500 miles from Hawaii, as well. “While I am not going to get into our tactic and procedures, I can say that we operate in accordance with international law and expect Russia to do the same,” Kafka added when asked about whether or not U.S. military forces issued any warnings to the Russian ships or otherwise communicated with them as they sailed past Hawaii. “U.S. military forces are present and active in and around the Western Pacific on a daily basis in support of the homeland and to ensure a Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” “The Russian vessels are transiting west and are out of the Hawaii Operation Area,” Kafka had also told the Star-Advertiser . “As part of our normal daily operations, we continue to track all vessels in the Indo-Pacific area of operations through maritime patrol aircraft, surface ship and joint capabilities.” A map showing the Hawaii Operating Area, including various warning areas and other restricted zones within it, as of 2018., USN The Star-Advertiser reported that this was the closest Russian ships had sailed to Hawaii “in a long time.” Other past reports had described the drills as the largest the Russian Navy had conducted anywhere in the Pacific since the end of the Cold War. Captain Kafka did not specify which Russian ships, specifically, sailed close to Hawaii or when that transit took place exactly. The Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said that the Slava class cruiser Varyag , the flagship of the country’s Pacific Fleet, along with the Udaloy class destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov , and the Steregushchiy class corvettes Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov , Gromky , and Sovershenniy , were participating in the Pacific drills. The flotilla also notably included the Marshal Krylov , originally built to support the Soviet space program and that was also capable of tracking and collecting useful data from missile tests, and was reportedly converted into a command ship in recent years. A satellite image, seen in the Tweet below and reportedly dated June 19, had previously emerged that some had suggested could show some of these Russians ship, as well as others, along with U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyers and a U.S. Coast Guard Sentinel class cutter shadowing them. The low resolution makes it difficult to conclusively identify any of the ships, but it does show a formation of vessels sailing approximately 35 nautical miles south of Honolulu, which would be perfectly in line with Captain Kafka’s statement. The proximity of these Russian warships to Hawaii during these drills, even if it was only for a relatively short period of time, could easily be described as highly unusual and provocative. If the U.S. military had gotten any prior indications that these vessels might get so close, or had already, it would certainly go a long way toward explaining the Navy’s usual decision to move the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and other elements of its Carrier Strike Group to the area on short notice. The Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group is ostensibly still in the midst of preparing for its next scheduled deployment. It’s unclear exactly when that movement occurred, but a picture, seen below, that the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet released late last week shows Carl Vinson , as well as the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Dewey, transiting the Pacific Ocean on June 13. The Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group had previously been training off the coast of southern California . The Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson , at rear, along with Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Dewey , sail in the Pacific on June 13., USN June 13 is also the date of the first of two other separate incidents in which F-22 Raptor stealth fighters scrambled from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii, reportedly in response to approaching Russian “bombers” also taking part in that country’s Pacific drills. A second such scramble took place on June 18. While the Russians did not say any actual bombers took part in the Pacific exercise, Tu-142 Bear long-range maritime patrol planes, a design derived from the Tu-95 Bear strategic bomber , did participate, along with Il-38 May maritime patrol planes and MiG-31BM Foxhound interceptors. A Russian Tu-142MZ Bear long-range maritime patrol plane. This was the specific variant of Tu-142 that had been observed taking part in the recent Russian Navy drills in the Pacific., Andrei Shmatko/Wikimedia Commons “No intercepts were conducted with the Russian planes likely turning away from the path toward the state,” the Star-Advertiser reported. At the same time, this could indicate that the Russian planes appeared to be flying mock attack profiles at targets in Hawaii when the decisions were made to launch the F-22s. It’s also worth remembering that this Russian maritime drill was going on before, during, and after President Joe Biden met with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 16 . The Russian spy ship Kareliya , the presence of which led to the delay of a U.S. missile defense test in May, is still operating near Hawaii , as well. This comes as another American missile defense test in the Pacific appears to be imminent. No matter what, the revelation about how close the Russian ships got to Hawaii, along with this added detail about the potential nature of the F-22 scrambles, puts the entire exercise in a very different light. There has been multiple instances of increasingly provocative Russian naval activity aimed at the United States in the Pacific , among other places , in recent years. However, a significant Russian naval flotilla operating so close to American territory and so far away from home is a radically different show of force that is clearly meant to send a signal to the United States.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 8, 2022",China’s Latest Submarine Seems To Have Lifted Its Sail Design From Sweden’s New A26 Class,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s prodigious naval shipbuilding program has recently made headlines for its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships , but there’s striking activity below the waves, too, including a new subclass of diesel-electric submarine, a detailed photo of which recently came to light. The existence of the new submarine, known in the West as the Type 039C Yuan class, only became known last month, but analysts are already mulling its features and potential capabilities. The latest image, apparently first posted to the Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo and now circulating on social media, provides a good view of what is known, unofficially for now, as the Type 039C. The vessel is harborside, flying the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ensign, and revealing the most visible change compared with previous subclasses of the Yuan family. This is the revised sail design, is raked along its leading edge and which flares out toward the top, very similar in appearance to the sail on Sweden’s next-generation A26 Blekinge class submarine. On the Swedish boat, this feature is understood to have been chosen to increase its stealth characteristics. A still from a brief video uploaded to TikTok showing the Type 039C being moved on the Yangtze River., via Twitter Since the Chinese submarine originally broke cover when photographed from a moving vehicle last month, we have also seen a brief video posted on the TikTok social media platform showing the Type 039C being moved up a river by tugboats from the shipyard where it was built in Wuhan. H.I. Sutton, an expert on all things submarine, first reported on the new subclass on May 12 and considers it “likely to be significant […] major upgrade to an already competitive design.” Sutton also proposes that the revised sail design is likely related to a sonar or communications system and also points out a housing on the upper part of the rudder that appears to house a towed array sonar. Other changes seem to be a generally ‘cleaned up’ hull, which should ensure that the Type 039C moved more quietly below the waves than its predecessors. At this early stage, with perhaps only the first example completed, it’s too early to say what the Type 039C will bring the PLAN, but we can expect other improvements over the already impressive Type 039A/B class, around 17 of which are in Chinese service, while modified versions are also being built for export to Pakistan and Thailand. The Type 039A Yuan class submarine., U.S. Navy Widely thought to be among the quietest submarines in active PLAN service, the Type 039A/B boats are thought to use air-independent propulsion (AIP), a technology that The War Zone has examined in detail in the past . The Chinese submarines likely use a similar Stirling-type engine as used in the influential Swedish Gotland class design and the future Blekinge class. The Stirling auxiliary engine, or Chinese equivalent, burns liquid oxygen and diesel to drive electrical generators that can be used for either propulsion or charging the batteries. The result is a conventionally powered submarine that’s able to remain submerged for multiple days at a time, without needing to surface or use a snorkel. The future Swedish A26 Blekinge class submarine., Saab One of Sutton’s other hypotheses is that the Type 039C may, at some point, introduce a more exotic propulsion system, perhaps using the same kind of lithium batteries as used in Japan’s latest Soryu class submarines, which you can read about here . These batteries offer a range of advantages, including increased endurance at high speeds when submerged, quicker charging and longer battery life, and reduced maintenance requirements, entirely replacing the AIP engine. Japan’s latest Soryu class submarine, the Taigei , features an innovative propulsion system using lithium-ion batteries., JAPANESE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE Either way, the fact China continues to focus on developing conventionally powered submarines, in contrast to the all-nuclear U.S. Navy, is significant. As we have discussed in the past , modern diesel-electric boats offer many advantages, with the potential to be quieter than their nuclear-powered counterparts and yet much cheaper to build — ideal for a fast-growing submarine force like that of the PLAN. In terms of utility, they also fit in better with the type of anti-access/area-denial strategy that Beijing is espousing and are better adapted for the littoral environments in which these kinds of based regional defense campaigns are focused. Size-wise, the new Type 039C is likely similar to the Type 039A/B, which measure around 250 feet long and have a displacement of approximately 3,600 tons. https://youtube.com/watch?v=1Gg404Nt4QE According to estimates outlined in China Naval Modernization: Implications for U.S. Navy Capabilities , a report to the U.S. Congress published earlier this year, it’s expected that China will field at least 25 Yuan class submarines by 2025. It’s not clear how many of these will be completed to the Type 039C design, or if that subclass will constitute a separate production effort. Evidence for the latter could be that the Type 039C seems to have been built at a different shipyard in Wuhan than that which is currently responsible for building the previous Yuan class submarines. PLAN sailors load a Yu-6 torpedo onto a Type 039 Song class submarine., Chinese Internet The emergence of the Type 039C subclass is further evidence, if it were needed, that the PLAN’s expansion is being matched by its qualitative growth, something that we have discussed in the past. In terms of diesel-electric submarines alone, the PLAN has leaped from the Type 035 Ming class, which was effectively an update of the Soviet Romeo class, via the Type 039 Song class, to the Type 039A/B, which are recognized as some of the most capable of their type. Combined with a prodigious submarine-building output, the latest Type 039C subclass looks set to continue the PLAN’s growing threat to the U.S. Navy, as well as regional naval powers, in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 8, 2021",Air Force Flightlines Are Under Threat From Drones And It Wants Your Ideas On How To Protect Them,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) is asking for outside ideas on how to secure its flightlines at permanent and temporary air bases both at home and abroad. AFWERX , a USAF program aimed at bringing innovation and entrepreneurs to Air Force programs, has announced a set of challenges as part of its Revolutionizing USAF Flightline Operations initiative. The challenge seeks proposals for new ideas related to flightline security operations, including the increasingly pressing goal of neutralizing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) that intrude into these highly sensitive areas. That goal is part of the AFWERX Flightline Security Challenge which is reaching out to academia, the private sector, and other government agencies for novel solutions related to protecting flightlines at its air bases from unknown or potentially hostile drones. Aside from the Flightline Security Challenge, AFWERX is also accepting proposals for innovative ideas in Aircraft Maintenance Operations and Airfield Maintenance & Repair. AFWERX is accepting white paper proposals through July 8. A crew assigned to 169th Fighter Wing performs refuels and rearms U.S. Air Force F-16s on the flightline at McEntire Joint National Guard Base, South Carolina , USANG/Senior Airman Mackenzie Bacalzo When it comes to its Flightline Security Challenge, AFWERX states that “aerial threats, including civilian and enemy drones, cause operational interferences and disruptions, lead to scheduling delays and contribute to excess use of Air Force resources” before asking “How can [the USAF] better secure the flightline and help USAF airmen and maintainers stay ahead of the curve?” Some USAF bases like Ramstein Air Force Base have even developed their own “laboratories” for developing new base defense concepts along these same lines. Most discussions of defense against unmanned aerial vehicles tend to focus on the kinetic threats posed by small drones, but AFWERX’s announcement also mentions the threat small UAS pose in terms of “data leaks caused by unauthorized surveillance.” Small drones can be fitted with a variety of sensor systems that can turn them into the perfect tool for electromagnetic signals intelligence surveillance used to probe defenses and communication networks. Off-the-shelf, inexpensive drone systems can even be used to surveil facilities and military hardware, even peering through windows in the the interiors of sensitive installations with powerful optical cameras. AFWERX also mentions “leveraging automation to strengthen the airfield perimeter security and streamline manual processes” as part of the Flightline Security Challenge. Some of these initiatives have already take shape at Tyndall, which has deployed autonomous “robot dogs” to carry out some perimeter security tasks on their own. One of the ways AFWERX’s challenge seeks to improve flightline security is by looking at new counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) technologies. Drones have flown dangerously close to flightlines at several major domestic military installations in the past, including Langley AFB, Davis-Monthan AFB , and even Joint Base Andrews . Those are just the incidents we know about, by every indication the problem is far more widespread. It’s not just military bases that are seeing their flightline operations threatened by UAV activity. England’s Gatwick Airport, the United Kingdom’s second busiest airport, was shut down for three days during the 2018 holiday season due to sightings of unknown drones in its airspace, affecting some 140,000 passengers and 1,000 flights. Since then the problem has exploded in scope . B-52H Stratofortresses sit on the flightline at Minot Air Force Base, USAF/Airman 1st Class Dillon J. Audit Mark Shackley, security forces program manager at Tyndall Air Force Base’s Program Management Office, said the AFWERX Flightline Security Challenge could help revolutionize base security from front to back through bringing more automation into many different operations: We expect the use of advanced data analytics and automation to kind of go hand in hand, but it is also more into the AI [artificial intelligence] and machine learning-type capabilities to see if it is something that we can tie into existing physical security measures and sensors. And there may be some new technology that is essential, that we haven’t thought of yet that can be employed, such as something that could be put into the ground, or maybe it’s in the paint that goes around the restricted area that transmits. When it comes to defeating threats from unmanned aerial systems, Shackley says that the AFWERX challenge could offer new ideas “not only for detection, but for a defeat capability,” adding that flightline security forces “would prefer something that is kinetic, that would be awesome, but we know right now that kinetic counter-UAS measures don’t seem to be really mature enough yet for state-side use.” In addition to tried-and-true air defense systems like surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns, many new kinetic drone intercept technologies have been demonstrated in recent years, including “hard kill” attack drones that ram hostile UASs , and a concept from DARPA that shoots “ strong, stringy streamers ” that foul drones’ propulsion systems. There have been multiple systems developed that use high-power microwaves to defeat drones, either emitted from containerized systems or from other drones . Lasers are another option that will soon hit the field operationally. A KC-135 Stratotanker sits on the flightline on Macdill Air Force Base, USAF/Senior Airman Tiffany A. Emery Despite the rapidly growing number of kinetic C-UAS solutions, it’s unclear how widespread these could be deployed to secure flightlines at installations in close proximity to populated civilian areas. Knocking anything out of the sky, especially with some form of kinetic effector, creates the potential for collateral damage over populated areas. For that reason, non-kinetic solutions are most often deployed in such areas, as was the case recently in Brussels during a NATO summit when Belgian Federal Police were seen wielding anti-drone weaponry designed to disable drones. The United States Marine Corps already has “soft-kill” electronic warfare attack systems deployed to detect and disable drones via electronic warfare. These types of anti-drone systems work primarily by severing the command and control links between drones and their operators, although some non-kinetic solutions like high-power microwaves use directed energy to “fry” the circuitry inside UAVs. Lasers that can burn holes through drones are also an option, as are a wide variety of jamming technologies . However, even directed energy and electronic attacks have collateral damage risks if these systems accidentally interfere with or disable civilian electronics or communications. Any uses of directed energy C-UAS systems close to populated areas would have to be carefully deconflicted with air traffic at airports and other critical infrastructure, particularly due to the fact that many U.S. military air bases are collocated with civilian airports. Despite the risks associated with any C-UAS system, these types of defenses are increasingly needed at America’s air bases. We have been sounding the alarm on the risks posed by low-end aerial threats for years, as in this 2017 feature in which we specifically highlighted the threats small drones pose to aircraft sitting on flightlines at air bases: Similar swarming strikes could be unleashed behind the front lines as well, with hugely expensive and low density/high demand combat aircraft being especially vulnerable to this sort of tactic—something General James Holmes alluded to inadvertently while speaking to the Air Force Association, stating: “Imagine a world where somebody flies a couple hundred of those and flies one down the intake of my F-22s with just a small weapon on it.” Actually, it would be even easier to just strike the jets as they sit idle and vulnerable on the flight line. One swarm could see a whole squadron of tightly packed fighters destroyed without even having a chance to fight back. For many different reasons, it is far more preferable to destroy fighters on the ground than in the air. The fact that this can now be done in such a low cost and low risk way thanks to even commercially-available drones, and potentially far from the front lines of a conflict, is very troubling. We have seen this attempted already in January 2018 when Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria was attacked by 13 crude fixed-wing drones armed with improvised explosives . Even terrorists or political actors could destroy billions worth of military hardware at a very low cost with simple off-the-shelf systems if flightline security solutions aren’t found and deployed in time. Whatever solutions end up being chosen in AFWERX’s Flightline Security Challenge, the very fact that the USAF is looking to industry and academia for ideas on how to protect its installations from emerging asymmetric threats shows just how significant the gaps in the U.S. military’s short-range air defenses are when it comes to small drones and the threats they pose to flightline security.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 25, 2021","Right On Cue, Russian Tu-22M3 Bombers Now Flying From Syria Brandish Anti-Ship Missiles","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense has released new video and photos showing the current deployment of three Tu-22M3 Backfire-C swing-wing bombers to Khmeimim airbase in Syria, the story of which we were first to report on Monday and followed up on a day later with additional details. Now, as we expected, one of the jets has appeared toting a single example of the enormous Kh-22 series standoff missile. Known in the West as the AS-4 Kitchen, the weapon is now primarily used for anti-shipping strike, in keeping with the maritime mission that Moscow has said the Backfires will undertake while in Syria. A video published today by the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television station, TV Zvezda , shows crew strapping into one of the four-seat bombers at Khmeimim, with an example of the A-50U Mainstay airborne early warning aircraft visible on the ramp in the background. An unarmed Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-22M3 is shown departing the airbase, while another is shown flying, with a single Kh-22 (or possibly a modernized Kh-32) carried asymmetrically, under the port wing. There is also an inflight sequence onboard one of the bombers, revealing the non-upgraded cockpit and one of the pilots studying a paper map. Additional footage published by the same source also shows Su-35S Flanker escort fighters departing to accompany the bombers. Tu-22M3 ‘Red 15,’ carrying a single Kh-22/Kh-32 missile, at Khmeimim Air Base., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE The two bombers that can be identified while loaded with missiles are ‘Red 15,’ wearing the Russian registration RF-94149, and thought to be homebased at Shaykovka in western Russia, and ‘Red 50,’ RF-34091, from Belaya in the Russian Far East. A Tu-22M3 overhead Khmeimim, carrying a single Kh-22/Kh-32 under the port wing., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP There is also a series of photos taken of the bombers at the Syrian base, showing a missile-armed aircraft landing, and again on the hardstand, as well as shots of ground crew wearing desert-colored summer flying suits. The caption to this series is “Crews of Tu-22M3 long-range bombers have begun to perform missions in the Mediterranean sea zone.” Since this is the first deployment of Tu-22M3s — or any Russian long-range bomber —to the Syrian base, it wasn’t guaranteed that they would have brandished any weapons. So far, it’s not possible to confirm if more than two missiles are available to the three bombers at Khmeimim and it’s even possible that only these two rounds are on hand to provide for training — and media opportunities of this type. Theoretically, each Tu-22M3 can carry as many as three of these 38-foot, liquid—fueled missiles, although a single example is a far more common payload. These missiles are best known as high-speed ship-killers, for which they can be armed with a nuclear of conventional warhead, but there is also a nuclear-only land-attack version that can be used to attack high-value stationary targets, such as airbases or ports. Crew from a Tu-22M3 bomber are welcomed after landing at Khmeimim Air Base., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE Since the Backfire-C is the only aircraft in the Russian inventory that currently carries the Kh-22 or Kh-32, having examples of the missiles in Syria is significant, as there wouldn’t have been stockpiles of them at the base to begin with. The appearance of the Backfire and anti-ship missile combination is also fully in line with the Russian Ministry of Defense’s description of the current deployment as fulfilling “the tasks of mastering the airspace in the maritime zone of the Mediterranean Sea.” A missile-armed Tu-22M3 trails its brake parachutes on landing at Khmeimim., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE We have already examined how a Tu-22M3, armed with a single Kh-22, can range across the Eastern Mediterranean , over the Black Sea , and even the Red Sea, from Syria, presenting a serious threat to NATO shipping. In its anti-ship version, the Kh-22, while positively antiquated, would still provide the defensive systems operators of any surface warships with a serious headache. Launched at Mach 1.5, the missile accelerates to a cruising speed of Mach 3 after flying for around 14 miles. Then, when approaching the target, the missile dives at an angle of around 30 degrees, accelerating to a terminal speed of Mach 4.1. Maximum range of the anti-shipping Kh-22 is over 300 miles, while the improved Kh-32 is said to extend this to more than 500 miles. Ahead of the Tu-22M3 deployment to Syria, Russia undertook extensive renovation work at the airfield, extending one of the two runways as well as resurfacing and adding new lighting and radio communications aids on both of them. At the time, The War Zone postulated that this was to accommodate bomber operations of the Mediterranean, to NATO’s chagrin. You can read more about that effort and its other potential implications for Russian airpower in this previous story . The Tu-22M3 rolls down the runway with a Kh-22 or Kh-32 missile under its left wing., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE So far, the inaugural Tu-22M3 deployment to Syria has played out much as we predicted. Now that it’s confirmed that the bomber will operate in a maritime role, and potentially carry anti-ship missiles, too, it will be fascinating to see where they venture next in the Mediterranean theater and what NATO’s response to their presence will be.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 27, 2020",Iranians Blame “Technical Fault” For Emergency Shutdown At Country’s Only Nuclear Power Plant,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iranian authorities say that an unspecified “technical fault” was responsible for a total shutdown of the country’s lone nuclear power plant in Bushehr along its southwestern Persian Gulf coastline. Officials in Iran are insistent that the plant, which was built with Russian assistance, will be back online in a matter of days, but details about exactly what has happened remain extremely limited. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) issued its statement regarding Bushehr, including the mention of the technical issues, late on June 20, 2021. This had followed an initial announcement on Iranian state television from Gholamali Rakhshanimehr, an official from Tavanir, the country’s state-run electric power generation and distribution company, that the plant had gone offline the day before and would remain so “for three to four days.” At the time, Rakhshanimehr offered no further information about what the reason or reasons might have been for the shutdown, which was described as an “emergency” decision. A view inside the control room at the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant while it was still under construction in 2009., AP Photo/ISNA,Mehdi Ghasemi “Following a technical fault at the Bushehr power plant,” AEOI’s statement read, according to Iran’s state-run PressTV . “After a one-day notice to the energy ministry, the plant was temporarily shut down and taken off the power grid.” The facility at Bushehr, which went critical in 2011 and began supplying power to the commercial grid two years later, presently has a single reactor plant rated at 1,000 megawatts. In 2014, Iranian and Russian officials signed a deal to build two more 1,000-megawatt reactors at this site and potentially built additional nuclear power plants across Iran. In 2016, there was a groundbreaking ceremony for the second reactor at Bushehr, with construction reportedly only beginning in earnest three years later. Iranian authorities have said in the past that their goal is to ultimately have nuclear power account for at least between eight and 10 percent of the country’s total electricity generation capacity. A map showing the general location of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant within Iran., Google Maps A satellite image of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, with the reactor dome visible toward the left side, and immediately adjacent areas, as of January 2021., Google Earth Iran relies predominantly on natural gas and oil to meet the country’s power needs, but Bushehr is reportedly already a significant contributor to the national grid, with Tanavir asking Iranians to try to reduce their electricity use in direct response to the shutdown. The situation has been further exacerbated by a “predicted rise in temperature” and “limitations in electricity generation,” according to PressTV . It is important to note immediately there is no indication, one way or another, that anything beyond some sort of maintenance issue or accident is responsible for the decision to shut down Bushehr. In March, Mahmoud Jafari, AEOI’s deputy head, had warned that difficulties in securing spare parts and other equipment for the plant from Russia due to sanctions threatened to severely curtail, if not end, operations there in the near term. It’s also not the first time that Bushehr has been shut down completely since it was built. For example, the plant was taken offline in April 2020 ostensibly for routine maintenance and refueling . As a non-proliferation measure meant to ease concerns about the power plant potentially supporting work on an Iranian nuclear weapon, Russia supplies the fuel rods , and then spent ones are returned directly to that country. Bushehr’s main reactor building as it appeared in 2010., AP Photo/Mehr News Agency, Majid Asgaripour At the same time, the official description of this latest shut down as an “emergency” action can only raise questions, as well as safety concerns. Bushehr is situated near active fault lines, to begin with, and there were concerns that an earthquake in 2013 might have caused some level of damage to the site. Afterward, Iranian officials acknowledged the need to repair a malfunctioning electric generator and that “long cracks” had been found on at least one building at the facility, but denied any of this was related to the quake. Regardless, there was no significant reported earthquake activity in the area ahead of this latest incident. In addition, there have been numerous reports that Israel has been conducting a number of clandestine campaigns against targets in Iran , as well as Iranian commercial and military ships at sea. These campaigns have been focused in no small part on hampering Iran’s nuclear ambitions , as well as hitting at the country’s already heavily sanctioned petroleum industry . Member’s of Iran’s Basij militia, an arm of the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, conducts a drill in 2013 simulating a response to an attack on the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant., AP Photo/Tasnim, Hosein Heydarpour Israel, or individuals acting on its behalf, are widely believed to have been responsible for an explosion and subsequent fire in July 2020 at a building where centrifuges used to purify nuclear material are assembled within Iran’s larger Natanz nuclear site. Four months later, top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was assassinated in a complex ambush of the convoy he was traveling in, which reportedly included the use of a remote-controlled gun turret hidden in a vehicle on the side of the road. Just in April, a blackout hit Natanz and there were subsequent reports indicating that an Israeli cyberattack might have been the cause. Iranian officials blamed the incident on sabotage and declared it to be an act of “nuclear terrorism.” Later reports suggested that the suddensh loss of power might have caused significant damage to centrifuge cascades there. In 2010, Israel, in cooperation with the United States, famously managed to infect computer networks at Natanz and other facilities with a computer virus known as Stuxnet, which also reportedly caused physical damage to centrifuges. A cascade of centrifuges at Natanz., Atomic Energy Organization of Iran The new shutdown of Bushehr also comes amid significant political changes in both Iran and Israel. Iranian hardliner Ebrahim Raisi recently won that country’s latest presidential election, which the U.S. government said was neither free nor fair. Earlier this month, a new political coalition formed a government in Israel, choosing Naftali Bennett to be Prime Minister, ending the 12-year tenure of his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. “Raisi’s election is, I would say, the last chance for world powers to wake up before returning to the nuclear agreement, and understand who they are doing business with,” Bennett said yesterday , referring to a controversial multi-national deal regarding Iran’s nuclear efforts . Former President Donald Trump’s administration withdrew the United States from that agreement in 2018 and current President Joe Biden’s administration has been conducting indirect negotiations with Iranian officials about rejoining it. Despite initially pledging not to do so , the Biden administration has eliminated some sanctions on Iran in an attempt to kick start this diplomatic effort. “A regime of brutal hangmen must never be allowed to have weapons of mass-destruction,” Bennett added. “Israel’s position will not change on this.” For his part, Raisi has said he will refuse to meet directly with Biden and that his country’s ballistic missile arsenal and support for proxy forces across the Middle East and elsewhere around the world are not up for negotiation. This is a continuation of existing Iranian policies, but there are still concerns that Iran’s new president-elect represents a shift by the regime in Tehran toward more extreme positions . With regards to Bushehr, even if this recent incident is nothing more than a need for unexpected maintenance or a minor accident, it could still be significant given the potential difficulties Iran faces in keeping the plant running safely. Damage to fuel rods and an associated buildup of radioactive gases at a nuclear power plant in China recently prompted similar concerns . Accidents are certainly not unheard of, even in countries with extensive experience with running various kinds of nuclear facilities and research and development projects , and that do not face major restrictions on the importing of critical parts and equipment necessary to their safe operation. What new information might emerge now about what has happened at Bushehr, either from Iran itself or from other sources, remains to be seen.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 23, 2021",Russia Practices Destroying Enemy Carriers In Pacific Drills Sending U.S. Alarm Bells Ringing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has provided more details about its recent sea and air drills conducted in the central Pacific, which included mock attacks on a simulated aircraft carrier strike group. Although we don’t know exactly when this exercise happened, its announcement comes just days after reports that U.S. Air Force F-22A Raptor stealth fighters were scrambled from Hawaii in response to Russian activities in the region, the second such reported alert mission in as many weeks . The robust Russian presence has seemingly alarmed the U.S. government to a significant degree, even prompting it to move a carrier group into the region in response, but details about exactly what’s been going on and why it’s so worrisome remain murky. The Russian Ministry of Defense today published an account about the Pacific Fleet maneuvers, which are described as having practiced “the tasks of destroying an aircraft carrier strike group of a mock enemy.” A simulated cruise missile strike was carried out by the Pacific Fleet flagship, the Slava class cruiser Varyag (pictured at the top of this story), as well as the Udaloy class destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov , and the Steregushchiy class corvettes Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov , Gromky , and Sovershenniy . A Russian Navy Tu-142MZ Bear-F Mod. 4 of the type that seems to have been the trigger for F-22s being scrambled from their Hawaiian base on two occasions in recent last weeks. , Andrei Shmatko/Wikimedia Commons The two detachments of ships were reportedly operating at a distance of about 300 miles from each other, one playing the role of the enemy. Also involved in the maneuvers was an unnamed Russian Navy submarine and a pair of Tu-142MZ Bear-F Mod. 4 long-range anti-submarine aircraft from the Pacific Fleet’s naval aviation branch, operating from Yelizovo Air Base on the Kamchatka peninsula, which were escorted by MiG-31BM Foxhound interceptors. The two detachments “worked out the tasks of detecting, countering and delivering missile strikes against an aircraft carrier strike group of a mock enemy,” the Russian Ministry of Defense announced. As well as anti-shipping strikes, the task force also tested their readiness for anti-aircraft and anti-submarine missions, the Russian Ministry of Defense added. Official Russian Ministry of Defense video showing the recent maneuvers in the central Pacific, which included a mock attack on a simulated enemy carrier strike group: The Russian Ministry of Defense says all of this was happening at a distance of about 2,500 miles southeast of the Kuril Islands. The location would correspond broadly with reports from U.S. media channels that Russian warships were conducting their maneuvers between 300 and 500 miles west of the main Hawaiian islands. The Honolulu Star Advertiser quoted an anonymous U.S. official as saying that the Russian naval exercise was taking place “several hundred miles west of the Aloha State.” Unconfirmed satellite images purport to show some of the Russian Navy surface combatants just 35 nautical miles south of Honolulu, Hawaii, on June 19, when they were said to be being escorted by three U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyers and a U.S. Coast Guard Sentinel class cutter, although the available imagery seems inconclusive. Regardless, this distance, if true, would put them far closer to Hawaii than any of the other sources currently indicate and it would seem highly unusual that there are no corresponding eyewitness reports from locals in the vicinity. For their part, the Russian Navy Tu-142 aircraft are said to have spent more than 14 hours in the air, covering around 6,200 miles in the process. They were topped up over the Pacific by a Russian Aerospace Forces Il-78 Midas aerial refueling aircraft. The statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense also claims that the mock missile attack was carried out both from surface warships and from the air, although it is unclear which aircraft were involved in this part of the drills. As well as the Tu-142MZ and MiG-31BM, the ministry also mentions Il-38 May anti-submarine aircraft and ship-based Ka-27 Helix anti-submarine and search-and-rescue helicopters. None of these aircraft is able to launch anti-ship cruise missiles, although the MiG-31BM is being upgraded to carry the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic strike missile , which has, in the past, been described as a “carrier-killer” weapon. However, while there are reports that the Northern Fleet is soon to receive the Kinzhal, the Pacific Fleet is not known to have received any examples of the weapon yet. As for the six Il-38s — which comprised both the original Il-38 and the upgraded Il-38N — their job was to search for and track submarines from the ‘enemy’ group. Flying in pairs, the aircraft conducted their maneuvers over the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific, each flying for around eight hours and dropping sonobuoys. A Russian Navy Il-38N., Papas Dos/Wikimedia Commons According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the current series of maneuvers in the central Pacific are the first of their type to be conducted by the Pacific Fleet in recent years and, altogether, involve as many as 20 surface warships, submarines, and support vessels, plus a similar number of aircraft. Last week, Russian state news agency TASS reported that a Pacific Fleet flotilla of the same size had been recently “practicing command and control of a combined arms task force in operations at considerable distances.” The cruise missile scenario described today could also have happened during a previous phase of the drills. The Honolulu Star Advertiser reported that on June 18 a pair of F-22s was launched to investigate “Russian Bear bombers headed … toward Hawaii.” In this instance, “bombers” is likely a description of Russian Navy Tu-142 aircraft. News outlets often describe the Tu-142 as a bomber, since it shares much commonality with the Russian Aerospace Forces’ Tu-95MS Bear-H strategic missile-carrier. Last week, The War Zone reported that three U.S. Air Force F-22s scrambled from their base at of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on June 14. CBS News subsequently reported that, according to unnamed U.S. defense officials, the F-22s were responding to aircraft associated with the Russian naval exercise. Again, CBS reported at the time that the Russian aircraft were “bombers,” although likely candidates are three Tu-142MZ aircraft that were taking part in Pacific Fleet maneuvers at the time, video of which was released by the Russian Ministry of Defense. Regardless, on both occasions, the Russian aircraft in question never entered the Hawaiian air defense identification zone (ADIZ), nor were they ever actually intercepted. Hawaii Air National Guard F-22s taxi down the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam flight line during exercise Sentry Aloha. , U.S. Air National Guard/Senior Airman John Linzmeier Questions still remain about the first incident in particular, with still no official on-the-record confirmation of what the F-22s were scrambled to intercept and why it was not actually intercepted. Then there is the movement of a U.S. Navy carrier strike group — based around the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) — closer to Hawaii, apparently in response to the Russian movements. At first, this movement was not officially confirmed, but on June 17 the Navy quietly admitted that the Carl Vinson and her strike group were operating near Hawaii, without revealing when they had arrived, or why.

McCoy All of this activity comes ahead of a potential missile defense test, for which a navigational warning was issued on June 16. This appeared to indicate a planned missile defense-related launch from Kodiak, Alaska, today, June 21. Kodiak is home to the Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska, a facility regularly used in testing by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and its partners . Those warnings also indicated a potential impact or impacts of some kind at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, another facility routinely used in U.S. military missile and missile defense tests. In addition, as of yesterday, a chain of MDA-linked radar tracking ships was also apparently on station in the central Pacific. They were arrayed along the exact same route as the one outlined in the navigation warnings, all but confirming they were preparing to monitor the test. The War Zone has reached out to the MDA for further information and the agency has forwarded our queries to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

It’s worth noting that among the Russian ships that has been active in waters around Hawaii in recent weeks is an apparent intelligence-gathering vessel, which reportedly appeared north of Oahu. According to the Honolulu Star Advertiser , this is the Kareliya , the presence of which disrupted a ship-launched SM-6 missile test in May, leading to it being rescheduled. A Cold War-era photo of the then Soviet Navy intelligence ship Kareliya steaming alongside the guided-missile cruiser USS Texas (CGN-39), in 1988., U.S. Navy The uptick in Russian naval activity around Hawaii comes amid the meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin that took place in Switzerland last week. That summit came after after a diplomatic spat between Washington and Moscow, earlier this year, which saw the countries withdraw their respective ambassadors from each other’s capitals. The meeting between presidents saw a solution on that front , suggesting a degree of rapprocehment, but there is still plenty of disagreement between the two powers. More generally, however, the Russian Navy’s increasing willingness to conduct long-range maneuvers closer to U.S. waters now seems to have added Hawaii and the central Pacific to its interests. In the past, for example, Russian naval activity close to the Continental United States saw the high-profile surfacing of the guided-missile submarine Omsk in the Bering Sea off Alaska, last year. The Omsk surfacing was linked to drills that were also described as some of the largest by the Russian Navy in the Pacific since the end of the Cold War, which parallels descriptions of the latest maneuvers, closer to Hawaii. A significant difference, however, is that the Omsk and the associated drills prompted proactive statements from the U.S. military and were confirmed by locals who witnessed the activity. Neither of this has really happened in this latest instance. Meanwhile, a senior U.S. Navy officer warned last year that his service no longer considers the East Coast of the United States as an “uncontested” area or an automatic “safe haven” for its ships and submarines as a result of increased Russian Navy underwater activity in that area. It was only a matter of time until a similar reality came into play in the central Pacific. As the Russian Navy increasingly ventures further afield with long-range exercises of this kind, it could be that the service’s warships, submarines, and aircraft become a more common sight close to Hawaii’s shores, too. Still, clear communications, or a total lack thereof, by the Pentagon in relation to this ongoing situation in the Pacific is what is most puzzling. It is possible that the Navy did whatever it could to make it a non-issue prior to the meeting between Biden and Putin, but now, after that meeting has occurred, the service’s lack of candor regarding what is a fairly unprecedented threat, at least in recent years, near Hawaii is baffling.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on May 13, 2021",Israel Has Shot Down Drones With An Airborne High-Power Laser,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced today that it successfully intercepted multiple drones during a test of an airborne high-power laser weapon . The demonstrated system is being hailed as “a strategic change in the air defense capabilities of the State of Israel” and could potentially add a vital capability to Israel’s multi-layered integrated air defense system . While the new high-power laser has been tested against UAVs, statements made by officials involved with the demonstration show that the system is also intended to defend against rocket attacks. The demonstration was carried out by the Israeli Air Force’s (IAF) “Yanat” missile test unit, Israel’s Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&D), and Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems . A press release accompanying the announcement states that multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were intercepted and destroyed above a test range using the new airborne laser system. Footage shared online shows the system deployed on a Cessna 208 Caravan behind a windowed panel on the left side of the aircraft’s rear fuselage. Few specifics about the laser system’s capabilities have been released, but DDR&D’s Head of Research and Development, Brig. Gen. Yaniv Rotem, stated that the system successfully intercepted drones at a range of more than 1km. Israel Ministry of Defense via YouTube Airborne laser systems offer advantages over ground-based laser systems due to the fact that they are carried aboard aircraft and therefore can be rapidly moved between locations. This offers added flexibility to respond to UAV threats wherever they might present themselves and provides greater coverage over a much wider area, especially when compared to a stationary system. An airborne counter-drone system also will be less impacted by atmospheric distortion than its ground-based counterparts. Laser directed energy weapons, in general, have limitations , such as being highly susceptible to atmospheric conditions, clouds, and smoke. As with any weapon system, size, weight, thermal loads, and power also significantly limit how effective they are against various threats or even how broadly they can be deployed on different aircraft. You can read all about these issues in this past piece of ours . Israel’s new airborne laser system is claimed to be able to “effectively intercept long-range threats at high altitudes regardless of weather conditions,” despite the fact that Israel’s Ministry of Defense has previously stated that laser systems do not work well in inclement weather or through cloud cover. Still, laser systems offer advantages over kinetic interceptors, in that cost-per-intercept is much lower despite the potential for high up-front procurement and research and development costs of the laser systems themselves. The aforementioned cost per intercept advantage is a significant catalyst in the development of Israel’s new airborne laser defense system. Israel’s Defense Minister Benny Gantz said the demonstration of the new system is “significant both in terms of cost-effectiveness and defense capabilities” and “will add a new layer of protection at greater ranges and in facing a variety of threats – securing the State of Israel while saving the costs of interception.” While the most recent demonstration saw Israel’s new high-power laser shoot down multiple UAVs only, statements made by those developing the program show that this system could also offer a new tool in Israel’s growing arsenal of rocket defenses. Oren Sabag, General Manager of Elbit Systems Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) Division, said that “that the use of a high-power laser to carry out low-cost airborne interception of rockets and hostile unmanned aircraft, closer to their launching areas and away from population centers, offers a significant change in Israel’s defense capabilities.” A target UAS illuminated by a laser spot prior to interception, Israel Ministry of Defense Last year, Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced an unspecified “technological breakthrough” related to an airborne laser system being developed in conjunction with Elbit Systems. That system was claimed to cost just one dollar per intercept, compared with the “tens of thousands of dollars that each Iron Dome interceptor missile costs.” Israel is looking at developing an array of laser weapons that also includes drone-mounted and ground-based systems. Israel’s new airborne high-power laser system could complement Israel’s existing multi-tier missile defense network, which includes the Iron Dome, Patriot , David’s Sling , and Arrow surface-to-air missile systems, as well as manned fighters and helicopters. The need for a multi-layered approach for lower-end threats presented itself in recent clashes when continuous mass rocket attacks launched by Palestinian militants tested the Iron Dome’s capabilities by overwhelming it with sheer numbers. Iron Dome and its Tamir interceptors are claimed to be capable of shooting down drones in addition to rockets and short-range artillery, but it remains unclear how effective that capability is. In the most recent round of clashes, the IDF reported shooting down unmanned aircraft flying out of Gaza, but it’s unknown which defense systems were responsible for those intercepts. Militants have been increasingly using drones to attack Israel , and these low-end threats continue to present challenges for existing defense systems designed to intercept rockets or missiles that follow more predictable ballistic trajectories. The proliferation of low-end drones capable of carrying out improvised attacks is becoming a worldwide security issue, and even relatively small-scale drones are capable of creating large-scale impact when targeting infrastructure or high-value targets . One could see how Israel could deploy several more mature versions of this system in the skies above key areas such as Gaza or along the border with Lebanon during a time of crisis, in essence providing anti-drone screening in a very efficient package. Migrating the capability to an unmanned system in the future would likely be ideal, enabling a loitering drone defense system. It’s also worth considering that one of the key benefits of lasers are they they can, at least in principle, fire indefinitely, so long as they have a sufficient and consistent power supply. This is important when considering questions about whether it is possible to simply overwhelm existing defense systems like Iron Dome. At the same time, each individual laser system can only engage one target at a time, and there could be significant lag between individual engagements depending on how long the high-power laser takes to charge up. The ongoing development of Israel’s airborne high-power laser system aimed at intercepting and defeating UAV threats demonstrates how crucial anti-drone capabilities have become when it comes to air defense. While airborne laser systems have been developed and tested to varying degrees of success by the U.S. Air Force as far back as the 1980s , Israel is the first to actually deploy a counter-drone laser aboard an aircraft and effectively make it work, at least from what has been publicly disclosed. The latest claims represent a technological triumph for the Israel Defense Forces which will likely influence other air arms around the globe. A UAV after being disabled by Israel’s new high-power laser system., Israel MOD What remains to be known is just what exact type of laser system is being used here and what its power output and other limitations are. For the test setup, it clearly has limited field of regard, but that will surely change over time. We also don’t know exactly what concept of operations would be employed operationally for such a system like this. Will organic sensors onboard the aircraft provide initial detection and targeting or will that come from external sources alone? Also, aboard which type of platform will this laser unit see its first operational deployment? The U.S. Air Force is still slated to deploy its first operational airborne laser on an AC-130 gunship soon , but that system is being eyed more for air-to-ground roles. Meanwhile, a far more ambitious initiative is underway to put a podded laser defensive system on a fighter aircraft. All this is fine and well, but Israel’s approach to provide a counter-drone capability with an airborne laser, something U.S. Navy ships haven’t even received in a truly operation state , is quite intriguing. Although it is worth mentioning that there may be undisclosed work underway in the U.S. that is focusing on developing a similar system . Still, there are aforementioned challenges that remain. It will be interest to see how the IAF and its research wings overcome these challenges as they try to migrate their airborne laser system into an operational state.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 11, 2021",Shocking Images: America’s Newest Aircraft Carrier Endures Explosive Tests Off Florida (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The day has finally come—the first in her class USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) has begun shock trials. The first explosive event occurred on the afternoon of June 18th, 2021, off the coast of Florida. The underwater blast registered 3.9 on the Richter Scale, which alerted many of us who watch for these types of events that the trials had begun. Full Ship Shock Trials (FSSTs) are a massive and potentially invasive test of how all of the ships’ systems, as well as her crew, fare after large concussive blasts occur in close proximity to the ship. This includes everything from the hardiness of onboard computer systems to nuclear reactor elements to sensor systems to crew support elements. Nothing is left unexamined and the entire ship is specifically prepared for the trials with thousands of miles of cabling to support test equipment. The ships’ crew has to be ready for major damage and their ability to respond to that potentiality is part of the testing evolution. These types of trials are hugely important for a new class of ships, especially one as complex as the Ford class, because nearby explosions could come from careening anti-ship missiles, naval mines, torpedoes, or even other ships nearby that get struck by enemy weaponry. It also gives some insights into how the ship may fare during a successful attack. It’s all about finding any weak spots and remediating them. Any issues can also impact the construction of future Ford carriers, four of which are planned and three of which are deep under assembly at this time. USN The bottom line is that the ship needs to be able to take a nearby explosion and continue to fight. Shock trials help ensure that is the case. Shock trials were potentially going to be delayed significantly for the Ford class, which is far behind schedule and over budget. Pushing the critical test evolution as far back as 2024, and using the second in class USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) to do it, was sought by the Navy in 2018. This would have seen USS Gerald R. Ford be put into service without these evaluations completed. Thankfully, not just for Ford , but also for her sister ships now under construction, this didn’t end up being the case. Congressional leadership, namely John McCain, demanded the ship go through the standard testing before being certified for deployment. The last time trials like this were carried out on an American supercarrier was 34 years ago with the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71). Hopefully, if the ship and her crew pass these trials, which usually consist of three explosions, without major issues, it will help speed her into an operational state. While problems with a number of her systems persist to some degree , she has seen some improvements as of late. By every indication, the Navy needs Ford available as soon as possible for operations as it pushes its dwindled supercarrier fleet to the max. With all that being said, we don’t know exactly how the test went as of yet, but we do have these incredible images to pore over: USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN We will update this story with more information as it comes available.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 30, 2021",Why The F-117 Made Its First Flight In Pastel Camouflage 40 Years Ago Today,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Forty years ago, to the day, the famous “Black Jet,” the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft, took its first flight. Its technological prowess , combat achievements , and radical looks mean the iconic plane is now firmly part of the public consciousness. However, when Skunk Works test pilot Harold “Hal” Farley Jr. carefully lifted the first prototype YF-117 off into the skies over Area 51 on June 18, 1981, that particular jet had a very different appearance. That YF-117, serial number 79-10780, also known as “Ship One,” was the first of five full-scale development aircraft (FSD). It took to the air painted in a disruptive three-tone “pastel” camouflage pattern, comprising light tan, light moss green, and a darker tan, with three different shades of each color, as is seen in the photo at the top of this article. However, the aircraft had been in a gray color when it was secreted into Groom Lake from the Burbank production facility aboard a C-5 Galaxy airlifter. Serial number 79-10780, Ship One, in its pastel camo at Groom Lake., Public Domain Remarkably enough, considering the secrecy that surrounded the program, the initial flight tests were conducted in daylight. “When I interviewed Alan Brown, then the head engineer on the F-117 program, he told me that even though there are persons at Area 51 performing all sorts of required work, most were not cleared to know anything about the 117,” author James Goodall explained to The War Zone. “ Alan said that they knew they couldn’t keep it from being seen from time to time, so they figured if they camouflaged it using three desert colors — light tan, light moss green and a darker tan, and three different shades of each color — the pattern would make it very difficult to make out the true shape of the F-117. Alan said that is why Have Blue had that type of scheme, to make it very difficult to make out the correct shape.” A similar camouflage pattern had previously been applied to one of the pair of Have Blue demonstrator aircraft that preceded the F-117 and which proved many of the concepts of the later design. Most importantly, the Have Blue jets showed that the company’s exotic “Hopeless Diamond” faceted design was actually feasible. The first Have Blue demonstrator in the disruptive camouflage. , U.S. Air Force As for the first YF-117, this camouflage scheme was only worn by 79-10780 and then only for 10 flights. It then gave way to an overall light gray scheme, which was reportedly found to be much more effective for concealing the jet both on the ground and in the air. Other changes made to Ship One during the course of its career included the addition of larger tailplanes after the originals were found to not provide the required stability and control authority during flight. YF-117 serial number 79-10780 in the hangar shortly before being painted prior to its first flight on June 18, 1981., USAF Ultimately, all five of the full-scale development machines received the gray scheme and it seems that Lockheed at one point envisaged that all production aircraft would be painted the same way, too. Ship One also got a red wingtip for a period of time in the winter of 1983-84. According to Chris Webb, a radar cross-section and performance analyst, the aircraft’s wing was modified with a sawtooth extension in an effort to help attenuate problematic wingtip votices and improve low-speed handling and landing approach speeds. This modification was never adopted despite showing promising results, potentially due to to its impact on the aircraft’s tiny radar cross-section. Still, it was a unique paint arrangement that gave the F-117 a bit of red flare. Public Domain Public Domain In any event, the Air Force intervened and determined that all of the F-117s should be painted black. All were repainted accordingly, including the FSD aircraft. The boss of Tactical Air Command (TAC), General Bill Creech, reportedly preferred black since it concealed the faceting better in daylight. “You don’t ask the commander of TAC why he wants to do something. He pays the bills,” Rich recalled. “The Skunk Works plays by the Golden Rule: he who has the gold sets the rules! If the general had wanted pink, we’d have painted them pink.” YF-117 Ship One in its pastel scheme., Public Domain The FSD jets were used to test out all aspects of the aircraft’s planned operations, including weapons release from the internal stores bay, and evaluating the aircraft’s all-important radar cross-section. For the latter, they were flown against both Soviet-made air defense systems and a variety of fighter jets. An early photo of 79-10782 flying from Tonopah Airport, Nevada, now wearing the familiar black paint job., U.S. Air Force While the two Have Blue jets were lost in crashes, the five FSD jets were altogether more fortunate. During their careers, they were known to ground crew at Groom Lake as “Scorpions,” after the fearsome arachnids that inhabit the Southwestern United States. The name proved popular with the pilots, as well, and they adopted the name “Baja Scorpions” as an unofficial moniker for their unit and its pilots. Meanwhile, the FSD aircraft were dubbed “Scorpion 1” to “Scorpion 5” and received appropriate scorpion insignias behind the cockpit, plus individual markings inside the weapons bay doors. WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The FSD aircraft all survived the early test program and the last three continued to perform trials work into the early 2000s. The first two of these historic jets, 79-10780 (Ship One) and 79-10781 (Ship Two), enjoyed shorter careers before they were preserved for posterity. Ship One, now painted black, and made to look more similar, externally, to the series-production F-117 aircraft, was put on display at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, where it resides on a pole at a location that continues to play a central role in the Nighthawk story. Its sister jet, Ship Two, is in the collection of the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. Ship Two at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force/Ken LaRock As for the changing colors of the Black Jet, there were other, one-off, and even unofficial schemes applied to F-117s during the type’s illustrious career. To welcome the F-117 into service, in late 1983, 79-10782 was painted with Stars and Stripes emblazoned across the underside and appeared as such at the unveiling of the type to high-ranking officials at Groom Lake in December that year. There are few pictures or video of this aircraft with this paint scheme, which is not surprising given how heavily classified to the program still was at that point. U.S. Air Force via James Goodall/F-117a.com Perhaps the most outrageous Nighthawk scheme was one called “Toxic Death,” which was applied to the stripped-down Ship Two when it was flown into retirement at Wright-Patterson in 1991, after 437 test flights. Ahead of its preservation, the jet had its black paint and volatile stealth coatings removed and was then sprayed with graffiti, which it displayed only briefly, in an episode you can read all about here . Serial number 79-10781 as “Toxic Death.”, Image Provided Elsewhere in the career of the F-117, several further examples ended up returning to the gray scheme that had proven so effective in concealing the aircraft in the daytime during the early days of the program. The aforementioned 79-10782 adopted gray colors under the Evening Shade program that ran during the latter half of 1993, and was apparently tasked with reducing the conspicuity of the aircraft when parked on the ground, although the Air Force ultimately decided to stick with the black paint job. According to Paul F. Crickmore’s Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Fighter , 79-10782 completed 14 flights in its gray guise, with pilots using the callsign “Gray Ghost.” Also available in gray… serial number 79-7082 in an experimental scheme., U.S. Air Force Another oddity around the same time was the half-black, half-metallic 79-10784, another one of the FSD jets, which was trialed under the Senior Spud program in July 1993. Over the course of four test flights, these metallic areas were apparently used to evaluate ways of reducing infrared signature, Paul F. Crickmore records, with the jet flying together with the NKC-135A Flying Infrared Signature Technology Aircraft (FISTA). It’s not clear how successful that was, but, in terms of visual signature, the metallic panels made the jet highly conspicuous in the daytime, at least. Similar testing continues to this very day, including using other surrogate aircraft . In its half-metallic scheme, 79-7084 is refueled by a KC-135., U.S. Air Force In late 2000, a pair of F-117s appeared outside Palmdale apparently wearing a semi-matte white finish over most of the aircraft, the reasons for which have never been fully explained . The jets were from Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico but were assumed to be undergoing some kinds of tests at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Subsequently, 85-10835 from the 53rd Test and Evaluation Group’s Detachment 1 appeared in the so-called Gray Dragon paintwork and was tested at Holloman Air Force Base, beginning in late 2003. This scheme was again tested with a view toward optimizing the jet for daytime operations. “The chief of staff wants to have a 24-hour stealth presence over future battlefields,” explained Lieutenant Colonel “Buck” Rogers, then the operations officer for Detachment 1, at the time . “We know our current black paint scheme wouldn’t be a good color for daytime operations.” At least one more jet, 79-10783 also wore the two-tone gray paint scheme around the same time. Serial number 85-10835 in its hangar at Holloman Air Force Base after being repainted. , U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Vanessa LaBoy One of the Gray Dragon jets is among the first six F-117s of the 8th Fighter Squadron being prepared for their retirement flight to Tonopah Test Range Airport, Nevada., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class John Strong Ahead of its official retirement in 2008, the Air Force returned 79-10782 to an almost identical Stars and Stripes scheme to that which it had worn in the early 1980s, and this was also applied to another jet, 88-10843. The specially painted serial number 88-10843 banks away from another Nighthawk on one of its last missions. Official U.S. Air Force captions describe the jet in the foreground as also being painted in this way, but that is not the case., Rich Cooper Between them, these two aircraft helped give the F-117 an appropriate sendoff as its frontline career came to a close. But as we are now well aware, the story of the Nighthawk is far from over and “Black Jets” still fly today, with signs that their intriguing post-retirement operations are becoming more widespread and somewhat less reclusive in nature. On at least one occasion in recent years, an F-117 has been noted flying with portions of its airframe either unpainted or perhaps due to tests of radar-absorbent material (RAM) or infrared signature applications, which are known to be part of its current work. It’s amazing to think that F-117s have been gracing the skies now for four decades. The fact that they remain increasingly active long after their retirement is a testament to how big of a breakthrough they were so long ago. Case in point, we just got word from our friends over at Dreamlandresort.com that a four-ship of F-117s performed a flyby over Groom Lake this morning, commemorating the legacy of a remarkable aircraft that began 40 years ago with “Hal” Farley’s flight from the same location. The fact that nobody could really see the flyby outside of a select few may be disappointing to many of us, but it is also fitting considering the aircraft was born into extreme secrecy and remains somewhat in the shadows to this very day. UPDATE: You can hear the audio from the four-ship flyover via Dreamland Resort linked here . Knight callsigns are the F-117s, Sabre is a chase F-16D photoship.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 14, 2021",The Air Force Might Make Two Distinct Versions Of Its Next Multirole Stealth Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is planning for the fighter at the core of its multi-faceted Next-Generation Air Dominance program, or NGAD, to come with at least a degree of multirole capability, being able to engage ground targets, as well as aerial threats. The service is also reportedly looking at fielding long- and shorter-range versions of the aircraft, optimized for operations in the Indo-Pacific and European theaters, respectively. These are the latest details to emerge on the secretive NGAD program, at least one demonstrator for which has already begun test flights . More information was revealed during yesterday’s House Armed Services Committee hearing regarding the Air Force’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget request . Testifying before the committee were Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown Jr. Meanwhile, remarks from retired General James M. Holmes, the former head of Air Combat Command, were reported the same day by Air Force Magazine . Alaska-based F-22s about to be loaded with GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs as part of a Combat Hammer weapons system evaluation., U.S. Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Dana Rosso General Brown described the NGAD, or at least, the central fighter component within what’s expected to be a ‘system of systems,’ as an aircraft with a primary air dominance mission. This fits in with its broad brief to ultimately replace the Air Force’s relatively small fleet of F-22A Raptor stealth fighters , which are now being slated for retirement in the coming decade. However, the Air Force boss also wants the fighter to have some “multirole” functions, specifically, the ability to attack targets on the ground, “to ensure, one, that it can survive, but also to provide options for our air component commanders and for the Joint Force.” That sounds, in fact, not unlike the F-22’s current mission spectrum which, although biased toward high-end air superiority, also includes attacking ground targets with precision-guided munitions. Indeed, so far, the Raptor has only ever used its weapons in combat during strikes on ground targets in the Middle East. The ability to fight its way into contested airspace through an anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) umbrella is also something that will be required of the NGAD, so it makes sense that the aircraft would be able to engage targets both in the air and on the ground, where suppressing and destroying advanced surface-to-air missiles would be of particular importance. However, and as The War Zone has explored in the past , the Air Force wants its F-22 successor to offer specific advantages over the current jet, in particular, longer range. The Raptor is currently hamstrung by its combat radius, limiting its potential value in a conflict against China, or other contingencies in the Indo-Pacific region. For its part, the F-35 stealth fighter , too, suffers from a widely reported lack of range for these kinds of conflicts, although it has longer range than many of its counterparts. Fighting against a peer adversary like China with existing fighter aircraft would make their supporting tanker aircraft especially vulnerable, an issue the USAF is acknowledging itself and one we explored in-depth years ago . So it’s not surprising the NGAD is supposed to offer substantially longer range than the F-22. At the same time, Brown confirmed that he wants the NGAD fighter component to carry an increased weapons load compared to the F-22. While this sounds like a reference to expanded internal weapons carriage perhaps aided by using smaller munitions , there has also been much talk in the past about using loyal wingman drones to expand the number of weapons available to the NGAD’s pilot. Using internal carriage to reduce its radar signature, the F-22 typically carries six AIM-120 AMRAAMs , or two AMRAAMs and two 1,000-pound GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), or two AMRAAMs and eight Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), plus a pair of short-range Sidewinder missiles in its side bays. The NGAD will have to do better than this. A CATM-120 AMRAAM missile training round is loaded onto an F-22., U.S. Air Force/Edward Cannon As for retired General Holmes, he reportedly brought up the idea that the Air Force might consider fielding two distinct versions of the NGAD fighter component, one optimized for long-range/heavy-payload missions of the kind that would likely be required in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as one with shorter range sufficient for the European theater of operations. The pros and cons of this approach are interesting to contemplate. If the ‘European’ NGAD was notably smaller, that could make it cheaper to buy and operate, but that would also entail two distinct production versions, with potentially different support infrastructure and a knock-on effect on concepts of deployment and operation. Furthermore, having two distinct versions of NGAD would have considerable logistical and sustainment implications, good and bad. Although it would be hoped that the two designs would share a high degree of commonality, experience with the F-35 shows this is not always the case . Designed using modern techniques with an absolute focus on modularity could impact this issue positively, though, and the aircraft’s subsystems would likely be identical, reducing risk and increasing commonality. It seems unlikely that the Air Force would opt for a ‘low-end’ version of NGAD with reduced sensors and/or stealth, but that’s a possibility, too. The most likely scenario here is that a highly modular design will offer ‘two fighters out of one.’ This can be made possible by using different wings and a common center fuselage, possibly with the ability to insert a plug to extend its size, for example. A more modular design approach to the development of the underlying structure might also allow for future scaling up and down of a central design, something the Air Force has expressed interest in doing with future unmanned platforms. The downside, however, is the Air Force ending up with discrete NGAD fighter fleets that are not necessarily tailored to different theaters: what happens if a commander in the Indo-Pacific needs more fighter capacity, quickly, and is forced to call upon European-optimized jets? Unless the NGAD is able to be reconfigured in short order, they would be getting a less than ideal version to work with. That isn’t a deal-breaker, but it is something to consider. Overall, this thinking has parallels with the so-called ‘Digital Century Series’ approach that was espoused by Will Roper, the former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This envisages rapid development of new fighter jet designs, potentially at a rate of once every five years. While this is potentially fraught with difficulties, as we have discussed before , it was always expected to play a part in the NGAD program, and Holmes’s words seem to reinforce this. The new details about NGAD also might help us understand what General Brown had in mind earlier this year when he introduced the idea of an all-new fighter jet design to replace the Air Force’s large fleet of hard-worked F-16s . As part of an overarching study into the service’s future force mix, one option is a ‘clean-sheet design’ to replace the F-16 and potentially disrupt plans to buy the full 1,763 copies of the F-35A that were originally planned. A shorter-ranged version of NGAD that is also stripped of some of its more exotic systems is a possibility now. A U.S. Air Force F-16C flies over the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Duncan C. Bevan Overall, it seems clear that the NGAD is still seen primarily as a Raptor successor for the high-end fight, but it will also be able to attack ground targets and might be fielded in a shorter-range/lower-payload version for Europe, where missions are likely to be of shorter. duration It could also lend itself to export, which might be trickier in the case of the standard NGAD. Efforts to sell the F-22 to Japan were frustrated, due to lawmakers’ resistance to sharing its advanced technologies. At one point, there was talk of developing an F-22/F-35 hybrid design for Japan to get around this problem and that, too, might offer another possible window into the options for two different types of NGAD fighter. If an ‘NGAD light’ variant were built to replace the F-16, it could benefit from an entire ecosystem of capabilties that are being developed to work in concert with NGAD. These include new weapons, new communications architectures, new sensor systems, and especially, unmanned aircraft that will work alongside these fighters. An F-35A from the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and an F-22A Raptor from the 43rd Fighter Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, fly together for the first time, in 2012. , U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Jeremy T. Lock All this perhaps leaves the F-35 in an even more precarious position. At the one end, plans for the F-35 to be acquired in large numbers to drive down costs could be threatened by a clean-sheet F-16 successor, possible a variant of NGAD, which would likely offer lesser capabilities but with a smaller price tag, and could be attractive to foreign customers. At the same time, if the NGAD is also able to take on the kinds of air-to-ground and defense-suppression missions in contested environments that were previously envisaged for the F-35, then that program could face another challenger, at least within the AIr Force. For the time being, however, we still know very little about the NGAD or a potential F-16 successor for the Air Force. Gradually, some tantalizing details are reaching us about the NGAD, but the program will likely contain a few more surprises along the way. Update, June 18, 12:45 pm PST: This article was updated to reflect the fact that it was General James M. Holmes and not General Mark D. Kelly who told Air Force Magazine about the potential for two variants of NGAD. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer News & Features Procurement"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 26, 2021",Chinese Pilots Are Also Dueling With AI Opponents In Simulated Dogfights And Losing: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recent Chinese state media report claims that pilots from the country’s air force have been losing a not insignificant amount of the time to artificial intelligence-driven opponents in simulated dogfights. This sounds reminiscent of the very public outcome of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s AlphaDogfight Trials last year, work that has since been leveraged in more advanced demonstrations . It also underscores the People’s Liberation Army’s growing interest and investment in the development of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, generally. Earlier this week, Chinese state-run outlet Global Times reported on the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) squaring off in simulators against “AI aircraft,” citing a separate story from this past weekend in the PLA Daily , the official newspaper of the Chinese armed forces. An English version of the original PLA Daily story could not be immediately found. People’s Liberation Army Air Force Pilots assigned to that service’s August 1st flight demonstration team., Xinhua “The AI has shown adept flight control skills and errorless tactical decisions, making it a valuable opponent to hone our capabilities,” Du Jianfeng, identified as the commander of an unspecified PLAAF brigade assigned to the PLA Central Theater Command Air Force, told PLA Daily , according to Global Times . Global Times ‘ story also says that the AI, which reportedly has been in use during simulator training for “years” now, has the ability to learn “from the pilots as it gathers data from each training session.” As such, “at first, it was not difficult to win against the AI. But by studying data, each engagement became a chance for it to improve,” Fang Guoyu, a group leader within Du’s brigade, also told PLA Daily . Fang is further identified as a top performer in a recent real-world aerial combat exercise. “Fang used a [sic] hard-thought tactics against the AI and finally beat it by a small margin, but in the next session, the AI used the same tactics against Fang to defeat him,” the Global Times piece continued. It is, of course, important to note that all of this is entirely according to Chinese state-controlled media outlets. Regardless of how long it’s been in use at Du’s brigade, it’s also unclear how widespread the PLAAF’s use is of the technology in simulated training, or for any other applications, and how aggressively they might be pursuing its continued development. At the same time, it is immediately interesting that the PLA Daily itself, let alone Global Times , which is affiliated with the People’s Daily , the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper, have chosen to highlight an apparent top PLAAF pilot struggling against and even losing to an advanced AI in simulated combat, regardless of how accurate the description of this mock opponent’s capabilities may or may not be. The video below shows PLAAF pilots engaged in live aerial combat training . Still, the kind of technology, and its capabilities, that the Global Times story describes are hardly outside of the realm of what possible within what is publicly known about the state of AI technology. In fact, what we’ve been told about the simulated AI-driven opponents that the PLAAF has been using to train its pilots, and Fang’s specific experiences, sound extremely similar to the outcome of the publicly broadcast finale to the aforementioned AlphaDogfight Trials, an initiative led by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), last year. At the conclusion of a three-day event in August 2020, a U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet pilot from the District of Columbia Air National Guard was beaten five times in a row in one-on-one simulated aerial combat against an AI-driven “pilot” developed by a company called Heron Systems. The actual F-16 pilot, who was referred to only by the callsign “Banger,” was also identified as a graduate of the Air Force Weapons School’s F-16 Weapons Instructor Course. It is also worth noting that, afterward, pilots and experts raised questions about just how valid and applicable the results of these trials might be to discussions about real-world aerial combat. “This [the capabilities of the AI and its ability to learn] forces pilots to develop more and more innovative tactics and make breakthroughs to win these simulations,” the PLA Daily story said, according to Global Times . “Simulated training can boost training efficiency, save costs and lower flight risks, and with the rapid development of technology, it has become a common goal for major military powers around the world to take advantage of training simulations.” These are all certainly potential benefits, broadly, of integrating AI and machine learning into military training regimens. The U.S. military, for instance, is also increasingly exploring the use of AI and machine learning technologies to help improve and economize aerial combat and other kinds of training. One particularly notable example is the work a company called Red 6 has been doing in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force to develop an augmented reality system that enables pilots in real-world jets to face off against entirely virtual opponents. You can read more about Red 6’s developments, which the company is hopeful will also be applicable to training on the ground in the future, in these past War Zone pieces . An Air Force pilot wears Red 6’s augmented reality headset attached to their helmet., USAF The video below shows what the view through Red 6’s augmented reality headset actually looks like during a sortie. Beyond the use of this technology in training, this report also speaks to the PLA’s expanding interest in AI for far broader applications and the work that has already been done in China in this arena. Algorithms that can “pilot” virtual opponents in a simulator could very well be stepping stones to ones able to operate various tiers of real-world unmanned platforms, including fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), another area of development where China continues to make significant strides . The Global Times piece pointed out that AI and machine learning technologies could be employed on manned aircraft to improve efficiency and reduce workload, including helping with decision-making during actual combat, as well. Again, the PLA is hardly alone in all of this. The AlphaDogfight Trials were an adjacent effort to a program called Air Combat Evolution (ACE), which has described the ability of an autonomous unmanned aircraft to dogfight as “gateway to nonlinear combat autonomy” more generally. In March, DARPA announced that AI-controlled simulated F-16s were working in pairs in virtual training environments and that it was hoping to demonstrate the technology on real subscale unmanned aircraft later this year. The goal is to move on to integrating the technology into a modified full-size jet trainer aircraft by 2023. A briefing slide showing, visually, how DARPA has envisioned the Air Combat Evolution program leading into more advanced aerial combat autonomy developments., DARPA The U.S. Air Force is also pushing ahead with its Skyborg program , which is developing a suite of AI-driven systems that it hopes will be able to operate “loyal wingman” type drones working in concert with manned platforms, as well as UCAVs. Portions of the technology could find their way into manned aircraft, too. An initial version of the Skyborg “computer brain” was flight tested for the first time earlier this year. Separately, the Air Force has been working up to a planned demonstration , presently expected to take place in 2024, that could see a piloted fighter jet dogfight against an autonomous drone in real life. This is just some of the work being done around AI and machine learning across the U.S. military and similar developments are occurring in other armed forces around the world, as well. In the United States, there has been a particular surge of interest in these technologies in recent years due, in no small part, to developments in China. A report from the U.S. government’s National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence released earlier this year declared bluntly that, at present, “America is not prepared to defend or compete in the AI era.” “China’s plans, resources, and progress should concern all Americans,” it added. “It is an AI peer in many areas and an AI leader in some applications.” So, while it’s hard to say what the exact capabilities of the AI that PLAAF pilots have been training against in simulators might be, it mirrors developments elsewhere, including the United States. It also underscores the major investments that the Chinese military is making in this field as it strives to become a world leader in the application of AI technologies.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2021",An Air Cushion Patrol Seaplane Was Once In The Works With The U.S. And Japan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A 70-ton jet-powered maritime patrol aircraft that could operate from runways peppered with bomb craters, unprepared airstrips, scrub, water, or even ice? The Grumman/Shin Meiwa ASR-544-4 proposal could have provided Japan, as well as other operators, with a remarkably versatile, high-performance submarine-hunter. Sadly, perhaps, this Cold War project never made it beyond the drawing board, but it was a radical concept that warrants further examination. The joint American/Japanese program was based around the potential of a novel concept that had been developed by Bell Aerosystems, the Air Cushion Landing System, or ACLS, which was apparently first tested on a Lake LA-4 light amphibious aircraft. A desktop model of the Grumman/Shin Meiwa ASR-544-4 in U.S. Navy markings., John Aldaz Collection via Twitter In the late 1960s and early 1970s, there were a number of experiments to fit aircraft with the rubber-raft-like ACLS gear, which promised to make possible operations from almost any surface. In this way, an aircraft fitted with ACLS could be truly amphibious without the requirement for wheeled landing gear, skis, floats, or even a boat-like hull. The ACLS employed an inflatable bag under the aircraft that effectively transformed it into an air cushion vehicle once on the ground (or water). This was inflated using compressed air, released through thousands of nozzles on the inside of the rubber skirt, creating a layer of air that the aircraft literally floated upon. Integral ‘pillows’ were deployed to slow the aircraft down when landing, acting as brakes. When the aircraft was parked or floating on water, an internal bladder sealed off the nozzles. To test the idea for military applications, the U.S. Air Force and Canada’s Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce teamed up with Bell to adapt a de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo twin-turboprop short takeoff and landing transport with ACLS. Two additional turboprop engines were fitted to provide compressed air to inflate the ACLS. Known as the XC-8A and nicknamed the “Puffalo,” the modified air-cushion Buffalo first took off using ACLS in March 1975. It’s unclear , however, if it ever landed with a fully inflated system. Overall, though, it seems the main concern with the project was the service life of the aircraft’s rubber airbag, which proved prone to wear and tear on harder surfaces. The XC-8A “Puffalo” taxies on its ACLS gear., Bell Meanwhile, the ACLS was being eyed by Grumman and Shin Meiwa as a way of greatly improving the versatility of their planned maritime patrol aircraft. In the ASR-544-4 proposal of 1973, the aircraft would likely have been used mainly from the sea, but it was expected to be able to tackle other surfaces too, including improved and unimproved runways. With an elegant 104-foot high-mounted swept wing and a swept T-tail, the ASR-544-4 was broadly reminiscent of the Martin P6M Seamaster jet-powered flying-boat prototype of the 1950s. The engine installation was unusual, with a pair of turbofans mounted above the wings, close to the wing root, and a third engine buried in the tail. The exhausts of the two over-wing engines could be deflected 15 degrees downward to improve takeoff performance. The 111-foot fuselage had space for a crew of 10, together with their workstations, a rest area, bunk, galley, and lavatory. Mission equipment was planned to include radar in the nose, magnetic anomaly detector in the wingtip floats for finding submerged submarines, plus internal sonobuoys. Two separate lower-fuselage weapons bays would have carried up to eight torpedoes, while four underwing stations were also provided for anti-ship missiles. John Aldaz Collection via Twitter Finally, the ACLS below the fuselage would have been 44 feet long and 24 feet wide, with a maximum depth of 6.7 feet, and would have retracted fully into the fuselage when not in use. The air needed to inflate the cushion would have come from two “common power packages,” located in the rear fuselage, these same engines also providing bleed air for the boundary-layer control system, which streamed gases over the upper surfaces of the wing for improved takeoff and landing performance. Takeoff from calm water with a headwind was expected to be achieved in 21 seconds, the aircraft lifting into the air after a distance of 1,700 feet. An underside view of the ASR-544-4 reveals the inflated ACLS and the fuselage weapons bays fore and aft., John Aldaz Collection via Twitter Performance-wise, the ASR-544-4 would have had a mission radius of 1,400 nautical miles and a maximum stores load of over 12,000 pounds. The planned top speed was an impressive Mach 0.9, which would have allowed it to take up its position on station far quicker than its propeller-driven counterparts. A three-view drawing and specification for the ASR-544-4., Grumman Schematic cutaway view of the Grumman/Shin Meiwa design., Grumman It’s unclear if there was a specific requirement that the ASR-544-4 was aimed at, but the design was expected to be ready for service in 1980, which would have provided the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) with a more capable successor to the four-turboprop Shin Meiwa PS-1 and US-1, anti-submarine and search and rescue amphibians, respectively, which entered service in the early 1970s. Interestingly, while the US-1 was a true amphibian, with a boat hull, floats, and wheeled landing gear, the PS-1 was a flying boat that could only alight on water. These aircraft also had a separate engine to provide power for the boundary-layer control system, similar to what was planned for the ASR-544-4. With a long history of amphibian and flying boat manufacture and service, it seems likely Japan was looking closely at more advanced aircraft in this class by the 1970s. Had the ASR-544-4 been chosen for production, it could perhaps have replaced the land-based SP-2H and P-2J Neptune as well as the earlier flying-boats. Instead, the Neptunes were eventually replaced from the early 1980s by P-3C Orions , a more conventional four-turboprop patroller. Meanwhile, the JMSDF has continued to operate both land-based fixed-wing patrol aircraft and amphibians, the most recent in the latter category being the impressive four-turboprop ShinMaywa US-2, a handful of which are in service. The impressive ability of the US-2 to take off from short stretches of water is something that The War Zone has looked at in the past . As for the P-3, after upgrade, the surviving JMSDF fleet is now being slowly replaced by indigenous, four-jet Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrollers. Kawasaki P-1., Japanese Ministry of Defense However, it’s hard to see that the U.S. Navy, which had already turned its back on patrol amphibians by the late 1960s, would have found a role for the ASR-544-4, although it would have offered a compelling performance advantage, at least in terms of speed and runway independence, compared to the P-3. While the promised performance and unique operating attributes of the ASR-544-4 are undeniable, it would likely have been expensive to procure and operate. Furthermore, with five turbine engines of two different types, maintenance may have been a challenge. Today, Russia is the only military operator of a jet-powered amphibian of any kind, the Beriev Be-200 , with the first example delivered to the navy last year. Intended primarily for search and rescue, this aircraft is broadly similar in size and configuration to the ASR-544-4, but of course uses a more conventional boat-like hull plus wheeled undercarriage, rather than air cushion landing gear. The first Be-200ES amphibian for the Russian Navy., United Aircraft Corporation Keeping the ASR-544-4 serviceable would have been further complicated by its lack of landing gear, likely making some kind of beaching gear (as used on the PS-1) essential whenever it was on land for prolonged periods, with the ACLS uninflated. Even the process of the crew entering and disembarking would have been somewhat tricky, not to mention refueling and rearming the aircraft. Ultimately, the ACLS did not find any applications that were enticing enough to put it into testing and production, although it continued to be revisited in the United States and elsewhere into the 1990s. Today, the concept is being offered as a means of operating airships from various different surfaces. A Soviet concept from the 1980s that added ACLS-like landing gear to the Antonov An-14 utility transport: Interestingly, the ACLS could also provide a solution to the ongoing challenge of creating an amphibious version of the MC-130J Commando II multi-mission combat transport, an idea that the U.S. military is now looking at again closely . There have been previous studies of C-130s using air cushion landing gear and it’s just possible that the same concept might once again find its niche. An ACLS-equipped C-130 concept., LOCKHEED In the meantime, the design of the ASR-544-4 stands testament to a bold approach to rethinking the problem of creating a truly amphibious aircraft.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 30, 2021",Air Force Says Hypersonic Missile Tests Could Kill Four Snails And 90 Clams,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) has determined that future tests of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, or ARRW, could result in the deaths of four Top Shell snails and up to 90 clams at Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone , was among the first to spot these details about the potential impact to wildlife at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, a U.S. Army-managed test range in and around Kwajalein, which is part of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. This information can be found in recently-released Environmental Assessment documents related to USAF tests of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that were published by the U.S. Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base. US Air Force personnel work on an AGM-183A ARRW test article loaded on a B-52H bomber., USAF The complete assessment is wide-ranging, detailing the environmental and ecological impacts of tests related to the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program, which is set to eventually replace the aging Minuteman III ICBM. The environmental impact report also references other environmental assessments conducted in conjunction with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), including those that were conducted ahead of the ARRW testing. In April, the Air Force aborted the long-awaited first live-fire flight test of the ARRW due to an unspecified issue on the test vehicle’s carrier aircraft, a B-52H bomber assigned to the 419th Flight Test Squadron out of Edwards Air Force Base in California. The Air Force is planning to try again next month . That test will “demonstrate the booster’s ability to reach operational speeds and collect other important data,” according to the Air Force. “In addition to booster performance, the test vehicle will also validate safe separation and controllability of the missile away from the carrier B-52H, through ignition and boost phase, all the way up to separation of a simulated glide vehicle. The simulated glider will not sustain flight, and will safely disintegrate soon after separation.” The complete ARRW weapon consists of an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that rides on top of a rocket booster. You can read more about this weapon and how it is designed to function here . Further testing of the missile will involve actual boost-glide vehicles impacting at the Regan Test Site. As such, the Air Force conducted these environmental assessments to determine just how harmful these tests might be to the native flora and fauna in that area. The Regan Test Site in the Marshall Islands, USAF A fact sheet for the Reagan Test Site claims its “isolated location minimizes environmental and safety constraints on missile test scenarios and permits control of the radio frequency spectrum.” The site has supported testing involving Patriot surface-to-air missiles, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile interceptors, as well as the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (HTV), among others. It is also a launch point for the Flexible Target Family target missiles, which are used to simulate various kinds of threats during missile defense tests. Kwajalein is also home to the $1.5 billion Space Fence radar system used to track orbital debris, satellites, and other space-based objects as small as a single marble. In addition to the four snails and 90 giant clams, the USAF’s environmental assessment reports that the ARRW tests could harm over 100 Humphead Wrasses, which are large fish that can grow up to six feet in length and weigh up to four hundred pounds. They are also an endangered species . A Humphead Wrasse, Public Domain The animals that fared the worst in the report were corals, over 10,000 of which could “experience complete mortality” due to ARRW testing. One of the main concerns is shock waves, which can travel long distances though the ocean to the seafloor when missiles or re-entry vehicles impact at high velocities. However, due to the particulars of mollusk physiology, the report concludes that “shock waves are expected to have insignificant effects to Top Shell Snails and Giant Clams.” The report cites other “stressors” animals may experience as a result of the missile tests, including: extreme noise levels, exposure to hazardous materials, disturbance caused by human activity or equipment, being struck by aircraft or vessels, and “long-term additions of man-made objects in the ocean.” Of course, direct impact from a test payload would no doubt be the worst “stressor” any of these affected marine species could experience during a live fire test. Aside from the ARRW Tests, the USAF’s assessment found that the proposed GBSD testing plan as a whole “may affect but is not likely to adversely affect” a wide variety of species, including sixteen species of cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), two sea turtle species, and seven types of fish. In addition, testing “may affect and is likely to adversely affect” seven species of coral and three mollusk species. A radar installation at the Regan Test Site, U.S. Army/Jason Cutshaw Four species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) were cited specifically as being in harm’s way due to the testing, including vernal pool fairy shrimp , California red-legged frog , and two plants, the Gaviota tarplant and Lompoc yerba santa . Interestingly, though endangered, the aforementioned Humphead Wrasse is not covered by the ESA, despite attempts to get it listed in the past. Luckily, coral aren’t expected to be impacted by the GBSD testing because, as the report claims, “these species are not known to occur in the portion of the Action Area where they might be exposed to stressors resulting from the Proposed Action.” These are just some of the dozens of species impacted by testing even in this relatively small area cited in the report. Ultimately, despite the impacts to the specific species listed, the document’s ‘final mitigated finding of no significant impact’ report concludes the proposed tests “would not have a significant impact on the natural or human environment.” Tectus niloticus, the top shell snail., Public Domain The USAF’s strangely specific estimate of how their testing might affect small and seemingly inconsequential species like clams or snails may seem like an odd quirk found among the mountain range of paperwork the Department of Defense (DOD) generates daily, but it highlights a very important facet of DOD operations and testing: the environmental impact of military activity. The DOD is the world’s largest user of fuel in the world, as well as the single largest producer of greenhouse gases, two superlatives that could also potentially harm marine life. The DOD sometimes goes to great lengths to ensure rocket launch sites and training areas are free from individuals or protected animals, but in the end, we share the world with so many other living things that it’s impossible for the military to avoid impacting the environment. Missiles or other weapons obviously can’t be tested in crowded urban environments, and unfortunately some of the least human-populated places on Earth are home to species like the Top Shell snail and Humphead Wrasse.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 27, 2021",Army’s New Unmanned Missile Launcher Could Target Ships And Air Defenses,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army says it has tested a prototype of an unmanned derivative of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS , that is capable of a certain degree of autonomous operation. The service has also released a glitzy computer-generated video presentation depicting one of these vehicles, now known as the Autonomous Multi-Domain Launcher, or AML, working a standard HIMARS launch vehicle to engage a hostile warship and land-based air defenses after being airlifted onto an island by C-130-type cargo aircraft . That video offers new information about the plans for the future Precision Strike Missile , as well. The recent test of the AML prototype, which took place on June 16, focused on demonstrating this general concept of operations, with a particular eye toward future operations in the Pacific Region. Over the course of the mock mission, which personnel from the Army’s 18th Field Artillery Brigade led, the unmanned launcher was airlifted onto multiple simulated “islands” at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. The 18th Field Artillery Brigade, based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, is part of the XVIII Airborne Corps , which also includes the 82nd Airborne Division and that is tasked with, among other things, being prepared to rapidly respond to contingencies worldwide. The scenario involved, in part, simulating the launch of multiple Precision Strike Missiles (PrSM), a weapon that is still in development, at targets more than 310 miles away. The AML also engaged mock targets at shorter distances using unspecified artillery rockets. The current HIMARS launcher can fire precision-guided 227mm artillery rockets , as well as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile, and is slated to be able to launch PrSMs in the future. The video presentation that the Army released along with its disclosure of the real-world test, seen earlier in this story, shows a pair of C-130s, one carrying a standard HIMARS vehicle and the other loaded with the AML, landing on an austere airstrip and unloading the launchers. The two vehicles then take up firing positions, with the manned HIMARS engaging a Russian Slava class cruiser at sea and the AML conducting a strike on what appears to be a Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system battery. The two launchers are then loaded back onto the C-130s and depart the area, while U.S. Air Force F-16C Viper fighter jets are shown then moving in to conduct follow-on strikes through the newly formed gap in the enemy’s defenses. A Russian Slava class cruise seen in the Army’s computer-generated video as one of the two threats that the HIMARS-AML team engages., US Army capture Surface-to-air missile transporter-erector-launchers depicted in the Army’s video as another target for the HIMARS-AML team. These are of a type associated with the Russian-made S-400 system, as well as variants of the older S-300., US Army capture The rapid deployment of manned HIMARS launch vehicles via C-130-type aircraft, as well as Air Force C-17A Globemaster III airlifters, to forward locations is already a well-established tactic in the Army, as well as the U.S. Marines Corps. The latter service refers to these as HIMARS Rapid Infiltration missions, or HIRAIN. The Army has also been exploring, in cooperation with other branches of the U.S. military, how ground-based artillery and missile systems could help neutralize enemy air defenses and other anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) assets in future conflicts. The video below shows the rapid deployment and then employment of a HIMARS launcher after being delivered to a forward location via C-17. At the end of the video, an overview of the AML is given, showing that it navigates using a combination of cameras, LIDAR sensors, and GPS. The Army says that, at present, the unmanned vehicle has a drive-by-wire capability that can autonomously follow a series of waypoints or operate in a “follow-the-leader” mode tethered to another vehicle, such as manned HIMARS launcher. It can receive targeting information and launch commands remotely or directly through a control panel on the side of the vehicle. The Army had issued a call for white papers on various advanced concepts , including the idea of an unmanned derivative of the HIMARS launch vehicle, in January. Briefings show that the service has been interested in this launcher since at least 2019. It has reportedly spent $10 million on the project, which is presently just a technology demonstration effort, so far, some of which came from funding that Congress added to previous budgets on top of the service’s requests. A slide from a 2019 Army briefing discussing the AML concept., US Army As The War Zone noted when it first emerged that the Army was exploring this concept earlier this year, an unmanned derivative of HIMARS presents a number of potential benefits, including simply allowing units to deploy more launchers, especially for shorter-during missions, without the need for large amounts of personnel. Unmanned launch vehicles that can operate autonomously, even just when instructed to move to a new location, makes it easier to distribute them across a broader area, increasing their operational flexibility, while also reducing their vulnerability to counterattacks. This could also speed up the process of relocating them to respond to sudden changes on the battlefield. The Army also says that the removal of the full-size cab on the AML could also enable it to fire longer weapons that can be currently accommodated on the HIMARS launcher. With that in mind, it’s interesting to note that, in the video, the unmanned launcher was used to fire an extended range version of the PrSM, referred to therein as the Increment 2 variant of this weapon and depicted as coming preloaded in a longer-than-usual launch canister. When the development of the PrSM began, the weapon’s range was limited by the provision of the bilateral Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between the United States and Russia. The U.S. government withdrew from that agreement in 2019 and the Army has since been working with Lockheed Martin on versions of the PrSM that can hit targets at previously prohibited distances . This new video would suggest that at least one planned extend-range version is longer than the standard PrSM, which can be fired from the existing HIMARS launcher. A standard HIMARS launcher fires a PrSM during a test., US Army The video also offers a look at the planned variant of the PrSM with anti-ship capabilities, identified as the Increment 4 version, and that is shown to have a distinctly different tail assembly and what could be a new nose cone. A new nose would be needed to house one or more types of seekers to enable the missile to engage moving targets at sea, which would also demand an increased level of maneuverability that could come from the new tail. The depiction of the Increment 4 PrSM from the Army’s AML video presentation., US Army There’s no mention of the Increment 3 PrSM variant or what capabilities it might have. There have been previous discussions about integrating new payloads onto the PrSMs in the future, including novel options, such as loads of small unmanned aircraft that would be released over a target area and that would then operate as an autonomous swarm. An Army Briefing slide that discusses a drone swarm payload for the PrSM, among other weapons., US Army At the same time, the Army is also looking to field ground-based versions of the Navy’s multi-purpose SM-6 missile and the Tomahawk cruise missile , which are too long the fit into existing HIMARS launchers. AML could present a potential launch platform for those weapons. “You can have all kinds of different configurations of missiles depending on what kind of fight you want to go into,” Jeffrey Langhout, director of the Army’s Aviation and Missile Center, which is part of the service’s Combat Capabilities Development Command, told reporters during a conference call on June 16. “Easily one of the biggest things it does is it just physically gives us more room without having to go spend gazillions of dollars to buy a whole new launcher. It enables us to kind of use what we have and do some minor modifications to it, which gives us options moving forward on however the Army chooses to move forward with the missile fleet.” The Army’s plan now is to continue with its current AML early prototyping effort and to see about integrating that system in more robust exercises in the future, including in cooperation with units in or otherwise focused on operations in the Pacific region. This makes good sense as the service’s first so-called Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) is based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State and has a focus on the Pacific. This MDTF is a testbed organization of sorts that is exploring how to integrate various advanced technologies, including new weapons and greatly improved networking capabilities, as well as associated tactics, techniques, and procedures, into future operations, especially against higher-end opponents, such as China or Russia. This unit set to receive the first operational battery equipped with the Army’s future Long Range Hypersonic Weapon , as well as a Mid-Range Capability Battery that could be equipped with land-based SM-6s and Tomahawks, or other weapons, such as Increment 2 PrSMs, depending on how the service proceeds in those development efforts. A graphic depicting a notional complete Multi-Domain Task Force, which includes a Strategic Fires Battalion equipped with HIMARS launchers, Long Range Hypersonic Weapons, and “mid-range” missiles., US Army The broad Indo-Pacific, and China within it, is the central focus of much of the future planning going on across the U.S. military, as a whole, at present. The AML, as well as other long-range strike capabilities, are part of a clear Army push to ensure it will be a relevant contributor to any future conflict in that region. It’s worth pointing out that the Marines are in the process of developing their own unmanned mobile missile launcher , as well, based on the 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) chassis to support their own new expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations, which are still being refined. That service, which as already noted also fields the manned HIMARS launcher, could very well be interested in the Army’s AML concept, too. A prototype of the Marine Corps’ Remotely Operated Ground Unit Expeditionary-Fires launch vehicle fires a Naval Strike Missile anti-ship cruise missile during a test in 2020., USN So, while the Autonomous Multi-Domain Launcher effort is still very much in the demonstration phase, there certainly does seem to be real interest within the Army, as well as the Marines, in the benefits that autonomous ground-based missile launchers could offer American forces on future battlefields.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jan 27, 2022",China’s Space Station Is Now Manned As Concerns About Its Space Ambitions Grow,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China successfully placed its first crew members aboard its Tiangong space station, which is still under construction. Three taikonauts (astronauts) boarded the Tianhe core space station module in orbit, marking a new milestone in the Middle Kingdomâ€™s rise as a global leader in space. While the launch of the Shenzhou-12 mission is significant on its own right as a demonstration of Chinaâ€™s space program, it also highlights growing concerns about Chinese ambitions in space. The Shenzhou-12, or â€œDivine Boatâ€ mission, is the seventh crewed Chinese spaceflight in history and China’s first space manned mission since 2016. Three astronauts, Commander Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, took off aboard a Long March 2F rocket launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Inner Mongolia on June 17. Seven hours after launch, the crew successfully docked with the Tianhe module in low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of around 236 miles.Â The Chinese astronauts will spend three months aboard the Tianhe bringing the module online and conducting tests of its systems ahead of other planned manned missions. Other modules will be added to the Tianhe and expanded into the full Tiangong space station in subsequent launches planned for later this year. Shenzhou-12 being rolled to its launch site., China News Service/Public Domain In a statement translated by the BBC , Commander Nie said the mission will be difficult and will help further the goal of establishing a Chinese space station. “We need to set up our new home in space and test a series of new technologies. So, the mission is tough and challenging. I believe with the three of us working closely together, doing thorough and accurate operations, we can overcome our challenges. We have the confidence to complete the mission.” SpaceShuttleAlmanac Shenzhou-12 marks the second flight to the Tianhe module after it was placed in orbit. An unmanned supply flight docked with the module in May 2021, and two more launches, the unmanned Tianzhou-3 and the manned Shenzhou-13 , will follow later this year. The 54-foot-long, 14-foot diameter cylindrical Tianhe core module was launched into orbit in April 2021 and includes living quarters for up to three crewmembers, life support systems, and power, propulsion, navigation, and guidance features for the entire Tiangong space station, which is expected to be completed by 2022. The entire module has just 1765 cubic feet of space for all of its equipment and systems in addition three crew members, making the three month stay for these taikonauts fairly spartan in terms of living conditions. The interior of the Tianhe cabin module, Public Domain Aside from the Tianhe module, two laboratory cabin modules, the Mengtian and Wentian, will be added to the Tiangong space station in later missions planned for 2022. Both of those modules will expand the station’s navigation, propulsion and orientation capabilities in addition to enabling crew members to conduct scientific and technical experiments both inside and outside of the modules. In addition, China plans to launch a companion space telescope capable of independent orbit as well as being able to dock with Tiangong that is claimed to have a viewing angle hundreds of times wider than that of the Hubble Space Telescope.Â Once completed, the Tiangong space station will have a mass roughly one-sixth of the ISS and will measure roughly 60 feet in length. The entire station has just 3,884 cubic feet of habitable space, and can house three astronauts. That makes Tiangong roughly the same size as the retired Russian Mir space station or America’s first space station, Skylab. Both of those space stations also had a maximum crew of three. Public Domain As progress on Tiangong is being made, the International Space Station (ISS) continues to encounter a range of problems and malfunctions. Just this week, astronauts were unable to conduct a planned installation of new solar panels due to technical issues and spacesuit errors. Last year, the ISS experienced a significant air leak and the breakdown of one of its critical life-support systems. The ISS has been in space for over twenty years now and its age is beginning to show, all while China continues to advance development of its own brand new space station. The Shenzhou-12 mission comes on the heels of several other recent major milestones for Chinaâ€™s space program. In late 2020, China successfully brought lunar soil and rocks back to Earth that were gathered by its Changâ€™e 5 lunar rover. In May 2021, China landed the Zhurong rover successfully on Mars to conduct a 90-day mission that includes collecting samples of the red planet’s surface and atmosphere. China has also conducted tests of more advanced spaceflight systems, including a reusable space plane similar to the U.S. Air Forceâ€™s shadowy X-37B . China’a Mars rover as seen by a remote camera next to its landing platform., China National Space Administration China has also signed an intergovernmental memorandum of understanding with Russia that establishes plans for both nations to work together on a lunar research station. Construction is planned to begin in 2026 and continue through 2035, at which point the moon base will become operational in 2036. Russia and China unveiled a roadmap for the lunar base at the Global Space Exploration (GLEX) conference in St. Petersburg, Russia this week that contains plans for installations both in orbit around the moon and on the lunar surface, in addition to descent and ascent vehicles, surface energy and communications, infrastructure, and a variety of robotic systems, such as rovers. Russian space agency Roscosmos shared a concept video that outlines the moon base roadmap to social media this week.

U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) commander Gen. James Dickinson told the Senate and House Armed Services Committees earlier this year that Chinaâ€™s anti-satellite weapons, in particular, could soon pose a threat as Chinaâ€™s space program continues to advance and expand. â€œThey invest heavily in space, with more than 400 satellites on orbit today, and China could have as many as 1,000 on orbit by the end of the decade,â€ Dickinson told Congress . â€œChina is building military space capabilities rapidly, including sensing and communication systems, and numerous anti-satellite weapons. All the while, China continues to maintain their public stance against the weaponization of space.â€ The Tianhe module prior to launch, Public Domain In addition to other satellite and ground-based anti-satellite technologies, Dickinson specifically cited Chinaâ€™s deployment of a robotic arm aboard the experimental Shijian-17 satellite in his opening remarks to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Dickinson claimed the satellite could â€œbe used in a future system for grappling other satellites,â€ although the China Academy of Space Technology has stated Shijian-17â€™s purpose is â€œhigh-orbit space debris observation technologies.â€Â There have long been concerns about the ability of certain space systems to have dual military-civilian capabilities. Much of the entire “ killer satellite ” discussion concerns what are publicly described as benign “inspector satellites” that inherently have the ability to maneuver close to other objects in orbit and engage with them, potentially in hostile ways. Any of these so-called inspector satellites could very well be described as being designed and intended to manipulate and observe space debris, while also being perfectly capable of being able to move other satellites out of orbit or otherwise render them inoperable. Various anti-satellite concepts as cited by the DIA, DIA As the Shenzhou-12 mission and other recent milestones show, China is a rising space power and, like any space program, this rise has military as well as civilian dimensions. Orbital space has quickly become a site of not just scientific exploration, but also geopolitical competition as nations become more and more dependent on space-based assets that support early-warning defenses , weapon guidance, intelligence gathering , navigation and communications, and more. As China, Russia, and the U.S. continue to expand their orbital presence, the development of space infrastructure , anti-satellite technologies and rapid launch capabilities will without a doubt become more of a priority.Â Beyond the competition of space-based capabilities, the actual environment of space looks to become an increasingly contested domain . Competing space stations , using space as a transport route, could potentially become platforms to support various missions and operations including as a launch platform for cargo deliveries bound for Earth. The discussion has historically been about threats to space-based capabilities with respect to activities on the ground, but there is a clear push, especially in the US military, to at least explore the idea of developing different kinds of military presences in space itself . While the U.S. has traditionally held the upper hand when it comes to space-based capabilities, the rise of Chinaâ€™s space program could tip the balance. Some experts have forecasted that Chinaâ€™s rapid progress could fuel a new space race , which could advance a wide range of technologies for both civilian and military applications as did the space race of the mid-20th century. It could also have potentially disastrous consequences during a conflict.Â Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com Brett Tingley Anti-Satellite Capabilities Chinese Space Program Space War In Space"
Brett Tingley,"Updated on Apr 21, 2018",Global Concerns And Questions Grow As China Admits Fuel Rods At Nuclear Plant Are Damaged,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Global concerns of a possible ecological and geopolitical disaster loom large as China has finally admitted that some of the nuclear fuel rods in its Taishan Nuclear Power Plant are damaged and that radioactive gases are building up inside one of its reactors. The Chinese government announced this week that no abnormal radiation has been detected outside of the plant, however, while a French company that helps operate and jointly owns the facility has claimed the radiation presents an “imminent radiological threat.” The security and health concerns stem from a build up of radioactive gasses in the water and steam surrounding the fuel rods in one of the plant’s reactors. According to reports , China has admitted that “about five” of the fuel rods in the reactor are damaged, but the plant is said to be capable of operating safely with up to 0.25% of its 60,000 fuel rods, or 150, damaged. French nuclear energy company Framatome, owned by Electricity of France (EDF), which controls a stake in the plant and helps operate it, has meanwhile stated the situation is caused by a degradation of the fuel rods’ housings within the reactor. “The presence of certain noble gases in the primary circuit is a known phenomenon, studied and provided for in the reactor operating procedures,” reads an EDF statement . However, The New York Times reports that experts say such build-ups of radioactive gasses are often caused by “poor design, manufacturing, or management.” Based on somewhat conflicting statements, it’s unclear how dangerous the situation may currently be in Taishan. Officials discuss the construction of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in 2013., Associated Press/Bobby Yip Taishan is located in Guangdong province in southern China and is close to several major metropolises such as Macau, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and the major industrial hub of Shenzhen. Obviously, a nuclear accident in the area would cause an immense health crisis. Four of the surrounding cities (Dongguan, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangzhou) are among the top 50 most populated cities in the world, with close to 40 million people between them. The power plant’s location, with several major metropolitan hubs nearby., Google Maps CNN reports that sources close to the Biden administration have determined the situation at Taishan is not yet at a “crisis level” and “does not currently pose a severe safety threat to workers at the plant or Chinese public.” However, documents obtained by CNN also accuse Chinese safety officials of raising acceptable limits for radiation in the area surrounding the plant in order to avoid shutting it down. When asked for comment, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters “there is nothing abnormal detected in the radiation level surrounding the plant.” Chinese news agencies have ben reporting similar headlines . “The operational safety of the nuclear power plant is guaranteed,” China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment said , according to China Daily . “The premise in the CNN report is wrong.” The White House National Security Council has convened multiple times in recent weeks to discuss the situation, led by NSC Senior Director for China Laura Rosenberger and Senior Director for Arms Control Mallory Stewart. In addition, the White House has been in close communication with the Chinese and French governments and has consulted with subject matter experts at the Department of Energy (DOE). U.S. government officials declined CNN ’s requests to discuss their assessments, but according to current treaties in place, the U.S. would be required to make known any risk to the Chinese public posed by a potential nuclear accident. CNN also reports that Framatome reached out to the U.S. Department of Energy requesting help in assessing the dangers posed by the buildup of radioactive gasses at Taishan. EDF, Framatome’s parent company, holds a 30% stake in the plant alongside the state-owned China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), which controls the other 70%. However CGN is on the U.S. Government’s Entity List , meaning the government believes they act “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States” and, therefore, the United States or U.S.-owned businesses cannot conduct business with them. Framatome has reportedly asked that the U.S. waive that restriction in order to seek the help of American nuclear experts. “The situation is an imminent radiological threat to the site and to the public and Framatome urgently requests permission to transfer technical data and assistance as may be necessary to return the plant to normal operation,” read a June 8 memo Framatome sent to the Energy Department, according to CNN . However dire the situation has been reported in some headlines, other experts have cast doubts on the assessments claiming a nuclear disaster could be imminent. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that it has not received any indication that a radiological incident has occurred, according to the BBC . Najmedin Meshkati, a nuclear safety expert at the University of Southern California, told the New York Times that damaged fuel rods are a common occurrence and that it’s unlikely the conditions at the Taishan plant are a serious threat to public safety. Meanwhile, an unnamed spokesperson for EDF Energy, the French company that helped build and helps operate the plant, said the situation may seem dire but is under control . “We are not in a scenario of an accident with a melting core,” the spokesperson said. “We are not talking about contamination, we are talking about controlled emissions.” A separate EDF statement published by CNN echoes that reassurance. “According to the data available, the plant is operating within the safety parameters,” that statement claims. “Our team is working with relevant experts to assess the situation and propose solutions to address any potential issue.” AN office building located at the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant, Public Domain While there does not seem to be any consensus yet on the dangers posed by the damaged fuel rods at the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant, any type of radiological incident in close proximity to so many heavily populated urban areas could wreak havoc on the Chinese and Hong Kong public if any potential radioactive contamination grows to unsafe levels. A major nuclear emergency along the already tense South China Sea would undoubtedly have public health implications that go far beyond China’s borders, as well. We will continue to monitor the situation in Taishan and update our reporting as new information comes to light. Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com Brett Tingley Nuclear Nuclear Power"
Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 19, 2022",Questions Remain After Report That F-22s Scrambled Due To Major Russian Naval Exercise Near Hawaii (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A report has emerged that major Russian naval maneuvers were underway in the Pacific when U.S. Air Force F-22A Raptor stealth fighters were scrambled from their base in Hawaii over the weekend, an incident you can read more about in The War Zone ’s initial reporting . The Raptors were supposedly launched to investigate unspecified Russian long-range aircraft , part of a group of naval vessels and aircraft that were participating in a large-scale exercise around 300 to 500 miles west of the Hawaiian islands . The incident came immediately ahead of today’s summit meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva. The pair of F-22s was launched this past Sunday on an alert scramble out of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam at around 4:00 PM local time. They were joined by a third Raptor soon after and also had refueling support from a KC-135 tanker during their mission. The reported Russian aircraft that prompted all of this did not enter the Hawaiian Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) at any point and were not intercepted, according to CBS News , which reported this additional information. One of the Russian Pacific Fleet warships involved in the recent maneuvers, the Udaloy class destroyer Admiral Panteleyev , underway in heavy seas., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE U.S. military officials had previously described was described as an “irregular patrol” that was initiated at the request of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), but with no immediate indication as to why the jets had actually scrambled. The FAA has since remained tight-lipped, offering little more than the following terse comment in response to The War Zone ’s repeated requests for more details: FAA Email That situation has since changed somewhat, according to CBS News , which reported that unnamed U.S. defense officials said that the F-22s were indeed responding to aircraft associated with the Russian naval exercise. While it’s not clear exactly why the request came from the FAA, this is not altogether unusual and can be prompted by potential security situations aboard airliners , to providing eyes-on to stricken aircraft or to investigate unidentified aircraft . Nevertheless, a lot of questions remain unanswered. “U.S. Indo-Pacific Command [INDOPACOM] is monitoring the Russian vessels operating in international waters in the Western Pacific,” U.S. Indo-Pacific Command spokesman Navy Captain Mike Kafka told The War Zone in a statement. “As part of our normal daily operations, we closely track all vessels in the Indo-Pacific area of operations through maritime patrol aircraft , surface ships and joint capabilities. We operate in accordance with international law of the sea and in the air to ensure that all nations can do the same without fear or contest and in order to secure a free and open Indo-Pacific. As Russia operates within the region, it is expected to do so in accordance with international law.” Curiously, INDOPACOM’s statement above, which was sent after The War Zone had separately asked Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) about the F-22 sorties, does not specifically mention the scramble itself and there has been no response from them (or clarification from the FAA) as to how the previously reported FAA request factored in to this. We still have no official on-the-record confirmation of what the F-22s were scrambled to intercept and why it was not actually intercepted. Meanwhile, the Russian naval drills reportedly included surface ships, anti-submarine aircraft, and long-range bombers, per U.S. military sources, according to CBS News . This suggests that the aircraft that the F-22s were scrambled to investigate may have been one of the long-range bomber types operated by the Russian Aerospace Forces, or perhaps a Russian Navy Tu-142 Bear long-range maritime patrol aircraft. Am F-22 escorts a Tu-142, on this occasion during an intercept off the coast of northwest Alaska, in 2020., NORAD According to Russian state news agency TASS , a Russian Navy Pacific Fleet flotilla had been recently “practicing command and control of a combined arms task force in operations at considerable distances” and this very likely refers to the vessels that were underway in waters within 500 miles of Hawaii. TASS reported that this task force covered a distance of 2,500 miles from its various naval bases and that it included the Udaloy class destroyers Admiral Panteleyev and Marshal Shaposhnikov , the Steregushchiy class corvettes Gromky , Sovershenniy and Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov , as well as embarked Ka-27PL Helix anti-submarine warfare helicopters. The TASS story is, however, one of the very few accounts of drills potentially related to the scrambling of the F-22s, which CBS News described in its story as the “largest naval exercise in the Pacific since [the] Cold War.” A Russian Navy Ka-27PL Helix-A anti-submarine warfare helicopter., U.S. NAVY In total, the Russian Ministry of Defense said around 20 surface combatants, submarines, and support vessels were involved in the Pacific Fleet exercises, together with up to 20 aircraft. In recent weeks, a Russian intelligence-gathering vessel has also made its presence felt in waters around Hawaii, with the spy ship sailing just outside U.S. territorial waters to the west of Kauai. The Kareliya was likely on station to monitor the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, resulting in a delay to the test of a ship-launched SM-6 missile against a medium-range ballistic missile target. The rescheduled test ultimately ended in failure . The Russian intelligence-gathering vessel Kareliya in Vladivostok., Alex Omen/Wikimedia Commons The Russian Navy’s Pacific drills had also been taking place at the same time that the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) and its strike group were operating around 200 miles off Hawaii. The same carrier came to the attention of The War Zone earlier this month , when it was off the coast of southern California during a so-called “ skyquake ” incident caused by a sonic boom. In the end, the culprits turned out to the U.S. Marine Corps . USS Carl Vinson departs Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam after a visit to Hawaii in 2011. , U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class James R. Evans While the Carl Vinson Strike Group is currently taking part in a pre-planned certification exercise, the location of these drills has been moved closer to Hawaii in response to the significant Russian presence in that part of the Pacific, U.S. officials said, according to CBS News . The backdrop to this Russian exercise close to Hawaii was, of course, the lead-up to the highly anticipated meeting between Biden and Putin that took place earlier today. There were clear tensions between Washington and Moscow ahead of the summit in Geneva, with Biden this past March having described Putin as a “killer.” That had prompted Russia to recall its ambassador from Washington, before the United States did the same with its ambassador in Moscow. Today’s meeting ended with the two leaders having agreed to reinstate their respective ambassadors, as well as to resume arms control talks, including possible changes to the New START arms limitation treaty that was extended for five years in February. This deal, as we have discussed in the past , puts limits on the total number of strategic nuclear weapon delivery systems, as well as the warheads that they carry, that each country can possess. After Biden and Putin’s meeting, there was, however, less agreement on other issues, including other items of particular concern to the U.S. administration, namely the increased Russian military presence on the border with Ukraine earlier this year, alleged Russian cyber-attacks against the United States, and Russia’s arrest of opposition politician Alexei Navalny . These, however, are just the latest points of contention between the two powers, part of a deterioration in relations that has been ongoing for some years now, with significant low points including the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and Russian-sponsored activities in the conflict in eastern Ukraine since then, Moscow’s intervention in the Syrian civil war starting in 2015, and the accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections in the United States. A Russian Aerospace Force Tu-160 bomber seen during another recent long-range aviation mission, this time over the Baltic Sea: Meanwhile, the significance of the Russian exercise to Hawaii is in its demonstration that Russia is increasingly ready and able to conduct long-range naval exercises closer to U.S. territory and interests. In recent years, Russian naval activity has extended from its traditional strongholds in the Baltic and Black Seas , as well as the North Atlantic , the Arctic , and the Western Pacific. Now, it seems, Russia is also keen to flex its muscles closer to Hawaii. The U.S. state is home to INDOPACOM’s headquarters, as well as a slew of other critically important Air Force , Navy , and Marine Corps facilities and assets. What’s so strange about all this is that Russia has made such little noise about what are supposedly historic exercises and the U.S. government hasn’t really even mentioned it either, especially considering it is occurring so close to Hawaii’s shores. Furthermore, intercepts of Russian strategic aircraft are usually publicized by the U.S. Air Force, and especially so when they are unique in nature. This was anything but the case in this instance. Also, moving a carrier strike group off Hawaii in response to a Russian naval exercise is abnormal, to say the least. A 199th FS F-22 on the ground at Hickam AFB in Hawaii., USAF It’s possible that the gag on communications has been due to sensitivities around Biden’s first meeting with Putin. The possibility of having yet another Russian-U.S. headline to deal with, stacked on top of so many others, may have resulted in a planned deviation in normal communications surrounding these types of episodes. It’s even possible that Russia was intending to change the narrative of the summit in order to not have to deal with far more controversial issues on the docket. Then again, there is a lot we still do not know about the incident. Maybe there were other factors at play surrounding Russia’s operations near Hawaii and the catalyst that prompted the ‘irregular patrol.’ As far as we can tell, the details we do have are only based on CBS’s sources. Regardless, the appearance of a large-scale Russian naval task force relatively close to Hawaii is an important reminder that Moscow also has interests in the wider Pacific, as well as delivering a clear message: The Russian Navy can reach out far from home to operate in very close to American territory. Update, June 17, 8:15 am PST: Rob Lee, whose Twitter feed is well worth a follow for those interested in Russian defense matters, has brought to our attention a video showing a portion of the recent Russian Navy exercise in the central Pacific Ocean. The maneuvers were mainly focused on anti-submarine warfare, so it’s not altogether surprising that it involved three Tu-142MZ Bear-F Mod. 4 long-range ASW aircraft, which reportedly conducted a 12-hour flight from the Kamchatka peninsula. These were almost certainly the aircraft the the F-22s responded to. The video, published on the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television station, TV Zvezda , can be seen in full here .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 15, 2021",Air Force Plans To Buy A New Tanker As Problems Persist With The One It’s Already Buying,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is now officially eying the purchase of additional new-build aerial refueling tankers, either of an existing designed or derived from one. This will help “bridge the gap” between the end of its currently planned purchases of Boeing KC-46A Pegasuses and the fielding of a still largely undefined advanced tanker, also referred to as KC-Z, which could be a stealthy and unmanned design . This comes as major issues continue to plague the KC-46A program, including critical deficiencies that limit the ability of these aircraft to reliably perform their core mission. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center announced it had issued a formal Sources Sought notice for the Bridge Tanker Program on June 16, 2021. The service says that proposals must be for aircraft that are “non-developmental” and that are derived from commercial aircraft designs. It expects to issue an actual request for proposals by the end of next year. A KC-10A Extender prepares to refuel a KC-46A Pegasus, while a KC-135R flies in the foreground., USAF “The requirements for Bridge Tanker are currently being defined and the necessary capabilities will be incorporated into the final Request for Proposal once it is validated through the Department of Defense’s joint staffing process,” an official press release explained. “Neither developmental stealth nor unmanned capability is planned.” Just today, Boeing announced it had delivered the 46th KC-46A to the Air Force, though the type technically remains in development. Those aircraft are being delivered under a firm, fixed-price contract and, at present, the service’s plan is to buy 179 aircraft across 13 production lots, in total. The Air Force expects to order the last KC-46As through this deal in 2027 and actually take delivery of those planes in 2029. It's an extra special flyaway day when the name matches the number! The 46th #KC46 is off to the @916ARW where they're ready to provide rapid aerial refueling. pic.twitter.com/xLKHpjV4U1 — Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) June 16, 2021 The stated plan is for the KC-46As to replace a portion of the Air Force’s existing fleet of just under 400 KC-135 Stratotankers . There has been a question for some time about how the service would go about replacing the KC-135s. Though the Stratotankers are still receiving upgrades , the underlying design will be over 70 years old in 2029 and the aircraft becoming more costly and complicated to maintain. There are also still questions about what will happen to the Air Force’s smaller fleet of 59 KC-10A Extenders, which it acquired in the 1980s. In July 2020, the service started retiring some of the oldest KC-10As and, at the time of writing, official records show that six of them have gone to the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona since then. A pair of KC-10As at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona., USAF As of 2019, the Air Force had expected the KC-Z advanced tanker program to have a design in production by 2027. KC-Z had originally been envisioned as a direct follow-on to the KC-X effort that yielded the KC-46A. As The War Zone has explored in the past , while the exact requirements for KC-Z have yet to be finalized, it has since already evolved into a much more advanced development project that is exploring novel concepts to support aerial refueling demands, potentially even in contested environments . Concept art Lockheed Martin has shown in the past of stealthy tankers, including a version with a boom and one with a probe-and-drogue refueling system., Joseph Trevithick There’s nothing now preventing Boeing from simply pitching the KC-46A again for this bridge contract. However, the immediate issue facing the Pegasus is that the aircraft, at least in its present form, simply cannot be relied upon to consistently perform its core mission of aerial refueling for a variety of reasons. Just this month, Air Force Magazine revealed yet another apparently persistent issue that has to do with the software that runs system that controls the refueling boom at the rear of the plane. Unlike in previous Air Force tankers, KC-46 boom operators don’t physically sit in a position at the back of the aircraft to perform their task, instead doing so remotely from the main cabin. The boom software is supposed to allow the operator to select present limits on its travel that are specific to various types of planes that it can refuel via this method. The boom is supposed to pop out of the receiver aircraft if it moves too far up or down or right or left to prevent damage on either end. However, these presets simply do no work and boom operators have to manually enter the appropriate data every time they refuel another aircraft. That workaround means that the Air Force describes this as a Category II deficiency, which refers to issues that do not technically prevent an aircraft from carrying out its assigned missions. However, it still increases the workload on the boom operators and slows the refueling process down. “Boom operators said the workaround is not a big deal when there’s just one receiver, such as another tanker or airlifter. However, when there’s a flight of multiple aircraft, such as these four F-16s , the process takes a small amount of time between refuelings,” Air Force Magazine reported after one of its reporters went aboard a KC-46A during a major training exercise. “Additionally, if there is just one boom operator on the flight, it takes attention away from this process, an issue that was alleviated in this recent mission by having the instructor handle the resets while the boom operator focused on refueling.” A KC-46A refuels an F-16C Viper fighter jet during a test., USAF This followed the Pentagon’s Office of the Inspector General releasing a report in May that slammed the Air Force for mismanagement surrounding the development of requirements for the KC-46A’s boom and its approval of Boeing’s design plan. In addition to the issues with the boom itself, the Remote Vision System (RVS) that operators use to link it up with receiving aircraft remains dangerously problematic , as you can read more about here . The RVS is a hybrid 2D/3D system that pipes video feeds in from an array of cameras at the rear of the aircraft on a flat screen inside the main cabin. Boom operators wear special glasses, similar to those used to watch modern 3D movies or experience other 3D attractions, that are, in principle, supposed to provide valuable depth perception. However, still-limited depth perception, as well as shadows and glare, make it difficult for personnel to accurately and safely move the boom relative to the receiving aircraft. In May, as part of Air Force Magazine ‘s reporting, it emerged that the tip of the boom is often not even visible on the screen requiring personnel to try to determine its position based on shadows and general experience with the system. Boom operators inside a KC-46A wearing special glasses in combination with the hybrid 2D/3D Remote Vision System (RVS)., USAF Boeing and the Air Force have agreed on a plan to develop and integrate an ‘RVS 2.0’ on existing and future KC-46As, but the system isn’t expected to be ready to go into the first Pegasuses until 2023 . It’s not clear how long it will take to integrate the fix onto all of the service’s existing KC-46As or how much time it will take to train boom operators to use it. Until the RVS issue is sorted out, the Air Force only expects to use the Pegasuses for refueling during training or operational missions on an, at best, limited basis . Other issues have befallen the KC-46s over the years, including recent problems with the installation of a palletized lavatory that causes the contents of the toilets to leak out into the aircraft , though some of them have been resolved . Quality control issues have also led the Air Force to stop accepting deliveries of the tankers from Boeing on multiple occasions in the past. In January, the company acknowledged that the program had seen total cost overruns in excess of $5 billion , more than the value of the original contract award. Due to the firm, fixed-price nature of that deal, Boeing has had to eat the majority of these losses, though it has secured some additional funding in instances where the Air Force has accepted that certain fixes to the aircraft exceed its original requirements. Even before production started, the KC-46A had already been party to a decades-long saga of Air Force attempts to purchase new tankers. One initial attempt to acquire new aerial refueling planes in the early 2000s ended in a massive scandal that saw Darleen Druyun, who had been the Principal Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to nine months in federal prison. The first KC-X contract, which a team consisting of Northrop Grumman and what was then known as EADS won in 2008 after beating out Boeing, was subsequently canceled. Their offering was a militarized Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) variant of the Airbus A330 airliner. Boeing then won the rebooted competition in 2011 with its KC-46A. Had the Northrop Grumman/EADS team won again, the plan had been to build those tankers, known as KC-45As, at a plant in Mobile, Alabama. That facility was still established and today it serves as a final assembly point for A220 and A320 airliners. A Royal Australian Air Force KC-30A tanker, that service’s designation for the Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker-Transport., RAAF EADS, which has since evolved into Airbus Defense and Space, has since secured sales of A330 MRTTs to Australia, the United Kingdom , France, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. Last year, it also began delivering examples that are now part of a multi-national tanker fleet available to European Defense Agency member states. Interestingly, in 2018, Lockheed Martin and Airbus announced a partnership to pitch contractor-operated A330 MRTTs to the U.S. military to meet non-combat aerial refueling demands, as well as work together on advanced tanker concepts. The A330 MRTT certainly remains a non-developmental, commercial derivative tanker option that could be now be proposed to meet the Air Force’s Bridge Tanker Program requirements. It is, in fact, the only such design equipped with a boom, the Air Force’s aerial refueling method of choice, beyond the KC-46A, that is in production now. There may well be few, if any other options available. In recent years, Boeing has reportedly blocked approval for third parties to convert its aircraft into aerial refueling tankers in instances where it might threaten sales of the KC-46A. Boeing and Airbus are the only companies that build suitably sized commercial aircraft, to begin with, that could be readily transformed into tankers that would be likely to meet the Air Force’s needs. It’s also interesting to note that the Air Force, in cooperation with U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), has been exploring the possibility of using contractor-owned and/or operated aerial refueling tankers for non-combat activities, such as training or long-range transits, to ease the burden on existing tanker fleets. A number of private companies are already flying boom-equipped tankers. It’s not clear how the current Bridge Tanker Program plan may or may not impact those separate efforts, which could provide additional aerial refueling capacity without the need for the Air Force to actually buy new aircraft. An ex-Republic of Singapore Air Force KC-135R that is now operated by a private company, Meta Aerospace., Hans Jacobs All told, it seems very likely that the Air Force is looking at another showdown between the KC-46A and the Airbus A330 MRTT for this new tanker acquisition effort. It will be interesting to see if any additional competitors emerge, as well. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Procurement"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 4, 2021",Russia’s Newest Submarines Are “On Par With Ours” According To Senior American General,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior U.S. military officer has again sounded the alarm about the threat that advanced, very quiet, cruise-missile-armed Russian submarines, as well as Chinese ones, increasingly present to the United States . At a hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday, U.S. Air Force General Glen VanHerck, who is head of U.S. Northern Command and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command, told lawmakers that Russia’s growing fleet of nuclear-powered Yasen class guided-missile submarines , in particular, are nearly on par with U.S. Navy types in terms of quietness and will present a persistent threat to the American homeland unlike any before within five years. He added that, at its current pace of modernization , the Chinese Navy would not be behind for long in terms of similar capabilities. VanHerck made these comments before members of the House Armed Services Committee during a hearing on missile defense on June 15, 2021. The general was one of five officials testifying before the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, the others being Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy Leonor Tomero, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Director Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill, U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command head Lieutenant General Daniel Karbler, and U.S. Space Command chief Space Force Lieutenant General John Shaw. The Russian Navy’s Yasen class submarine Severodvinsk ., Russian MoD “Russia just fielded their second Sev class [submarine], which is on par with ours,” VanHerck said at one point, as part of a response to a question about threats that fall below the nuclear threshold that potential adversaries pose to the United States. “Within a five-year period, they’ll have eight to nine of those submarines, which will be a persistent proximate threat off of our east and west coasts that we haven’t had ever in the past.” The “Sev class” boat VanHerck was referring to was the Kazan , which was formally commissioned into Russian Navy service in May. Kazan is the second submarine in the Project 885 Yasen class, which NATO refers to as the Severodvinsk class after the name of the lead boat. It is also the first boat in a new subclass, known as the Project 885M Yasen-M class. Russia has four more of the multi-mission Yasen-Ms already under construction and is presently planning to build at least eight boats in this subclass, in total. Earlier in the hearing, VanHerck, in the context of cruise missile defense, another area of growing concern to the U.S. military, in general , had talked about Russian submarines that were “advanced, very quiet, nearly on par with our[s].” This also appeared to be a reference to the Yasen class. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UEzgQ26W4hE Severodvinsk , which is set to be the only example of the original Yasen design, has eight large payload tubes that can be configured with different configurations of vertical launch system (VLS) cells to accommodate different types of missiles. Reported loadouts include up to 40 Kalibr subsonic cruise missiles , variants of which are intended to be used in anti-ship and land-attack roles , as well as differing amounts of other weapons, such as the Oniks supersonic anti-ship cruise missile. The shadowy Zircon hypersonic cruise missile could also be part of its arsenal in the future. The Yasen-M design is shorter, by up to around 40 feet, but reportedly still has eight large payload tubes, allowing it to fire the same mix of existing and future missiles. Reports also say that Kazan and its future sisters lack the large flank-mounted sonar array found on Severodvinsk , but have gained improvements, including to their reactor plant and elsewhere that focus on reducing their acoustic signatures. The Severodvinsk was already understood to be very quiet , something that General VanHerck has now publicly confirmed. Low acoustic signatures make the Yasen and Yasen-M class designs, which you can read more about in detail here , very hard to detect and track, and then, in the event of an actual conflict, engage. “In the not too distant future, five to 10 years, China will be in the same position,” VanHerck also said during the hearing, referring to similar advanced Chinese submarine developments . This includes the continued development of new variants of the Type 093 Shang class, another modern nuclear-powered type that is reportedly very quiet and can launch cruise missiles from its torpedo tubes. There had been reports that the improved Type 093G version might have VLS cells , but no subsequent evidence has emerged to support this. General VanHerck’s comments yesterday are very much in line with remarks that Navy Vice Admiral Andrew “Woody” Lewis made last year. Lewis was and continues to be the head of U.S. 2nd Fleet, as well as NATO’s Joint Force Command-Norfolk. The Navy reestablished 2nd Fleet in 2018 specifically in response to growing threats in the Atlantic Ocean , including from Russian submarines. “Our ships can no longer expect to operate in a safe haven on the East Coast or merely cross the Atlantic unhindered to operate in another location,” he said at a gathering jointly hosted by the U.S. Naval Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in February 2020. “We have seen an ever-increasing number of Russian submarines deployed in the Atlantic, and these submarines are more capable than ever, deploying for longer periods of time, with more lethal weapons systems.” VanHerck’s remarks also come just months after the Russian Navy made a dramatic display of some of its submarine capabilities when it had three boats capable of firing nuclear-armed ballistic missiles surface close to each other in the Arctic, an area of growing strategic significance . Knyaz Vladimir , the first and, to date, only in-service example of the improved Borei-A class , another design reported to be very quiet , was among the submarines that took part in that exercise. The general’s comments about both submarines and cruise missiles are also interesting when remembering that the Russian Navy’s Project 949A Oscar II class guided-missile submarine Omsk made an unusually public appearance near an outlying part of Alaska last year, sailing on the surface near St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea. That had, in turn, prompted an equally unusual public statement from U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) that it was monitoring the boat’s activities. The Soviet-era Oscar II s have a distinctive hullform that is very wide in order to accommodate 24 missile launchers, 12 on each side, in long sections between their inner and outer hulls. Each one of these launchers can be loaded with a single P-700 Granit anti-ship cruise missile, which NATO also refers to as the SS-N-19 Shipwreck . Deep overhaul-retrofits will see these older Soviet-era missiles replaced by more modern ones. Russian has previously announced plans to modernize at least one Oscar II class boat, the Irkutsk , with new launchers able to fire the Zircon hypersonic cruise missile. A picture of the Oscar II class submarine Smolensk showing the type’s distinctly wide-bodied design. , via Reddit The potential for Yasen and Yasen-M class boats, along with older Russian submarines, as well as various types of surface warships, to carry Zircon is part of separate and growing concerns about the threats that missiles able to reach hypersonic speeds present to American forces. “It’s important that we have that capability now because the hypersonic threat is there now,” MDA head Vice Admiral Hill had said at a separate hearing before members of the Senate Armed Services Committee last week in a response to a question about the need for hypersonic defense systems , especially sea-based options to protect Navy aircraft carriers . At the hearing yesterday, Hill stressed that when he talked about hypersonic weapons, he was talking about a broad category that included missiles tipped with highly-maneuverable unpowered boost-glide vehicles , very-fast-flying air-breathing cruise missiles , and advanced ground-based and air-launched ballistic missiles , which reach extremely high velocities in their terminal phase of flight. “Dog-leg maneuvers just right off the bat, maneuvering in space , what I call range-extensions,” Hill told the members of the House Armed Services Committee in terms of developments just in advanced ballistic missile performance capabilities. “They’re all hypersonic when they come back into the atmosphere.” “What used to be a very predictable ballistic profile, that has now changed and it’s a challenge to the sensor architecture,” he continued. “It’s very important that we continue to invest in the sensor capacity that we have against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise [missiles], because they are converging and they’re coming at us across that whole integrated air and missile defense domain.” “I remain concerned about my ability to defend the homeland as our competitors continue to develop capabilities to hold our homeland at risk, from all vectors, and in all domains,” General VanHerck had said in his opening remarks at the hearing, where he also raised concerns about non-kinetic threats, such as cyber attacks . The potential difficulty in detecting Russian Yasen and Yasen-M class guided-missiles submarines, as well as other increasingly quiet designs that Russia and China are developing, combined with the ever-more-advanced weapons they can carry, look to only be further complicating this overall threat picture. As a result, the situation is increasingly prompting warnings from those with the best available information that America’s advantage in key strategic areas is eroding.

"detresfa_, Sim Tack, The Intel Lab, Tyler Rogoway","Updated on Nov 17, 2021",Tracking China’s Sudden Airpower Expansion On Its Western Border,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s bewilderingly quick construction of airfields atop man-made islands in the South China Sea, as well as its extra-territorial claims over that body of water, have grabbed headlines for years and the issue remains one of the most significant strategic and geopolitical problems of our time. Yet another far less discussed, but similar strategic expansion is underway in the western reaches of the Chinese mainland, which has gotten much less attention, yet it isn’t all that less concerning. Beijing’s remarkable blitz on airfield and other military-related construction in this remote region coincides with escalating tensions with its neighbor, India. Just a year ago to the day, a clash along the Line Of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley between Chinese and Indian troops ended with dozens dead. While it was one of a long list of violent clashes over the years along various disputed portions of the border between the two countries, many saw this particular incident as a strategic turning point for both sides, but especially for the ever more powerful China. Fast forward a year, and China’s heavy investment in airpower-related facilities in the region is already being leveraged by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), as evidenced by an unprecedented level of activity along the Sino-Indian border as of late. This is in addition to massive growth in ground-based air defenses, as well as the construction of new fortifications, heliports, and rail lines into the area. As such, there is more going on here than just some defensive upgrades and the strategic implications are potentially severe. With that in mind, The War Zone brought in some of the best satellite image analysts we know, virtually a who’s-who of the strongest voices in Twitter’s open-source intelligence community who also specialize in develpments in Asia. We want to actually show you via satellite imagery exactly what we mean when we say China is massively expanding its air combat capability footprint in the far western areas of the country, as well as what it all means. With that being said, we will let Detresfa_ , Sim Tack , and The Intel Lab share their in-depth and carefully curated analysis of the situation: Tensions Rise As Combat Capacity Grows The tempo of military infrastructure development in western China, particularly in the country’s Tibet and Xinjiang autonomous regions, has accelerated rapidly over the past years and airpower is one of the biggest elements of the expansion. Since 2017, the year of the tense Dokhlam standoff between India and China, an especially since last year, the number of new military facilities constructed or existing military facilities receiving significant expansions has skyrocketed. J-16 Flankers at an airfield in Tibet., Chinese Internet/uncredited Across its westernmost provinces, China has laid down new runways that expand the overall capacity for the PLAAF to operate in this strategic border region. The emergence of hardened aircraft shelters and underground facilities associated with various airbases has also increased the survivability of military assets deployed in the region, while the enlargement of support facilities helps boost readiness levels and the potential sustainability of air operations along the wider Chinese border with India. Though much of this infrastructure development is focused on enabling and supporting fixed-wing airpower, there are many other significant aspects of this relentless infrastructure expansion effort. This includes expanding or building entirely new bases for helicopters, as well as ground forces, to include air defense assets, and logistics facilities. The sudden acceleration of infrastructure development in Tibet and Xinjiang is linked directly to the rising geopolitical tensions between India and China. Border tensions between the two countries have informed a heightened military posture, though the competition between the two powers covers much more than competing territorial claims within the Himalayas. The expansion of military capabilities in this border area underpins a wider and longer-term regional competition over political, economic and military power. Major fixed-wing airbases that are either under construction or being deeply upgraded along China’s western flank., @Detresfa_ The full intended extent of Chinese military infrastructure development in the region also remains not fully known, as each individually identified new runway or other military infrastructure expansion project in itself increases the potential scale and scope of China’s long-term plans. With different airbases at different stages of completion, from old airbases receiving thorough updates to newly constructed runways at others, interpretations of how Beijing will operationally apply this increased capacity develops along with the construction work. Current observations through satellite imagery, as well as of overall Chinese behavior along its border with India, only tell the story so far, but it is clear that this is not the endpoint of China’s expanded military infrastructure ambitions. Meticulous investigation of developments across various types of military infrastructure in the region will help lift the veil on China’s true intent and capabilities over time. With all this in mind, we have assembled satellite imagery and analyzed a number of airpower developments in the tense region. The massive expansion of China’s existing airbase facilities and the building of new ones underscores just how aggressive its push to wield power over the region truly is. To put it frankly, the expansion is breathtaking in its scale and harkens back to the early 2010s in the South China Sea in terms of how fast Beijing is working to shift the strategic reality in the region on its own terms. Satellite Imagery Analysis Hotan Air Base At Hotan Air Base, which is co-located with the civilian airport in Hotan, a Chinese city in Xinjiang, there has been construction of a new, second runway with its own parallel taxiway. However, additional developments at the airbase leave no question about the military purpose of new infrastructure at Hotan. In addition to the new runway, a new support and maintenance area has been built up, containing several hangars that have also been observed hosting unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations. Satellite imagery also shows the construction of an underground tunnel near the new runway, the purpose of which is difficult to ascertain through imagery alone, but could possibly be used for unobserved or protected vehicular movement and munitions handling within the airbase. Hotan is already an established airbase, actively hosting fighter aircraft as well as electronic warfare platforms, but its expansion represents a significant increase in the capacity of Chinese airpower in its westernmost territory. The satellite image edge was cut off due to the angle that this image was taken. , PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Hotan Air Base is also situated very close to various sites along the border that separates China’s Aksai Chin region and India’s Ladakh that was involved in a protracted and sometimes violent standoff between the two countries in 2020. This region is one of the most intensely disputed areas along China’s western border with India. The expansion of capabilities at Hotan are not a minor adjustment in China’s posture and represent a drastic escalation that is fully oriented toward expanding Chinese airpower in the areas around Ladakh. In addition to airpower, the large base also serves as a major logistical hub in this region where Chinese ground forces man positions along the disputed frontlines. Ngari Gunsa Air Base Further south, in Tibet, Ngari Gunsa Air Base is seeing its capacity increased in a different manner. While no new runways have appeared there, China is busy constructing at least 12 hardened aircraft shelters that suggest an increased fighter presence in the future as only four Chinese Flanker aircraft are typically stationed there. Construction of new hangars and what appears to be a dedicated air maintenance and support area, as well as munitions storage facilities, will also further increase the air base’s capacity. Satellite imagery shows an active deployment of surface-to-air missiles within the air base, as well. The development of new air defense positions alongside China’s air bases in Tibet and near other border locations is a common theme across the region-wide infrastructure drive. The observed construction of hardened aircraft shelters, and expanding support areas, indicate an intent to base larger fighter units at Ngari Gunsa and suggests that China is actively aiming to fill assessed gaps in its airpower capabilities along this sector of its western flank. This assessment may be influenced by the deployment of Rafale fighters of the Indian Air Force at Ambala Air Force Station located just across the border from Ngari Gunsa. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION With deployments increasing in the area, the new hardened aircraft shelters will also allow China to increase the survivability of its aircraft when on the ground, by protecting them against bombardments as well as environmental exposure. Perhaps more importantly, they will also conceal their presence to future observation through reconnaissance flights or satellite imagery. Until now, aircraft at Ngari Gunsa had been stationed on the open tarmac, without means of cover or concealment. Lhasa Air Base The Chinese airbase at Lhasa, the capital of China’s Tibet Autonomous Region, is seeing similar expansions to those at Ngari Gunsa, with 24 hardened aircraft shelters under construction. The separate location of two of these shelters also suggests that they may be intended to serve a high alert function for rapid reaction. Just as at Ngari Gunsa and Hotan, these expansions also include newly developed maintenance and support areas. At Lhasa, an entirely new helicopter staging area also appears to be under construction, which, in combination with the many heliports China is constructing in the region, as well as elsewhere in the country , draws attention to the Chinese military’s emphasis on rotary-wing capabilities . In the mountains just south of the airbase, satellite imagery also shows the ongoing construction of several underground facilities. The presence of underground facilities in the immediate vicinity of PLAAF bases is by no means unprecedented, but also underscores the importance of survivability as part of China’s military infrastructure expansion.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Lhasa Air Base is not located immediately at the western border, where the most recent standoff with India occurred, but instead sits closer to separate disputed border areas that lie across from India’s Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh states. It was, in fact, the primary airbase serving Chinese airpower during the 2017 Dokhlam border crisis . The development of military infrastructure at Lhasa also impacts China’s posture across Tibet, however, as it serves as a major logistical hub into the region. As in other air bases, the new developments such as hardened shelters will increase the survivability and concealment of aircraft on the flight line, but the construction of more elaborate underground facilities in the mountains to the south could suggest an even greater ambition to increase the protection of PLAAF aircraft and weapon systems. Here, like other locations, observations have also revealed renovations to existing area-denial systems alongside the airbase upgrade. Kashgar Air Base Satellite imagery of Kashgar Air Base, located along China’s western borders in Xinjiang, shows the construction of more hardened aircraft shelters as well as maintenance and support areas. In addition to these expansions in support of fighter aircraft operations, the developments at Kashgar also include an extension of the apron that is typically home to H-6 strategic bombers , and a temporary aircraft shelter that appears to support UAV operations. The facility also boasts a new, already active, air defense site integrated within the grounds of the airbase itself. The imagery shows likely HQ-9 surface-to-air missile systems deployed at this site. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The base shows largely the same type of improvements that other bases along China’s western borders have been receiving, aimed at improving survivability and support of air operations in China’s border region. The base witnessed the arrival of H-6s (a nuclear-capable platform) during the 2020 Ladakh crisis, and ongoing apron extensions in the area where they were observed could point to a long-term ambition to base these aircraft at Kashgar. Such a capability reaches beyond efforts to control China’s airspace in the border region, supported by expanded fighter operations and new air defense positions, and plays directly into the Chinese nuclear deterrent toward India. The H-6s at Kashgar are not necessarily fulfilling a nuclear role, however, and could also provide the ability to execute standoff strikes using traditional and more exotic weapons currently in development, or they could be configured as aerial refueling tankers. Changdu Bangda Airport Imagery shows that China is also refurbishing the Changdu Bangda airport located in the very eastern corner of Tibet, near the disputed border with India’s Arunachal Pradesh. The airport has in the past had a primarily civilian character and was used to host China’s longest paved runway at 18,000 feet before it was closed, leaving Changdu Bangda with just one operational runway. New imagery, however, shows that the runway is being refurbished and possibly even extended, while the construction of underground facilities in the mountains right next to the airport unveil a likely military role for the airport.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Located at an altitude of over 14,400 feet, the opening of a more than 18,000-foot second runway could greatly enhance the operation of a variety of aircraft within the PLAAF inventory. Especially with two long operational runways, a military role for Bangdu Changda airport could significantly increase the capacity for air operations over Eastern Tibet. The underground facilities would also be able to ensure a protected presence of PLAAF aircraft and weapon systems. Multiple New Air Bases Under Construction (Tingri, Tashkorgan, Damxung) In addition to the enhancement of infrastructure at existing airbases and airports, satellite imagery has also shown the ongoing construction of entirely new runways at various locations in and around Tibet. The runways are being constructed at locations that previously have not hosted airports or other military infrastructure. These runways are located at Tingri and Damxung, both located in portions of eastern Tibet opposite Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, as well as Tashkorgan in Xinjiang near China’s border with Tajikistan.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Imagery clearly shows soil preparation and outlines of runways, aprons, and support areas under construction at these locations. The military character of these facilities cannot yet be derived from these observations, however. Still, the reality is that any additional runway capacity in Tibet and Xinjiang adds to the overall air combat potential capacity and resiliency of the PLAAF along China’s western borders. The Bigger Picture The overall purpose of these PLAAF infrastructure developments in China’s westernmost regions is clearly centered around projecting increased airpower along the largely disputed border with India, and improving the sustainability of air operations in case of actual armed conflict. As such, the construction drive backs up China’s aggressive territorial policies along its western border areas by helping to ensure control of the skies over them. China’s efforts extend far beyond airpower itself though, and the rapid increase of active heliports and ground forces garrisons throughout Tibet and in Xinjiang paints a picture of a vast multi-domain military buildup along the edge of China’s territorial reach that airfields will be critical in sustaining. In addition to the militarization of the region, China’s infrastructure drive actually also includes a tremendous number of civilian infrastructure developments. Some of these, such as road and rail construction, serve an indirect military purpose by enhancing military logistical capabilities. Others, such as electricity generation, telecommunications, and agricultural developments help China sustain populations into the more remote western reaches of its territory and thereby cement the political claims to territorial control over Tibet and its disputed borders with India. A J-10 fighter operating under PLA Western Theater Command heads to the runway during a training exercise in Western China., Chinese Military The timing of this infrastructure development, which has taken place over the same general timeframe as border clashes with India in Dokhlam and Ladakh, suggests a level or pragmatism related to these border disputes, but is also closely linked to the development of China as a global power. For China, the budgetary burden that this infrastructure development brings with it is something that can currently be shouldered by sustained economic growth, while the strategic benefit of the infrastructure itself will pay off over a much longer term. With Chinese leadership likely anticipating the possibility of increased regulatory and budgetary constraints in the future, now is the time to build up the infrastructure that can carry Chinese power projection through the coming decades. The infrastructure developments also serve as a more short-term boost to China’s economy by subsidizing its vast construction sector as the government seeks to sustain current levels of economic growth and to expand the Chinese middle class. Beyond the ongoing construction, similar benefits can be found in the dual-use nature of some of this infrastructure as well as the permanent employment and economic activity that this militarization will bring to Tibet. The unavoidable strategic implication of the buildup, of course, is a significant expansion of China’s anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) bubble along the entire stretch of its western border. As Chinese capabilities in this area grow, it will become more difficult for India or other neighboring nations to attempt to match its pace and maintain anything resembling a balance of power in the region. In addition, it is important to note that these developments are well in line with similar military and dual-use infrastructure expansion initiatives in other Chinese border regions, such as across areas that are the responsibility of the PLA’s Southern Theater Command and deep into the South China Sea. All of these combine to form an assertive infrastructure-driven policy toward securing vast territorial claims. The well-documented development of Chinese military facilities in the South China Sea in fact provides what can be regarded as a template to the rapid development of persistant military capabilities and combat capacity, as well as the sustainment of A2/AD bubbles that other border areas are now witnessing. A JH-7 flies over Woody Island in the South China Sea., Chinese Military The growth of Chinese strength along its western border will surely embolden Beijing in the pursuit of territorial claims and in future border clashes that may in fact translate into an even more aggressive posture. By also logistically unlocking the Chinese ability to project offensive military power from the western part of the country, toward India or Central Asia, it raises a perception of a Chinese military threat beyond the geographically limited border disputes themselves. With this in mind, the buildup of combat capability on China’s western edge will likely become a greater international concern as time goes on. With all that being said, the big takeaway here is that China’s force posture and ability to sustain a major conflict along its western border is being dramatically enhanced in a breathtakingly short period of time. That, paired with China’s rapid advances in air combat capability, should make India and even other nearby countries very nervous.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 14, 2021",Gaza Ceasefire Breaks As Israeli Airstrikes Follow Incendiary Balloon Attacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israeli Air Force has flown a series of airstrikes against targets in the Gaza Strip associated with the Palestinian group Hamas. The flare-up marks the end of a ceasefire that had held following an 11-day conflict between Israel and Hamas last month. The strikes early this morning were in response to Palestinian militants launching helium-filled balloons carrying incendiary devices from Gaza, a self-governing Palestinian territory. The latest round of violence also comes just three days after a new Israeli government took office. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that its aircraft hit “military compounds belonging to the Hamas terror organization, which were used as facilities and meeting sites for terror operatives in Hamas’ Khan Yunis and Gaza Brigades.” The targets were located in both Gaza City and the town of Khan Younis, in the south of the Gaza Strip. So far, there have been no confirmed reports of any casualties . Incendiary balloons are launched by militants from the Gaza Strip., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP According to the the Israeli fire services, the indenciary balloons resulted in 20 blazes in open fields close to the Gaza border. Similar tactics have been employed by Hamas since at least 2018, when The War Zone reported on the militants’ use of kites carrying incendiary payloads from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory, causing considerable destruction. “The Hamas terror organization is responsible for all events transpiring in the Gaza Strip, and will bear the consequences for its actions,” the Israeli Air Force tweeted, while the IDF announced it was “ready for all scenarios, including renewed fighting in the face of continued terrorist acts emanating from Gaza.” The balloon attacks came after a march by Israeli ultranationalists through Arab areas of East Jerusalem yesterday. This was a scaled-down version of the same march that had been planned for last month, but was canceled as tensions spiraled out of control, leading to a brief, but significant conflict between Israel and Palestinian groups in Gaza in May. The revised march was met by Palestinian protesters against whom Israeli police fired rubber bullets. According to Palestinian medics, more than 30 protesters were injured and there are reports of at least 17 Palestinians being arrested . Other protests took place yesterday within Gaza, with reports that one person was shot in the leg by an Israeli sniper. There are, however, no indications so far that Hamas has resumed launching rockets — on suicide drones — from Gaza. According to Al Jazeera , the militant groups have not yet received any official orders to retaliate, while Israel’s Army Radio reported that Israel informed Egyptian mediators that direct Hamas involvement in launching the balloons would put long-term truce talks at risk. A Shehab suicide drone is prepared by a member of the Al Qassam Brigades, the militant wing of Hamas, during the conflict last month., Hamas Large-scale rocket attacks by Hamas aimed at central Israel became a defining feature of last month’s brief conflict, and these were met in turn by IDF strikes against Gaza, as well as attacks launched by Israeli naval vessels ; in all, it’s been reported that militants fired more than 4,000 rockets into Israel from Gaza. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of May 25, 253 people had been killed in Gaza, while rockets launched from there into Israel killed 12. A ceasefire came into effect on May 21. The context of this latest outbreak of violence is somewhat different, since it comes so soon after Israel’s new government was formed. Although a historic cross-party coalition, including Arab Israelis , the government is led by hardline right-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett, who is an advocate for the settler movement in the Palestinian territories, and who has in the past faced criticism for his comments about Palestinians. “I have killed lots of Arabs in my life — and there is no problem with that,” he was reported as saying in 2013 . Bennett has also spoken specifically about the threat of incendiary balloons. “An explosive balloon is like an anti-tank missile,” Bennett tweeted in 2019, “whoever launches one is a terrorist who is trying to murder Israelis and must be hit.” Clearly, these latest events will be a test for the new Israeli government, which includes lawmakers with widely differing opinions on the protests in East Jerusalem. This part of the holy city was annexed by the IDF in 1967 but contains important religious sites for Muslims, Jews and Christians. For Palestinians, Jerusalem is their proclaimed capital, while most of the international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the city. Reflecting the moderate, centrist position within the Israeli government, Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid took to Twitter to denounce the latest protests in East Jerusalem. “It is inconceivable that one can hold the Israeli flag in one hand and shout ‘Death to the Arabs’ at the same time,” he wrote . “These people are a disgrace to the people of Israel.” Since tensions in Jerusalem around the planned march by Israeli ultranationalists played a key role in sparking last month’s Gaza War, there was a heavier police presence in the city this time around. Police redirected the march to avoid some Muslim areas of the city, but it was still met by Palestinian protesters and hostile words from Hamas, which called for “valiant resistance” to the march. So far, that resistance has not seen a return to rocket attacks from Gaza, although ahead of the march , the IDF reportedly bolstered its Iron Dome defense systems to tackle potential rocket barrages. In the last round of fighting, the Iron Dome systems and their Tamir interceptors were able to knock down hundreds of Hamas rockets . The Iron Dome is known to be able to destroy rockets, artillery shells, and mortar rounds, but it is not designed to be used against basic balloons. An earlier test of an upgraded Iron Dome defense system., ISRAEL MINISTRY OF DEFENSE CAPTURE There is also a possibility that the militants are still rebuilding their stocks of rockets since the conflict last month and there is little doubt that the IDF attacks caused significant damage to rocket manufacturing centers and rocket-launching infrastructure. Meanwhile, other reports suggest that Israel and Egypt withholding financial support and material assistance to Gaza is forcing Hamas into restraint. The IDF has responded swiftly to the attacks by Hamas incendiary balloons, but with the situation still fraught since the previous Gaza conflict, it remains to be seen exactly how the militants in Gaza will respond to this and how the Israeli government will manage the strained situation in East Jerusalem.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 3, 2021","The U.S. Military Doesn’t Even Track How Many Weapons It Loses, And It Has Lost Thousands","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A damning investigative report published by The Associated Press today details how over 2,000 weapons have gone missing from military arsenals between 2010 and 2019. While the data set was far from complete, what the outlet did obtain shows a worrying pattern of lost and stolen weapons, some of which ended up in the hands of criminals who used them in the commission of violent crimes, while others were even simply discarded in public parks. The Associated Press ‘s investigation states that, between 2010 and 2019, these weapons went missing or were deliberately taken from a wide variety of locations, including armories, warehouses, firing ranges, Navy vessels, or even while in transit. Reasons cited in the report included unlocked doors, burglary, security personnel falling asleep, or lapses in surveillance and other security systems. 1,504 weapons were reported missing or stolen from the Army, 211 from the Navy, 204 from the Marines, and 39 were categorized as “Other,” which presumably includes the U.S. Coast Guard and Department of Defense security forces like the Pentagon Force Protection Agency. While the Marines and Navy offered their own figures about weapons lost or stolen throughout the last decade, the Army and Air Force did not willingly provide The Associated Press with exact numbers about how many of their weapons were unaccounted for, so the report instead relied on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for military criminal case files, as well as internal military small arms registries. One of those FOIA requests filed with the Army’s Office of the Provost Marshal General revealed 1,303 lost firearms from the Army alone. The AP reported the Air Force was less cooperative: The Air Force was the only service branch not to release data. It first responded to several Freedom of Information Act requests by saying no records existed. Air Force representatives then said they would not provide details until yet another FOIA request, filed 1.5 years ago, was fully processed. An airman returns an M4 carbine to storage at Holloman Air Force Base., USAF/Airman 1st Class Aaron Montoya Of these guns and other weapon systems cited in the AP report, many of which remain unaccounted for, 1,179 were rifles, while another 694 were handguns. A total of 74 machine guns went missing, as did 11 shotguns. Close to 100 more were reported to be grenade launchers, rocket launchers, or mortars. The AP did not specify which specific weapons were stolen or lost in most cases. M4 rifles are cited in a few incidents, as are Beretta M9 handguns . In the cases of the other classes of weapons cited in the report, the classes used represent a wide range of weapons with different levels of lethality. Rocket launchers, for example, come in both reloadable and non-reloadable forms. “Machine guns” as a whole also represents a wide variety of weapons, some of which can fire of thousands of rounds per minute and would be absolutely devastating if used in a criminal or terrorist act. Another seven missing weapons were reported as “other.” It is unknown what those may represent, or if they are merely uncategorizable based on a scarcity of data in the reports obtained by The Associated Press . From the lack of clarity in the dataset, these could be almost anything ranging from a knife to a nuclear weapon. The U.S. military has also infamously lost six of its nuclear weapons due to aircraft crashes or other mishaps. One of those incidents remains classified to this day, but is thought to be related to the loss of the USS Scorpion , which sank mysteriously with all hands aboard in the North Atlantic Ocean in May 1968. DOD Even military vehicles get stolen from time to time, such as in 2018 when a Virginia Army National Guardsmen stole an M577 armored command vehicle and led police on a 60-mile chase. In 1995, an M60A3 Patton tank was stolen from a National Guard armory in San Diego, after which it was taken on a rampage that left dozens of cars flattened before police were able to take out its driver. “The military’s weapons are especially vulnerable to corrupt insiders responsible for securing them,” the AP’s report reads. “They know how to exploit weak points within armories or the military’s enormous supply chains. Often from lower ranks, they may see a chance to make a buck from a military that can afford it.” The AP cites an NCIS investigation in 2014 which discovered four M4 trigger assemblies went missing from the Navy’s Special Boat Team Twelve, presumably for sale on the black market or even on sites like eBay. These assemblies can be used to convert civilian AR-15 models to fully automatic weapons. Earlier this year, an Army trainee fled Fort Jackson with an M4 Carbine which he used to hijack a schoolbus full of children. Luckily, the assailant left the bus without harming anyone aboard. Other reasons cited were improper or insufficient adherence to security protocols, as was the case at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune where “authorities often have an open missing weapons investigation” according to the AP. The AP’s report cites an incident in which a Beretta M9 was stolen from Camp Lejeune, only to later turn up in a drug bust in Baltimore. Another missing M9, taken from an unlocked National Guard armory along with six automatic weapons, a grenade launcher, and four other M9s, was recovered by law enforcement in South Carolina in 2017 during a domestic dispute. In 2017, a box containing 32 40mm MK-19 grenade launcher rounds was stolen from an ammunition train while in transit. The box showed up eight months later in an Atlanta suburb tucked behind bushes at a private residence. Only 30 grenades remained in the box. The other two were never found . The AP also cites a theft at Fort Irwin in California in which 26 AK-74s were stolen a decade ago and keep turning up in the hands of gang members throughout the state. The Department of Defense (DOD) primarily procures these weapons from friendly third-party nations for use in Special Operations Command (SOCOM) familiarization training. The AP published a separate piece the same day as their larger missing weapons report which details how some of the military’s missing weapons stolen from the Lincoln Stoddard Army Reserve Center ended up being found “in a trash bag in a Bronx park near Yankee Stadium.” Some of the weapons were lost overseas, such as when a Navy SEAL lost his sidearm in Lebanon during a fight in a restaurant. 65 Beretta M9s were stolen and never recovered in Afghanistan when a padlock was cut off of a fence. Prior to 2017, the Pentagon was required to share annual data about stolen or lost weapons with Congress. That requirement lapsed, but some members of Congress want to restore it, especially in light of the AP’s report. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called the report “absolutely blood curdling” in a hearing with Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth held on June 15, the same day the report was published. Wormuth assured Blumenthal that the Army is taking the matter seriously and will look into it. Blumenthal repeatedly pressed Wormuth for an answer on whether or not the Army would commit to regularly reporting lost weapon data to Congress, to which Wormuth replied the Army “would be open to a reporting requirement.” According to a 2018 estimate published by the Small Arms Survey, the U.S. military possesses some 4.5 million firearms. Thus, while 2,060 can seem like a small number, the potential damge even one of these weapons could do in the wrong hands makes each one a serious case. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told the AP in an interview that “Though the numbers are small, one is too many,” adding that the military safely accounts for the overwhelming majority of its weapons each year. “We have a very large inventory of several million of these weapons,” Kirby told the AP. “We take this very seriously and we think we do a very good job. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t losses. It doesn’t mean that there aren’t mistakes made.” A U.S. Marine inspects a M16A4 rifle at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego., USMC/Sgt Robert Gavaldon The new report about the military’s missing weapons highlights the inherent dangers in storing weapons and other dangerous equipment close to civilian populations. Criminals can break into military bases as well as any other building if proper security measures aren’t in place. Furthermore, service members are human like anyone else, and aren’t infallible when it comes to having lapses in judgment leading to the theft or misuse of weapons. There is a reason for strict security protocols in place at military installations, and the AP’s investigation reveals there could be more security gaps at domestic military facilities than the Pentagon realizes. Above all, the AP’s latest report should be a call to action for Congress to reenact accountability measures that would require the Pentagon to regularly share data about missing weapons. It should not take a national tragedy for the government and the military to fix these problems, however statistically small they may seem. It’s important to also note that this recent data is only what we know so far, given that the Air Force did not report any data. Small arms have also been lost en masse on the battlefield or in combat areas, which could make the number of missing or lost weapons far larger if it is not included already in the data provided to the Associated Press . So it very well could be that the data in the AP’s report is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to lost or stolen weapons. At the very least, a complete data set over time would certainly help show just how serious the problem actually is.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 5, 2021",Dozens Of Chinese Warplanes Fly South Of Taiwan After Beijing Blasts Criticism From G7,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s military sent 28 aircraft into the southwestern corner of Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ, earlier today. This is the largest group of People’s Liberation Army warplanes to fly through that region since the Chinese began conducting these kinds of sorties on a near-daily basis in 2020. This show of force comes just a day after authorities in Beijing slammed a statement from the G7 group of industrialized nations, which includes the United States, that had called for, in part, a “peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.” In a statement, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) announced the incursions, which took place on June 15, 2021, and said that the amassed Chinese aircraft included 14 J-16 and 6 J-11 fighter jets , both derivatives of the Soviet-design Flanker, as well as four H-6 bombers , two KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, one electronic warfare variant of the Y-8 series, and another Y-8 type in an anti-submarine warfare configuration . This is eight more aircraft than the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had sent into this sector of the Taiwanese ADIZ on March 26 , which had previously been the most Chinese warplanes sent into the region in a single day since these flights became a routine occurrence last year. A stock photo of a Chinese KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, a type that was among those that flew south of Taiwan on June 15, 2021., Taiwan MND Taiwanese officials said that their responses to the PLA sorties included the scrambling of combat aircraft, the employment of air defense assets to further monitor the situation, and the issuing of warning messages to the Chinese aircraft via radio. This is the standard operating procedure in response to People’s Liberation Army (PLA) missions that enter the ADIZ. As has happened in the past , the fighter jets and bombers, as well as the electronic warfare Y-8, took routes that hooked around the eastern side of Taiwan. This underscores the PLA’s now increasingly well-established ability to launch aerial attacks on Taiwanese targets from multiple vectors simultaneously, presenting complications for defending forces on the island. In general, the appearance of more than two dozen Chinese military aircraft south of Taiwan reflects a steady escalation of tensions between authorities in Beijing and Taipei in recent years , with the former routinely issuing overt threats to use military force should officials on the island declare total independence from the mainland. The Chinese government views Taiwan as a rogue province and integral to its national territory. These latest sorties, however, follown outrage on the part of the Chinese government at a joint statement that leaders of the G7 nations issued on June 13 at the close of their latest meeting in Carbis Bay in Cornwall in the United Kingdom. In addition to the United States, the G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The leaders of the G7 nations, including U.S. President Joe Biden, in the first row, second from the left, pose for a picture during the group’s summit in Cornwall in June 2021., AP Photo/Patrick Semansky Among other things, the G7 statement called for the Chinese government to be more transparent about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and its global economic activities , as well as for it to show respect for human rights, particularly in Xinjiang, where it is pursuing genocidal policies against the Uighur ethnic minority, and in Hong Kong , which remains in the grips of a massive crackdown on pro-democracy politicians and activities. The joint communique also raised concerns about widely disputed Chinese territorial claims in the East China Sea and the South China Sea . “We reiterate the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo Pacific, which is inclusive and based on the rule of law,” the statement added. “We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.” Taiwanese officials welcomed the declarations from the G7 members, promising to be a “ force for good ” as the island’s government pursues greater direct engagement with the international community. Taiwan’s current President Tsai Ing Wen started her third term last year and pledged to pursue greater decoupling from the mainland, drawing the ire of Beijing, which has already previously described her as an “ independence extremist .” Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing Wen speaks at a ceremony marking the launch of a naval vessel in April 2021., AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying The Chinese Embassy in London itself responded with a harsh critique of the G7 communique. It said that its contents, as it applied to China, reflected the “sinister intentions of a few countries such as the United States.” “China’s internal affairs must not be interfered in, China’s reputation must not be slandered, and China’s interests must not be violated,” it added. “We will resolutely defend our national sovereignty, security, and development interests, and resolutely fight back against all kinds of injustices and infringements imposed on China.” It is important to note that the United States presently recognizes the government in Beijing as the sole legitimate authority in China. However, Washington reserves the right to engage directly with authorities in Taipei, including on military affairs, to include training exercises with Taiwanese forces and arms sales to the island’s military , until the final status of Taiwan is formally settled. In April, former Senator Chris Dodd and former Deputy Secretaries of State Richard Armitage and James Steinberg went to Taiwan at the request of President Joe Biden to send a “ personal signal ” about his administration’s commitment to the island, according to a White House official. Earlier this month, a Congressional delegation traveled there aboard a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft in another clear demonstration of America’s support for the government in Taipei. All told, it is hard not to see the latest Chinese aerial armada flying in the southwestern portion of Taiwan’s ADIZ as a tit-for-tat response, at least in part, to these American signals of support. This all also comes amid simmering concerns about the potential for a new cross-straight crisis , potentially one that involves some level of actual military conflict, in the near future. The PLA’s significant and still growing airpower capabilities , as demonstrated in the cross-strait sorties earlier today, together with its expanding naval prowess , would be significant factors in any such engagements. These new sorties, coupled with the response to the G7’s statement, make clear that the Chinese government, at least in the near term, has no plans to back down in regards to Taiwan, among other issues causing tension between it and the international community. How authorities in Taiwan or the United States will now respond to this new escalation remains to be seen.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Nov 17, 2021",The Army Lays Out Plans For Its New Intelligence Gathering Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has begun the next phase of its High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System, or HADES, which is intended to provide the mission payload for the service’s next-generation airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) system. The two contractors now bidding for part of the HADES requirement are L3Harris and Raytheon, with the long-term aim being to integrate one of their payloads on a new fixed-wing surveillance platform, for which a variety of options are under consideration. These fall into three fairly distinct categories: an airliner-sized adapted maritime patrol aircraft, one of a number of business jets, and a high-flying drone. The possible host aircraft for HADES comprise the Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, Gulfstream EC-37B Compass Call electronic attack aircraft, Bombardier E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) airborne communications platform, and finally a new version of the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk drone, with higher-altitude performance. The fact the Army is considering the RQ-4 is significant in itself since the Air Force is meanwhile trying to retire most of their young fleet of RQ-4s in favor of more survivable, penetrating alternatives . That could potentially release second-hand Global Hawk airframes to the Army, but they would not be able to meet the Army’s expanded ceiling expectation for an ‘enhanced’ RQ-4. Still, free airframes may be hard to pass up. The Air Force has selected the EC-37B to cross-deck its Compass Call weapon system from the older EC-130H. The EC-37B is now one option for the Army’s HADES platform., BAE Systems In an online announcement today , the U.S. Army Project Director for Sensors — Aerial Intelligence (PD SAI) confirmed that it had awarded contracts together worth around $4.37 million to the two companies, under Phase 1 of its Multi-Domain Sensing System (MDSS). This is an eight-month competitive effort to develop and build prototype electronic intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT) sensors for HADES. Once these payloads have been demonstrated, Phase 2 will see one or both of the companies selected to continue to develop the sensors and then optimize them for the chosen HADES platform. While the definitive HADES will carry additional sensors, too, the ELINT and COMINT components have been prioritized so far. In the meantime, the Army has already been using two adapted, contractor-owned and operated Bombardier Challenger 600/650 business jets to test some of the types of sensors that HADES will use. These testbeds are the Airborne Reconnaissance and Targeting Multi-Mission Intelligence System, or ARTEMIS , which have been deployed to both Europe and Japan in recent months. According to an official contracting notice , the ARTEMIS is intended to demonstrate “standoff operations to detect, locate, identify and track critical targets for the ground commander.” A modified contractor-owned and operated Bombardier Challenger 650 aircraft that the Army has been using to evaluate the ARTEMIS sensor package., U.S. ARMY “One of the things we saw, and we know that we’re concerned about with near-peer [adversaries], is we need to look at our sustainment, our ability to move around; so we did see one thing that came out the demonstrations is we can get to where we need to a lot faster,” Colonel James DeBoer, the Army’s project manager for fixed-wing aircraft, recently told Defense News of the ARTEMIS program. As well as ARTEMIS, another Army ISR trials platform is preparing to gather data for HADES, too. The Airborne Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare System, or ARES, is being installed on a Bombardier Global Express 6500 bizjet airframe by L3Harris Technologies. It will reportedly carry an alternative SIGINT package compared with the ARTEMIS. Concept artwork from L3Harris showing a notional manned airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and electronic warfare platform., L3Harris An aircraft platform for HADES will have been selected by the Army by the time Phase 3 begins, in which a “holistic COMINT/ELINT system” will be flight-tested ahead of a production decision. All three phases of the MDSS prototyping and test efforts are likely to be worth around $49 million, the Army says. “The Army is pursuing HADES to address the demands of future Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) against peer- and near-peer adversaries,” said Dennis Teefy, Project Director, PD SAI. “This follows the DoD MDO framework as described in the 2018 National Defense Strategy and in Army doctrine as described in The U.S. Army in Multi-Domain Operations (TRADOC PAM 525-3-1, Dec 2018).” Ultimately, HADES is intended to provide a successor to the venerable RC-12 Guardrail , as well as the more modern MC-12 Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS), both of which are based on the familiar Beechcraft King Air series of twin-turboprops. The RC-12X, in particular, has had serviceability issues, with the Army having to raid the Boneyard for the spares needed to keep them flying. MC-12 EMARSS., U.S. ARMY Teefy also mentioned the requirement to supersede the “EO-6C Airborne Reconnaissance Low (ARL) aircraft,” which seems to be a conflation of two different platforms: the EO-5C Airborne Reconnaissance Low (ARL) COMINT/ELINT aircraft that’s based on the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 four-turboprop regional airliner, and the more recent RO-6A Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced (ARL-E), which uses a Dash 8 twin-turboprop as its basis. Broadly speaking, these existing Army ISR platforms are optimized for counterinsurgency-type operations, but they are also found in Korea and in Europe. RO-6A ARL-E., U.S. ARMY The Army says it wants a successor to these aircraft that’s not only able to be deployed around the globe but which can gather intelligence at longer standoff ranges and from high altitude, increasing its field of regard and keeping it safer, at least from less-sophisticated air defenses. Tellingly, all the aircraft under consideration are jet-powered and would offer significantly higher operating ceilings than current Army ISR planes. However, the Global Hawk would have a huge advantage over a bizjet or airliner type, offering considerably greater line of sight from its high-altitude perch, which equates to more standoff range. An RQ-4 Global Hawk is prepared for a mission while deployed at an air base in Southwest Asia., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Andy M. Kin The service also wants a platform with greater endurance than its predecessors, allowing the aircraft to remain on station longer, or transit across greater distances, more rapidly. “The goal is to provide deep-sensing intelligence collection of indicators and warnings, electronic order of battle, and patterns of life for target development,” Teefy continued. “This will allow standoff operations to detect, locate, identify, and track critical targets for the ground commander.” The potential HADES platforms are also significantly larger than the Army’s current fixed-wing ISR planes and the options also parallel those that were in line for the Air Force’s now-canceled plan to replace the U.S. Air Force’s E-8C Joint STARS . While the MDSS is focused on ELINT and COMINT sensors, HADES has altogether bigger ambitions, including integration of a ground-surveillance radar with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with a ground-moving-target-indicator (GMTI) functions. Essentially, the result will be an aircraft that can also replicate the capabilities of the Air Force’s E-8C and the Cold War-era RC-135 intelligence-gathering plane. Furthermore, with no Air Force plans as yet for a direct SAR/GMTI-equipped successor to the E-8C, the Army, by taking this approach, is also fulling an important gap in the overall order of battle. On the other hand, the Air Force does plan on developing a distributed SAR/GMTI and likely has some more secretive ISR platforms in preparation, too. An Air Force E-8C Joint STARS operating from Edwards Air Force Base, California., Northrop Grumman Ultimately, a fully mature HADES system onboard its chosen platform should be able to pick out targets and then relay their coordinates to the Army’s new Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) batteries, for example, which would be able to engage them from standoff range. That scenario also signals a plan for much greater independence from the Air Force’s ISR assets, essentially allowing the Army to complete the sensor-to-shooter chain itself. A PRSM is fired on April 30, 2020, at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, before hitting a target over 50 miles away., Lockheed Martin PrSM itself promises to revolutionize the Army’s ability to strike targets at considerable distances, now that its specifications are no longer contained by the limits of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The first of these new missiles, which are being developed by Lockheed Martin, could enter service around 2023. As well as PrSM, there is clearly scope to have HADES find targets for a host of new long-range weapons the Army is developing, too, potentially including ground-launched SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles , as well as the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon , or LRHW. The ARTEMIS testbed has also recently been used to help spot for a classified loitering munition, something you can read about here . An artist’s conception of an LRHW being fired from a trailer-mounted launcher, with the components of a full firing battery seen in the background., LOCKHEED MARTIN While the types of aircraft platforms under consideration for HADES represent a significant advance into the fixed-wing realm for the Army, it’s also worth pointing out that they are otherwise fairly conventional solutions. They lack the low-observability characteristics to survive in highly contested airspace, so would need to operate from considerable standoff distances when confronted by the kinds of “peer- and near-peer adversaries” that they are intended to help defeat. Indeed, part of the reason for the Air Force deciding against a direct replacement for the E-8C was the concern that platforms of this kind will simply be too vulnerable in future. Notably, both China and Russia are developing very long-range air-to-air missiles expected to be optimized for high-value targets such as these. In addition, airborne ISR platforms will increasingly face sophisticated anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) networks before they even get to their operating areas. The current HADES effort also has clear parallels to an earlier Army program, the Aerial Common Sensor . This had broadly equivalent ambitions and also looked at some similar platforms, including the P-8A and bizjet airframes. The Army ultimately gave up on this initiative, shifting to the plan that led to its current interim fleet, which is made up to a significant degree of formerly contractor-owned platforms and Air Force castoffs. However, if all goes to plan, the timeline for HADES could see a fleet of “fewer than 10 business jet derivatives” put into service first, according to Aviation Week’s Steve Trimble, pending the introduction of “the full MDSS” in around 2035. Right now, there is no program of record to replace the RC-12 and the other fixed-wing Army ISR aircraft, but the MDSS initiative reiterates the fact that the service is serious about not only superseding these aging assets but also introducing new capabilities that were previously the preserve of the Air Force.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 12, 2021",Check Out The Anti-Drone Weapons Carried By Security At Biden’s Meeting In Brussels,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Images shared to social media show Belgian security forces wielding a combination of handheld anti-drone weapons to protect a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and King Philippe of Belgium held on Monday, June 14. Two different types of anti-drone systems were carried by members of the Belgian Federal Police , one which fires a net projectile at drones, and another that uses radiofrequency (RF) jamming to disrupt links between drones and their operators. The deployment of these two systems together is a reminder of how serious the threat of drone attacks or even assassination attempts on high-value targets is worldwide. The meeting between Biden and King Philippe saw the two discuss issues including the coronavirus pandemic, as well as relations between the European Union (EU) and the United States. President Biden arrived in the Belgian capital of Brussels for a summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) hosted by the NATO Secretary. The summit in Brussels marks the 31st formal meeting of the heads of state of participating NATO nations and was held to discuss “the challenges of today and tomorrow” including: increased Russian aggression and threats posed by cyber attacks, terrorism, and emerging and disruptive technologies. Climate change and “the rise of China” were also on the docket. Belgian Federal Police carrying a kinetic anti-drone weapon., Associated Press/Patrick Semansky One of the weapons seen being wielded by Belgian Federal Police at Biden’s meeting with King Philippe appears to be the DroneGun Tactical made by Australian firm DroneShield. DroneShield claims the DroneGun Tactical can cause drones to “respond via vertical on the spot landing or return to its remote controller or starting point” when successfully disrupted by its multi-band radiofrequency (RF) jamming attack. These types of anti-drone weapons work by severing the command and control links between drones and their operators, and DroneShield claims the DroneGun Tactical can instantly cease video transmission between them. These types of jammers don’t work against autonomous systems which do not rely upon RF links with human controllers, although those systems are far less flexible and are usually only capable of targeting fixed points, not fluid targets that are often in motion. The DroneGun Tactical jammer runs on a rechargeable 14.4V lithium ion-battery and weighs 16lbs when loaded with two battery packs. The weapon is described as having a “robust rifle-style design” and even features Picatinny rails for mounting scopes or other gear. DroneShield lists the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Intelligence Community among its customers. A U.S. Marine assigned to Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force using an anti-drone jamming weapon., USMC/Gunnery Sgt. Melissa Marnell The other weapon seen carried by the Belgian Federal Police appears to be a Skywall Patrol made by UK-based OpenWorks Engineering . OpenWorks describe the gun as a “handheld drone capture system” that uses compressed air to fire nets or a combination net-and-parachute round at hostile drones. OpenWorks states that the Skywall is a more effective solution to bring down drones than other kinetic solutions because “Conventional weapons often fail to incapacitate a drone and do not offer a proportionate response to the drone threat.” Further, the company writes, conventional weapons “can also escalate a situation when used in the vicinity of large crowds.” In a defense urban environment outside of an actual conflict environment, using any sort of traditional firearms or munitions presents significant hazards to bystanders. In addition, jammers such as the DroneGun Tactical or other anti-drone systems that use high-power microwaves have limitations when used in urban environments, as they could potentially disrupt civilian communications networks or other electronics. The net and net/parachute rounds fired by Skywall are claimed to be reusable, but it’s unclear how many rounds each unit can carry or how quickly it can be reloaded, making it unknown how well the system would be against multiple drones or a drone swarm. Belgian Federal Police wielding the Skywall anti-drone system, Associated Press/Patrick Semansky Drones have previously been used in the past in assassination attempts on world leaders, as was the case in 2018 when a drone exploded in the air above disputed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as he gave a speech in front of a large crowd. A stampede ensued, leaving seven Venezuelan National Guardsmen injured. It’s possible that this kind of panic could very well be as destructive or more destructive than an initial drone attack itself. In addition, small, off-the shelf drones are already being armed with small explosives and used to assassinate enemies of drug cartels in Central America. Multi-layered drone defenses have been tested by DARPA recently, who recently demonstrated a vehicle-mounted system that can rapidly deploy a combination of high-power microwave and kinetic capture weapons designed to disable drones without destroying them outright. By bringing these drones to the ground intact, these systems allow investigators to forensically examine hostile drones and potentially identify their origin or better assess the risks they pose, enabling the development of more precise countermeasures to defeat them. It’s important to note that the particular mix of net projectiles and jammers seen in Brussels are really only useful against low-density, very low-end threats, such as a single quadcopter, and would not be highly effective against a drone swarm or against more advanced types of unmanned aerial vehicles, including small fixed wing types that travel at greater speeds and can be autonomous in nature. It’s also worth mentioning we don’t know what other anti-drone systems may have been providing cover for the meeting. Nevertheless, the combination of the two weapons seen carried by Belgian Federal Police in Brussels makes for something of a very low-end layered drone defense of sorts, one that could quickly respond to simple threats while remaining portable enough to be used by roving security details. In the future, far more advanced defenses—likely including RF jamming, kinetic systems, and directed energy weapons—will need to be layered into the equation to adequately defend against rapidly proliferating far more capable drones that would be employed en-masse during an attack.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 12, 2021",The Navy Is Developing “Bio-Inspired” Drones That Transition Between Air And Water,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy appears to be taking a cue from mother nature by seeking to develop “bio-inspired autonomous systems” that mimic or leverage characteristics of the natural world to accomplish Navy missions. Specifically, the U.S. Navy’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget requests contain close to $30 million for developing “Biocentric” or “Bio-Inspired” technologies such as unmanned underwater vehicles that can move, school, blend in with their surroundings, and sense their environments in ways similar to the living creatures that inhabit the seas. Most notably, the research outlined in the Navy’s budget documentation includes highly ambitious plans to develop bio-inspired autonomous vehicles that can operate both in air and underwater, and transition seamlessly between the two. The Navy’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 Budget , released on May 28, 2021, contains two line items in the Navy’s Research, Development, Test & Evaluation justification book related to the research and development of these systems specifically. Two program elements within the Navy’s budget, Defense Research Sciences and Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research, requested $9.45 million and $15.99 million, respectively, for line items titled “Bio-Inspired Autonomous Systems” and “Bio-Inspired Autonomous Systems and Soft Robotics.” For FY2022, the Navy’s budget request for Biocentric Technologies, housed within the “Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research” program element, totals $9.45 million. Within that, the “Bio-Inspired Autonomous Systems” line item outlines more specific goals of that request for 2022, including plans to: – Conduct applied research on bio-inspired underwater vehicle propulsion and control. – Mature advanced search behaviors for autonomous vehicles. – Integrate sonar and image processing into a bio-inspired unmanned vehicle to evaluate obstacle detection and avoidance in congested spaces and neutralization maneuvers. One of the most eyebrow-raising goals for the Navy’s FY2022 investment into this unique class of vehicles is to conduct “applied research on bio-inspired cross-domain vehicles for amphibious and sea/air transitions.” Concepts for submersible aircraft capable of operating in both air and water have been looked into by the Navy in the past, but without the emphasis on bio-inspired designs and unmanned technologies, specifically. An image from a 2018 U.S. Navy patent for a swordfish-shaped, soft-bodied unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV)., USPTO Other plans for the Navy’s Biocentric Technologies research are concerned with materials research, microbial electrochemical systems for waste-to-energy conversion, and sensor development. These include conducting applied research on bio-inspired underwater navigation, control, and “advanced search behaviors.” Some of that work involves integrating sonar systems “into a bio-inspired unmanned vehicle to evaluate obstacle detection and avoidance in congested spaces” and conducting applied research to “develop and evaluate lateral line based intelligent sensing and control.” Lateral lines are a sensory system found in marine vertebrates like fish that enables them to sense movement or vibrations in the water around them, providing spatial awareness. DOD In addition to the elements cited above, the Navy’s Defense Research Sciences program element requested $15.9 million for its Medical and Biological Sciences research for FY2022. That research specifically outlines “research on bio-inspired mechanisms to develop multi-spectral camouflage technologies,” developing “experimental sensing capabilities and modeling for bio-sensing to enable sensorimotor control including fish schooling for passive swarm coordination in underwater vehicles,” and the “exploration of bio-inspired locomotion from amphibious animals to enable technologies for amphibious and cross-domain vehicles.” DOD In addition, the program includes the “Bio-Inspired Autonomous Systems and Soft Robotics” line item that mentions developing “high-lift, stealthy propulsion without propellers and achieve high maneuverability for underwater vehicles,” among other goals. This sounds a lot like wing-like locomotion as found on birds. DOD The Navy’s FY2022 budget request also contains a Congressional addition of $3 million for bio-inspired engineering, including soft robotics, modes of animal-like propulsion including “fin-based swimming, flapping flight and legged locomotion,” and nature-inspired sensor systems. DOD The Office of Naval Research (ONR) describes the scope of their Bio-Inspired Autonomous Systems research on the program’s website , writing that the overall purpose is to “expand the operational envelope” of the U.S. Navy: The aim of Bio-Inspired Autonomous Systems is to extract principles of sensorimotor control, biomechanics and fluid dynamics of underwater propulsion and control in aquatic and amphibious animals that underlie the agility, stealth, efficiency and sensory adaptations of these animals. The principles that emerge from this interdisciplinary research are formalized and explored in advanced prototypes. The goal of this program is to expand the operational envelope of Navy underwater and amphibious vehicles and enable enhanced underwater manipulation. A Naval Research and Development Framework document from 2020 mentioned research projects that included such bio-inspired topics as Biologically Inspired Sensors and Autonomous Systems, Novel Autonomous Platforms, Synthetic Biological Sentinel Organisms and Circuit Designs, and more. Many different bio-inspired designs have been pursued by the DOD and the Navy, specifically, for some time. In 2014, ONR demonstrated its GhostSwimmer project which sought to develop a UUV that propelled itself like a fish and could operate at depths ranging from 10 inches to 300 feet. The GhostSwimmer could reportedly operate in both tethered, with a man in the loop, and independent/autonomous modes: The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has previously looked at developing a UUV shaped like a fish, called WANDA , for chemical signature detection in shallow waters. The NRL has also attempted to develop “bio-inspired cross-domain vehicles” capable of sea/air transitions with the so-called “Flimmer” vehicles which could fly through the air as well as “swim” below the waves: Hints of the Navy’s more recent bio-inspired ambitions may be able to be seen in patent documentation. In 2018, the U.S. Navy was granted a patent for an “Acoustically stealthy soft-bodied UUV propulsion system,” applied for by an oceanographer at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. In images accompanying the patent application, the UUV is depicted much like a swordfish, and the propulsion system is described as having a spine-like “central chord member” in addition to “a series of successive muscle layers each having a skeletal mechanism and a set of actuators.” USPTO DARPA and ONR have even researched small “underwater walking machines” that resemble lobsters and can crawl along the bottoms of bodies of water. The bio-inspired “passive swarm coordination in underwater vehicles” research being conducted by the Navy also demonstrates just how central swarming technologies will soon be below the waves in addition to in the skies . “Schools” of small UUVs that behave like schools of fish would represent a revolutionary new capability for clandestine underwater operations, particularly in distributed sensing. While marine animals such as whales and dolphins have been employed to varying degrees of success by naval forces in the past, the Navy’s focus on blending nature with technology represents a new way to leverage the natural world for use in military operations. This Bio-Inspired Autonomous Systems research demonstrates the Navy’s increasing focus on developing unmanned underwater systems designed to be more difficult to observe by the growing underwater sensor networks in contested waters . Such systems could be aimed at deployment in areas such as the Arctic and the South China Sea , which have become flashpoints for territorial disputes, naval power projection competition , and general geopolitical friction . Deploying UUVs that better blend in with marine life could be a way to emplace sensors and other systems without attracting too much attention. After all, the underwater sensors of today are far more sophisticated than in years past, meaning engineers have to work that much harder to develop vehicles that can slip past enemy sensor networks undetected. Bio-inspired designs that could be mistaken for the real thing could offer a way of reducing the potential for detection when carrying out a wide variety of other roles beyond emplacing sensors, however, especially with the transmedium component of being able to transition from sea to air or vice versa. Such a system could provide a number of surveillance functions or otherwise carry out attacks, both kinetic and non-kinetic . The aerial component is very interesting as it could allow for the system to self-deploy over the horizon before using the safety of the water to infiltrate deeper into a target area where it could carry out its core mission. It could also briefly take to the air again once at the target area to collect key data or to prosecute an attack, before diving back into the water to exfiltrate the immediate target area. It could then fly to a recovery area once a safe distance away. Couple such a capability with the inherent benefits swarms offer, resilancy and or the ability to carry out more than one mission set at once across a broad area, and its clear to see why the Navy is turning to mother nature for inspiration. What remains unknown is just exactly what the Navy’s “bio-inspired cross-domain vehicles for amphibious and sea/air transitions” would look like when developed. While previous designs like the NRL’s “Flimmer” drone was designed to make air/sea transitions and were inspired by the diving behaviors of seabirds, the increased focus on specifically “bio-inspired” locomotion and “high-lift, stealthy propulsion without propellers” in the Navy’s latest budget request make it sound as if a radical departure in vehicle design could soon be on the way.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A pair of F-22 Raptors were launched on an alert scramble out of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on Sunday at around 4:00 PM local time. A third F-22 joined the mission about an hour after pair’s departure. A KC-135 was also launched to support the fighters. Hawaii News Now reports that the scramble, described as an “irregular patrol,” was initiated at the request of the Federal Aviation Administration, which reported an ‘incident,’ although nobody is providing any clear information in regards to what that catalyst for the prolonged scramble mission was. The 199th Fighter Squadron, a Hawaii Air National Guard unit that is part of the 154th Wing based at Hickam Air Force Base, provides the alert capability for the state, with at least two jets equipped with full armament and wing tanks are always on standby to scramble, along with at least one spare. F-22 tearing out of Hickam Air Force Base. , USAF Scrambling on request of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not uncommon. It happens for things like potential security situations aboard airliners or to provide eyes-on to stricken aircraft or even to investigate unidentified aircraft. You can hear just what this process is like in this past special feature of ours . Hawaii’s F-22s are also tasked with intercepting unknown or potentially threatening aircraft approaching the air defense identification zone (ADIZ) that surrounds the islands. FAA What’s odd here is that usually there is fairly straightforward messaging regarding these events. Even when Russian bombers, fighters, and surveillance aircraft approach U.S. shores , the U.S. military is usually open about the encounters. As to why this intercept is not being addressed clearly is somewhat puzzling, but there could be national security issues involved that make issuing an immediate and detailed response problematic. This is likely the case based on a cryptic statement that The Star Advisor obtained : The Hickam-based Air Force command added that the FAA requested that U.S. Indo-Pacific Command “conduct an irregular air patrol and the situation resolved, prompting the fighters and a KC-135 Stratotanker (a refueling plane) to return to base. We cannot discuss further specifics of the situation.” Hawaii-based F-22s off a KC-135’s wing., USAF Clearly, due to the strategic nature of the Hawaii and the stretches of water that surround it, it means that it is of high interest of foreign adversaries that have a presence in the Pacific. Still, its remote location make even long-range patrols a significant operation.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 10, 2020",Special Ops MH-47 Chinooks Can Use These Fuel Dump Pipes To Help Climb Over Mountains,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Photos of the highly modified MH-47 Chinooks of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , or 160th SOAR, the famous Night Stalkers , are almost always worthy of attention. These highly-capable aircraft are frequently noted with different modifications cropping up around their airframes, some of them more mysterious than others . Some recent imagery of 160th SOAR MH-47s released by the U.S. Department of Defense brings to light one little-known feature of the U.S. Army’s extensively customized Chinooks — pipes for safely dumping fuel in flight. The pipes are visible in some of the shots, protruding prominently from the rear of the huge sponsons fitted on each side of MH-47’s fuselage, which are enlarged compared to the ones on standard Chinook and that contain additional fuel within Nomex honeycomb cells. These tubes are deployed using a pneumatic extension mechanism and are generally not seen, perhaps simply because they are retracted or possibly because they might not always be fitted. That is certainly true for the characteristic inflight refueling probe on the front of the helicopter, which is not a permanent fixture, but is often installed on these helicopters. A U.S. Army MH-47G from the 160th SOAR lands on the flight deck of the Expeditionary Sea Base USS Hershel “Woody” Williams in the Atlantic Ocean, June 12, 2021 as part of African Lion 2021., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Eric Coffer Fuel dumping is, of course, a familiar part of fixed-wing aircraft operations, both military and civilian, and is used to jettison the volatile liquid to lighten the aircraft for landing, or in various different emergency situations. Look closely around the rear end of a range of military aircraft and you may well see a fuel dump pipe and some types have even used the jettison function together with afterburner to create crowd-pleasing pyrotechnics . A fuel jettison pipe on a helicopter, however, is far less common. The main reason for this is that, taking off vertically, if a helicopter loaded with fuel can lift itself into the air, it can very likely touch down again with a similar load, even if very little fuel has been burnt. The exception could conceivably be a helicopter rolling takeoff , where forward speed provides additional lift and can allow liftoff at higher weights. However, in that scenario, a heavily loaded helicopter could also get back to the ground safely using a rolling landing. In the case of the MH-47, however, the situation is a little different. These helicopters are already renowned for their high-altitude capabilities and this is combined with the ability to take on more fuel in flight — at least, when the telescopic refueling probe is fitted. Operating at high altitude, where the rotors generate less lift in the thinner air, is a perennial challenge for helicopters, even those with the power of an MH-47. With this in mind, there is sometimes very good reason for the crew to want to lighten the fuel load. Soldiers assigned to the 160th SOAR and 19th Special Forces Group land and load an MH-47 in Tifnit Training Area, Morocco, June 8, 2021. The fuel dump pipe is just visible at the rear of the right sponson., U.S. Army/Spc. Brendan Nunez Illustrating this point well is a passage from Weapon of Choice: U.S. Army Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan , an officially approved account of Army Special Operations soldiers and their actions in that conflict. Flying below 200 feet above ground level (AGL), “nap-of-the-earth” (NOE) ingress and egress routes, and wearing NVG in zero/zero conditions for those long hours placed tremendous stress on the MH-47E pilots. To minimize the effectiveness of the enemy AAA (guns and missiles) in the high mountains, the MH-47E pilots flew extremely narrow corridors between the mountains, which reduced left and right limits of error to 200 meters, causing the airmen to refer to the flight route as the “line of death.” Larger-capacity portable oxygen systems were required for aircrews flying higher and longer than ever before. The variable weather conditions in and around the high mountains further complicated flying. The seldom-used fuel dumping capability enabled the MH-47Es to carry more weight and still clear the initial barrier of K2 mountain ranges, but it meant another aerial refuel before entering Afghanistan. So, to clear some of the bigger mountains in the areas where they operated in Afghanistan, MH-47s would jettison fuel, lightening their loads to improve high-altitude performance. Once on the other side of the mountain, they would top up from an MC-130 tanker, allowing the choppers to continue their long-range mission. Joint coalition security forces board an MH-47 during an operation to capture a Taliban commander January 18, 2014, in Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province, Afghanistan., U.S. Army/Spc. Michael G. Herrero With that in mind, it’s possible that these fuel jettison pipes are only seen deployed on MH-47s when it’s known they are being called upon to fly at high altitudes. That seems logical and there actually might only be a few other scenarios when they would be required. Indeed, the recently released photos showing the MH-47s with the pipes visible were taken during the African Lion 2021 drills, which are still ongoing now in Morocco, Tunisia, and Senegal. North Africa’s highest mountain range, the Atlas Mountains, includes stretches in Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Algeria. The pipes are prominent in this rear view of an MH-47 at in Tifnit Training Area, Morocco., U.S. Army/Spc. Rhianna Ballenger U.S. Army/Spc. Rhianna Ballenger As for dumping fuel in emergency situations, if the Chinook were to lose an engine, for example, while carrying a heavy load, its crew could likely perform a running landing safely enough before losing too much power. The exception would be if there’s no room for a running landing — such as a when touching down on a pad on a ship. This brings us, suitably, to another sequence of photos that show some of these special operations Chinooks with fuel jettison pipes flying from the deck of the Expeditionary Sea Base USS Hershel “Woody” Williams , in the Atlantic during the same exercise. The Williams is the second of these Expeditionary Sea Base ships and is assigned to U.S. Africa Command , or AFRICOM. The vessels have a flight deck with four helicopter spots as well as a reconfigurable mission deck that can be used to launch small craft and unmanned vehicles. In the past, we’ve also seen Chinooks with standard sponsons and not fitted with the fuel dump pipes on Williams ’ sister ship USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB-3), too, so they don’t seem to be a prerequisite of these types of operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 6, 2020",S-400 SAMs Knocked Out In Simulated Strikes During Big Army-Led Exercise In Africa,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Simulated strikes on a pair of Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries were part of the still ongoing U.S. Army-led Africa Lion 2021 exercise that is taking place in various countries in North and West Africa. This comes as the Russian government continues to actively market export variants of the S-400, even to smaller countries , and amid persistent concerns within the U.S. military about the general increasing proliferation of higher-end air defense assets. The inclusion of these threats in African Lion 2021’s training scenarios is also notable given that there were indications last year that the Kremlin had introduced S-400 or S-300 systems into the civil conflict in Libya, though U.S. Africa Command later said it had assessed that no such deployment had occurred. Twitter user @kmldial70 was among the first to notice the mention of the mock strikes on the S-400s in footage that the U.S. Army’s Southern European Task Force-Africa (SETAF-AF) recently released of a Command Post Exercise (CPX) being run at a facility in Agadir, Morocco, as part of the larger African Lion 2021 event , on June 9, 2020. A CPX is typically an entirely simulated wargame. African Lion 2021 kicked off on June 7, 2021, and is set to wrap up on June 18. Components of a Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system., Sputnik / Dmitriy Vinogradov “Two strikes were conducted against those two S-400s,” an individual is heard saying in English at one point in the video, seen above, which is made up of a number of disjointedly edited-together clips, during what appears to be a briefing on new developments as part of the scenario. “We are still awaiting battle damage assessments [BDA] from yesterday’s strike.” SETAF-AF, which is the Army’s main Africa-focused component and is based in Italy, is leading African Lion 2021. The Army announced last year that it would merge U.S. Army Africa (USARAF) with U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) to form a consolidated command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa, to oversee Army operations in and around both continents last year. It’s unclear what assets the CPX participants employed to carry out these simulated strikes. AFRICOM has said that unspecified U.S. and Moroccan fighter jets, as well as American bombers, have or will take part in other portions of African Lion 2021, as they have in other iterations of this exercise . At least one B-52H bomber flew a training mission to West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea from Moron Air Base in Spain on June 9, but it’s not clear if this was related to African Lion 2021. A B-52H bomber takes off from Moron Air Base in Spain for a mission over the Gulf of Guinea., USAF In addition, Morocco flies advanced Block 52+ F-16C/D Viper fighter jets that could be employed in the suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, missions sets commonly abbreviated as SEAD and DEAD, respectively. In 2018, there were reports that the country was looking to acquire AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missiles (AARGM) to bolster the ability of F-16s to carry out these missions. High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), which are capable of firing short-range ballistic missiles , in addition to 227mm artillery rockets , have also taken part in other segments of the exercise. In addition to the specific mention of S-400s, it is also interesting to note that the simulated strikes were conducted in a fictitious country created for the exercise called Rowand. A map that is visible at one point in the video from the CPX shows Rowand, as well as its equally fictional neighbor Nehone, situated in areas of Northeastern Algeria. It is not clear if Algerian forces are taking part in African Lion 2021 in any way. Algeria’s real-life neighbor Tunisia is participating in the exercise and was set to host a CPX, as well as small unit tactical training, according to an official Africa Command (AFRICOM) press release sent out on June 7. The annual African Lion exercise started as a bilateral training engagement between the U.S. military and its Moroccan counterparts, but has since evolved into a regional event . This year’s iteration also includes various training in Morocco, as well as Senegal, in addition to Tunisia. Ghana, where AFRICOM established a logistics hub in 2019 , is supporting the exercise , a well. A number of other countries in and outside of North and West Africa are also actively taking part in the training or have sent observers. There is also no indication that the scenario actually reflects strikes on Algeria, which has been an important partner of the United States in combating regional terrorist groups, in any potential future conflict, either. Though there have been persistent rumors that the Algerian military has fielded S-400s , there is no clear evidence to substantiate those claims. Algeria did receive S-300PMU-2 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia starting in 2010, and at least one picture that some have suggested shows transport-erector-launchers (TEL) associated with Algerian S-400s appears to actually be of these earlier acquisitions. A number of configurations of the S-400 system, originally known as S-300PMU-3, use variants of the same TELs employed with the older S-300PMU-2. Transporter-erector-launchers associated with Algeria’s S-300PMU-2 systems, which have been misidentified as being related to purported S-400 systems in the past., Jack Glodel via Wikimedia At the same time, within the general context of African Lion 2021, as well as with regards to Tunisia, specifically, it is worth remembering that Tunisia also borders Libya to the east. In August 2020, pictures emerged on social media that purported to show the deployment of S-300 or S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to that country. The appearance of those images came amid a surge in fighting, and an expanding air war , between the U.N.-recognized and primarily Turkish-backed Government of National According (GNA) and the Libyan National Army (LNA), which has received support from Russia , among other foreign powers. In September 2020, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Heidi Berg, AFRICOM’s top intelligence officer, told reporters that the command did not believe S-300s or S-400s had been deployed in Libya, but that it believed Russia was interested in doing so. Earlier in the year, the Kremlin had sent MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-24 Fencer combat jets, along with Pantsir-S1 point air defense systems and other weapons and military equipment, to bolster the LNA forces. Russian mercenaries from a company called Wagner , which has strong ties to Russia’s intelligence services and that has been involved in the conflict in Libya for years now, are believed to be primarily responsible for flying the aircraft and operating the Pantsirs. The LNA recently released a video, seen below, that was clearly meant to show that its own pilots have been the ones at the controls of the Russian-supplied jets. In October 2020, the GNA and LNA agreed to a new ceasefire deal , which included provisions for future talks on finally bringing the country’s civil conflict to an end for good. However, this peace is fragile as the LNA, and its leader Khalifa Haftar, continues to operate a parallel government to that of the GNA and maintains its significant independent military capabilities. The next round of GNA-LNA talks is scheduled to take place in Germany later this month and will reportedly focus on the matter of foreign troops and mercenaries, which have been fighting on both sides, as well as nation-wide elections planned for December. The matter of the proliferation of the S-400 system is hardly limited to Northwest Africa, either. The presence of Russia’s own S-400s in Syria and the Crimean Peninsula , the latter of which the Kremlin seized from Ukraine in 2014, among other regions , have become major security considerations, generally. With that in mind, it’s worth pointing out that AFRICOM has said that the 2021 iteration of African Lion is now tied in directly with U.S. European Command’s (EUCOM) Defender-series exercises. The first Defender-Europe exercise took place in 2020 as a new, over-arching training event that would link together multiple smaller regularly-held exercises and was focused on strengthening U.S. military cooperation with NATO allies and other partners in Europe with a clear, if unstated focus on deterring Russia aggression . Though the timing was incidental, this year’s iteration of Defender-Europe followed a particularly worrisome Russian troop buildup along that country’s borders with Ukraine. The Kremlin has also been pushing for export sales of the S-400 to a number of other countries, especially in the Middle East , including Iran , in recent years. The Russian government has sold S-400s to China , India , and Belarus, among others, too. https://youtube.com/watch?v=TDIKBxoteOw In 2017, Russia notably secured a sale of these surface-to-air missile systems to Turkey, a NATO member, as well, which touched off a major spat between authorities in Ankara and those elsewhere across the Alliance, especially in the United States. Operational security concerns stemming from this purchase ultimately led to Turkey’s expulsion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. The S-400 and S-300 are not the only longer-range surface-to-air missile systems on the international market, either. For example, China offers the FD-2000 , an export variant of its HQ-9, itself an S-300 analogue. Before signing the S-400 deal with Russia, Turkey had also planned to buy FD-2000s , before canceling that order in the face of pressure from the United States. The increasing proliferation of these kinds of longer-range air defense capabilities, as well as of more modern short and medium-range surface-to-air missile systems, can add complications for the U.S. military, among others, when planning future missions, even in historically lower-risk environments in support of more limited operations . All told, this CPX conducted as part of African Lion 2021 certainly seems to underscore general concerns about the expanding availability of S-400s and similar-long-range surface-to-air missile systems now available on the export market.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 25, 2021",Space Force Got A Satellite Into Orbit In Just Four Months,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States Space Force (USSF) launched a Northrop Grumman Pegasus XL rocket carrying a satellite from the L-1011 Stargazer carrier aircraft over the weekend, marking a milestone in terms of how rapidly the United States can develop and launch a satellite. The entire design, integration, and testing phase of the Tactically Responsive Launch-2 (TacRL-2) vehicle carrying the satellite took just four months, less than a fifth of the time the launch process usually takes. Being able to put satellites in orbit with such a short development cycle represents a radical new capability for the Space Force and the Department of Defense (DOD) as a whole. In the Pegasus Payload User Guide , Northrop Grumman writes that “the procurement, analysis, integration, and test activities associated with the Pegasus launch of a payload typically occur over a 24- to 30-month baseline mission cycle.” For this most recent launch, however, that mission cycle was under four months. “This Pegasus launch was a clear demonstration of our team’s ability to provide rapid and responsive operational needs,” said Northrop Grumman’s vice president of launch vehicles, Rich Straka. “Our team was able to execute the design, integration and testing of the TacRL-2 launch vehicle in less than four months from contract award.” U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) issued a statement the day after the launch, adding that one of the goals of the TacRL-2 mission was to simulate the “rapid reconstitution” of space capabilities to ensure there would be no gap in space-based missile detection and warning in the event of a satellite being damaged or rendered inoperable. “During conflict, the ability to rapidly reconstitute degraded systems within hours forces adversaries to rethink the economic benefit of attacking on-orbit assets,” said U.S. Army Gen. James Dickinson, commander of USSPACECOM. USSF The exact details of the integrated Space Domain Awareness satellite, nicknamed “Odyssey,” remain undisclosed, but the USSF reports that the satellite was built and operated by the Air Force Research Laboratory and Space Dynamics Laboratory. The Pegasus XL rocket carrying the TacRL-2 payload including the Odyssey satellite up to orbit over the weekend was flown to its launch position aboard Northrop Grumman’s heavily modified Stargazer aircraft, the only Lockheed L-1011 Tristar still flying today. The Stargazer frequently launches experimental or secret payloads and typically operates out of the Mojave Air and Space Port. The Stargazer and its payload departed Vandenberg Space Force Base on Sunday, June 13, with launching taking place at 4:11 a.m. EDT. Navigational warnings for its launch window were issued just days before: In a Space Force statement , USSF Chief of Space Operations Gen. John W. “Jay” Raymond, said the Space Force’s “call-up” of the satellite took place on an even shorter timeline after the TacRL-2 payload had been designed and tested: The space domain is defined by speed. And with this effort, we demonstrated the kind of speed it will take to win. We executed a ‘21-day call-up’ to get a satellite on orbit – pulling the payload, mating it with the rocket and integrating the combined package onto the aircraft. Agile, responsive capability development, combined with our ability to rapidly launch and insert capabilities into space where we want, when we want, will deny our competitors the perceived benefits of beginning a conflict in, or extending a conflict to, space. The most recent Space Force launch was part of its “Tactically Responsive Launch” program, defined by the USSF as “the first step toward the USSF acquiring a tactical space mobility and logistics capability to support combatant command’s future requirements for tactical spacepower.” The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) recently stood up the “ Space Safari Program Office ” in order to “respond to high priority needs to deploy space systems quickly to respond to emerging threats.” “Where most space vehicles take years to deliver, and launches are similarly planned years in advance, this ability to quickly integrate and launch will result in greatly enhanced capabilities for America’s Space Force,” said SMC Director of Special Programs Col. Dennis Bythewood about the Space Safari Program Office. Stargazer, flying for Orbital Sciences at the time, taking off carrying an X-34 suborbital reusable-rocket technology demonstrator in 1999. , NASA Rapid air launches such as the TacRL-2 mission have become an increasing part of the U.S. military’s space strategy in recent years. In 2019, the U.S. Air Force conducted its first ever satellite launch from Guam using Virgin Orbit’s Cosmic Girl, a modified Boeing 747 mothership , in support of the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative (RALI) which also explored rapid and responsive space access concepts. Even reusable space planes have been eyed for placing small satellites into orbit quickly. These types of launches could enable the insertion of payloads into orbit quickly and unpredictably , or, more importantly, enable the rapidly replacement of satellites that are lost or disabled during a time of war. As global superpowers jockey for dominance of the space domain, constellations of rapidly replaceable or reconfigurable satellites will be key to maintaining the space-based capabilities the U.S. military increasingly depends on during a time of war. DOD leaders have even suggested that a “ show of force ” in space may be needed to deter our adversaries, and it may be that launches such as the TacRL-2 are intended to demonstrate just how rapidly the US can put satellites in orbit, making hostile nations wary of wasting resources on anti-satellite operations. Compressing this timeline even further is most certainly another goal of the Tactically Responsive Launch program and other similar initiatives. These types of public launches taking place on proven system such as the combination of Stargazer and Pegasus XL are just tip of the iceberg when it comes to rapid launch concepts, and there are almost certainly other space access programs underway in the classified realm, as well. What is clear, however, is that the Space Force and the DOD have made rapid space access a major priority moving forward, as demonstrated by the incredibly short timeline of the recent TacRL-2 mission.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 22, 2020",Canadian Submarine Bedeviled By Accidents For A Decade Is Finally Back In The Water,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Canadian Navy’s Victoria class diesel-electric submarine HMCS Corner Brook has returned to the water, following a troubled overhaul that began back in 2014 and was interrupted by an onboard fire. The boat has not been to sea for even longer, however, since it was effectively put out of commission after hitting the seabed off Vancouver Island in the Pacific Ocean back in 2011. The Royal Canadian Navy, or RCN, announced yesterday that Corner Brook had begun the undocking process at Esquimalt Graving Dock (EGD), when it was loaded onto the lift barge Seaspan Careen over several hours. The barge then moved the sub to Ogden Point. Here, the submarine was gradually lowered into the water. It will then be moved to Her Majesty’s Canadian Dockyard at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and fueled in advance of in-harbor acceptance trials, after which it should finally go back to sea. HMCS Corner Brook is maneuvered onto the lift barge for the journey to Her Majesty’s Canadian Dockyard., Royal Canadian Navy The RCN described it as a “significant milestone for Canada’s Submarine Force” and “also a noteworthy step towards the goal of having three of four submarines back in operations across the east and west coast in the near future.” Preparations for the undocking of Corner Brook began on June 10 after Babcock Canada completed its Extended Docking Work Period (EDWP) at EGD. The path to getting Corner Brook back into service — which has still not happened yet — has been a tortuous one and has become emblematic of the problems that the four-boat Victoria class has faced. HMCS Corner Brook transported on the lift barge Seaspan Careen ., Royal Canadian Navy The submarines were acquired from the United Kingdom after the British Royal Navy phased out conventionally-powered boats in favor of an all-nuclear sub-surface fleet in the 1990s. The four ex- Upholder class submarines arrived in Canada between 2000 and 2004. After spending $427 million on an eight-year lease, the boats were officially sold for exactly one British pound and another $98 million was invested in overhauls and refits. Their subsequent service in RCN hands, where they were renamed as members of the Victoria class, has been anything but straightforward, however. Corner Brook ’s particular misfortune really began with the aforementioned accident off Vancouver Island in 2011, which was officially blamed on human error. At the time there were concerns that damage to the submarine’s pressure hull might mean it would have to be scrapped, but repairs were subsequently authorized and work began in 2014. HMCS Corner Brook pulls into Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, for a 2009 port visit., U.S. NAVY In 2019, as the repair process dragged on, a fire broke out on Corner Brook at Victoria Shipyards in Canada’s British Columbia. It was quickly extinguished, thankfully, reportedly causing only minimal damage. Then, last December, the Canadian Department of Defense confirmed a leak aboard the submarine had caused new damage during a test carried out by Babcock the previous March and had pushed back the date of the boat’s expected return to service. With all this in mind, the latest progress made by Corner Brook is encouraging for the RCN and for the Canadian military at large. However, it’s not only this Victoria class submarine that has had a checkered history since its transfer to the RCN. Among the other three boats, the future HMCS Chicoutimi , caught fire while sailing from the United Kingdom to Canada in 2004, killing one sailor and injuring eight. HMCS Victoria , meanwhile, was found to have a dent in its hull in 2000 and then suffered “ catastrophic damage ” to its electrical system during upgrade work in 2006. Fire damage inside HMCS Chicoutimi in 2004., Canadian Forces In the years after their transfer from the United Kingdom, all four boats were found to have dangerous sub-standard welds that required repairs, as well. As a result, these submarines have barely managed to spend any meaningful periods at sea since their — much delayed — introductions. In 2019, for instance, the four boats were at sea for zero days as further maintenance continued. The COVID-19 pandemic further complicated things and, although Victoria returned to the fleet last September, Corner Brook faced more delays. As of April this year, both Windsor and Victoria were in the water undergoing post-work testing, suggesting the program may, finally, have turned a corner. There seems to be some uncertainty when work on Chicoutimi might be completed, however, evidenced by the RCN’s stated aim of “having three of four submarines” back in service in the near-term. An RCN video showing preparations to make HMCS Victoria ready for sea in late 2011 and 2012: That aspiration might also be challenged by the age of the submarines, with the oldest, Victoria , due to reach the end of its planned service life next year. A life-extension program costing roughly $1.5 billion would be required to keep the class active into the late 2030s or early 2040s. While that may not sound such a lot, it’s a significant figure in a country where annual defense spending for 2019-20 was estimated at around $26.5 billion, total. The life-extension program would equate to more than 5 percent of the entire defense budget. HMCS Corner Brook passing Fort Amherst and entering St. John’s Harbour in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador., Rick Anthony/Wikimedia Commons It wouldn’t be altogether surprising if the Canadian government decides the funds for submarine life-extension could be better spent elsewhere. Regardless, Canada has already invested more than a billion dollars in the submarines in the past 20 years, with very little return so far. Submarines are also not the only area where Canada is struggling to modernize, with the saga of acquiring new fighter jets another prominent big-ticket example. The RCN’s requirement for a submarine of any kind is meanwhile clear, with the strategic importance of the nearby Arctic region steadily growing and with highly advanced Russian submarines increasingly active in the North Atlantic. The result has been a revival of submarine and anti-submarine warfare across NATO, something that Canada is keenly aware of. That said, just four submarines for a country like Canada with maritime interests in the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Arctic, as well as responsibilities as part of NATO, is an extremely small force — even if they do all work. That Ottawa is willing to invest in high-end naval capabilities is clear by looking at its ambitious next-generation frigates, based on the British Type 26 design , which will be among the most heavily armed warships of their size. It remains to be seen whether Canada will opt to persist with its trouble-prone Victoria class or if it will decide to invest in a new design offering better reliability and capabilities, although, so far, there doesn’t appear to be any active movements toward acquiring new submarines. Once the RCN finally has three subs back in regular service, the defense ministry might be better able to make a decision on that front.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 25, 2021",The Soviet-Era Hurricane High-Speed Missile Boat Had Absolutely Gargantuan Hydrofoils,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Known in the Soviet Union as the Project 1240 Uragan, meaning hurricane, and given the Western codename Sarancha class, only one example of this hydrofoil missile boat was ever built, but it certainly packed a punch and was in many ways a remarkable design from a technical point of view. With enormous hydrofoil surfaces on either side at the front, and another at the rear mounting propellers, the Uragan could race across the surface of the water at an impressive 60-plus knots. The torpedo attack craft of the early Cold War years had been supplemented by coastal craft armed with anti-ship missiles by the 1960s, with the Soviet Union pioneering much of this effort. It was Soviet-made Komar class missile boats that sank the Israeli destroyer Eilat in 1967, bringing these types of high-speed attack craft to greater prominence. The Project 1240 Uragan in drydock in Sevastopol with its hydrofoils in the deployed position., Бабкинъ Михаилъ/Wikimedia Commons In a quest to further increase the performance of missile craft, work began on mating anti-ship missiles with hydrofoil designs, the hulls of which lift out of the water as they increase speed, decreasing drag as they are carried on wing-like surfaces. As well as boosting speed, it also typically improves fuel economy and can improve stability, even in rougher sea states. During the Cold War, the concept was not always a total success, but it certainly produced some interesting designs along the way. Enter the Uragan , constructed in Leningrad and immediately identified by the sheer size of its titanium-alloy hydrofoils. Those at the front were of the surface-piercing type, which meant they were partly out of the water when foilborne. When not deployed, they projected well clear of the hull at an angle of almost 45 degrees. The hydrofoil at the rear was of a different type, being fully submerged when foilborne, with vertical struts mounting rudders, plus propulsion pods at the tips. Propulsion came from a pair of gas turbines each developing up to 18,000 horsepower. Reportedly, these were maritime versions of the turboprops that power the Tu-95 Bear strategic bomber , versions of which remain in service today . The propellers were arranged as pairs on each of the aforementioned propulsion pods, and there were also a pair of diesel engines driving pump-jets, which were used for maneuvering at slow speeds. The Uragan with its hydrofoils in the water., via Twitter The Uragan was a big boat, over 160 feet long and with a displacement of over 400 tons when fully loaded, making it the biggest naval hydrofoil of its era. Construction was mainly of aluminum-magnesium alloy. All that capacity supported an appropriately heavy weapons load : two twin launchers for P-120 Malakhit (SS-N-9 Siren) high-subsonic anti-ship missiles with a range of around 70 miles, one twin Osa-M (SA-N-4 Gecko) surface-to-air missile launcher with a reach of up to 20 missiles, and one 30mm six-barrel AK-630M Gatling-type cannon. Fire-control and navigation radar was supplemented by an electronic countermeasures suite. МРК-5 in port, with the Osa-M surface-to-air missile ‘dustbin’ launcher visible on the bow., via Twitter The first and only Uragan was МРК-5, laid down at Leningrad’s Primorsky Shipyard in 1973 and beginning trials in the Baltic Sea in 1977. Two years later, the vessel was moved by inland waterway to the Black Sea, the other major area of operations for Soviet (and later Russian) military hydrofoils. It seems that МРК-5 was at least a qualified success in its trials since it remained in use at Sevastopol until being decommissioned in 1990. Reportedly , the P-120 anti-ship missiles were test-fired on two occasions and the vessel displayed “excellent seaworthiness.” The Uragan at speed., via Twitter Overall, however, the design unsurprisingly proved highly complex, tricky to operate, and no doubt also expensive. It’s probable that the size and cost of the Uragan compared unfavorably to more versatile corvette and frigate designs. Crew lend scale to one of the enormous forward hydroplanes., via Twitter Sadly, the one-off Uragan is no more: it was damaged by a fire in 1992 and then sank. After recovery, the wreck was scrapped. With hydrofoils raised, the Uragan cut a truly unique appearance., via Twitter The idea of the military hydrofoil has not gone away, however, with Russia in particular continuing to use these craft, including some of the Cold War-era counterparts to the Uragan. In the United States, meanwhile, smaller hydrofoil boats were still being tested recently, more than 25 years after the U.S. Navy retired its six Pegasus class missile boats, the last of its operational hydrofoils. You can read about both of those U.S. concepts in this previous article .

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 9, 2021",The Navy Concluded Transmedium Flying Submersibles Were Possible A Decade Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Navy research document from 2010 outlines the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Carderock Division ‘s efforts to create a working design of a manned vehicle capable of both airborne flight and submerged travel. The craft was intended to provide stealthy transport for Special Forces units into and out of operating areas. This wasn’t the first study of its kind to propose such a “transmedium” vehicle, defined as one capable of operating in multiple domains, such as in the air and underwater, but building such a craft has proven itself time and time again to be difficult, to say the least. It’s not clear how far the Navy’s efforts went, but the document’s conclusions are significant in that they show that over a decade ago, Naval researchers concluded that a “working design is feasible within the current state of the art.” Aircraft that could also operate under the sea have long been pursued by the U.S. Navy and other militaries. A number of often unworkable or heavily compromised designs have been proposed and even tested by armed forces around the world since at least the 1950s , including various forms of submersible aircraft , to more modern designs like the short-lived Lockheed Martin Cormorant . While the degree to which these designs have been able to operate in both the sea and air environments vary greatly, among the “holy grails” of aerospace research is a truly hybrid vehicle , a submersible aircraft or “flying submarine” that can travel near-seamlessly between the sky and the sea. USN In 2010, NSWC Carderock published its study of just such a vehicle concept. The idea was to research the feasibility of designing a vehicle that combined “the speed and range of an airborne platform with the stealth of an underwater vehicle by developing a vessel that can both fly and submerge.” The ultimate goal was to work towards developing a vehicle that could insert and extract Special Forces units at much greater ranges and speeds than existing platforms at the time, and be able to do so in locations that were “not previously accessible without direct support from additional military assets.” There have been far less ambitious boat-submarine concepts brought to life as of late , that try to address the issues of getting around the inherent limitations of existing swimmer delivery options . But the technological chasm between creating a vehicle that can transition between the surface and subsurface of the ocean and creating a true flying submarine is absolutely massive. The study was born out of a Broad Area Announcement (BAA) issued by DARPA in 2008 calling for design proposals for such a Special Forces vehicle and defining a Concept of Operations (CONOP) for potential designs. NSWC Carderock based its study off of that CONOP, which outlined the need for a vehicle whose capabilities included: – Deployment from a naval/auxiliary platform; – take-off from the water surface and transit 400 miles airborne, then land on the water surface; – submerge and transit 12 [nautical miles] underwater before deploying Special Forces; – loiter for up to 72 hours fully submerged; – retrieve Special Forces whilst submerged before transiting submerged to 12 [nautical miles] off the coast, take-off and return 400 miles to the mother ship To meet that need, NSWC Carderock and the Office of Naval Research conducted a study that would determine the feasibility of building a manned triangular, “submersible aircraft” that could insert Special Forces operators “covertly at a higher speed and more independently than is currently achievable.” USN NSCW Carderock came up with two blended wing-body/flying wing-type designs for their submersible aircraft concept, one with a wingspan of 92 feet, and another with a wingspan of 109 feet. Aside from differences in size, both designs had fairly similar specifications in terms of payload, speed, and weight: USN The submersible aircraft was designed to be operated by a crew of two, with room to accommodate six more Special Forces personnel for transportation. When underwater, the craft would have an operating depth of 30 meters and a speed of 6 knots; in the air, the craft would reach 200 mph. Propulsion was an obvious challenge the study considered, and the authors note that “It quickly became apparent that turbofans, turbo-props, and pulse jets systems should be considered in more detail.” In the end, based on fuel considerations and each propulsion methods’ ability to be sealed when underwater, it was decided that the best propulsion choices were “twin turbofans within sealable nacelles for air and sea-surface operating modes,” while “a single drop-down electrically driven thruster” was chosen for submerged operations. In order to assess the feasibility of the overall concept, a scale model with a six-foot wingspan powered by two 11-volt motors was constructed for testing. In flight tests, the vehicle displayed “very good directional stability” despite its lack of vertical stabilizers, which designers thought would severely limit the aircraft’s yaw control. The craft lost control only once during testing due to high winds, but this “was not believed to be a significant problem as the scale velocity of the wind was high,” meaning a full-sized aircraft would not have been affected as much as the small scale model was. When floats were attached to the scale model aircraft for water testing, its designers encountered difficulty in maintaining directional control. As a result, the study notes, “Attempts made to reach take-off speed and carry out a short take-off and landing were unsuccessful.” The failure was attributed to the inaccurate alignment of the model’s floats and the “inherent flex” of the Velcro used to attach the floats. Despite the failures, the report concluded that the tests validated the concept for the transmedium vehicle’s design and made plans to address the flaws in subsequent designs and tests. USN While it’s unknown if the study led to any further testing or development, the submersible aircraft study conducted by NSWC Carderock reached several conclusions, including that “feasible vehicle concepts can be generated using current technology and materials” and that “a hybrid flying wing/blended body design offers a viable solution” for transmedium vehicles and “offers a practical compromise between performance in flight, on the surface and when submerged.” Other concepts were created in response to DARPA’s BAA for a submersible aircraft and were published in aerospace academic publications throughout the early 2010s, like the submersible airplane design seen below. AIAA NSWC Carderock wasn’t the only laboratory pursuing transmedium vehicle research at the time. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) was also testing small, air-launched unmanned vehicles that could dive into bodies of water and travel short distances underwater in the early 2010s. According to a study published in 2014, these “vehicles demonstrated mixed-mode operation through dozens of swim tests and three flight tests,” although the study never accomplished air to underwater operation in a single test. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) also developed at least one such vehicle, the Flying Sea Glider , that was designed to be dropped from as high as 30,000 feet before gliding above the water and finally diving beneath the surface. The Office of Naval Research’s Flying Sea Glider, a demonstrator for which is seen here on display in 2017, was considered for use in resupplying submerged submarines., Joseph Trevithick In 2018, a DARPA-sponsored research project conducted at North Carolina State University reported a “seabird-inspired fixed-wing hybrid UAV-UUV system” that successfully conducted both air flights and submerged operations that demonstrated “egress from water, flight in air, ingress into water in each flight, and water locomotion.” In addition to Department of Defense-funded laboratories, there has been a clear, demonstrated interest in multi-medium vehicles by the military-industrial complex. Large aerospace contractors likewise possess patents for transmedium vehicles, such as the curiously low-key name “Vehicle” patent assigned to Lockheed Martin. The “Vehicle” patent describes a turbofan-powered vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) craft “capable of travel on the water, vertical flight, and hovercraft type operation.” One of the primary purposes of the patent was to provide a VTOL vehicle capable of traveling long distances on the water. A schematic from Lockheed Martin’s “Vehicle” patent. Just a fun side note, one of the designers is Steve Justice, who held a top position at the Skunk Works before going on to being one of the stars on the History Channel show Unidentified and part of Tom Delonge’s To The Stars Academy., USPTO Lockheed Martin also developed and patented the Cormorant, a stealthy, jet-powered drone that could be both launched and recovered by submerged submarines and carry a 1,000-pound payload in its modular bay. The Cormorant’s design was informed specifically by Navy specifications for unmanned aerial vehicles that could be launched by its converted Ohio -class guided-missile submarines (SSGN) at depths up to 150 feet. You can read all about Cormorant and the Navy’s ability to launch flying drones from submarines in this past feature of ours . A non-flying Cormorant test article., USN Like so many other transmedium vehicle projects, it’s unclear just how far the Cormorant project went after DARPA canceled the project in 2008. However, Lockheed Martin filed a patent for a separate transmedium vehicle a year later described as being able to “float in a body of water, or submerge itself underneath the water, and then later launch from the water without human intervention to perform a flying mission.” Using a modified MiG-15 to illustrate its patent components, Lockheed recently patented a true transmedium vehicle that could fly above and navigate below the waves., USPTO So far, there is no hard evidence that the decades-long search for a true hybrid aerospace-underwater vehicle has resulted in anything but a trove of conceptual studies hidden away in academic literature and a handful UUV/UAV concepts that have shown promise in testing. The full-scale development of such a craft either went dark or never went much farther. Still, the fact that a Navy study concluded over a decade ago that such a concept was “feasible within the current state of the art” shows just how close we may be to seeing the dream of a submersible airplane finally realized. Considering the tactical issues facing the U.S. military and the rise of peer state competitors like China, especially in regards to its anti-access umbrella and the long distances that would be involved in a war in the Pacific, such a vehicle would be far more relevant now than in the last few decades. A low-flying, somewhat low-observable craft could convey special operators through contested airspace and then deliver them into outright enemy territory while submerged. It’s not like the special operations community hasn’t delved into exotic infiltration capabilities before . With all that being said, and considering the generous and far more agile budget the special operations community has, it wouldn’t be outside the realm of the possible that a concept like this is indeed in some form of development or could even exist in a clandestine operational state today. The enemy certainly would have a hard time even figuring out what the heck they were looking at if they ran into one. Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com ​​​​ Brett Tingley"

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 19, 2021",Australia To Upgrade All Its Aging Submarines Amid Chronic Delays To Its New French Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Australia waits for its 12 new, controversial Attack class submarines , the country’s defense ministry has announced that it will spend around $4.6 billion keeping its current fleet of Collins class submarines viable until they can be replaced. Previous plans would have modernized just three of the Collins class, but the ministry has been forced to make the move since the first of the Attack class is not now expected to be delivered until around 2035, while the full fleet won’t achieve final operational capability (FOC) until 2054. Australia’s Minister of Defense Peter Dutton confirmed the plans for a life-of-type extension (LOTE) for the six Collins class submarines, as reported by the Defence Connect website. It’s a significant investment in the aging Collins class design, the first example of which entered service in the mid-1990s and reflects the latest in an ongoing series of concerns about delays with the Attack class program, which was originally supposed to enter service in the early 2030s. The Collins class submarine HMAS Rankin conducts helicopter transfers with an MH-60R Seahawk in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, as part of its pre-deployment training., AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE The Collins class submarines were designed by the Swedish firm Kockums, which is now part of Saab. These are large conventionally powered submarines, with a submerged displacement of almost 3,500 tons and a length of 254 feet. Details of the LOTE program have not been announced, but the plan is to ensure that the Collins boats remain suitable for combat operations until the Attack class is declared ready for frontline service. “We need to be realistic about what lies ahead by way of threat in our own region, and the submarine capacity is a significant part of how we mitigate that risk and it’s important we get the program right”, Dutton told The Australian . “There is no doubt in my mind that we need to pursue a life-of-type extension [for the Collins class].” LOTE work will commence on each Collins class submarine as it reaches 30 years of service, with a thorough rebuild that will take around two years per boat. According to Defence Connect , upgrade work will be carried out by ASC in Adelaide, which originally built the vessels, while the government confirmed by that Saab will be active in a supporting role. The first Collins is due begin undergoing the upgrade work in 2026. Dutton admitted the modernization program presented “a tight timeline, no question.” In the background to this latest development, there is still confusion as to the viability of the ambitious Attack class program, also known as SEA 1000. Back in 2016, France’s Naval Group (then known as DCNS) won the SEA 1000 contract to replace the Collins class. The Naval Group’s Attack class submarine is a derivative of the Shortfin Barracuda Block 1A design. Equipped with advanced technologies, likely to include air-independent propulsion systems, as well as the AN/BYG-1 Submarine Payload Control System , the Attack class is enormously expensive — it’s now projected to cost around $69 billion. Back when the French submarine was selected the total program cost was projected to be a little under $40 billion. An artist’s concept of the Attack class submarine for the Royal Australian Navy., DCNS The cost of the program, as well as worries about workshare for the Osborne Naval Shipyard in South Australia that will build the submarines, as well as technology sharing, has dogged the SEA 1000 project. The original agreement required at least 60 percent of the contract value to be invested in local industry. Exactly why the program has become so expensive is not entirely clear and this lack of transparency on the financial issues has been a persistent source of conflict between the Australian and French sides. However, we do know that the $69 billion includes funds for research and development, integration of combat systems, establishing indigenous production facilities, plus support infrastructure. With that in mind, a unit cost of $8 billion per hull is somewhat misleading. On the other hand, the fact remains that two years ago France claimed that it had budgeted just over $10 billion for a total of six Barracuda class boats that it’s buying for its own navy. Earlier this year, it was reported the Australian government was even thinking of canceling the contract with Naval Group entirely. Instead, thought has apparently been given to an alternative design based on the Collins class, to be built by Naval Group’s Australian subsidiary. More recently, there have been reports that the government is also examining acquiring a German submarine — almost certainly the Type 216 submarine from Thyssen Krupp that lost out in the original SEA 1000 bidding — as an interim measure pending full availability of the Attack class. That would seem an extravagant solution but bearing in mind the Type 216 was expected to come in at around half the cost of the French design, it could potentially be feasible, albeit far more expensive than an upgrade to the Collins class. A computer-generated schematic showing the Type 216 design., Thyssen Krupp Dutton noted that there had been “problems with the arrangements with Naval Group,” and assured that everything was being done to ensure that contractual obligations were being met. Nevertheless, all this only adds to the delays in actually putting the new submarines to sea and makes the need for an interim solution more urgent. Earlier this month, as part of a wider overhaul of its leadership, Naval Group Australia brought in a new executive vice president for its Future Submarines program. Clearly, Australia needs a replacement for its aging Collins class submarines, one way or another. While the costs of the Attack class may be eye-watering, the Royal Australian Navy recognizes the importance of submarines in modern naval warfare, in general, and to Australia, in particular, as a major Pacific naval power. This is especially relevant at a time when China is rapidly expanding its own navy and introducing submarines that are faster and harder to detect . A Chinese Type 039A diesel-electric submarine, reckoned to be one of the quietest of its kind now in service., United States Naval Institute News Blog What seems to be the current favored solution — upgrading the existing Collins class while waiting to see what happen with the Attack class — seems risky, but it does at least give Naval Group another chance to put its program onto the right track. At the same time, local shipbuilding industry will be kept busy with repairs works to the older submarines at least until it can begin work on its successor. For now, that is still likely to be the Naval Group design, but talk of more than one alternative under consideration suggests that there is still potential, at least, that this might still change.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 9, 2019",Gremlins Drones Could Be Rearmed Inside Their Mothership Transport Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, is exploring new potential concepts of operations as part of its Gremlins program , which has been experimenting with swarming drones that are designed to be launched and recovered in mid-air. DARPA is now looking into the possibility that personnel on a mothership aircraft that deploy and retrieve these unmanned aircraft might be able to load new payloads onto them, including swarms of smaller drones or munitions, before sending them out on new missions. Steve Fendley, President of the Unmanned Systems Division at Kratos, offered these new details about the plans for Gremlins in a recent interview with Military.com , portions of which were published today. Dynetics, now a subsidiary of Leidos, is the prime contractor for the Gremlins program, but hired Kratos to oversee the actual design and construction of the drones themselves, which are designated X-61As. DARPA first initiated the Gremlins project in 2015. An X-61A Gremlins drone., Dynetics “The government is adding requirements,” Fendley told Military.com . “They now want to rearm the Gremlins in air and redeploy [them], so they won’t just do one mission now.” Fendley did not name any specific payloads that the Gremlins might carry in the future, according to Military.com , but did say that the options could include “actual weapons.” DARPA has long talked about individual X-61As being able to carry different payloads , such as different sensor packages, electronic warfare jammers, and even potentially small warheads, and then operate together in a fully-autonomous, networked swarm to carry out missions collaboratively. “[The military wants] to be able to deploy and retrieve a volley quantity, which is approximately 20 of those aircraft [the X-61A],” Fendley added. The X-61A is an “attritable tactical unmanned aerial system that can fly a several hour-long mission,” he continued.” Attritable means that they are cheap enough to be employed in higher-risk environments where the risk of losing the aircraft is elevated enough that commanders would be disinclined to send in more expensive and more sensitve assets. At the same time, the Gremlins concept has always envisioned the X-61As as being recoverable for reuse , as well, but it has not been entirely clear in the past what the exact concept of operation might be in this regard. Beyond all this, Fendley is now describing X-61As carrying expandable payloads, which could also include non-kinetic stores, such as electronic warfare decoys , and using them during a mission, before being recovered by a mothership aircraft. A specially-configured C-130-series cargo plane has been used in this role in Gremlins flight testing so far. The drones would then get reloaded inside that aircraft and be quickly sent back out again. A specially-configured C-130-type aircraft attempts to link up with an X-61A drone during a flight test in 2020., DARPA It’s not clear whether this proposed capability would also extend to swapping out modular payloads installed inside the X-61As themselves. It’s also not clear if the small turbojet-powered Gremlins would also be refueled inside their mothership, though it’s hard to see how this wouldn’t be the case in order for the entire concept to work. Regardless, it’s not hard to see how this could further expand the flexibility of the Gremlins concept. For example, a group of these drones could be deployed initially to search for and engage targets in a certain area and then go back to their mothership to be reloaded, either simply to then fly new missions in a different portion of the battlespace or to enable them to meet rapidly changing mission requirements. The ability of X-61As to carry even smaller drones could enable them to deploy their own drone swarms in certain areas before return to their flying base to reload and do it all over again, rapidly expanding the total area one mothership could cover. Drone swarms , in general , have an inherent ability to overwhelm and otherwise disrupt an opponent’s decision-making cycles by making it difficult for them to effectively prioritize their response. This underlying capability would be beneficial in a wide variety of contexts, especially when seeking to degrade or neutralize hostile integrated air defense networks, a mission set that DARPA has already identified as a potential future operational application for the Gremlins. Concept art and computer renderings that DARPA, as well as Dynetics, has put out in the past have suggested the Gremlins could be initially launched from various platforms, including B-1B bombers , before returning to a mothership. A stealthy launch platform, such as a B-21 Raider stealth bomber , could conceivably penetrate deep into enemy territory before launching a swarm of X-61As, increasing the amount of time they could spend in a hostile area before heading back to less contested airspace to be recovered. At the same time, in the past year or so, there has been a steady stream of news regarding work conducted by elements of the U.S. military, including the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army , as well as foreign armed forces and private companies, on air-launched and potentially air-recoverable drone concepts . This has included announcements about related developments in swarming technologies and numerous actual flight tests involving larger unmanned aircraft as launch platforms for smaller drones. Gremlins concept art showing a B-1B launching either X-61As or cruise missiles, or a mixture of both, while C-130-type aircraft recover other Gremlins returning from their missions., Dynetics Fendley himself told Military.com that he saw Gremlins as one part of a three-tiered attritable unmanned aircraft family of systems for the U.S. military. “That will evolve this year. I think you’re going to see the Gremlins really be a high-focus item for the Defense Department moving forward because it’s kind of a third leg of that attritable capability set,” he explained. The other two “legs” that he was referring to are Kratos’ UTAP-22 , also known as the Mako , and its XQ-58A Valkyrie . Both types are presently being used to support various advanced technology efforts, particularly within the Air Force, including the development of “ loyal wingman ” types drones designed to work networked together with manned aircraft, and fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). Artificial intelligence and machine learning are major components of many of these programs, especially the Air Force’s Skyborg initiative , which Kratos is involved in . Skyborg is seeking to develop a suite of systems that will together form a “computer brain” to operate loyal wingman drones, as well as UCAVs, and an initial version of that package flew for the first time in May on board a UTAP-22. Separately, the Air Force also demonstrated the ability to launch a smaller drone from inside the XQ-58A’s internal payload bay in April. An XQ-58A Valkyrie launches a smaller drone from its internal payload bay during a test in 2021., USAF DARPA’s Gremlins program still has yet to demonstrate the ability of a mothership aircraft to recover an X-61A in flight. A C-130-type aircraft configured for this role failed to reel in any Gremlins drones during flight testing last year. The next round of Gremlins flight testing is presently scheduled to begin later this year. If those flight tests are successful, it could just be a matter of time before DARPA looks to demonstrate the ability of a mothership send out swarms of Gremlins to deploy their own swarms, or launch other payloads, including small munitions, and then return to their aerial nest to be reloaded and rearmed for another mission.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 3, 2025",7.62x51mm Rifles And Miniguns Adapted To Fire Longer-Range Polymer Cased 6.8mm Ammo In Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ammunition manufacturer True Velocity has test-fired an M134 Minigun , among other weapons, chambered for its 6.8mm TVCM cartridge. The company says that the round’s design means that all that you need to do to convert guns that use 7.62x51mm ammunition to fire it, in many cases, is to perform a simple barrel change. True Velocity originally developed this 6.8mm ammunition for General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, as part of that company’s submission for the U.S. Army’s Next Generation Squad Weapon program. True Velocity announced that it was working to expand the potential applications of its 6.8mm TVCM round in a press release , and accompanying video, which it issued last week. In addition to the M134 Minigun, the company said it had tested its new ammunition in a rechambered M240B machine gun and M110 marksman rifle . All three of these weapons are presently in Army service, as well as in use elsewhere across the U.S. military. The video, seen above, also shows tests involving the Knights Armament Company (KAC) Light Assault Machine Gun (LAMG) and Remington 700 bolt-action rifle, as well as variants of the RM277 weapon system, which you can read more about here . The RM277 family, developed by Beretta in cooperation with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS), is currently competing against designs from SIG Sauer and Textron as part of the Army’s Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) effort. An RM277 in its rifle configuration, as has been submitted to the Army’s NGSW program., Beretta Reed Knight of Knights Armament Company fires a Light Assault Machine Gun (LAMG) rechambered to fire the 6.8mm TVCM round, while also demonstrating the gun’s controllability by firing it one-handed., True Velocity capture “True Velocity is an American-owned, American-based company that set out with a singular goal in mind, and it was to provide the American warfighter with an unfair advantage on the battlefield,” Patrick Hogan, True Velocity’s Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, said in a statement. “The Next Generation Squad Weapon program has given us the opportunity to do that … Not only do we have this forward-leaning momentum with next-generation capabilities, but we have a plug-and-play application that can be fielded on the battlefield today with weapons that our soldiers are carrying into battle.” True Velocity describes the 6.8mm TVCM cartridge as offering as “switch-barrel capability” for weapons that fire the 7.62x51mm round, a NATO-standard design that was first developed in the 1950s. This has to do in no small part with the fact that the 6.8mm TVCM’s cartridge case is also 51 millimeters in length and is very similar in size and shape to the one used on the older 7.62mm design. The front portion of the case is notably different, but a complete barrel assembly typically includes the firing chamber, which would also have to be resized to make the change from 7.62x51mm to 6.8mm TVCM. “What we’ve done is basically made a round that is the same size as a 7.62, but this round here, the new [6.8mm] round, has much more energy, than what this round does, by far,” Lonnie Burrow, True Velocity’s Chief Research and Innovation Officer, says in the recently released video. A typical 7.62x51mm cartridge on the left and a 6.8mm TVCM round on the right., True Velocity capture “You’re talking about something as simple as pulling a barrel off the M240 and replacing it with one that accommodates 6.8 TVCM,” Hogan added. “All of a sudden, you’ve increased the effective range of this weapon by more than 50 percent … and you’ve given our soldiers a meaningful advantage on the battlefield.” For reference, FN America , the U.S.-based subsidiary of Belgian gunmaker FN , which makes M240Bs for the Army, says on its website that its approximate maximum effective ranges against point and area targets, using typical ammunition, are around 2,624 feet and 5,900 feet, respectively. A 50 percent increase would mean the gun could be employed against area targets up 8,850 feet away. An M240B machine gun fires 6.8mm TVCM ammunition during a demonstration., True Velocity capture With all this in mind, it would also seem likely that the 6.8mm TVCM would be able to use many types of magazines and other feeding systems designed for the 7.62x51mm cartridge with, at most, minimal modifications. In addition, True Velocity says that the 6.8mm TVCM round, when fired, produces pressures that are very similar to those generated by common types of 7.62x51mm rounds. What this means is that guns that are designed to withstand the force of shooting 7.62x51mm ammunition are not at risk of exploding or otherwise failing catastrophically, and should generally function reliably, when firing True Velocity’s 6.8mm rounds. This would also, in principle, suggest that the 6.8mm ammunition would not cause significantly greater wear and tear on those weapons. The 6.8mm TVCM round also uses a polymer cartridge case, which True Velocity says makes it 30 percent lighter than brass-cased 7.62x51mm rounds. While polymer-cased ammunition of various types in different calibers has been in development for decades now , materials science advances have made such designs increasingly safer and more reliable. A view of polymer cases for the 6.8mm TVCM cartridge being made., True Velocity capture It is a well-established fact that the average combat loads for individual personnel have only gotten heavier over the years. Polymer-cased ammunition has long been held out as one potential path toward reducing the burden troops have to carry, without them having to carry less ammunition, or as a way for them to carry more rounds without incurring any additional weight penalty. Any weight savings could also enable them to carry additional items, if desired, again without increasing how heavy their overall loadout is. The reduced weight of the 6.8mm TVCM could be just as beneficial for use with guns mounted on vehicles or aircraft. Many helicopters, for instance, have to operate at reduced gross weights, which could mean carrying less ammunition for defensive machine guns, to maintain performance in hot-and-high environments. “We went down to Dillon Aero . We took the M134 rotary machine gun, the Minigun, and with nothing more than a barrel swap and a couple of minor adjustments to that weapon, you’re now firing 6.8 through the Minigun and significantly increasing your effective range and lightening the load, not only for the guys on the ground, but also for our rotary-wing assets,” True Velocity’s Hogan said in the recently released video. All told, True Velocity’s 6.8mm ammunition would certainly seem to offer a relatively simple and low-cost way to improve the effectiveness of guns designed to fire the 7.62x51mm cartridge. The nature of conversions means that it should be possible to readily convert back and forth between the rounds, allowing the use of existing stocks of ammunition for operational or training purposes, as desired. It’s also worth noting that SIG Sauer and Textron have also submitted their own 6.8x51mm ammunition designs as part of the Army’s NGSW program requirements. Depending on how these rounds are designed, it’s possible that these companies could also offer conversion kits for 7.62x51mm guns. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jDvGCx1hn1M What’s perhaps most interesting about True Velocity testing of the 6.8mm TVCM cartridge in various types of guns in use or otherwise on the market now is that the company would seem to be not only hedging against GD-OTS losing the Army’s NGSW competition, but that competition getting canceled entirely. “At True Velocity, we see this more as an ammunition program than a weapon program,” Hogan, the company’s Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, says in the video. “I think the Army’s assumption was that in doing and achieving that enhanced level of ballistic performance, that we were going to have to deal with higher than normal chamber pressures, thus the need for next-gen weapons.” “If True Velocity’s 6.8[mm] TVCM is capable of achieving that level of enhanced ballistic performance, while keeping chamber pressures at a normal operating level, then it begs the philosophical question, do we really need these next-gen weapons?” he continues. There’s no indication that True Velocity is not fully committed to GD-OTS’ entry in the NGSW program, but Hogan’s comments are certainly interesting when considering what Army General John Murray, head of Army Futures Command, told members of the House Armed Services Committee just this week . “That is a future decision to be made, very much dependent on the prototyping we have going on now,” he said when asked about the timeline for when NGSW variants might begin to replace existing M4 carbines and M249 Squad Automatic Weapons (SAW), both of which fire the 5.56x45mm round . He added that it could take three to four years for government-owned plants to begin mass production of new 6.8mm ammunition and that many soldiers would likely at least conduct some level of basic training with existing weapon types for some time to come. https://youtube.com/watch?v=brehxUuLn58 The Army has also talked publicly in the past about limiting the fielding of NGSW guns to only certain combat units . A few years ago, the service also briefly considered adopting a new 7.62x51mm battle rifle as an interim way to get small units improved range and terminal performance over their existing M4 carbines. As The War Zone has explored in the past, the costs and logistical factors that surround the replacement of hundreds of thousands of guns and millions of rounds of ammunition have led the Army to abort plans to adopt new standard infantry rifles and other small arms on multiple occasions in the past three decades. The debacle surrounding the development and ultimate abandonment of plans to adopt the XM8 rifle, a modular design readily adaptable to other roles that you can read about more here , is a prime example. Members of the Army with XM8s. The individual in the rear has a gun in the carbine configuration that is also fitted with a 40mm grenade launcher, while the soldier in front has a full-sized rifle version., US Army It’s also worth noting that the U.S. special operations community has also been pursuing the acquisition of new rifles and machine guns with a focus particularly on increasing range and ballistic performance over existing weapons. However, these guns will shoot 6.5mm rounds unrelated to the 6.8mm designs being tested as part of the NGSW program. Whatever the case, True Velocity is certainly making a compelling case that, if the conversion process to 6.8mm TVCM is truly as simple as the company says it is, there is another option for increasing the combat effectiveness of units equipped, even in part, with guns chambered to fire 7.62x51mm ammunition.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 4, 2021",Iran Releases Video It Says Shows One Of Its Warships In The Atlantic For The First Time (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Iranian Navy says that the Makran , a sea base-like ship that only entered service in January, and the corvette Sahand are now sailing in the South Atlantic and has released video of the latter vessel plowing through the waves in that region. Previous reports have indicated that the ships’ final destination is Venezuela, possibly with plans to deliver missile-armed boats and other weapons to the regime there, but they might also be scheduled to stop in Cuba , as well. The U.S. government has said that if the Iranian vessels are indeed carrying military-related cargoes that this represents a “threat” to regional security and that it reserves the right to at least attempt to block any such deliveries. It seems most likely that the newly released video of Sahand , seen below, which is undated, was taken by someone on the deck of the Makran . No other ships are visible and there are no obvious geographical markers to help determine the exact location where it was shot. During a press conference on June 10, Iranian Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari also told reporters that the two ships were in the Atlantic Ocean and that they had not made any port visits since entering that body of water. This appears to be the first official statement from Iranian authorities about this naval deployment to the Western Hemisphere, the first of its kind for Iran after years of aborted attempts . The video also shows the seas that Sahand is sailing to be relatively rough. “The Navy is improving its seafaring capacity and proving its long-term durability in unfavorable seas and the Atlantic’s unfavorable weather conditions,” Sayyari said at the press conference . Reports had first emerged in May that the two naval vessels appeared to be headed for the Atlantic via the Cape of Good Hope, which they reportedly rounded on June 4. Posts on social media had suggested that Makran and Sahand might need to return to Iran after the Iranian Navy’s replenishment ship Kharg sank in the Gulf of Oman after suffering a major fire on June 2. This has clearly turned out not to be the case. The circumstances surrounding what happened to the Kharg remain murky, though there is already significant, if unconfirmed speculation that it could have been the latest victim of an Israeli sabotage campaign against Iranian commercial and navy ships . Makran , which formally entered service in January and that you can read about more here , is a converted oil tanker that the Iranian Navy now describes as a “forward base ship.” Sahand , Iran’s most modern warship , is a 2,000-ton displacement corvette, though official sources often describe it as a destroyer or frigate, derived from the design of British-made vessels supplied to Iran under the Shah. Satellite imagery of Makran from April had shown it carrying at least seven fast attack craft, possibly types capable of being armed with anti-ship cruise missiles, on its upper deck. This, in turn, had suggested that Iran might be planning to deliver those boats, as well as other weapons and military-related cargo, to Venezuela. “The precedent of allowing Iran to provide weapons to the region causes me great concern,” Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told members of Congress at hearing today. “I am absolutely concerned about the proliferation of weapons, any type of weapons, in our neighborhood.” “The delivery of such weapons would be a provocative act and understood as a threat to our partners in the Western Hemisphere,” the senior U.S. government official had also told Politico on June 9. “We would reserve the right to take appropriate measures in coordination with our partners to deter the transit or delivery of such weapons.” The is roughly identical to a statement Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby issued last week. Politico also reported that the Biden administration had warned both Venezuela and Cuba against allowing the Iranian naval vessels to enter their ports for any reason, adding that officials in Caracas had apparently indicated that they might be willing to acquiesce to the American demands in exchange for sanctions relief. President Donald Trump and his administration had hit the Venezuelan government with a number of new sanctions following abortive attempts, starting in 2019, by opponents of President Nicolas Maduro to bring an end to his increasingly dictatorial regime. There was also a bizarre failed coup against Maduro, led in part by American mercenaries, including veterans of U.S. special operations units , in 2020. Ties between the Venezuelan and Iranian governments have also grown, in general , in recent years, with Maduro openly talking about buying weapons from Iran, including “ short, medium and long range missiles ,” last year. There have been reports of Venezuelan cooperation with Iran on the production of drones in the past, as well. Separately, the Trump administration had also reversed key efforts that President Barack Obama’s administration had made to increasingly normalize relations with Cuba. U.S. policy decisions toward Cuba under Trump had also became intertwined with reports centering largely on still-unexplained sonic phenomena that may have left American government employees with traumatic brain injuries and otherwise sickened in that country. Multiple investigations, including ones that are still ongoing now , into what some now refer to as “ Havana Syndrome ” have yet to reach any firm conclusions about the cause or causes of any of these incidents. Some have suggested that the injuries and ailments, which may have also impacted individuals working for the U.S. government in other foreign countries , as well as within the United States , could be the result of deliberate attacks by hostile actors. Cuba has not been directly accused of carrying out any such attacks, but has been criticized for failing to protect American diplomats. It is important to note that Makran and Sahand pose virtually no direct, immediate threat to the United States, as The War Zone has previously explained . At the same time, even just a port visit by those ships to either Venezuela or Cuba would almost certainly be touted as an act of defiance toward the U.S. government by those involved for propaganda purposes . As expected, Iranian authorities are also highlighting this deployment as a demonstration of their ability to safeguard their commercial interests in the region. Last year, the U.S. government succeeded in using legal mechanisms to seize four tanker ships carrying Iranian gasoline bound for Venezuela. In 2019, British officials also detained an Iranian tanker loaded with oil bound for Syria as it sailed near Gibraltar. The latter ship was ultimately released . It remains unclear what the U.S. military, or other agencies of the U.S. government, may be willing or able to do to block or otherwise impede Makran and Sahand if it is determined that they are carrying weapons or other military cargo for delivery to Venezuela, or any other country in the Western Hemisphere. No matter what, the arrival of the Iranian ships in the Western Hemisphere seems very likely to frustrate any attempts by the Biden administration to reverse Trump-era policies toward the governments in any of these countries, especially the regime in Tehran. American and Iranian officials are presently conducting indirect negotiations about the U.S. government’s return to a controversial deal over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Trump withdrew the United States from that agreement in 2018 and Iranian authorities have since violated all of its key provisions . Biden’s domestic political opponents are already making their positions clear on the deployment of the Iranian naval vessels. “#Venezuela bought attack boats from #Iran last year, but only now are they trying to deliver them,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, the ranking member of that party on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a staunch opponent of the current Venezuelan and Cuban governments, wrote in Tweet today. “Either #Maduro unconditionally turns them away or [the] U.S. should force them to turn around.” All told, how the Biden administration reacts to Makran and Sahand sailing in the South Atlantic for the first time could have broader geopolitical ramifications for the U.S. government, as well the regimes in Tehran, Venezuela, and Havana. UPDATE: 4:50 PM EST— A new report from Iran’s state-owned PressTV regarding the arrival of Makran and Sahand in the South Atlantic interestingly includes a presentation by an Iranian Navy officer showing various maritime routes on a map. A number of these look be the routes taken by Iranian naval vessels on past long-range overseas deployments, including Kharg ‘s trip to China in 2013. Curiously, the line that appears to represent the planned route for the current mission in the Atlantic cuts a straight path between West Africa and South America and then hooks eastward around Northwest Africa toward Europe, rather than turning westward toward the Caribbean. UPDATE: 7:35 PM EST— Iranian authorities have now released additional imagery they say is of Makran and Sahand in the Atlantic, including pictures that appear to show the converted tanker refueling the corvette. One of the pictures shows Makran riding very low in the water, indicating the ship is very heavily laden. Part of that load is almost certainly fuel for both ships during this voyage, but some experts have raised questions about whether this might point to the presence of other cargoes onboard, as well. The Associated Press has also reported that an aide to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had said that the Iranian ships would not visit that country.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The latest in a long line of U.S. Air Force heritage schemes is a special one, indeed, recalling the service’s combat during the Vietnam War, when hundreds of aircraft were adorned in these shades of green and tan. While the Southeast Asia camouflage scheme is a well-known one , this is very likely the first time an F-16 fighter jet has appeared in these colors. Photos were released by the Department of Defense today showing the specially prepared Block 30 F-16C serial number 86-0331 from the 149th Fighter Wing’s 182nd Fighter Squadron, Texas Air National Guard, at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. The non-standard scheme has been applied to mark the 25th anniversary of the wing being redesignated from the 149th Fighter Group, an event officially marked last October . Newly painted F-16C serial number 86-0331 in its shelter at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland., 149th Fighter Wing Public Affairs/Public Domain While the Vietnam-era colors look striking on the F-16, the 149th Fighter Wing didn’t actually serve in the Southeast Asian campaign. That said, its combat record is impressive, having originally been stood up in 1943 to fight in the European Theater during World War II. After the war, the wing’s component 396th Fighter Squadron was inactivated and then reconstituted as the 182nd Fighter Squadron, assigned to the Texas Air National Guard. Flying the F-84E Thunderjet in Korea, the 182nd became the first Guard unit to shoot down a MiG-15 in that conflict. In 1960, the unit was reorganized as the 149th Fighter Group and it continued to fly a range of fighters — including F-102A Delta Daggers , F-100D Super Sabres, and F-4C Phantom IIs — until re-equipping with its current mount, the F-16, in 1986. Since 1999, the 149th has served as the Formal Training Unit (FTU) for Air National Guard F-16 pilots under Air Education and Training Command. 149th Fighter Wing Public Affairs/Public Domain 149th Fighter Wing Public Affairs/Public Domain Another one of the 149th Fighter Wing’s specially painted F-16s was the subject of a recent innovation, when the wing unveiled a unique robotic system used to wash down its fighters keep them free of corrosion and extend their lifespan. You can read more about that proof of concept, and how it could also be rolled out to other Air Force units, in this previous story . The new-look Texan Viper is actually part of an expanding repertoire of Air Force equipment to appear in the SEA scheme. Most recently, an A-10C from the Warthog Demo Team at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base emerged wearing the pattern, a story The War Zone covered here . Before that, a T-38C jet trainer wore the scheme , as did a QF-4 demo jet prior to the type’s retirement . A UH-1N Twin Huey helicopter also appeared with this pattern last year. An SEA-scheme F-4C from the 182nd Fighter Squadron used for battle damage repair training at RAF Upper Heyford, England, in 1986., Mike Freer/Wikimedia Commons Meanwhile, for Viper afficionados, now is a particularly good time for variety among Air Force units, with not only unique special liveries to mark different anniversaries , but also some of the most flamboyant aggressor schemes that we have seen in recent years . As for the SEA scheme of the 149th Fighter Wing, perhaps the closest other in-service Viper camouflage is that applied to the Venezuelan fleet of F-16A/Bs , that country’s surviving jets operating in similar, but different, tones. A Venezuelan F-16B in its unique color scheme., Rob Schleiffert/Wikimedia Commons There’s no doubt that heritage schemes like this resonate with the public and engender pride within Air Force units. As the Air Force’s last serving POW — from Desert Storm in 1991 — retires, this particular jet is also a reminder of the many airmen who were Killed in Action or became Prisoners of War during the long conflict in Southeast Asia.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 8, 2021",Drone Used High Power Microwaves To Knock Down Other Drones In DARPA Demo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. DARPA announced this week that it had successfully demonstrated its new Mobile Force Protection (MFP) system, which can launch semi-autonomous interceptors that shoot kinetic “streamers” at enemy drones in order to clog their propellers or rotors and bring them to the ground. In addition, DARPA’s announcement stated that “other non-kinetic techniques were developed and demoed.” To find out more about the MFP anti-drone system and what these other techniques were, The War Zone spoke with Dr. Greg Avicola of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, who serves as Program Manager for the Mobile Force Protection program. Avicola revealed previously unreleased details about the MFP system, including the fact that it has been demonstrated using Lockheed Martin’s MORFIUS, another counter-drone interceptor that uses a high-power microwave directed energy weapon to defeat drone swarms. After our initial report on MFP, we still had additional questions, including about just how autonomous the nature of the anti-drone system is. While some of those details still cannot be shared, Avicola said there’s a human operator in the loop to provide guidance to the system overall, but the goal is to design a system that can handle a large number of incoming drone threats at once. A DARPA graphic depicting a potential concept of operations for the Mobile Force Protection system., DARPA “For that, you need some level of autonomy to sort out everything it’s looking at and make recommendations on what to engage and how fast to engage them” Avicola told us. To accomplish this, the system uses a DARPA-developed “decision engine” to classify potential threats, form a “local engagement picture” of the surrounding airspace, and then make recommendations to the human operator about deploying its interceptors. “It’s been trained to look at sensor data and ascertain based upon the characteristics of what it’s seeing what it thinks things are and what the probability is of various things are being drones or not drones and then provide recommendations to the operator.” While Avicola couldn’t share specific details about what that decision engine entails, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are usually associated with this kind of terminology, and DARPA has built similar systems leveraging those technologies in the past. Avicola told us that the demonstration system possessed six interceptor launch tubes powered by compressed air pneumatic ejector systems, but that a future system could be scaled up or down based on different users’ needs. “In principle the number of tubes that you bring with you is really for a future acquisition system. If they were to take this concept and build it out into an acquisition system, that number could be variable based on the actual needs of the surrogates and what they think their requirements are.” “Obviously, carrying more requires bigger vehicles.” While the Humvee in the demonstration “comfortably” carried six interceptor tubes, Avicola said the number of tubes for that particular form of the Humvee-mounted system could also be increased in the future. The MFP system mounted aboard a Humvee in demonstrations at Eglin AFB., DARPA Avicola said that because its size, weight, and power requirements are designed to be small, it could be deployed inside of modular containers , aboard ships, or deployed around installations, including forward operating bases . Still, the system was primarily designed to be mobile and capable of operating on rough terrain. “It can get jostled around, it can take bumps, and the sensor systems still operate and the system holds together,” Avicola said. “That was one of the goals at the beginning of the program, to build something that was [not only] mobile, but also mobile in the sense of unprepared roads.” The press release on MFP that DARPA put out earlier this week mentioned only one interceptor specifically, the CUGAR – it’s unclear what this acronym stands for – for which Dynetics performed system integration. Dynetics ordered dual-rotor drones similar to those seen in DARPA’s recent demonstration last year in order to “develop new payload systems that will provide additional capabilities for customers in the defense and intelligence communities.” Avicola told us that another drone interceptor was tested in the MFP demonstrations, as well. This was the Lockheed Martin’s Mobile Radio Frequency-Integrated Unmanned Aerial Systems Suppressor, or MORFIUS . “We took their existing product and basically contracted them to Dynetics to make some mods to integrate it with our system,” Avicola told us, adding that “They had a pretty interesting solution.” Lockheed Martin describes MORFIUS as a tube-launched, “reusable, high-power microwave-based interceptor for C-UAS and C-swarm scenarios.” MORFIUS is based on the Agile-Launch Tactically Integrated Unmanned System-600 ( ALTIUS-600 ) airframe designed by Area-I, a company that was recently acquired by Anduril Industries. It is claimed to be capable of defeating multiple threats simultaneously in a single attack using high-power microwaves (HPM). HPM are a form of directed energy weaponry which are capable of disrupting or even destroying electronics inside of drones or weapon systems, literally frying their circuitry from the inside out when powerful enough. It’s not immediately clear just how powerful the HPM system in the MORFIUS drones is, but the fact that a drone of its size can deploy a high-power microwave system at all is exciting on its own. The ALTIUS-600 is an increasingly popular small drone design that can be adapted to various roles and that has been already test launched from a wide range of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters , as well as from ground vehicles . Earlier this year, an XQ-58A Valkyrie unmanned aircraft notably launched an ALTIUS-600 drone from a Common Launch Tube system in its internal payload bay. While the MFP system’s sensor suite uses X-band radar to detect and identify drones within its airspace, Avicola told us that the interceptors tested so far are also equipped with an onboard radar system developed by Fortem Technologies . After the master MFP unit assigns and directs an interceptor towards a target, the interceptor’s onboard radar then takes over in order to engage the target with its blasts of “ strong stringy streamer ” type effectors, as DARPA calls them. The interceptors tested for the MFP system so far are capable of defeating multiple threats in a single launch, Avicola told us. During the demonstrations at Eglin Air Force Base, the MFP unit was tested in engagements with multiple incoming threats. “It can take on more than one and did take on more than one at a time” in the demonstration, Avicola said. After the MFP interceptors expend their effectors, they can land on their own where they can then be recovered. Once recovered, each reusable interceptor can be rearmed and loaded with new battery packs in less than twenty minutes. The interceptors, while designed to be low cost, are nevertheless built to be robust and durable. Avicola said one of their first prototypes successfully flew “hundreds of flights.” A screenshot of one of the Dynetics CUGAR interceptor drones in recent tests of the MFP system at Eglin Air Force Base., DARPA While DARPA isn’t releasing any specifics in terms of the system’s flight capabilities, Avicola did tell us that the Dynetics CUGAR interceptors are capable of staying in the air “on the order of tens of minutes.” Those figures are different for the MORFIUS interceptors, and any of the interceptors’ ranges would obviously be dependent on a wide range of factors in each use case. Avicola also added that the Dynetics interceptors can fly out to their maximum engagement range within “tens of seconds.” Once in the air, they have enough endurance to use all of their effectors “under most engagement timelines.” “The endurance of those aircraft is designed to allow them to do a complete set of engagements over the course of a tube launch, and then land themselves,” Avicola said. Once an interceptor has defeated an incoming threat or multiple threats, it will then escort the vehicle from which it was launched until it runs out of battery power and lands. “What they aren’t really designed to do is to be long-term escorts.” Even each individual interceptor is capable of having multiple engagements with hostile drones in a single launch, carrying multiple “effector tubes” full of what has been described as “pink goo” or “strong, stringy streamers” that can disable a hostile drone’s propulsion system. The Dynetics interceptors’ propeller-clogging streamers can disable a wide variety of UAV systems, including fixed wing drones with both pusher and puller propellers and even quadcopters with shrouded rotors. “It’s pretty effective,” Avicola said. “The effector material is basically following the air flow. If the air flow is getting through the cage, then so is the effector material.” Avicola said there is a size limit on how large of a drone the stringy effectors are capable of disabling, however. “If the vehicle gets so big that its motors can just overpower the effector material, then obviously we lose effectiveness.” The effector material is reported to be capable of bringing down both Group 1 and Group 2 drones as defined by the DOD. Group 1 UAVs include traditional quadcopter designs as well as hand-launched fixed wing aircraft up to 20lbs in weight and with a nominal altitude of around 1,200 ft above ground level (AGL). Group 2, meanwhile, consists of larger, mostly catapult-launched drones with weights up to 55lbs and that can reach nominal altitudes of up to 3,500ft AGL. DOD The exact capabilities of the Lockheed Martin MORFIUS in terms of which types of drones its HPM system can defeat or disrupt remain unknown, but the limitations of any one interceptor and its effectors or directed energy systems are exactly why DARPA and its DOD partners would want a system capable of carrying and launching multiple types of interceptors. Avicola added that one of the goals of the DARPA program was to build a system that is flexible enough to use different types of interceptors as well as be combined with other CUAS solutions or sensors already at a higher technological readiness level to create a multi-layered drone defense. While the Lockheed Martin MORFIUS and Dynetics CUGAR interceptors were tested in the demonstration, the MFP system was designed specifically to be able to accommodate a variety of interceptor payloads. “Part of that was to demonstrate that we could command and control heterogeneous interceptors so that the system was flexible and does not necessarily have to use just this pair of interceptors,” Avicola said. With the new Mobile Force Protection system, DARPA and the DOD are clearly going for a modular anti-drone approach that would allow them to add in new and expanded capabilities as UAV systems evolve, all unified by a common launch and command and control system. The Dynetics CUGAR and the Lockheed Martin MORFIUS are only two out of a wide range of drone interceptors available today, with more being developed all the time. Given that the MORFIUS is based on the modular ALTIUS-600, which can also loiter for up to four hours and has a maximum range of hundreds of miles, these systems could theoretically provide counter-drone screening for prolonged periods of time overhead everything from convoys and forward operating bases. It is becoming increasingly clear that a layered drone defense is what will be needed to protect U.S. forces who are increasingly under threat by small drone attacks. Short-range air defense capabilities are finally among the DOD’s top priorities, and to that end, systems like DARPA’s MFP could become more prevalent on the battlefield in the very near future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 9, 2021",South Korea Is Looking At Building A Way Bigger Carrier Than We Thought,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The South Korean shipbuilding industry has shown off a range of models of the country’s planned first aircraft carrier , now known as CVX, which is intended to operate F-35B stealth fighters . While a previous plan, referred to as LPX-II , suggested the South Korean Navy was eying a revised amphibious assault ship design better suited to carry those short takeoff and vertical landing-capable jets, the revised CVX project is an altogether more ambitious aircraft carrier. Among the latest proposals are a vessel with a new ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramp, as well as twin island superstructures. The models in question are on display at the International Maritime Defense Industry Exhibition 2021 (MADEX 2021) that’s taking place in Busan, South Korea. One of these is from Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), which received a contract for conceptual design study in late 2019 and it is a twin island design akin to that of U.K. Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth class . Visitors to MADEX look over a model of the rival CVN design from DSME., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The new HHI proposal also has a ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramp over the bow for STOVL operations. The company has also been pitching a bow ramp on its carrier for some years now , but this new model clearly represents a significantly evolved design. HHI says its carrier design would be 850 feet long, have a 200-foot-wide beam, and have a fully loaded displacement of around 45,000 tons. By comparison, the Queen Elizabeth class is 920 feet long, has a beam of 240 feet, and a displacement of 65,000 tons. A platform at the rear of the Hyundai CVN design for vertical takeoff and landing drones. , YOUTUBE SCREENCAP A computer-generated graphic showing the adapted well deck for USVs and UUVs., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The Hyundai model is displayed with F-35Bs, AH-1Z Cobra attack helicopters, of which a potential transfer to Korea has been approved , plus H-60 series helicopters arranged on deck, as well as what looks like a Leonardo Merlin helicopter, a type not currently used by South Korea. Hyundai says that it will be able to operate up to around 20 F-35Bs. A computer-generated graphic from Hyundai Heavy Industries showing F-35Bs inside a CVX hangar., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP There’s also an auxiliary deck area at the very rear of the ship for operating small rotary-wing drones and an adapted well deck from which to deploy unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). The Hyundai carrier design has two elevators, one on each side, including one between the islands, to move aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar. However, the Hyundai design is not the only South Korean carrier proposal on show at MADEX. The South Korean Navy, formally known as the Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN), itself displayed a model at MADEX, with much in common with the DSME proposal Meanwhile, a rival design from Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) is on display that also utilizes a twin-island arrangement, but lacks the ‘ski jump,’ instead having a flight deck that has more in common with U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships. The vessel would be 860 feet long, 150 feet wide, and would have a displacement of around 45,000 tons, according to that company. DSME also says its carrier would be able to embark 16 F-35Bs and six medium helicopters simultaneously, with hangar space for 12 of the jet fighters. It has two elevators on the starboard side to move those aircraft between decks. In the course of MADEX, DSME signed a memorandum of understanding with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri, which would provide the Korean firm with technological expertise derived from its own Trieste class design, a landing helicopter dock with F-35B capability that’s now being built for the Italian Navy and which also features twin islands. A model of the CVN proposal from DSME., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The DSME vessel is closer in concept to the kinds of ‘evolved amphibious assault ship’ designs that had been expected, including older LPX-II concept art. Nevertheless, it still represents a considerably larger and more capable ship than the South Korean Navy’s current Dokdo class landing platform helicopter (LPH), which is 652 feet long, 101 feet wide, and has a displacement of only 19,500 tons. A computer-generated graphic from DSME showing the twin-island arrangement and locations of the elevators., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP In the past, it’s been reported that the CVX, whichever design is chosen, will be equipped with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar of the same type that will be used in the new KDDX destroyer. It is expected to be protected by Haegung (K-SAAM) surface-to-air missiles and close-in weapons systems (CIWS). The latter is expected to be an indigenous design developed under the CIWS-II program . There’s also evidence that Seoul is mulling another possible carrier design at the other end of the scale, which would provide the option to move from STOVL operations to short take off but arrested recovery (STOBAR), combining an angled deck, ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramp, and arrester gear; this is the same configuration currently used by China , India , and Russia on their in-service carriers. This would permit non-STOVL aircraft to be embarked, perhaps including a carrier version of the indigenous KF-21 new-generation fighter. The land-based KF-21 was first rolled out in prototype form last April , but more recent reports have called into question the actual state of progress on the design, suggesting it may still be some way off from being finished. A STOBAR configuration could also potentially allow larger drones to be operated, too. The KF-21 prototype during its rollout ceremony in April., MBC NEWS SCREENCAP For some years now, South Korea has been planning to introduce an aircraft carrier capability to the ROKN and last year the service formally confirmed that it would introduce a vessel capable of embarking fixed-wing jets. Earlier this year, the project received the name CVX. In past there has even been discussion of small or medium carriers equipped for catapult launch, although this equipment seemed to be absent from the proposals at MADEX, suggesting that that ROKN has settled on a carrier that is STOVL capable, larger than the Dokdo class LPH, but not as ambitious as the kinds of catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) warships currently on in service with France and the United States, and under development in China . Nevertheless, the Korean CVX proposals are still smaller than the two that China already operates, while Beijing’s third carrier is set to be bigger still . The Dokdo , nearest camera, sails with U.S. Navy ships from the Boxer and Bonhomme Richard Amphibious Ready Groups during a joint exercise., U.S. Marine Corps/Cpl. Darien J. Bjorndal, 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit With considerable naval development in the last two decades, a true aircraft carrier (as opposed to an aviation-capable amphibious assault ship) would be the next logical step and would be a significant symbol of Seoul’s maritime power, helping it keep pace, to some degree, with regional rivals China and Japan. A carrier would also provide the centerpiece of a naval battle group also including destroyers, frigates, and submarines, all of which are produced domestically. In case of a conflict with North Korea, the CVX would be able to launch offensive missions from standoff range using its stealthy F-35s, as well as coordinating anti-submarine warfare or amphibious operations. But there is an argument to be made that an aircraft carrier is otherwise not of huge value in the kind of conflict that could be waged with the North, although proponents point to the fact it could be less vulnerable than traditional airfields as well as being better able to defend more distant interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The carrier could also undertake secondary missions such as humanitarian relief, as well. However, the utility of a STOVL carrier depends on Seoul’s acquisition of F-35Bs in addition to the conventional takeoff and landing F-35As, 40 of which are on order for the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF). The air force had hoped to secure funds for 20 more F-35As, but it’s possible that these could be swapped for F-35Bs, or a follow-on order could comprise both variants. So far, however, no order has been placed. The adoption of the F-35B would also provide the opportunity for closer cooperation with the U.S. Marine Corps, which has already deployed its own examples of the jet to the Asia-Pacific region aboard amphibious assault ships and has F-35Bs permanently stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan. Potentially, Marine Corps jets could be used to increase the numbers of deployed jets aboard the CVX, in the same way, that they have been embedded within the Carrier Strike Group for HMS Queen Elizabeth . Meanwhile, aircraft and units from the ROKAF already frequently exercise with their counterparts from the U.S. Marine Corps and other U.S. services.

Steven Schneider There are also parallels between the ROKN designs and the kinds of studies the U.S. Navy is looking at in terms of a potential future class of light aircraft carriers , or CVLs. The service recently confirmed it had been examining designs based on the aviation-focused America class amphibious assault ships and a “light” derivative of the new Ford class supercarriers, among others. The acquisition of F-35Bs is expected to cost Seoul $2.7 billion, but is just part of the investment that will be needed fulfill its carrier ambitions, with the warship reported to have a likely price tag of around $1.83 billion, although this seems highly optimistic. In addition, there will be considerable manpower and training investments involved, too, as well as the recurring costs of operating and maintaining the carriers and their aircraft. This is a significant financial commitment for Seoul, which had a total approved defense budget of $52.84 billion in 2021. That would make the F-35Bs alone equivalent to 5 percent of that expenditure, although it should be noted that defense spending is on the increase . If all goes to plan, however, the ROKN could have a carrier ready for service by the early 2030s. There is much work to be completed before then, however. Min Kyong Hoon, General Manager Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering at DSME, told Naval News that he expects a design contract to be awarded to the successful bidder at the end of this year, or in early 2022. That is expected to be followed by another three years of detailed design work before a construction contract might be issued.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 26, 2021",Air Force Corrects Top Official’s Statement On B-21 Bomber Progress (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The modernization of the U.S. Air Force’s bomber branch is gathering pace, with the news that the first two examples of the so-far highly secretive Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider stealth bomber have been completed. As the service prepares to start testing the two new flying-wing bombers, it has also confirmed that it has no plans to retire additional examples of its aging B-1Bs until deliveries of the Raider begin, scheduled for some time in the mid-2020s, at the earliest. That reflects wider concerns in the service about whether it actually has enough bombers in its current fleet to deal with the kinds of high-end threats that it could face today. Update: After this story was published, the Air Force corrected the remarks that Darlene Costello, the Air Force’s Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics , had made at the hearing on June 8 regarding the status of the two B-21 Raider stealth bomber prototypes now under construction. Contrary to Costello’s earlier comments, the service says that the two aircraft remain “in production.” The latest progress updates on the B-21 program, and the bomber force at large, came during a House Armed Services Committee hearing yesterday, during which Darlene Costello, the Air Force’s Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, revealed that the first two B-21s have now been completed at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. A first flight was originally planned for December of this year, though there have long been concerns that this could get pushed back and earlier this year it was confirmed the Air Force now expects the rollout of the aircraft in early 2022. It would then make its first flight in the middle of the same year. In the meantime, the Air Force has not said what exactly it will be doing with the two brand-new B-21s, but there will surely be extensive ground tests as well as simulations. A now well-known artist’s rendering of the B-21 prepared for the U.S. Air Force., U.S. Air Force It seems clear, however, that there are real concerns the pace of the B-21 program could end up frustrating the Air Force’s plans to field a future force of 225 bombers, made up exclusively of the B-21, plus Cold War-era B-52s that will be significantly upgraded . The current fleet comprises 20 B-2s , 61 B-1s, and 76 B-52s — a total of 157 aircraft, although not all of these are available at any given time. The B-1 force will soon be reduced to 45 examples, bringing the total to 142 airframes. Lieutenant General David S. Nahom, the Air Force’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and Programs, confirmed the planned figure of 225 bombers to the panel. With all B-1s and B-2 Spirit stealth bombers to be retired, simple arithmetic would provide a force comprising the 76 B-52s that are in service today, plus 149 B-21s. It’s important to remember, however, that this last figure has not been confirmed and it also presumes that the B-52 fleet size remains unchanged. That last figure is more or less in line with the 145 B-21s that Frank Kendall, President Joe Biden’s nominee to become the next Secretary of the Air Force, recently outlined as the minimum required for the service. Prior to that, the Air Force had only said it anticipated building at least 100 B-21s. “We can’t get the B-21 fast enough,” Lieutenant General S. Clinton Hinote, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategy, Integration, and Requirements, Headquarters, told the panel. “The risk in the bomber portfolio is high,” he continued. “We’ve got to do better. We’ve got to accelerate the B-21 capability as quickly as we can.” Construction of a B-21 Raider Environmental Protection Shelter prototype at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, in February this year., U.S. Air Force/Airman First Class Quentin Marx In its recent budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year, the Air Force asked for $2.873 billion for continued work on the B-21, adding an extra $30 million compared to the 2021 Fiscal Year request, which it says is needed “to prepare for initial production” of the bombers. After testing at Edwards Air Force Base, California , the first operational B-21s are scheduled to enter service at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. That initial operating location will be followed by Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, currently the home of the B-2s, as well as Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, which currently hosts B-1s. The Air Force is currently in the process of retiring from service 17 of the most worn-out B-1s as it reduces its Lancer force to 45 aircraft, pending the arrival of the Raider. This number, according to Nahom, will not be further reduced until B-21s become available as direct replacements. “We have no intention of going below 45, because the combatant commanders need that firepower in the next five, seven, 10 years, until the B-21s start showing up in the numbers we need them,” Nahom declared. That would seem to put an end to persistent efforts to divest further B-1s, the entire fleet of which was recently grounded due to a problem with the fuel system . The first of 17 B-1Bs to be sent to the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona earlier this year., U.S. AIR FORCE Heavy combat usage in Afghanistan and the Middle East in recent years has taken a toll on the B-1 fleet and Himote admitted that the cost of operating those 17 B-1s that are being removed from the inventory outweighed any benefit they provided the Air Force. Once the B-1 fleet has been reduced to 45 aircraft, its availability should improve, Nahom said, since the most maintenance-intensive aircraft will have been removed. As well as improvements to serviceability, these last B-1Bs will also see out their final years of service with some significant advances in terms of weapons, with plans to add new hypersonic missiles and other ordnance carried on a number of external pylons , as well as a new focus on anti-ship missions . A Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) is prepared for loading aboard a B-1B at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Damon Kasberg These wider plans, of course, are dependent on the B-21 schedule and officials are intent on bringing the new bomber into service without relying upon the concurrency that has plagued the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Concurrency means putting something into production before it’s been fully tested, and Costello said it wasn’t part of the plan for the Raider. There remains the possibility, of course, that some changes might have to be made to the B-21 in light of testing, which presents another risk of delay in the program. Darlene Costello, the Air Force’s Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, speaks with senior leaders at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts., U.S. Air Force/Todd Maki Only once B-21s are in service will that decision be taken to potentially ramp up production more quickly to meet the demands of Air Force commanders, Costello said. The benefits for the wider Air Force could be significant, too, with the B-21 program understood to be also leveraging work on other, smaller designs, including the RQ-180, an important drone project we discussed in detail in this article . Until the B-21 is finally unveiled, many aspects of the aircraft itself remain a mystery, and Air Force officials have been tight-lipped about its exact capabilities. For instance, we don’t yet know if all the aircraft will be nuclear-capable. Currently, all B-2s can carry nuclear weapons, none of the B-1s can, and dozens of the B-52s have had their nuclear capability removed. This factor becomes more important when we consider that the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) imposes limits on the number of certain nuclear weapons delivery systems, including heavy bombers, that the United States and Russian can have. However, this treaty will no longer be valid as of 2026 and it’s not clear what will happen after that. Armorers prepare to load AGM-86 Air-Launched Cruise Missiles on a B-52H Stratofortress at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Lillian Miller Whatever types of weapons they will end up carrying, the B-21 is set to provide a step-change in capability for the Air Force, which now looks likely to overhaul its ability to penetrate highly contested airspace by trading 20 B-2s for close to 150 B-21s, which will also replace the hard-worked B-1s, too. In the meantime, however, the service is going to have to make do with a bomber force that is significantly smaller than that which its officials say they need.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 13, 2021",Supersonic Aircraft Tracked Off San Diego Coincided With Mysterious “Skyquake”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Residents of San Diego County in South California, as well as other nearby areas, heard and felt at least one loud boom late yesterday. The U.S. Geological Survey did not detect any earthquake activity at the time of this incident, which occurred at around 8:20 PM local time on June 8th, 2021, and that some are referring to as a “ skyquake .” There are strong indications that this was a sonic boom and flight tracking data available online does show an unidentified plane flying at supersonic speeds off the coast in a general area that regularly hosts military training exercises , among other military aviation activity , at around the same time. A U.S. Navy supercarrier was also training in the area yesterday. The San Diego Union-Tribune has reported that people were talking about hearing and feeling the boom in areas as far east as El Cajon, a city in San Diego County, around 17 miles inland from the Pacific coastline, and as far as south as Tijuana, just over the border in Mexico. KMFB-TV , a local CBS affiliate in San Diego, said that the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) had recorded a minor earthquake , which is not common in the region, at around 5:37 PM local time, but nothing at around 8:20 PM. Online flight tracking software recorded the following route, which was taken by an aircraft flying at supersonic speeds around the time of the reported “skyquake” on June 8, 2021. The dashed line seen heading off toward the northeast is actually a gap in the data and connects to an unrelated track in France., ADS-B Exchange Sonic booms are hardly unheard of in the area. There are a number of formalized U.S. military test and training areas off the coast of San Diego, as well as further to the north toward Los Angeles, where fast-flying fighter jets often operate and where high-speed flight testing, including of hypersonic vehicles , has taken place in the past. The Navy, in particular, also regularly conducts training in parts of the Pacific just off the coast of Mexico’s Baja Peninsula . This includes workups for aircraft carrier strike groups , including their air wings, ahead of deployments. In addition to the fighter jets flying from these carriers’ decks, these exercises can involve contractor-operated and military “red air” aggressor jets that are also capable of hitting supersonic speeds. This often includes these adversaries flying supersonic profiles meant to simulate incoming cruise missiles. It’s certainly important to also note that the Nimitz class carrier USS Carl Vinson was operating in the area yesterday. The ship had left San Diego two days earlier and returned off the coast today. Online flight tracking data available through ADS-B Exchange shows an unidentified aircraft flying off the coast of San Diego, as well as Baja, at altitudes between 20,000 and 25,000 feet, last night. The data shows a recorded speed of 967 knots at 8:27 PM, certainly fast enough to produce a sonic boom at the altitudes in question. The proximity of the track to the shore also lends credence to the boom and associated shockwave being heard and felt across the San Diego County Area. The transponder broadcasting that information appears to have been miscoded and the code in question, 249249, has been associated with various aircraft in the past, including types not capable of supersonic flight. As such, it does not offer any obvious clues as to the type of aircraft, or who may have been operating it, recorded off the coast of Southern California last night. The track itself is very similar to what we see from aggressor jets that fly against U.S. Navy ships in the area regularly. You can see examples of this in great detail here . The difference being, in this case, the track was offset closer to the Baja Peninsula than normal. Generally, the military aggressors are not trackable and a miscoded transponder is not very suspicious regardless. Contractor aggressors usually are trackable, at least for certain portions of their flight. F-21 Kfir and Mk58 Hawker Hunters from ATAC that often play adersary for Navy ships training in the SoCal range complex. The F-21s are supersonic capable. Navy aggressors and test fighters also take part in these exercises. , Tyler Rogoway The beginning of the track also seems to indicate that the aircraft in question took off from Naval Air Station North Island , part of Naval Base Coronado in San Diego, which is where high-performance military aggressors working in the area typically operate from, as well as a number of contractor aggressors. The War Zone has already reached out to the public affairs office at Naval Base Coronado for more information. Separately, a public affairs officer at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar , which is situated some 12 miles northeast of downtown San Diego, told The War Zone that the only aircraft flying from that base at the time “were KC-130s , and they are definitely not producing a sonic boom sound.” The Miramar public affairs office also directed The War Zone to contact Camp Pendleton , another Marine Corps base further to the northwest, where artillery training has been going on this week. “Depending on atmospheric conditions, the sound of the explosions may be amplified and heard up to 50 miles away. Although we cannot account for every loud noise heard in Southern California, what you are hearing may be a result of our training,” a public affairs officer at Camp Pendleton told us in a separate statement. However, it seems unlikely that artillery fire, even if it was audible across a broad area, would have caused the earthquake-like shaking felt across so much of San Diego County and adjacent areas. The reported incident last night would seem overly brief to have been associated with training involving either howitzers or rocket artillery systems , where multiple rounds are generally fired in succession, as well. The video below shows Marines training with 155mm M777 howitzers at Camp Pendleton in 2013, including the firing of multiple rounds in succession. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NmpWalXkTfM A spokesperson for Naval Air Facility El Centro , which is located around 85 miles east of San Diego, also told The War Zone that “we do have squadrons come out here for detachment and training,” but “currently, there are no fixed wing aircraft at the installation.” They added that “operations over the San Diego area are outside of our controlled airspace and we do not have the means to monitor that area.” When reached for comment, a public affairs officer at Vandenberg Space Force Base , situated northwest of Los Angeles, said they had no information about the incident to the south and were not even aware that it had happened. Vandenberg regularly supports missile tests and space launches , among other activities . However, missile and space launches from that base typically prompt the issuing of warning notices to airmen and mariners for certain dates. There do not appear to have been any such notices issued for June 8th with relation to Vandenberg, though there are ones active for upcoming planned launch events later this month, as seen in the Tweets below. The War Zone contacted a number of other U.S. military facilities in the region, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), about the “skyquake,” as well. We have also sent out inquiries about two other as-yet-unexplained “skyquakes” that residents of the San Diego County area experienced earlier this year, on February 16 and March 10, respectively. It is, of course, important to note that there are no indications one way or another that any of these incidents are necessarily linked to each other. That being said, the public affairs officer at Miramar told The War Zone said that F/A-18 Hornet fighters were flying from their base on February 16, but that they had landed well before the reported boom and associated shaking. Similarly, on March 10, the only flight activity at Miramar was the departure of a pair of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters nearly an hour after reports of the incident that day had emerged. Unexplained sonic booms , as well as other rumblings in the sky , are not new to California, either. There was a particular surge of such reports in the state in the 1990s, leading to speculation that they could be related to top-secret aircraft capable of flying at extreme speeds. Whatever the case, people living in San Diego County and surrounding areas have certainly been experiencing something. “Yes, I heard it. No, I don’t know what it was,” San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria wrote on Twitter after the most recent episode. “I’ll share if I get any information.” Given the presence of Carl Vinson in the area at the time, the familiar track, and its close proximity to the shore, in this case, it sure looks like the culprit of the boom was a normal adversary supersonic profile flown at a Navy ship, likely part of a carrier strike group undergoing routine training. We will also certainly continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway"
Brett Tingley,"Updated on Aug 19, 2019",The Y-12 Nuclear Development Site Has Deployed Its First Anti-Drone System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To help protect against the rising threat of drone incursions above sensitive infrastructure, the National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA) Office of Defense Nuclear Security (DNS) has deployed its first counter-unmanned aircraft system (C-UAS) at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It’s unclear exactly what that system consists of, but it is described as being able to “detect, identify, and track potentially malicious UAS threats.” Note, however, that the description does not include any mention of being able to actually neutralize or disable drones that the system detects. Nevertheless, the system is described as being able to “counter all unauthorized unmanned aircraft systems” in Y-12’s airspace, so it remains possible that the system may include more robust defenses to bring down any potentially hostile drones it detects and that those details aren’t being disclosed. The NNSA is known to not divulge more information than it has to about its operations, to say the least . In a press release , Teresa Robbins of the NNSA Production Office (NPO), which oversees Y-12, said the new C-UAS system was deployed to help mitigate the threat posed by potential drone incursions. “The National Nuclear Security Administration Production Office is announcing this deployment and the airspace restriction to the public to minimize the threat of unauthorized UAS flights over Y-12. This will enhance our ability to effectively protect this vital national security facility,” Robbins said. The Y-12 facility oversees nuclear maintenance and production tasks such as the storage, processing, and manufacturing of uranium and the production of raw uranium products for use in U.S. Navy vessels. In addition, Y-12 helps support international nuclear nonproliferation programs. The Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, DOE The Department of Energy (DOE) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) previously announced in 2017 that drone operations are prohibited within 400 feet of the boundaries of several DOE facilities including Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Site. It’s unknown if the deployment of the new anti-drone system at Y-12 is in response to specific incidents or if the facility is merely following recent federal guidance aimed at meeting the drone threat head-on. However, Steven Wyatt, public affairs manager for the NNSA, responded to inquiries for details from local news outlets that the administration is “not at liberty to discuss any incidents involving suspected drone overflights at Y-12.” The FAA’s UAS Sightings Report database contains 13 drone sightings in the Knoxville, Tennessee area between 2015 and 2020. The Y-12 facility lies some 20 miles to the west of Knoxville, separated from the city by the Clinch River. Of those 13 reports, at least four were reported west of Knoxville, in the direction of Oak Ridge. One such report reads: PRELIM INFO FROM FAA OPS: KNOXVILLE, TN/UAS INCIDENT/0928E/KNOXVILLE ATCT ADVISED DIAMOND DA40, MBT – TYS, REPORTED A SMALL UAS 500 FEET OFF THE RIGHT WING WHILE NE BOUND AT 4,000 FEET 8 NW TYS. NO EVASIVE ACTION TAKEN. KNOXVILLE COUNTY DISPATCH NOTIFIED. According to documents released by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to friend of The War Zone Douglas D. Johnson, there were 57 drone incursion incidents reported above nuclear facilities between December 2014 to October 2019. In 49 out of those 57 cases, the NRC reported the incidents as “Closed Unresolved,” meaning the drones’ operators were never identified. Some of the nuclear facilities that reported drone sightings include Limerick Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania, Perry Nuclear Power Plant in Ohio, Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California, and Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station outside of Phoenix, the site of a deeply troubling “drone-a-palooza” that you can read our exclusive reporting on here . In addition to nuclear power plants, some of the drone incursions reported by the NRC were above spent nuclear fuel storage sites. A waste management facility at Y-12, DOE While the exact details of Y-12’s C-UAS system are unknown, some of the details released to the public seem to follow anti-drone guidelines issued by the DHS in 2020. For one, the plant is installing “No Drone Zone” signage around its perimeter in order to educate the public about the airspace restrictions in place, as well as creating social media outreach with the same message. “NNSA welcomes assistance from the local community and UAS operators to help ensure the safety and protection of the Y-12 site and its personnel from unauthorized UAS activities,” Y-12’s press release states. Both of those policies were mentioned specifically by the DHS’s “Protecting Against the Threat of Unmanned Aerial Systems” report . Drone security considerations recommended by the DHS’s “Protecting Against the Threat of Unmanned Aerial Systems” report., CISA.gov The NNSA has previously deployed counter-drone systems at other critical DOE sites such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. “We needed a system to counter threats ranging from on-site disruption by protestors to intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance of NNSA sites, plants, and labs,” Lewis Monroe, the NNSA’s Director of Security Operations and Programmatic Planning, said about the Los Alamos anti-drone system at the time. Like at Los Alamos, protests against American nuclear activities have previously been held at Y-12, so it’s possible that these were taken into consideration when deploying the new drone system in addition to broader security concerns. The announcement about the new anti-drone system at the Y-12 National Security Complex is but the latest in a long string of developments that show the U.S. federal government and Department of Defense (DOD) are taking steps to address the growing threat posed by small drones. Aside from above critical nuclear facilities , drone incursions have been reported in military training areas , around anti-ballistic missile installations , as well as in mass sightings over populated civilian areas . Small drones have even been weaponized specifically for targeting energy infrastructure, as was the case in 2019 when the world’s largest oil processing facility was hit by a devastating drone attack , resulting in a significant drop in global oil production. While kinetic threats remain a major concern, low-end drones’ ability to collect intelligence, including on wireless networks at a certain location, is also a serious issue. With the addition of this new anti-drone system at Y-12, the DOE and NNSA are now demonstrating just how seriously they are taking the threat of small drones. Given that U.S. military leaders have declared the United States no longer has air superiority for the first time in seven decades specifically due to the now-widespread use of small- and medium-sized drones by a whole range of enemy actors, the drone threat is proving itself to be one of the most serious security issues of our time.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 29, 2021",Mockup Of China’s Stealthy FC-31 Fighter Appears On Full-Size Aircraft Carrier Testing Rig,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Less than a week ago, we got our best view so far of China’s latest, in-construction aircraft carrier, which will feature catapults for launching aircraft, rather than a “ski jump”. Now, an apparent mockup of the enigmatic Shenyang FC-31 stealth fighter , or a derivative of it, has been spotted for the first time at the country’s land-based carrier test facility. The image in question shows the FC-31-like model positioned on the full-size mock aircraft carrier that’s located in Wuhan, China, and is used to evaluate aircraft for potential use at sea. Although undated, the photo is, according to Chinese military aviation expert Andreas Rupprecht, fairly recent. The familiar configuration of the FC-31, with its twin canted tailfins, twin engines and high-mounted cockpit is clearly apparent from the rear aspect, although it’s exact relationship to the FC-31 is unclear. The image also shows that the island on the carrier mockup itself has been updated, likely to represent the one for the forthcoming Type 003 carrier — this will be the third carrier for the People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN, and the first one to have a distinctly domestic design. The same photo showed mockups of J-15 carrier fighters , as well as one of a Z-18 series helicopter, a standard heavyweight rotary-wing type in PLAN service and a frequent visitor to its carriers. The first prototype of the FC-31 takes part in the Zhuhai air show in 2014., wc/Wikimedia Commons While the Type 003 has been gradually taking shape observed by satellites and aerial photographers, the FC-31 program remains, in many ways, something of a mystery. However, there have been rumors for years now that the aircraft might serve as the basis for a future carrier-capable fighter, a stealthy complement to the J-15, a Chinese-made Sukhoi Flanker derivative that’s in service with the PLAN today, and which goes to sea aboard its first two carriers, Liaoning and Shandong . “Development continues on the smaller FC-31/J-31 for export or as a future naval fighter for the PLAN’s next class of aircraft carriers,” according to an annual report on Chinese military developments that the Pentagon sent to Congress in 2020. It’s worth noting, of course, that the FC-31 designation is applied to an export-optimized land -based fighter. There is speculation that the PLAN’s carrier-capable version could be designated J-21, or J-35, but this is entirely hypothetical at this stage. However, after years of speculation that there were plans to navalize the Shenyang design, the latest photo provides strong evidence that this is, at the very least, being seriously addressed and it would match with the Pentagon’s assessment. Adapting a modern fighter jet like the FC-31 for carrier operations is a considerable undertaking. Typically, it may involve aerodynamic changes, optimizing the aircraft for the different angles of attack encountered on takeoff and landing, perhaps including additional high-lift devices on the wing. The flight-control system will need adaptation too, and then there are potential structural changes to reinforce the airframe for the stresses of launch and recovery. Invariably, the undercarriage will need to be beefed up and a catapult launch bar and arrester hook are requirements, too. More extensive use of composite materials may be required to prevent corrosion. Finally, for stowage on board ship, the wing panels would require folding mechanisms. An artist’s impression of the FC-31 and the J-20 over the carrier Liaoning . , AP Meanwhile, what little we know about the FC-31 so far is related almost entirely to its export derivative, developed by Shenyang as a private venture, while the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) opted for the larger Chengdu J-20 , which entered frontline service in early 2019. Both these jets incorporate low-observable features and fielding a stealth fighter aboard its carriers would provide the PLAN with a significant new capability to match its power-projection ambitions. A different aspect of the dummy carrier at Wuhan, with the FC-31 mockup seen closest to the ‘island’., via Twitter The FC-31 first appeared in scale model form in 2011 and a demonstrator aircraft took to the air in October 2012. Since then, only one more prototype has been confirmed, this featuring a number of improvements over the original, including aerodynamic refinements, among them smaller “clipped” and swept vertical tails, a less angular overall appearance, and cleaner surfaces. The powerplant exchanged the Russian-supplied RD-93 engines for a pair of indigenous WS-13E turbofan engines. This second example made its first flight in December 2016. The reworked second FC-31 prototype., CHINESE INTERNET On the hardware side, therefore, there is little that’s official to point to the naval ambitions for the FC-31. However, in December 2019, a silhouette of the FC-31 appeared on the Weibo microblogging site of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — of which Shenyang is a subsidiary — described as a “future carrierborne fighter.” Days later, Shenyang announced it was developing a ‘new’ fighter, leading to speculation this was the long-awaited FC-31 carrier variant, although no such specifics were provided. While unconfirmed, it’s been suggested that this new fighter may receive WS-19 turbofan engines and have a maximum takeoff weight around 30 tons, putting it in a similar weight category to the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet . The aircraft will also almost certainly be tailored for catapult launch, with the Type 003 design expected to be equipped with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), rather than relying on the “ski jump” ramps used on the PLAN’s previous two carriers. All in all, however, there is very little so far that’s confirmed about the PLAN’s future carrier fighter, which makes the appearance of the FC-31 or FC-31 derivative mockup at Wuhan all the more interesting. A mockup of the KJ-600 carrier-based airborne early warning aircraft had also appeared on Wuhan’s land-locked carrier by at least 2018. An actual prototype of this plane was spotted undergoing flight trials last summer . What’s clear is that the PLAN does have a need for a new carrier-based multirole fighter. The J-15s that are currently in use, which are derived from the Soviet-designed Su-33 Flanker -D, have been criticized in the past on account of their “unstable flight control system,” which was blamed for two fatal accidents in 2016. Moreover, it will always be hamstrung when operating from the “ski jump” takeoff ramps on the PLAN’s first two carriers, which limits the weights at which it can be launched and, as a result, its maximum fuel and weapons loads. In an effort to increase the total payload of fuel and weapons with which the J-15 can launch from the carrier, China has been working on a version that will be suitable for catapult launch , from the Type 003 and subsequent PLAN flattops. Currently the only carrier fighter in the PLAN inventory is the J-15., IMAGINECHINA VIA AP IMAGES At one time, it was expected that J-15 production might wind up after 24 series-production examples had been built, work that was completed in mid-2017. However, in early 2020, it was revealed that production of another batch of J-15s had begun, suggesting a requirement for some kind of interim equipment for the PLAN’s burgeoning carrier force. Meanwhile, work is also underway on improved versions of the J-15, including the J-15T demonstrator with catapult compatibility, and the two-seat J-15D with wingtip electronic warfare jamming pods, which is expected to operate in a role similar to the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler . Ultimately, however, the J-15 represents Cold War technology, albeit improved with more modern Chinese avionics and weaponry, giving it improved multirole capability compared to the Su-33 that the design was based on. With that in mind, a long-term successor is probably viewed as a necessity for China’s fast-expanding navy . Even if the PLAN is now looking seriously at some kind of a derivative of the FC-31 for its future carrier air wings, that’s not to say that navalizing the jet will be straightforward, and developing a first indigenous fighter in this class is an ambitious undertaking, even for China. Currently, only three nations have indigenous carrier-based fighter jets in frontline service. Despite the hurdles ahead, however, the last few weeks have shown clearly that China’s carrier capabilities are developing at an impressive pace.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 22, 2021",Why The Destroyer USS Howard Left Port Flying A Bright Red Flag Adorned With An Asian Dragon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We here at The War Zone are always on the lookout for notable and unique flags flying from U.S. Navy warships, which often have some very interesting history behind them . Yesterday, our Twitter contact @cjr1321 spotted the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Howard leaving San Diego flying a bright red flag emblazoned with an ornate East Asian-style dragon and the word “victory” in large gold-colored letters. @cjr1321’s images were subsequently posted on one of our favorite twitter accounts, @warshipcam . After close review, the flag appears to be based on parts of the ship’s coat of arms, which makes references to its namesake, Medal of Honor recipient U.S. Marine Corps First Sergeant Jimmie E. Howard, as well as a Wickes class destroyer of the same name that served during World War II. The current USS Howard , also known by its hull number DDG-83, is a Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyer homeported in San Diego and assigned to the Navy’s Pacific Fleet as part of Destroyer Squadron Nine . The destroyer was commissioned in 2001, becoming the fifth Flight IIA subvariant and the 33rd ship in the class, overall, to enter service. USS Howard leaves San Diego on June 7, 2021, flying its red flag., @cjr1321 A better look at the flag with the dragon and the word “victory.”, @cjr1321 A dragon that is very similar to the one seen on the flag the ship was flying as it departed San Diego, as well as the word “victory,” also appears on Howard ‘s official coat of arms. The word victory on the flag appears to simply reference the ship’s motto, which appears on a scroll in the coat of arms, and is “Ready for Victory.” USS Howard ‘s official coat of arms., USN The meaning behind the dragon, which has become a symbol generally associated with the ship , is more involved. “The oriental dragon denotes service in the Pacific and the fighting spirit demonstrated by the platoon under the leadership of Gunnery Sergeant Howard,” according to an entry on the website of The Institute of Heraldry (TIOH), a U.S. Army-run organization that manages the design of heraldic devices and unit insignia across the services. That latter part refers to actions during the Vietnam War that led to Jimmie E. Howard being awarded the Medal of Honor. Jimmie E. Howard joined the Marines in 1950. Two years later, he was sent to Korea to join the 1st Marine Regiment’s 4.2-inch mortar company as a forward observer. 1st Marines had been fighting on the Peninsula since 1950, taking part in the amphibious landings at Inchon and then in the grueling Chosin Reservoir Campaign . Then-Corporal Howard was awarded a Silver Star , as well as for his actions between Aug. 12 and 15, 1952, where he helped call in 4.2-inch mortar fire on hostile forces from an observation post while it was under direct attack, even after being briefly knocked unconscious by an enemy mortar round. Injuries he sustained from a second incoming mortar round finally forced his comrades to take him to a rear area to receive medical attention. After an armistice ended most of the active fighting on the Korean Peninsula in 1953, Howard continued to serve with the Marines in various roles while assigned to different units over the next decade or so, including as a member of the 1st Force Reconnaissance Company and as a Counterguerrilla Warfare Course instructor within 1st Marine Division. In April 1966, Howard, by then promoted to Gunnery Sergeant, found himself in South Vietnam as a platoon leader with Company C, 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, part of the 1st Marine Division. Howard’s platoon of reconnaissance Marines, which also included two Navy corpsmen, were airdropped onto Hill 488 in that country on June 13 of that year. Six other teams from the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion were also sent into the area as part of this large-scale operation , which had the main goal of locating the headquarters of a major North Vietnam unit. Reconnaissance Marines in Vietnam., USMC Howard’s team established an observation post and began monitoring enemy movements, as well as calling in artillery strikes on them. North Vietnamese forces, supported by local guerillas, subsequently determined the Marines’ general position and sent a force of reportedly between 200 and 300 personnel to flush them out. The reconnaissance platoon repeatedly beat back attacks from this battalion-sized enemy force, with the help of air support, while awaiting extraction, with the fighting said to have been close enough at times for both sides to exchange taunts. By the time helicopters arrived to extract the Marines, five members of the reconnaissance team were killed and all but one were wounded. However, differing accounts estimate they had inflicted between 40 and 200 casualties on the enemy in the process. Howard was seriously injured by an enemy grenade, but continued to exercise control over his unit and call in airstrikes, actions that led to him receiving the Medal of Honor. “Moving from position to position, he inspired his men with dynamic leadership and courageous fighting spirit until he was struck and painfully wounded by fragments from an enemy hand grenade,” the award citation reads . “Unable to move his legs and realizing that the position was becoming untenable, he distributed his ammunition to the remaining members of his platoon and skillfully directed friendly aircraft and artillery strikes with uncanny accuracy upon the enemy. … When rescue helicopters proceeded to Gunnery Sergeant Howard’s position, he directed them away from his badly mauled force and called additional air strikes and directed devastating small arms fire on the enemy thus making the landing zone secure as possible.” Other members of Howard’s platoon also received various awards and it became the single most decorated unit of the Vietnam War. Howard himself attained a near-legendary status for his role in the Battle of Hill 488. An undated portrait of First Sergeant Jimmie Howard taken sometime after he had received the Medal of Honor, among other awards., USMC Howard continued to serve with the Marines until he retired in 1977, having attained the rank of First Sergeant. He died in 1993. The decision was subsequently made to name DDG-83 after him and the ship was officially christened in 1999 , two years ahead of its formal delivery to the Navy. As already noted, while the current USS Howard is formally named after Jimmie E. Howard, it also carries history and heritage from the last ship of that name in Navy service, a Wickes class destroyer that was commissioned shortly after the end of World War I. That vessel was named after a different Howard, Charles W., who served in the Navy during the Civil War and died on the USS New Ironsides when it was attacked by a Confederate Navy torpedo boat in 1863. That Howard had been mortally wounded while ordering sentries on the deck to fire at the incoming enemy vessel. The Wickes class Howard was converted into a high-speed minesweeper in 1940, but was quickly sent into action as a convoy escort in the Atlantic after the United States entered World War II. The destroyer also supported the Allied invasion of North Africa in 1942. In 1943, that Howard was transferred to the Pacific Theater, where it supported various island-hopping campaigns, including the invasions of the Marianas and the Philippines. By June 1945, however, the vessel, then 25 years old, had been pulled from frontline operations and assigned to escort duty in rear areas. After World War II ended, the ship was decommissioned and scrapped. In addition to the dragon, an array of six stars at the top of the current Howard ‘s coat of arms also “allude to the previous USS Howard ‘s World War II battles,” according to TIOH, though it doesn’t name any of the specific battles in question. The Wickes class USS Howard circa 1944, presumably somewhere in the Pacific., USN In the Arleigh Burke class USS Howard ‘s two decades or so of service, it had primarily operated in the Pacific, including as part of Carrier Strike Group 11, which presently has the supercarrier USS Nimitz as its flagship. The destroyer has taken part in numerous exercises, including iterations of the biennial Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise and annual Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) engagements across southeast Asia. It has also supported humanitarian relief missions in the Pacific region. Most notably, in 2008, Howard was among the American warships that responded to the hijacking of the MV Faina off the coast of the Horn of Africa. This turned out to be a more complex situation as the Belize-flagged cargo ship, operated by a company headquartered in Ukraine and owned by a firm based in Panama, was carrying a load of T-72 tanks and other weapons and ammunition. In addition, the cargo was ostensibly bound for Kenya, but later turned out to have actually been headed for South Sudan . The crew attempted to, but failed to overpower the hijackers, and the ship was ultimately released after a ransom was paid. It then proceeded to Mombasa in Kenya, where it offloaded its cargo, which was then eventually sent overland to South Sudan. The USS Howard has now left San Diego again, flying a flag that reflects the storied history associated with its name and, in line with its motto, its crew’s readiness to pursue “victory” in whatever tasks they are assigned.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on May 17, 2019","Huge “Swarm” That Lit-Up Radar Was Almost Certainly Caused By The Military, Not Ladybugs","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In early June 2019, a buzzworthy headline about an anomalous ladybug swarm swept through the news cycle . According to the story, National Weather Service radar detected a massive bloom originating out of the Mojave Desert before heading south over Southern California. The story went viral on social media before generating headlines around the world in major news outlets. Despite the plethora of coverage, it seems there was actually scant evidence that the ladybug swarm even existed at all. In fact, based on our investigation, the ladybug swarm seems to have been entirely a figment of the media’s creation, based on a single Tweet, which itself was based on a single volunteer weather observer’s report of seeing “specks” in the air. When all of the facts of the case are examined closely, the “ladybug swarm” actually appears to likely have been the result of military testing and training in the area, not a super swarm of bugs. Here’s what happened: On June 4, 2019, at roughly 3:35 PM local time in California, a strange bloom began appearing on weather radar across a large swath of the southern part of the state before drifting for hours into the night. The National Weather Service (NWS) office in San Diego reported the bloom on Twitter , and posted an animated image that clearly showed a linear radar bloom heading southward from an area just north of the city of Barstow, before expanding into a more amorphous cloud shape. Also accompanying the NWS’s tweet was the caption “The large echo showing up on SoCal radar this evening is not precipitation, but actually a cloud of ladybugs termed a ‘bloom.'” Within hours, news outlets across the world began running headlines about the alleged ladybug swarm . NWS via Twitter Curiously, not one outlet made mention of what lies just north of Barstow: a massive swath of military operating areas (MOA) that are often restricted for military use and that encompasses several high-profile weapons testing and training facilities. These include Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake , the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, and remote stretches of the Mojave Desert that witness tests and training sorties involving some of the most sensitive and advanced military technologies on the planet. Multiple military training ranges surround the area north of Barstow, California., NASA In a composite image, seen below, made by combining a Google map of the area, an airspace map published by NASA, and radar data published by NWS San Diego on Twitter, it seems that the “ladybug swarm” originated from just beyond the northeast corner of R-2515, airspace controlled by the 412th Test Wing out of Edwards, and just over the border from R-2502N, an airspace often used by the National Training Center at Fort Irwin. This location is the extreme southeastern area of the R-2524 range complex, an area that is controlled by Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. Full descriptions of these airspaces and their uses can be found in the R-2508 Complex Users Handbook . Google Maps/NASA/NWS NWS/USAF The area where the swarm originated appears to be a bombing range containing a mock airfield with multiple targets and a tower for scoring, located just above the two dry lake beds (coordinates 35°17’01.9″N 117°05’42.6″W) at the bottom center of the map below. VFRMAP.com The mock airfield, replete with a mock SAM site and aircraft targets, in the exact area where the bloom appears to have originated. , Google Earth The range also has a traditional bombing target, as well as other targets, and a control tower and operations area. , Google Earth Why Did The Ladybug Story Spread So Widely? News reports published at the time detail just how the ladybug story began. In their coverage, the L.A. Times quoted Joe Dandrea, a meteorologist with NWS San Diego, who said he called a single weather spotter in Wrightwood, California, to ask what they were seeing at the time of the reported bloom. “I don’t think they’re dense like a cloud,” Dandrea said. “The observer there said you could see little specks flying by.” The Washington Post quoted Mark Moede, a NWS meteorologist at the San Diego office, who likewise said the office called a single volunteer weather observer in Wrightwood, who told the office they saw “ladybugs everywhere.” Moede told The Washington Post that the reported swarm was so large that “it does raise the question of whether it could be something else.” In particular, Moede said it’s possible the bloom seen on radar was due to chaff. Chaff is a radar countermeasure first developed for use in World War Two, which typically consists of aluminum strips or metalized glass fibers dispersed into the air to reflect radar waves. This, in turn, creates radar returns that can hinder an adversary’s ability to track aircraft, missiles, or other aerial threats. Chaff is sometimes released in military exercises and occasionally drifts into civilian areas outside of MOAs. US Navy RR-144 (top) and RR-129 (bottom) chaff containers., Public Domain The Guardian quoted yet another NWS meteorologist in San Diego, Alexander Tardy, who stated “It’s definitely not birds, and it’s not bats. But we’re still not sure if it’s ladybugs.” Once again, Tardy stated it could have been chaff . “Because this was at night, the visibility would have been low,” Tardy said. “And whatever we caught on the radar was pretty high up – more than 5,000ft in the air.” The Guardian contacted both Edwards Air Force Base and the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, but neither responded to requests for comment. The Guardian also cited several entomology experts who stated that it would be unusual for such a high concentration of ladybugs in California to migrate all at once. “They tend to move gradually rather than in huge clusters,” Steve Heydon, a curator of the Bohart Museum of Entomology, told The Guardian . “It’s not like they’re caribou or something.” A University of California, Davis entomologist was quoted in the same piece as saying it was rather late in the year for ladybugs to be migrating. Meanwhile, NPR spoke with NWS San Diego meteorologist Casey Oswant who said “we were seeing something that indicated there was something out there.” Once again, Oswant cited the single weather spotter in Wrightwood, California as the source of the ladybug explanation. By the time the “mass of ladybugs” was closest to being directly over Wrightwood, where the weather spotter was said to have been located, it was 02:15 UTC, or 7:15 PM local time. The sun set in Wrightwood, California at 7:59 PM , with twilight ending at 8:28 PM, so it’s quite possible for the spotter to have seen ladybugs in the area at the time. NOAA Do Massive Swarms Of Ladybugs Really Bloom Out Of The Mojave? On the online forum WrightwoodCalif.com, Wrightwood residents have been discussing ladybug blooms and infestations for years. In a thread dating back to May 28, 2003, one forum member wrote that large amounts of ladybugs appear each year in Wrightwood. The day after the NWS reported the ladybug swarm in June 2019, one WrightwoodCalif.com member wrote “In this area, ladybugs emerge from their wintering locations in crevices in the mountains at this time. They over-winter in large groups, often a foot or more thick. When the weather warms, they emerge. No one drops them from helicopters. They show up every year. This is nothing new. Welcome to Wrightwood.” Continuing this helicopter theme, on May 10, 2012, the administrator of the WrightwoodCalif forum, username “Wrightwood,” jokingly wrote “they haven’t started releasing ladybugs from the black helicopters yet.” Apparently, in some locations, there are conspiracy theories and urban legends about helicopters releasing clouds of ladybugs in order to reduce aphid populations and boost agriculture output. Similar unfounded claims about airdropped insects have been made in other parts of the country, and an urban legend about helicopters dropping ladybugs grew so rampant in Virginia that the entomology department at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University ran a story in 2012 in the Virginia Tech Daily to address the rumors . It is worth noting that the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) does actually oversee a program that involves airdropping sterile Mediterranean fruit flies, or Medflies, not ladybugs, for pest control purposes. You can read more about that operation here . Wrightwood, California., Public Domain Conspiracy theories, as well as the very real Medfly Preventative Release Program, aside, these forum posts would suggest that Wrightwood and the surrounding mountains are home to large ladybug populations every year. That would make sense, given that some 50 miles to the west in the San Gabriel mountains, the aptly named Ladybug Canyon has long been known as a hibernation location for ladybugs, also known in some parts of the world as “ladybirds” or “ladybird beetles.” Another nearby canyon is home to large swarms of ladybugs in late Spring. So, there is plenty of evidence of dense ladybug populations in the San Gabriel Mountains south of the Mojave Desert. Could such a bloom come out of the desert below the mountains, though? According to the ecologists and entomologists The War Zone spoke with, such an event at that time of year would be rare, to say the least. A view facing south towards Edwards AFB from Harper Lake, just north of Lockhart, CA, Google Maps Dr. Peter Brown, Senior Lecturer in Zoology at Anglia Ruskin University and co-lead of the UK Ladybird Survey , found the size of the bloom as odd. “I am struggling to see how a ladybird swarm could be so massive,” Brown told The War Zone by email, “so I am skeptical about that part.” In emails provided to The War Zone , Phillip Stepanian, a research assistant professor at the University of Notre Dame who specializes in Biometeorology and Animal migration and dispersal, stated that some members of the radar meteorology community had their doubts about the reported swarm at the time of the incident: Based on discussions within the weather radar community, we’ve come to the consensus that the “bloom” detected by radar was most likely a release of military chaff, probably associated with training flights out of Edwards Air Force Base. Among some of the evidence leading to this conclusion were estimates of aerial densities of ladybugs, which as [others] have similarly noted would be quite extreme. It would have been nearly impossible for such high numbers to have been present in highly populated areas with no records of observations. Similarly, the bloom extended to altitudes that would have been far too cold to support ladybug flight. James Cornett, senior scientist with James W. Cornett Ecological Consultants, told The War Zone that since ladybugs are exothermic, it is highly unlikely that they can fly at all at the kinds of altitudes reported on June 4, 2019. Furthermore, when compared with other environments, “the desert does not usually spawn masses of organisms,” Cornett said. Shortly after the ladybug swarm was reported, Cornett was quoted in the Desert Sun newspaper as saying there would have been “unbelievable numbers of telephone calls to the police” if such a massive swarm as was indicated by radar descended on Southern California. Deep space antennas on the grounds of NASA’s Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex directly adjacent to the U.S. Army’s Fort Irwin., NASA When The War Zone reached out to Cornett, he told us that while the case is strange, pinning down a definitive answer could be difficult due to the scarcity of data surrounding such anomalous incidents: If they were ladybug swarms (they are actually beetles, technically not bugs), why were there no visual reports? At the time, I checked with several people in the Victorville area, all biologists or naturalists, none reported seeing the swarm. Again, if it was a ladybug swarm, perhaps our detecting equipment was not sensitive enough in the past. We didn’t detect them because we did not have the sophisticated equipment that we have today? Climate change is very real but I’m not prepared to go there first with the paucity of information that we have. Sometimes it seems that any anomaly is blamed on climate change. It’s on the tip of everyone’s tongue. I am not saying that such a swarm, if there was one, might not be somehow associated with climate change, just that we have no way of knowing. The darn thing about any anomaly is that it’s almost always a single data point: no trends, no second chances and no trace. The War Zone reached out to multiple local news outlets in the area, some of whom asked readers to send in pictures of the ladybug swarm in their coverage of the event. None responded for comment. In fact, it seems there are no pictures of any anomalously large concentrations of ladybugs on social media during the week following the reported swarm. Many of the largest forums on social news aggregator Reddit that are related to the area in which the swarm was reported (r/Wrightwood; r/InlandEmpire; r/SanGabrielMountains; and r/CaliforniaPics) contain zero posts that include the term “ladybugs.” The only result on the subreddit r/California is a link to CBS News ’ coverage of the ladybug swarm from June 4, 2019. Similarly, there are no pictures of masses of ladybugs to be found on Twitter for the day of the swarm and the week proceeding it. In NOAA emails obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), a NWS San Diego meteorologist reached out to the weather spotter who first reported the ladybugs to see if they had any pictures of the insects. It does not appear the spotter responded with any, as this is the only email in this chain in the FOIA releases. NOAA via FOIA What Does The Radar Data Show? There is a precedent for insects to show up on weather radar , and NWS meteorologists have been quoted before as saying insect swarms detected by radar may not be dense enough to be visible from the ground. A spokesperson for the NEXRAD Radar Operations Center at NOAA told The War Zone via email that while it is common for NEXRAD to detect non-meteorological features such as insects, birds, bats, or even wind turbines, NOAA does not track specific dates or times of insect blooms, and NOAA is rarely sure what type of insects or birds are detected by their NEXRAD systems. “On occasion,” NOAA’s email reads, “National Weather Service offices will post on social media about these detections.” Radar imagery of the June 4, 2019 radar bloom., NWS One way of telling what the radar bloom may have been is to examine what is known as dual polarization data. By 2013, National Weather Service Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) systems had been upgraded to be able to more accurately determine the shape, orientation, and distribution of various scattered elements that make up a radar return. The resulting measurement, known as a correlation coefficient , can provide a picture of how similar the different particles within a radar return are. If that data was available, one would be able to more accurately determine if a given return was chaff, precipitation, or a swarm of insects or other organisms. NOAA’s NEXRAD III archives have a 95% data coverage of the NEXRAD station at Edwards , California. That means for 95% of dates between May 1, 2001, and May 3, 2021, the archive contains comprehensive radar data, including correlation coefficient, for the area in which the ladybug swarm was reported. However, there is no correlation coefficient data available at this particular station’s archive between May 28, 2019 and the evening of June 6, 2019, meaning the alleged ladybug bloom fell into the 5% of total dates over the last twenty years for which there is no data. A NOAA spokesperson told The War Zone “ there was likely an outage of certain components, causing loss of the dual pol data” at the time. NOAA Emails Reveal Even NOAA Didn’t Buy The Ladybug Story Despite the scarcity of detailed radar data, internal NOAA communications obtained through FOIA show that several NWS San Diego meteorologists and staff members doubted the ladybug story themselves even as they confirmed the story to the media, all while inquiring amongst themselves if their initial tweet about the swarm should be retracted. Susan Buchanan, who was at the time Director of Public Affairs for NWS, stated three days after the bloom was reported that it’s “not good” that the specifics of the incident do not match traditional ladybug behaviors. “Hopefully it will die down,” Buchanan wrote. The same email confirms that the entire ladybug story was based on a single weather spotter’s observations. NOAA via FOIA NWS San Diego meteorologist Alexander Tardy confirms the suspicions of the entomologists cited above, noting that the altitude, time of day, and temperature seem anomalous, adding “there is some concern that it was not ladybugs” and that “more investigation [is] needed:” NOAA via FOIA Tardy builds on these concerns in another email, dated July 24, 2019, when he responds to a journalist’s inquiry with “As you know it was never confirmed about the swarm of ladybugs on weather radar.” NOAA via FOIA In a June 11, 2019 email sent to a Cornell University entomologist, Tardy wrote that “Military chaff can look like this but typically not this wide unless something is spreading it out and trapping it like the inversion.” Another email between the two states that there was indeed a strong temperature inversion and an “unstable layer at that altitude” on the night of the alleged ladybug bloom, which would “support suspending any type of small particle” in a drifting pattern from north to south. NOAA via FOIA A June 6, 2019, email between a NOAA affiliate and Tardy strikes a joking tone, noting in reference to the doubts about the ladybug story “But NPR did a story about it, therefore it MUST be true!!” followed by a smiley face emoji. NOAA via FOIA Tardy wrote another NOAA employee on June 6, 2019 adding that chaff releases take many “sizes and shapes” on radar in the area and that he believed he had seen chaff released from ground-level sources in the past. NOAA via FOIA Building on this, Tardy wrote to NWS Director of Public Affairs Buchannan three days after the incident, writing that “the bottom line is we do not know if this is insects and it’s not consistent with ladybug behavior.” Tardy then adds that chaff in the area frequently takes on various forms on radar. NOAA via FOIA We reached out to NWS San Diego and Tardy, specifically, on multiple occasions to inquire about the ladybug swarm, but did not receive any replies. FOIA requests made to the 412th Test Wing Public Affairs Office and all other Public Affairs Offices at Edwards Air Force Base turned up no records for any communications containing the term “ladybugs.” Similarly, the Table Mountain Facility , operated by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Wrightwood, returned zero records containing the term “ladybugs” or “ladybug swarm.” The War Zone is still pursuing FOIA requests related to the incident with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the U.S. Army’s Fort Irwin, and the U.S. Navy’s Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. If It Wasn’t Ladybugs, What Was It? The SoCal “ladybug swarm” of June 4, 2019, is similar in many ways to a separate incident that occurred at the Army’s Redstone Arsenal, also referred to as RSA, near Huntsville, Alabama. On June 4, 2013, a strange radar bloom appeared on weather radar operated by the NWS in Huntsville. The bloom did not disperse into the wind, but instead lingered in the air for over nine hours. Due to widespread media coverage of the event, Redstone issued a press statement on June 6, 2013, stating that they were, in fact, responsible for the strange radar bloom, which was caused by a release of chaff: During these tests RR-188 (chaff) was dropped from aircraft. This chaff showed as an anomaly on local weather screens as weather conditions caused it to linger longer than normal. This substance is commonly used by the military in training and testing operations. There are no known environmental effects caused by RR-188. According to a study of the Redstone incident published in the Journal of Operational Meteorology, the media fervor over the ordeal was made worse by “RSA’s initial reluctance to confirm the chaff release as the source of the radar echo and the fact that radar-observed chaff echoes are uncommon near RSA.” The study’s authors write that “the unusual nature of the event presented unique operational challenges for the NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO) in Huntsville,” as meteorologists had to “balance scientific expertise and transparency with potential military operations impacts.” There were several similar chaff incidents throughout 2018 and 2019. In late 2018, The War Zone reported that a mysterious plume lit up weather radar screens across Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky, and was confirmed the next day to have been chaff ejected from a West Virginia Air National Guard C-130H Hercules cargo plane. The same day the C-130H was confirmed to have been the cause of that plume, two more anomalous radar blooms were detected over Maine and Florida . No cause has yet been identified for those, but they happened close to, or inside of, Military Operations Areas. Once more, in March 2019, a chaff cloud was observed in New Mexico near Cannon Air Force Base. The base did not respond to The War Zone when asked about the cloud. These are just a few outstanding examples of military chaff releases caught on weather radar in recent years, and there have been plenty of others that have not received widespread media attention. Radar imagery of the March 2019 chaff release above New Mexico., NEXLAB While the Redstone Arsenal and West Virginia Air National Guard incidents were confirmed as chaff, the others were not – nor was the “ladybug swarm.” Yet based on the fact that tests and training exercises are conducted in the area of the bloom’s origin, it’s very likely that chaff was responsible for the event. For instance, in the United States Air Force F-35A Operational Beddown Air National Guard Environmental Impact Statement published in August 2019, the authors stated that “the ARM-210 chaff proposed for use by the F-35A is currently unavailable and undergoing operational testing ” but that “it is expected to be ready for use in 2020.” If operational testing of chaff systems was occurring in August 2019, and presumably prior to that while that impact statement was being drafted, then it’s possible that at least some of the 2018 and 2019 radar blooms and/or chaff incidents could have been among those operational tests. Of course, this is only one possible explanation, as there are many other testing and training events that could have been the culprit, given that the area in which the swarm was reported to have originated is a major nexus for the U.S. military’s training and testing. Aircraft use those ranges daily for all sorts of needs. And given that a bombing range was directly underneath where the swarm appeared to have originated, the origins of the chaff cloud seem fairly clear. Even a release by accident is possible. It is also worth noting that the ladybug swarm was reported in the midst of Green Flag-West 19-8 , a live-fire air-land integration combat training exercise which took place at Fort Irwin, but included aircraft from around the region. Letting The Ladybugs Out Of The Bag The circumstances surrounding the SoCal “ladybug swarm” incident and subsequent media feeding frenzy are important for a number of reasons. For one, it shows how even relatively benign military aircraft activities – releases of chaff – can be denied or ignored by the Department of Defense. After all, why reveal elements of your aircraft testing or even minorly disruptive exercises when you really don’t have to? Secondly, the ladybug swarm case demonstrates how a click-worthy, attention-grabbing headline can circulate wildly throughout a media that is very hungry for readers’ eyeballs. Note just how many outlets cast doubts on the ladybug story, or even mentioned chaff as a potential counter-explanation, yet still ran the “massive ladybug swarm” headline anyway. Even the NWS had its doubts about the story, and considered retracting its initial tweet, but let the ladybug story proliferate wildly nevertheless. Now consider how many tests or exercises are conducted that involve aircraft or weapons systems that are much more sensitive than chaff countermeasures. Obviously, the DOD would need a much bigger headline than simply a large swarm of bugs to cover for such tests when or if they occur within sight of prying eyes. It’s possible that similar major headlines about other anomalies that could have been related to military testing went by uncorrected. When it isn’t absolutely critical information, it seems that the media is game to go along with the sensationalism even if they are aware more mundane explanations exist. Of course, in this case it is merely some phantom ladybugs at stake, but next time it may be a matter of greater importance, and regardless, accuracy should still matter.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 12, 2021",DARPA’s Interceptor Drone Shoots “Stringy Streamers” To Drop Enemy Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. DARPA has shared a video of a recent demonstration of a system it is developing as part of its Mobile Force Protection program, or MFP. The demonstration tested a novel counter-drone concept that launches reusable interceptors that shoot what DARPA is calling “strong, stringy streamers” directly at adversary drones in order to foul their propulsion systems and cause them to fall from the sky. The system, as it exists now, is primarily intended to offer a way to protect convoys from small drones while avoiding or minimizing collateral damage by not using high-explosives to take down incoming threats. DARPA also states the system can defend military installations. The recent demonstration was conducted at Eglin Air Force Base and saw the MFP technology demonstrator successfully neutralize “tactically-relevant drones.” In the footage DARPA shared to YouTube, the MFP interceptor can be seen bringing down a single quadcopter drone using a blast of its “stringy streamers” which appear to clog the drone’s rotors to the point of complete loss of lift a few seconds after impact. The vehicle-mounted MFP system, DARPA The new MFP system in DARPA’s recent demonstration was mounted onto the back of a Humvee and seems to include a sophisticated sensor suite in addition to at least four, or possibly eight, interceptor launch tubes. DARPA states that the system uses a novel X-band radar system that is claimed to be able to automatically sense and identify UAS targets. The system then uses “an automated decision engine” to match those targets to specific interceptors in its inventory without the need for a human operator to manually launch those units. DARPA’s press release mentions the MFP system consists of both rotary and fixed wing interceptors that employ two types of drone countermeasures, but the accompanying footage depicts only a rotary wing interceptor launching the stringy anti-rotor countermeasures specifically mentioned in the release. It’s unknown what other type of countermeasures are used in the MFP system, but the press release states that “non-kinetic techniques were developed and demoed.” Propellers and rotors are, by far, the most common means of propulsion for small drones, commercial and military, on the market today. It’s unknown how well the system might work on drones potentially featuring other forms of propulsion, but such a concept could presumably foul the intakes of small jet engines or any articulated control surfaces found on drones as well, if it could hit them. “Because we were focusing on protecting mobile assets, the program emphasized solutions with a small footprint in terms of size, weight, and power,” said Gregory Avicola, DARPA’s MFP program manager. “This also allows for more affordable systems and less operators.” In a press release accompanying the footage, DARPA explained that the focus was on “defeating raids with multiple threats, rather than single unmanned aerial attackers” by focusing on sensors and autonomy. The system is even claimed to be safe enough to use in and around populated civilian areas, which is a massive advantage. The MFP program began in 2017 with DARPA awarding Phase 1 contracts to three contractors: Dynetics, Inc., Saab Defense and Security USA, and SRC, Inc. In addition, DARPA also worked with the Department of Homeland Security’s Science & Technology Directorate and the U.S. Coast Guard on developing the MFP system. In DARPA’s most recent announcement of the successful demonstration, Dynetics was reported to be the primary systems integrator on the MFP project. Dynetics has previously developed highly ambitious swarming drone systems for the Department of Defense (DOD). According to a Dynetics fact sheet about the MFP program, the system can detect small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) at a distance of 1 km or greater, and “disable or destroy numerous self-guided sUAS” at those same distances. Dynetics reports the system is “highly autonomous.” The MFP C-UAS interceptor as seen in DARPA’s recent demonstration., DARPA via YouTube In DARPA’s recently-released Fiscal Year 2022 budget request, the agency is reported to have requested $12 million for the program in FY2020, and just $4.3 million in FY2021. According to DARPA’s budget estimate documentation, FY2021 plans include “additional open-air demonstrations that include realistic threats, performance models, signatures, networks, and environmental factors.” No funds were requested for FY2022, as the program has reached completion. DOD Similar kinetic C-UAS systems have been developed and demonstrated in recent years as the threat from small drones and/or swarming drones continues to increase. The U.S. Army has previously purchased Raytheon’s Coyote UAVs in order to provide an anti-swarm solution , and we have previously reported that the DOD has purchased other kinetic anti-drone systems that use drone interceptors made by Anduril Industries. The U.S. Air Force, meanwhile, has previously purchased special shotgun shells that, when fired, expand into a net in order to snag hostile drones similar to DARPA’s new rotor-tangling streamers, and Lockheed Martin has developed small munitions capable of bringing down small drones or artillery rounds. While DARPA has said that the goal of the MFP program is to “protect high value convoys,” from the look of the system shown in the demonstration, it seems there’s no reason why it couldn’t be palletized and deployed in a number of scenarios including surface vessels, forward operating bases, or even for protecting critical infrastructure from drone attacks. One thing that remains unclear is whether or not each interceptor in the MFP system is designed to engage multiple drones or not, given that it is clear that one of the most looming airspace defense concerns is swarm defense. Taking down one drone with an interceptor could be useful in small-scale attacks, but what do you do in response to mass attacks or swarms? How many MFP drones would be needed to defeat or disable a hostile swarm? The footage DARPA shared seems to show either four or eight interceptor launch tubes per MFP unit, but one can easily imagine an adversary putting together a swarm of more than four or eight drones with minimal investment and easily available commercial technologies. Such tactics are already being used by criminal organizations and peer-states alike . Of course, there’s no reason that multiple MFP systems couldn’t be deployed side-by-side, or that the system in shown in the recent demonstration at Eglin AFB couldn’t be sized up to feature more interceptor launch tubes. There’s still a question of overall capacity, however, and though the interceptors are stated to be reusable, it’s unclear how long it takes to recover, rearm, and redeploy each one. A “hostile” drone (right) being enveloped by the MFP interceptor’s streamers., DARPA via YouTube Clearly, while this is a novel idea, and DARPA’s demonstration appears to have been successful, there are questions about just how broadly applicable the system is to the current challenges at hand in terms of swarming drones. Cost is also a factor: how expensive is each individual unit relative to the protection it offers? DARPA’s program manager has stated that the MFP system was designed to have a small footprint, both physically and in terms of cost, but one can imagine that a large number of MFP units would be needed to protect a large force or installation from the threat of a sizeable swarm or multiple swarms. The investment into systems like DARPA’s Mobile Force Protection program are in clear response to the growing threat posed by unmanned aerial vehicles, suicide drones , loitering munitions , swarming technologies and the current shortfalls in terms of defending against them. Even small, modified commercial quadcopters represent a very real and asymmetric danger against military installations and operations, a danger that is sure to grow as these technologies continue to get cheaper and more capable. “These small- and medium-sized UAS proliferating across the [area of operations] present a new and complex threat to our forces and those of our partners and allies,” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), declared to the House Armed Services Committee earlier this year. “For the first time since the Korean War, we are operating without complete air superiority.” To that end, the US military is exploring a wider array of counter-drone systems, as well, and the MFP system, if transitioned into deployment, would almost certainly be just one part of a future layered defense. Systems such as DARPA’s MFP could provide a standalone solution for lower threat areas, but could also add another valuable layer of air defense in a far more dense threat environment. For a more robust and comprehensive drone defense solution, the DOD and military leadership are examining a wide range of C-UAS concepts including netting or fencing around installations, directed energy solutions , or methods to sever command and control links between drones and operators. “We’re open to all kinds of things. The Army is working it very hard. Still, I don’t think we’re where we want to be,” McKenzie recently said . We have reached out to DARPA for comment about the MFP program and will update our reporting as more information surfaces.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 8, 2021",Investigation Launched Into Border Patrol Helicopter’s Low-Flying Attempt To Disperse Protesters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it is investigating the circumstances surrounding one of its AS350 helicopters flying as low as between 20 and 50 feet during at least three passes over individuals protesting oil pipeline work in northern Minnesota. This maneuver appeared to be an attempt to disperse protesters using the force of the helicopter’s rotor wash, a potentially dangerous and definitely controversial tactic , though local law enforcement agencies have denied this was the aircraft’s mission. As The War Zone noted in our initial reporting on this incident, the Army National Guard was roundly criticized for employing helicopters in a similar fashion in response to protests in Washington, D.C., just over a year ago. The incident took place on June 7, 2021, at a pumping station for Canada-headquartered Enbridge Energy’s Line 3 oil pipeline, which passes through Minnesota carrying crude between the Canadian province of Alberta and a terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. Hundreds of protesters, including members of indigenous groups and environmental activities, some of whom refer to themselves as “water protectors,” had descended on the site to try to block work to modernize this section of the pipeline. Their position is that the pipeline presents environmental risks, especially to lands that are significant to local Native American tribes, and 24 people physically chained themselves to construction equipment in an act of civil disobedience. A US Customs and Border Protection AS350 helicopter flies very low over individuals protesting oil pipeline construction in northern Minnesota on June 7, 2021., via @GiniwCollective “U.S. Customs and Border Protection [CBP] in Grand Forks[, Minnesota] responded to a local law enforcement request for assistance to address a gathering of people who were reported to have trespassed on private property,” a spokesperson for the agency told The War Zone. “CBP’s headquarters is investigating the facts to determine precisely what occurred and whether the actions taken were justified. All appropriate actions will be taken based on the facts that are learned, including with respect to the incident itself as well as the agency’s applicable policies and procedures.” Separately, the Northern Lights Task Force Minnesota, or NLTF MN, a Minnesota law enforcement collective , confirmed issuing the request for air support from CBP, but said that the helicopter had only been called into issue audio message demanding the protesters disperse. “The idea was to provide the order in a manner that everyone would be able to hear,” NLTF MN said in a statement on Facebook. “Unforeseen to local law enforcement and due to the extremely dry conditions, dust kicked up in the area,” it continued. “As soon as helicopter staff saw what was happening, they immediately left the area to ensure no further issues would be caused. This was not an intentional act to cause discomfort or intended as a dispersal mechanism.” Witnesses on the ground said that the audio message the helicopter broadcast was inaudible, an assertion which is supported by the video that has since emerged online of the incident. Regardless of the intent, flying the helicopter so low in this case presented clear potential risks , both to its crew and individuals on the ground. Debris kicked up by the powerful downwash could have injured protesters, or worse, or been sucked up into the helicopter’s engines or otherwise hit the aircraft, especially its rotors. Had the crew of the AS350 suffered an engine failure or otherwise lost control, the aircraft could have gone careening into bystanders below. It is worth noting that an initial investigation that the Army National Guard conducted determined that the controversial helicopter flights over protesters in Washington, D.C., last year did not present as great a danger because the UH-72 Lakota and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters employed each had two engines, mitigating some of the risk of a total loss of power. The AS350 is a single-engine type. This, of course, does not address the other dangers flying debris can pose to a helicopter. That same investigation determined that the use of helicopters in this way, in that case, was not authorized and led to disciplinary action against multiple individuals. A subsequent investigation that the Department of Defense’s Office of the Inspector General carried out, a redacted version of which was released in May, called some of those conclusions into question and further underscored confusion and inconsistencies in the issuing and interpretation of orders at various levels of the chain of command during the episode. A CBP AS350 helicopter flies over New York City, New York, in 2011., CBP We will be watching closely now for any new announcements about CBP’s investigation into the use of its AS350 helicopter in this incident.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 11, 2021",Legion Infrared Search And Track Pods Can Now Carry Their Own Datalinks For More Lethal Targeting,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin took the opportunity of the recent Northern Edge large force exercise in Alaska to trial a new datalink capability for the Legion Pod , which carries an infrared search and track (IRST) system , and is capable of accommodating other sensors and more. The resulting update means fighters carrying the pods are able to accurately determine the range of different aerial threats, providing higher-quality telemetry on targets, thus making them better able to engage them with their weapons, at long range, all without giving away their presence. The datalink breakthrough that was demonstrated at Northern Edge essentially coupled a pair of Legion Pods together, on two different Air Force F-15C fighter jets , so that the range of any given target could be determined “near instantaneously,” according to Lockheed Martin. An infrared search and track sensor, Lockheed Martin’s IRST21, is at the heart of the Legion Pod and is designed to passively detect and track other aircraft at extended ranges. A company-provided diagram showing the datalinked Legion Pods as used at Northern Edge 21., LOCKHEED MARTIN Unlike a radar, an IRST allows targeting to be conducted passively, so the hostile aircraft will not be alerted to the fact it’s been detected, nor will it be able to determine the location of the aircraft carrying the sensor. Another major advantage is that an IRST is not affected by electronic warfare jamming. Beyond that, targets designed for radio-frequency low-observability, such as stealthy combat aircraft and cruise missiles, are not immune to the IRST. It remains the best way to detect these targets at this time and when the IRST’s capabilities are fused with information from other sensors, including radar, both onboard the aircraft and off, it makes stealthy aircraft far more vulnerable to being successfully detected, tracked, and engaged. On the other hand, there are some limitations to the effectiveness of these systems. For instance, atmospheric conditions can reduce the IRST’s range and acuity. Even more importantly, the IRST, in its basic form, is less able to provide a range calculation for a given target due to its ‘2D’ nature. Instead, the primary information it provides the pilot with is a bearing — the angle between the sensor and the target that’s been detected. Traditionally, a fighter pilot would be able to spot an aerial target using the IRST’s thermal optics, but would then have to use another device — typically radar — to determine how far away that target was, and how best to develop a firing solution to bring it down, if required. Otherwise, a shot could be taken without this information, albeit with a lower probability of kill. “With a datalink directly integrated into Legion Pod, it enables the system to provide full 3D (angle and range) tracks to the aircraft,” Jim Ni, one of Lockheed Martin’s IRST Programs managers, explained to The War Zone . “The superior angle resolution of the IRST system can be used to promote weapons-quality solutions at even greater ranges than traditional IRST systems. The addition of datalinks with our field-proven IRST21 systems support joint all domain operations (JADO) by sharing IRST tracks across the battlespace.” The Legion Pod contains Lockheed Martin’s IRST21 sensor., Lockheed Martin There are some workarounds to providing the triangulation that would greatly benefit the telemetry for an engagement, although they are less than ideal. You can read more about this and the IRST21’s capabilities in general in this in-depth piece of ours . Regardless, networking two aircraft with IRSTs together solves this issue. In a press release, Lockheed Martin likens the range-finding ability to human binocular vision — in which two eyes, rather than one provide us with rapid depth perception and a 3D view of the world. Essentially, two Eagles could team up during a counter-air mission and calculate accurate firing solutions without having to rely upon radar that would likely give away their positions. Since the IRST21 is intended to detect and track aircraft and other aerial threats at extended ranges, this enhances the capabilities of fourth-generation fighters equipped with the pods being able to engage targets at beyond visual range — and do it relatively stealthily. This is especially true when combined with tailored tactics and electronic warfare capabilities. LOCKHEED MARTIN The benefits of this could be substantial, especially in the kinds of high-end, peer conflicts in which remaining undetected by the enemy for as long as possible, especially over great distances, will likely be important for survival. It also ties in with an increasing focus on very long-range missile engagements in general, something in which the F-15C has recently been at the forefront . As well as boosting the combat potential of F-15Cs carrying Legion Pods, range data gathered by the datalinked sensors could be shared with other platforms too. For example, F-15s or F-16s with datalink-equipped Legion Pods might share tracks with F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , for which Lockheed Martin is also delivering the IRST21 as part of a U.S. Navy upgrade. Beyond that, the cooperative IRST capability will help add to the overall situational wareness of the battlespace that can be exploited by multiple platforms via networking. In its initial form, the pod-to-pod datalink uses an IP-based waveform, known as Tactical Targeting Network Technology, or TTNT. Target data could be handed over by TTNT or via the aircraft’s existing datalinks, feeding critical information into networks like the Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS). For its part, TTNT, which was first used on the EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft, is rapidly emerging as an important waveform, something that The War Zone has examined in the past . Navy Super Hornets are now also getting TTNT connectivity as part of the Block III upgrade , which would further point to possible sharing between Legion Pod-equipped Air Force jets and Navy F/A-18E/Fs. A Legion Pod installed on an F-15., Lockheed Martin Using the pod rather than an existing aircraft datalink could have certain advantages, however, not least the fact that legacy systems often have limitations in terms of bandwidth. The data they process also has to pass through the aircraft’s onboard mission computer, which already has to deal with multiple data sources. Having the datalink in the pod itself smooths out this whole process, with the pod’s computer able to calculate target ranges rapidly and independently. “The datalink in Legion Pod helps reduce the workload for our pilots so they can focus on the tracks that matter most, keeping them safe for a successful mission,” said Kenen Nelson, fixed-wing sensors program director at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. “Additionally, this datalink capability further reduces the timeline for our pilots to engage a weapon, if needed, without having to sacrifice precious time.” An Air Force pilot preflights a Legion Pod-toting F-15., U.S. AIR FORCE The process of adding the TTNT datalink into the Legion Pod is straightforward, Lockheed Martin says, involving a line replaceable unit that fits inside the existing pod structure. “Legion Pod was purposely built to accommodate the size, weight and power requirements of additional payloads,” Ni continued. With that in mind, Lockheed Martin now has “near-term” plans to integrate datalinked Legion Pods onto the F-16 and then demonstrate F-15-to-F-16 IRST solutions, as well as sharing targeting data between unspecified “other platforms/weapon systems.” Notably, a TNTT datalink was already a part of the package that Lockheed Martin demonstrated to link F-35s and F-22s , suggesting other uses for the Legion Pod beyond just transferring IRST data. A Legion Pod under the intake of an F-16D., Lockheed Martin Indeed, while the initial demonstration of the concept was with TTNT, thought is already being given to adding different datalinked communications capabilities to the pods. “There are several other waveforms and radios that are being considered by the services that may be of interest to different customer sets,” Ni told The War Zone . “Due to its open architecture design, adding other payloads/radios can be accomplished within the existing design.” That could pave the way for the pod being used as a “fifth-to-fourth generation gateway payload,” similar to the way in which the Talon Hate pod was used to enable communications between the F-15C/D and F-22 Raptor fleets, as well as other weapon systems. LOCKHEED MARTIN In this kind of scenario, a future datalinked Legion Pod could not only obtain and share highly accurate targeting data but also allow different air platforms to ‘talk’ to each other in new ways, or ways that weren’t previously possible. “Adding a datalink payload — whether TTNT or communications gateway — to help fourth-gen aircraft support the fifth-gen fight is what we are focused on,” Ni explained. “Incorporating datalinks and fusion into our IRST product line builds on a 35-plus-year legacy of designing, fielding and sustaining IRST systems and enables air dominance in the future fight.” An F-15C fitted with a Legion Pod prepares to depart for a Northern Edge 21 mission., U.S. AIR FORCE As well as aiding the flow of battle-critical data between manned aircraft, Lockheed Martin has also brought up the possibility of using pod-to-pod or pod-to-aircraft communications in support of manned/unmanned teaming , a concept that’s rapidly gaining traction with all branches of the U.S. military. The Legion Pod with IRST21 was selected by Boeing and the Air Force for the Eagle Integrated IRST program in 2017. However, the dedicated datalink is not part of the program of record right now, with Lockheed Martin using internal funding and working with the Air National Guard to develop and demonstrate the capability, including at Northern Edge. The company says that interest “across the Department of Defense” has grown since the pods were flown at last month’s Northern Edge. Linking pods in this way certainly seems to offer a significant boost in sensor and communications capability and could also be a pathway toward expanding the data-sharing capabilities of the Legion Pod in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 8, 2021",Border Patrol Helicopter Just Tried To Disperse A Protest Using Its Rotor Downwash,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video has emerged that shows a U.S. Customs and Border Protection AS350 helicopter flying extremely low in what looks to be an attempt to disperse a group protesting oil pipeline construction in northern Minnesota. This a potentially dangerous tactic that was also controversially employed just over a year ago by Army National Guard helicopter crews flying over protesters in Washington, D.C., a decision that prompted intense criticism, multiple investigations, and disciplinary action against a number of the individuals involved. This new incident occurred earlier today at a pumping station north of Park Rapids Minnesota that is part of Enbridge Energy’s Line 3 crude oil pipeline . Indigenous groups and environmental activists are at the site as part of an act of organized civil disobedience to hinder work to modernize this pipeline. They say the line and work on it, which takes oil from Canada’s Alberta province through North Dakota and Minnesota, before ending up at Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin, presents environmental risks, especially to lands that are significant to local Native American tribes. Enbridge Energy is headquartered in Canada. A screengrab from a video showing a CBP AS350 helicopter flying very low near protesters in Minnesota in June 2021., via @efrostee Footage that has now appeared on social media shows the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) helicopter in question, which has the U.S. civil registration code N3949A, approaching the protesters at a very low altitude and then moving sideways past them at relatively slow speed, and then hovering before flying away. The AS350’s rotor wash is clearly seen kicking up dust and other debris as it passes by. The War Zone has already reached out to CBP to try to get more information about this incident. However, as The War Zone explored in detail after the incidents over Washington, D.C., on the night of June 1-2, 2020, using helicopters flying at low level to disperse crowds, though an established tactic, presents significant dangers to both bystanders on the ground and the helicopter and its crew. Flying debris kicked up by the rotor wash has the potential to cause serious injuries, and potentially death, to anyone on the ground below.That same debris could also get sucked into the helicopters rotors or otherwise smack into it. If the crew were to experience a catastrophic loss of engine power, or otherwise lose control, they could easily have gone crashing into the crowd below. You can read much more about the safety and other issues surrounding the employment of this tactic for dispersing protesters, especially in war zones, from a highly experienced helicopter pilot in this past feature of ours. Though we still have limited details about the circumstances leading up to this incident, it’s hard to fathom how the decision was made to employ this maneuver in this particular case given the risks and the existing outcry over what happened in the nation’s capital last year. An initial investigation that the Washington, D.C., National Guard launched into that episode incident concluded that the helicopters had been used for this type of civil disturbance response mission without proper authorization and that various orders had been wrongly interpreted at multiple levels of the chain of command. At the same time, it also came to the conclusion that the use of the helicopters in this way was not dangerous, as types employed all had two engines, mitigating the risk of a total loss of power. “Corrective actions and disciplinary actions have been taken” following that investigation, an Army official told reporters in April . However, the Department of Defense’s Office of the Inspector General, or DODIG, just released a new report last month that disputed some of those findings and raised new questions. Among other things, DODIG determined that the helicopter crews involved in those incidents had no specific training to employ this tactic, but called into question whether it was proper to say that orders had been misunderstood given significant confusion and inconsistencies in the instructions from various levels of the chain of command. A CBP AS350 helicopter flies over New York City, New York, in 2011., CBP It’s also worth noting that CBP aircraft, including one of its Reaper drones , were widely involved in the response to protests following the killing of George Flloyd and the agency had been widely criticized for its actions there, as well. This new incident is almost certain to prompt new calls for CBP to explain its actions and describe what its policies are for using the powerful downwash from its helicopters to disperse protesters.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 15, 2021",The Navy’s Tanker Drone Makes History By Refueling A Manned Aircraft For The First Time (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing’s MQ-25 Stingray test asset, known as T1 , has conducted the first successful aerial refueling of a manned receiver aircraft by an unmanned tanker. The landmark is a vital one as the U.S. Navy looks forward to adding the MQ-25 to its carrier air wings, or CVWs, in the future . The Navy’s Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and Boeing announced today that the T1 test article had demonstrated its tanker capability with an F/A-18F Super Hornet jet fighter on June 4, 2021. The drone had flown from MidAmerica Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois. The MQ-25 demonstrator aircraft passed fuel to the Super Hornet using an Aerial Refueling Store (ARS) mounted under its wing. The MQ-25 T1 refuels an F/A-18F during the drone’s June 4 flight out of MidAmerica Airport, Illinois., Boeing As well as the fighter actually ‘plugging in’ to the drone to receive fuel, the same test mission involved evaluation of formation flying between the manned and unmanned assets, with as little as 20 feet separation between the two. Other test points included tracking the drogue — the basket-like assembly trailed by the MQ-25 that connects with a receiver aircraft’s standard refueling probe. Both aircraft were flying at operationally relevant speeds and altitudes, according to Boeing . “This flight lays the foundation for integration into the carrier environment, allowing for greater capability toward manned-unmanned teaming concepts,” said Navy Rear Admiral Brian Corey, head of the Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons. “MQ-25 will greatly increase the range and endurance of the future carrier air wing — equipping our aircraft carriers with additional assets well into the future.” “This history-making event is a credit to our joint Boeing and Navy team that is all-in on delivering MQ-25’s critical aerial refueling capability to the fleet as soon as possible,” said Leanne Caret, President and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security. “Their work is the driving force behind the safe and secure integration of unmanned systems in the immediate future of defense operations.” “This is our mission, an unmanned aircraft that frees our strike fighters from the tanker role, and provides the carrier air wing with greater range, flexibility and capability,” added Navy Captain Chad Reed, program manager for the Navy’s Unmanned Carrier Aviation program office (PMA-268). “Seeing the MQ-25 fulfilling its primary tasking today, fueling an F/A-18, is a significant and exciting moment for the Navy and shows concrete progress toward realizing MQ-25’s capabilities for the fleet.” The first fuel transfer between the MQ-25 and a manned aircraft was used to collect various data relating to airwake interactions — how aerodynamic flows between the two platforms behave — as well as the reliability of guidance and control systems. With the data gathered, the test team will examine whether any changes needs to be made to the drone’s flight control software. While the June 4 demonstration is the first time in history that air-to-air refueling of a manned aircraft has been accomplished with an unmanned tanker, the concept of using drones in refueling operations is not without precedent. In 2015, Northrop Grumman and the Navy successfully demonstrated fully autonomous aerial refueling using the X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration (UCAS-D) drone, which refueled in flight from a contractor-operated Boeing 707 tanker. That was the first time an unmanned aircraft had been refueled in-flight. An X-47B completes the first autonomous aerial refueling demonstration over Chesapeake Bay on April 22, 2015., U.S. Navy Prior to that, in 2012, DARPA’s Autonomous High-Altitude Refueling program demonstrated fully autonomous aerial refueling of unmanned air vehicles at high altitude. This culminated with two modified RQ-4 Global Hawk drones flying in close formation to test probe-and-drogue contacts, as seen in this video: The first refueling sortie for the MQ-25 demonstrator was the 26th for the T1 test vehicle but there has also been extensive simulations of aerial refueling using MQ-25 digital models. According to NAVAIR, “Testing with T1 will continue over the next several months to include flight envelope expansion, engine testing, and deck handling demonstrations aboard an aircraft carrier later this year.” The first carrier that will be adapted to operate the aircraft is the Nimitz class USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77). The MQ-25 has been flying with the ARS pod since last December 9, when T1 made a previous test flight at MidAmerica St. Louis Airport. The drone performed its maiden flight from the same location in September 2019. The ARS, developed and produced by Cobham, is the same store that’s carried by U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets that presently fulfill the carrier-based tanker mission. Previous test footage of the MQ-25 with the ARS pod: “MQ-25 Stingray extends CVW mission effectiveness range, partially mitigates the current Carrier Strike Group (CSG) organic ISR shortfall, and fills the future CVW-tanker gap, mitigating strike fighter shortfall and preserving F/A-18E/F fatigue life,” the Navy latest budget request explains. Beyond the tanker mission, the Navy also plans for the MQ-25 to undertake intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) taskings, as well. There are also some indications that the MQ-25 could take on additional missions as time goes on, as well, something The War Zone has explored in the past . Nevertheless, the scope of the MQ-25’s overall capabilities are still much more modest than the previous Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program. That was intended to yield a low-observable drone able to penetrate sophisticated air defenses and then undertake strike and persistent ISR missions. That said, the MQ-25 demonstrator was reworked out of the UCLASS effort and does retain at least some of the low-observable features of that original, more demanding requirement, including the novel flush-mounted intake . Meanwhile, as a dedicated test vehicle, the MQ-25 T1 is not necessarily representative of the definitive Stingray drone. A first batch of four Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) aircraft are also being completed under a 2018 contract award . Last year, the Navy handed Boeing a contract modification for another three MQ-25s. As well as the tanker/ISR mission set, these aircraft will provide the Navy with experience of its first carrier-based drone of this size and capability and will be used to “demonstrate mature complex sea-based C4I UAS technologies, and pave the way for future multifaceted multi-mission UAS’s to pace emergent threats,” according to the Navy. Boeing Over the next few years, Boeing will deliver the EDM aircraft for testing at the company facility in St. Louis, Missouri before transiting to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, for the rest of the flight test program, although there will also be tests undertaken at Lakehurst, New Jersey, and Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. However, while a first EDM aircraft was scheduled to be delivered this year, the MQ-25 program has run into some delays. According to the Navy, these include a “pause” in design work to optimize weight and strength, an unspecified quality issue identified during the build process, plus the effects the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the manufacture and delivery of parts from suppliers. With that in mind, it’s not currently clear when the first of the EDM vehicles will be handed over. Regardless, flight testing of that aircraft is not now expected to begin until sometime in Fiscal Year 2022. Ultimately, the Navy plans to field 72 MQ-25s, the first of which are expected to deploy with the fleet in an initial operating capacity in Fiscal Year 2025, a process that’s set to be eased by attaching the drones to E-2 squadrons , with Hawkeye crews cross-training to also fly the Stingrays. For now, at least, the first aerial refueling mission by the MQ-25 demonstrator is the latest important milestone in the service’s push toward its first-ever operational carrier-launched unmanned aircraft capability. Update, 12.30 PM PST: At a joint Boeing and U.S. Navy media round table, Captain Chad Reed, program manager for the Navy’s Unmanned Carrier Aviation program office (PMA-268), and Dave Bujold, Boeing MQ-25 program director, provided some more details about the historic June 4 refueling sortie, involving the T1 test article for the MQ-25 program and an F/A-18F from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23). The flight had a total duration of around 4.5 hours and the formation work began with the F/A-18F, flown by two Navy operational test pilots, moving into a standard observation position on the drone, checking the hose and drogue. Once the Super Hornet was lined up in a pre-contact position the MQ-25 operator on the ground — in radio contact with the F/A-18 — withdrew the basket. The fighter jet then got “substantially closer” to the drone for the wake survey. The test pilots reportedly confirmed that the effects of the drone on the fighter were very benign, with a high degree of stability. The F/A-18 then backed off and T1 deployed the hose and drogue, as the Super Hornet pilots checked the perspective. This included evaluating their view of the drogue, which is otherwise deployed from under the centerline of the strike fighter, but is offset under the wing of the drone. The first actual contact was a dry connect, with no fuel flowing, followed by a wet contact at 10,000 feet. Since T1 does not actually feature plumbing between the wing tanks and the ARS, there was only the 500 pounds of fuel available in the refueling pod to transfer. A total of 300 pounds of fuel was delivered before another transfer was conducted at 15,000 feet, this time involving a considerably smaller quantity, around 25 pounds. In all, in excess of 10 minutes was spent conducting wet contacts, with a longer period for the dry hookups. Captain Reed explained that over the next six months it’s planned for T1 to undertake a carrier demonstration as well as expand the receiving aircraft to include the E-2. For the deck trials, the T1 will be loaded onto a carrier in port, and then used for deck-handling work, since it’s not equipped for catapult launch or arrested recovery. That last point is interesting, since it was originally built with this capability. Bujold confirmed that the first EMD aircraft is now expected to be delivered in the fall of 2022. This should not be significantly different from the T1, externally at least, since it will share the same mold line, as well as the same Rolls-Royce AE 3007N turbofan engine, albeit in a navalised form. Currently, EMD-1 is in production in St. Louis, Missouri, alongside one of two static test specimens, in addition to the seven EMD aircraft now on order. Initial operating capability is currently set for early 2025. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Drones F/A-18 Fighters MQ-25 Naval Aviation Tankers Unmanned"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 2, 2021","These Are The Best Images Yet Of “RAT 55,” The World’s Most Secretive 737","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After what seemed like an extended hiatus, the world’s most highly modified 737 has become quite active as of late, flying missions over the Mojave Desert relatively frequently, usually with a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber in tow. This is for good reason, as the shadowy NT-43A , better known by its callsign and nickname “RAT 55,” is one of America’s most prized test and evaluation assets for use in developing and validating low observable (stealth) technologies. The bizarre jet is extremely shy. In fact, nobody really knows where it lives, although it is known to bounce around from notorious locales like Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport . Pretty much all images of it are from far away or are grainy and low-quality in nature. Now that is no longer the case. The photos seen in this post, which give us a near-perfect look at this almost grotesque 737 adaptation, were taken during an escorted media visit to Edwards Air Force Base in California in 2014 by the Netherlands-based pro aviation photo journalism group Phodocu . Phodocu The images show RAT 55, its nickname and callsign likely a play on its supposed name—Radar Airborne Testbed—and its tail number, in stunning details. The modifications to this aircraft are quite incredible, with its massive forward and aft radomes, along with the outsized structures to accommodate them, turning what was basically a 737-200 aircraft into a bizarre monstrosity, although a highly valuable one. A RAT 55 patch pulls no punches as to the aircraft’s less than beautiful nauture and its mission., Ebay.com Also clearly seen are the infrared turrets above each radar, as well as the pitot air data sensors that look like bug antennas above the aircraft’s cockpit. A number of non-standard antennas are present, as well as a discolored dorsal area on the forward end of the fuselage. We are aware that a top-mounted enclosure can be added to this area of the aircraft that can accommodate another sensor or even potentially a satellite communications system when it’s installed. Finally, the AFMC tailband is clearly visible, denoting that Air Force Materiel Command is who officially owns the almost ghost-like airframe. Phodocu RAT 55 is set to be tasked more than ever before as the B-21 Raider bomber program emerges into the light and as other highly classified very low-observable aircraft projects move from development and into testing . There are many less advanced stealthy aircraft programs that will soon be in flight test that are likely to demand its precise ‘flying radar-cross section measurement facility’ services as well. This is why it seems as if a replacement for this aircraft, which is now nearly 50 years old, or a major augmentation to the existing capacity it provides, appears to be on the way via a far younger 737 that is undergoing modifications now. This aircraft appears to have emanated from the shadowy Denmar company that also brought RAT 55 to life, as well. You can read all about RAT 55 and its possible successor in this past piece of ours . Regardless, it is truly a treat to see such a unique example of aerospace engineering in such detail for the first, and hopefully not the last, time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 21, 2021",MC-130J Commando II Simulated Launching A Pallet Of Cruise Missiles During A Mock Strike Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force MC-130J Commando II special operations aerial refueler and transport plane simulated the launch of a pallet of AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles, or JASSMs, during a major exercise earlier this year. Though no actual missiles were launched, this test did allow the service to demonstrate the procedures, including transferring targeting information to the MC-130J via multiple other nodes, that it would use when employing a cargo aircraft transformed into an ‘arsenal plane’ during an actual operation. The MC-130J’s simulated JASSM launches were part of the latest iteration of the biennial Northern Edge exercise, which took place in and around Alaska in May, but the Air Force only announced this test on June 4, 2021. The U.S. military, as a whole, regularly uses Northern Edge exercises as an opportunity to test are routinely used to test and evaluate new and improved capabilities and hardware , with a particular emphasis on communications and data-sharing . A C-17A Globemaster III airlifter drops a simulated pallet load of AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles during an earlier test as part of what is now known as the Rapid Dragon program., USAF “This enhanced capability can provide combatant commanders additional targeting flexibility and control in the prosecution of the high-end fight,” Dr. Dean Evans, the Rapid Dragon Program Manager at the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation Office, or SDPE, said in a statement . “Additionally, the retargeting methodology used is transferrable to other strike platforms, potentially making all JASSM-capable strike assets more lethal in an increasingly complicated and dynamic near-peer conflict.” The service has already carried out multiple experiments involving airdrops of mock palletized munitions, including JASSM surrogates, from MC-130Js and C-17A Globemaster III airlifters , as part of a program now called Rapid Dragon, in the past year or so. In March, another MC-130J test dropped an instrumented test article representing a palletized launch system for JASSM missiles over White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico as part of the 2021 iteration of U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Emerald Warrior exercise. During the latest demonstration at Northern Edge 2021, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFOSC) MC-130J in question carried an “emulator” simulating a load of JASSMs, specially AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extend Ranger (JASSM-ER) variants. While airborne, the aircraft received targeting information for the weapons via a beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) datalink from the Standoff Munitions Applications Center (SMAC) and prepared for the mock launch. An MC-130J Commando II., USAF However, as part of the demonstration scenario, an unspecified off-board sensor identified a new target and relayed that information to the All-Domain Operations Capability-Experimental (ADOC-E). ADOC-E passed that information to SMAC, which then used it to retarget the simulated missiles onboard the MC-130J, all via BLOS links. It’s not clear whether the virtual JASSMs had already been “launched” by the point. Based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, SMAC is a joint-service stand-off strike planning cell situated within the Joint-Global Strike Operations Center (J-GSOC), which is led by 8th Air Force, the Air Force’s main unit overseeing bomber operations. The ADOC-E, which you can read more about here , is an experimental, distributed command and control architecture employed during Northern Edge 2021, with its main hub at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska. At its core, the Rapid Dragon concept centers on the idea of using airlifters as weapons trucks to provide additional stand-off strike capacity, especially during potential higher-end operations against near-peer competitors, such as China or Russia. This would also offer a lower-cost means of providing this added capability, especially compared to buying, operating, and maintaining larger fleets of traditional bombers . “A Palletized Munitions capability could enable various airlift aircraft to employ a range of weapons en masse via a self-contained, roll-on/roll-off palletized system, and may offer an alternative way for the Air Force to bring more mass to the fight,” Dr. Evans, the Rapid Dragon Program Manager, had said after an earlier test of the concept last year. It first emerged that SPDE was exploring this idea, which it also described as “ a bomb bay in a box ,” last year. This is, of course, not the first time the Air Force has considered the idea of employing transport aircraft as arsenal planes or the first time that service, as well as other air forces around the world , has used the airlifters to drop oversized munitions , for test and evaluation purposes and during actual combat missions . In addition, while the Air Force, so far, has primarily been conducting Rapid Dragon testing with an eye toward launching missiles from the combat-proven and increasingly popular JASSM family, which also includes the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile derivative, it’s hard to see the concept not being readily adaptable to different munitions and other novel payloads. This could include swarms of networked munitions, which the Air Force is developing as part of its separate Golden Horde program , as well as autonomous drones with swarming capability . At least one earlier test involved the release of a pallet loaded with examples of a new munition design called the Cargo Launch Expendable Air Vehicles with Extended Range, or CLEAVER . A picture from a previous US Air Force palletized munition test showing a pair of CLEAVERs., USAF As Dr. Evans noted, the Rapid Dragon demonstration during Northern Edge 2021 also highlights work the U.S. Air Force, as well as the U.S. military as a whole, is doing with regards to the development of advanced networking concepts to support various aspects of future operations . Given that no actual missiles were launched in this particular instance, the fact that targeting data was communicated to an MC-130J flying over or near Alaska from a distributed array of nodes via a command and control center in Louisiana, thousands of miles away, may be the most impressive aspect of this test. Separately, the Air Force has also been using Rapid Dragon to explore new contracting mechanisms and rapid prototyping and testing concepts that could help speed up the development and fielding of various new capabilities. “Now, more than ever we must take a different approach to how we deliver capability to the warfighter,” Chris Ristich, head of SDPE, said in a statement following the Rapid Dragon demonstration at Emerald Warrior earlier this year. “Lengthy formal acquisition programs won’t deliver the Future Force we need, and Rapid Dragon demonstrated that through collaboration and well thought-out programs, we can rapidly field relevant capabilities to meet the demands of today and tomorrow.” At present, SPDE plans to conduct additional drop tests in the coming months that will involve MC-130Js and C-17As releasing more complete prototype palletized launch systems. The goal is to conduct an actual live-fire test of the entire system before the end of the year. At the same time, to prove Rapid Dragon is truly viable, the Air Force will also need to address questions about how it would balance operational airlift requirements with requests for additional strike capacity during an actual conflict. The service, as well as U.S. Transportation Command , has publicly discussed the risk of airlift shortfalls , especially in potential future high-end fights, in recent years. This, in turn, has prompted talk about novel logistics concepts, especially idea for how to provide additional capacity to support global strategic airlift requirements, to include a new U.S. Space Force-led program to explore the use of large rockets to deliver payloads anywhere in the world on very short notice, which you can read more about here . Regardless, the mock launch of JASSM-ERs from an MC-130J during Northern Edge 2021, supported by information passed across great distances through various advanced networks, underscores how serious the Air Force is right now about turning the Rapid Dragon concept into a real operational capability.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Graduation ceremonies, in any context, are moments to celebrate a group’s successful completion of often rigorous tasks, physical or otherwise. For elite military units, these events generally follow the conclusion of a particularly strenuous training regimen and are a moment of great pride for those who pass the test and are often involve significant pomp and ceremony to mark the occasion. Case in point, a graduation ceremony at the bottom of a diving pool for a group of trainees who had passed the Republic of Singapore Navy’s Combat Diver Course, with everyone in full scuba gear. Like a scene out of “Aquaman,” at one particularly triumphant point, an individual catches an actual trident, a common symbol associated with naval special operations units around the world, including the U.S. Navy SEALs , which was dropped into the tank from above. This ceremony, seen in the video below, took place in 2018 and marked the graduation of individuals who had passed the 39th iteration of the Combat Diver Course. The dive pool, which is four meters, or around 13 feet, deep, is located at the Singapore Armed Force’s (SAF) Sembawang Camp in the northern part of the country. The pool is specifically designed so groups can see what is happening underwater, with large windows along one side, and is also used for public demonstrations of the skills of personnel assigned to the country’s elite Naval Diving Unit (NDU). Completing this four-month-long training program is a key requirement for individuals, most of whom are conscripts doing their National Service, before they can join the NDU, which broadly analogous to other naval special operations units, such as the SEALs . Before attending this course, NDU candidates must first go through a modified version of the RSAF basic training that lasts three months. The Combat Diver Course “is divided into four phases: Physical Phase, Diving Phase, Basic Seamanship and Water Confidence,” according to an official Singapore Ministry of Defense brochure . As with the SEALs’ near-legendary Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Team course, or BUD/S , the Republic of Singapore Navy’s training program for prospective NDU members includes a “ hell week ” that is designed to weed out individuals who are unlikely to make it through the entire course. It has been reported that up to 60 percent of those who start this training process regularly wash out . Individuals taking part in the Combat Diver Course five specific tests, known as “vetoes,” that are must pass events. As of 2014, they had to show their ability to: Swim two kilometers (~1.2 miles) in no more than 50 minutes. Run six kilometers (~3.7 miles) in 27 minutes or less. Pass a Diver Fitness Test that consists of swimming 500 meters (~546.8 yards) within 12 minutes, doing 52 pushups in no more than two minutes, doing 60 sit-ups in two minutes or less, doing nine chin-ups in two minutes, and running 2.4 kilometers (~1.5 miles) within 12 minutes, in that order. Trainees are allotted 10 minutes to rest after the swim and before the run, and two minutes of downtime between all of the other portions of this test. Make it through the “Sea Circuit” three times within 18 minutes. This is an obstacle course of sorts that involves swimming backstroke, climbing up a rope, walking across a balance beam, ascending up and then jumping off a five-meter (~5.4 yards) tall tower, doing another leg of backstroke, and then running for a total distance of 750 meters (~820 yards). Meet the requirements of the RSAF’s standard Individual Physical Proficiency Test, which has more strenuous requirements for special operations forces personnel. “A 22-year-old must perform 40 sit-ups, jump over 242cm [~8 feet] in the standing broad jump, pull 12 chin-ups, complete the shuttle run in under 10.2 seconds, and finish the 2.4km [~1.5 miles] run in under nine minutes and 15 seconds,” according to The Strait Times , a Singaporean newspaper. “It has been a tough 6 months for these trainees to transform from civilians to Naval Divers following their enlistment into Naval Diving Unit in March this year,” Lieutenant Colonel Sng Meng Wah, then the head of the NDU’s Dive School, said in a statement following the graduation of the 39th class of the Combat Diver Course in 2018. “They have learnt not just to dive with SCUBA and Closed Circuit Re-breathers, but in the process, have also grown physically stronger and mentally tougher in preparation for them to work in the harsh environment we divers work in.” “This underwater parade signifies the start of their journey as a Naval Diver and showcases to their parents the diving abilities that each and every one of these divers have learnt over the course of their training in Dive school,” he continued. “I wish them all the best when they proceed to serve their National Service in the various operational units in NDU.” Those who graduate from the Combat Diver Course and join the NDU go through various additional special operations and other advanced training courses. NDU personnel also routinely train with foreign special operations and other elite forces, including the U.S. Navy SEALs, U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers , and U.S. Marine Corps reconnaissance units . Members of Singapore’s Naval Diving Unit., Republic of Singapore Armed Forces The NDU traces its roots back to elements of the British Royal Navy’s Far East Fleet Clearance Diving Team (FECDT), which arrived in Singapore in 1959, at which time it was a self-governing British colony. When the FECDT personnel left in 1971, at which point Singapore had become an independent country, its own Navy created a new diving unit, which was initially focused on more traditional underwater salvage and demolitions missions. The current NDU, however, is a multi-purpose special operations unit. As with other naval special operations units around the world, members of the NDU are training to carry out a wide variety of underwater tasks, including removing mines and other hazards. As part of these missions, Singaporean combat divers are trained to infiltrate and exfiltrate from mission areas underwater using scuba gear with rebreathers , as well as individual propulsion systems. Rebreathers recycle unused breathing gas, and generally do so at warmer temperatures than the surrounding water, allowing divers to operate beneath the waves for longer periods and incur less fatigue in doing so. They also do not release tell-tale streams of bubbles, which can tip off enemy forces. Members of the Singaporean Navy’s NDU train with a diver-propulsion device in a pool., USMC NDU personnel launch a diver-propulsion device during a training exercise., USMC NDU elements are also capable of carrying out other specialized maritime missions, including raiding ships at sea . The unit trains to carry out others kinds of missions on land, including long-range reconnaissance, as well as counter-terrorism and other direct-action operations. All that being said, the NDU is focused primarily on missions in maritime and littoral domains, as is made clear by the dramatic underwater graduation ceremonies involving individuals in full SCUBA gear wielding symbolic tridents. UPDATE: After this story was published, a reader reached out to us to let us know that the RSAF’s Individual Physical Proficiency Test was changed in 2015 and that NDU personnel need to score of at least 90 out of 100 to pass. This typically means doing 60 pushups within one minute, doing 60 sit-ups in no more than a minute, and doing the 2.4 kilometer-long (~1.5 miles) run in 10 minutes, 10 seconds, or less.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Spitting out up to 4,500 rounds of 20mm ammunition a minute from its M61 Vulcan cannon , the venerable Mark 15 Phalanx close-in weapons system, or CIWS — pronounced “sea-wiz” — has long been the last line of defense for numerous surface combatants operated by the United States and its allies . Aircrews are well aware how devastating this type of weapon can be, but for two U.S. Naval Aviators aboard an A-6E Intruder strike aircraft, they got to experience it first-hand. Luckily, both survived the encounter without serious injuries. On June 4, 1996, pilot Lieutenant Commander William Royster and bombardier-navigator Lieutenant Keith Douglas, assigned to Attack Squadron 115 (VA-115), the “Eagles,” were taking part in the biennial Rim of the Pacific maneuvers, or RIMPAC, which has long been billed as the world’s largest maritime exercise . They were in A-6E Bureau Number 155704, flying off the Forrestal class aircraft carrier USS Independence , which was based in Atsugi, Japan. JMSDF destroyer Yugiri (DD-153) underway. The two Phalanx mountings are visible left and right above and behind the bridge., Japanese Ministry of Defense At around 4:15 pm local time, as part of these drills, the Intruder was towing a target, not a role the all-weather strike aircraft is often associated with, but an important one for testing the readiness and accuracy of naval air defense weaponry — in this case, the two Phalanx aboard the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) Asagiri class destroyer Yugiri (DD-153). Royster and Douglas, in the A-6E, were towing a roughly six-foot target around 1,500 miles west of Hawaii. The jet was at an altitude of 700 feet and a speed of 340 knots. According to U.S. officials, the target was trailed around 2.5 miles behind the jet, while Toshinori Yanagiya, the Japanese Ministry of Defense official responsible for training, told Reuters the tow cable was just 100 meters — around 300 feet. Whatever the distance, things went badly wrong. This part of the exercise was meant to test how rapidly the Yugiri would respond to an aerial threat, the crew first identifying the jet overhead — in this case approaching from the left — and then locating and engaging the target with live ammunition. While the banner target was made of radar-reflecting material to make locking onto it easier, the destroyer’s crew instead got the Intruder in their sights. According to Lieutenant Jeff Davis, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the gun was firing at 3,000 rounds per minute, the maximum for the earlier Block 0/1 versions of the weapon. The weather was good, with clear skies. A Phalanx CIWS aboard the USS Germantown trains itself on an AV-8B Harrier II during an operational test: As the Vulcan cannon hosed the jet with 50 rounds per second, its engines rapidly caught fire and the A-6 began to spin out of control, with the hydraulics knocked out. Fortunately, Royster and Douglas had time to eject, the rounds reportedly only impacting the center fuselage. The jet came down on the right of the JMSDF destroyer. The naval aviators were picked up out of the sea only minutes later, rescued by a motor launch from the Yugiri and then taken back to the Independence by helicopter. Royster needed surgery for facial lacerations, while Douglas was treated for superficial abrasions and was soon back on duty. Clearly, it was a lucky escape and the situation could easily have been tragic, as the pilot’s mother, Carolyn Royster, told the Associated Press : “I imagine he’s pretty well bruised … I’m glad it was a call like this and nothing worse.” An A-6E from VA-115 launches from the aircraft carrier USS Independence in 1995. , U.S. NAVY The defense secretaries of the two nations involved launched enquiries, and Japan put a temporary ban on using live ammunition during exercises, while U.S. officials played down the incident to smooth things over with their close ally. “It was an unfortunate accident; accidents happen,” said Lieutenant Davis. “This is not something to get mad about.” American President Bill Clinton formally accepted a Japanese apology for the incident, shouting “They’re okay,” to White House reporters as he left Washinton DC on a trip the following day. A VA-115 A-6E repares to refuel from a U.S. Air Force KC-135A Stratotanker., NATIONAL ARCHIVES Initially, the blame for the accident fell on some kind of mechanical failure in the Phalanx system, before it was discovered that it had been a case of human error. Since then, the Phalanx has been upgraded with new infrared and electro-optical cameras slaved to the boresight, expanding its ability to engage surface targets but also providing a useful visual identification-friend-or-foe (IFF) capability, something that helps avoid friendly fire incidents. Back in 1996, the situation was all the more embarrassing for Japan, as the RIMPAC blue-on-blue incident came after a Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) F-15J Eagle fighter jet had shot down another example of the same using a Sidewinder missile, during exercises the previous November. After a distinguished career, which had begun in 1963, the Intruder was in the final months of service when it took part in RIMPAC in 1996, one of its very last assignments. Following successive combat actions in Vietnam, Lebanon, Libya, and Iraq, the A-6 had rarely been far from hostile fire, as Lieutenant Davis wrily summed up: “They went out with a bang.” Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer A-6 Air Attack Naval Aviation"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 2, 2021",Long In Development Hypervelocity Rounds For Navy Railguns And Deck Guns Killed Off In Budget,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier this week, The War Zone was first to report the U.S. Navy’s program to develop an electromagnetic railgun appeared to be all but formally canceled in its proposed budget for the 2022 Fiscal Year. Now, it has also emerged from that service’s budget request that it plans to stop working on the specialized, high-speed, multi-purpose projectiles for that weapon, versions of which were also being developed for use in other more conventional guns , at least for the time being. Military.com was first to spot a section in the Fiscal Year 2022 budget documents outlining the Navy’s decision to stop the development of the Gun-Launched Guided Projectile (GLGP) program, a project previously known as the Hyper-Velocity Projectile (HVP). By at least 2014, work on this family of projectiles had been spiraled off of the larger railgun effort , which had begun in 2005. Mockups of HVP/GLGP rounds for use in various guns, including electromagnetic railguns., Joseph Trevithick “[The Navy] terminated the Gun-Launched Guided Projectile Research and Development effort,” one budget document says . “Potential reinvestment in the program will be reevaluated after an ongoing Strategic Capabilities Office demonstration effort in Terminal Defense Analysis is complete.” “The Gun Launched Guided Projectile program is cancelled in FY2022 due to cost and is concluded in FY2021,” another budget document adds. The Navy expects to free up approximately $5.9 million by ending this project. Details about the HVP/GLGP effort from the US Navy’s 2022 Fiscal Year budget request., USN USN The original dart-shaped HVP/GLGP design for use in the electromagnetic railgun was a kinetic round intended to destroy targets through the sheer force of hitting them at extremely high speeds. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) had said in the past that it had demonstrated the ability of a railgun to fire one of these projectiles at a speed of approximately 4,500 miles per hour , or around six times the speed of sound. Another HVP/GLGP variant with a high-explosive warhead was subsequently developed for use in railguns. This version was also intended to be fired, at speeds up to Mach 3, from more traditional guns, such as 5-inch naval guns , 155mm howitzers , and the 155mm Advanced Gun System (AGS) guns found on the Navy’s Zumwalt class stealth destroyers. A briefing slide showing HVP/GLGP variants for different types of guns, including electromagnetic railguns., USN At Mach 3, and together with a high-explosive warhead, the round was still expected to be useful against a wide variety of targets, ranging from ships and boats to targets ashore and even low-flying aircraft and cruise missiles. As the GLGP program name makes clear, the rounds were also guided, though it’s not entirely clear exactly what the means were for the projectiles to zero in on their targets. Whatever the guidance package was, it was designed to be able to hit moving, as well as stationary targets. Another Navy briefing slide showing the various types of targets the service envisioned HVP/GLGPs fired from railguns and other types of guns being employed against., USN The Navy had been particularly interested in HVP/GLGP’s potential as a low-cost alternative to missiles in air and missile defense roles. Independent estimates had suggested that each one of these projectiles could ultimately cost $100,000 or less, a fraction of the unit prices of even lower-end surface-to-air missiles in Navy service, such as the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) or the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). In the the configuration for use with the 155mm AGS guns, the HVP/GLGP had also offered a potential way for the Navy to actually make use of those guns its Zumwalt class destroyers. In 2016, the Navy had decided not to buy any stocks of the ammunition it had originally intended to use with those weapons, known as the Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP), after costs soared . Just last year, the U.S. Army, as part of a joint-service experiment led by the U.S. Air Force, used a 155mm self-propelled XM1299 howitzer to shoot down a BQM-167 target drone acting as a surrogate for a subsonic cruise missile in a first-of-its-kind demonstration. That same event saw HVP/GLGPs fired from a 5-inch gun on a ground-based test mount and from an M107 self-propelled howitzer modified to act as a testbed for the 155mm AGS gun. https://youtube.com/watch?v=o0LrICKwDfY The Navy had also conducted at least one at-sea live-fire test , during which HVP/GLGPs were fired from the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Dewey ‘s 5-inch main gun, as part of the biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise, or RIMPAC, in 2018. “Just for the record, [a] tank shooting down cruise missiles. That’s just awesome,” Dr. Will Roper, then-Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, said after the 2020 experiment . “That’s video games, sci-fi awesome. You’re not supposed to be able to shoot down a cruise missile with a tank. But, yes, you can, if the bullet is smart enough, and the bullet we use for that system is exceptionally smart.” Roper had previously been head of the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and had been closely involved in the decision to split the HVP/GLGP effort from the railgun program. “Not that we’re not interested in [a] railgun – we are – but if you look at the delta between fielding in quantity – we have [more than] a 1,000 powder guns, we have very few railguns,” he had said in 2016 . Then-Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder, chief of naval research, shows off a Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP) to CBS News reporter David Martin, during an interview held at the Naval Research Laboratory’s materials testing facility in 2014., USN Since then, the Navy, which put just over $15 million into GLGP program, specifically, has clearly determined that the potential capabilities these rounds offer are not worth the costs. This also further indicates that the service is effectively canceling the railgun project, though it says it will retain hardware and technical documentation relating to those weapons for potential future use. At the same time, the budget documents do stress that the HVP/GLGP-related work that SCO is doing now could lead the Navy to reboot work on the HVP/GLGP in the future. There’s also the possibility that the Army could seek to take over the effort in order to continue pursuing this ammunition for its current and future 155mm howitzers, especially given its potential use in the cruise missile defense role, which is an area of great interest to this service at present. For now, though, the Navy’s plans to develop and field very fast-flying projectiles able to take out a wide range of targets look set to come to a halt.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Nov 6, 2018",Quantum Radar Offers No Benefits To The Military Say Pentagon Science Advisors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the Department of Defense’s, or DOD’s, top independent scientific advisory boards has thrown cold water on the many recent predictions that quantum radar will enable new levels of detection far beyond that of traditional radar systems. Most damning, the Defense Science Board , or DSB, concluded that quantum radar technologies “will not provide upgraded capability to DOD.” The DSB’s conclusions were cited in a report published in May by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). That report, titled “Defense Primer: Quantum Technology,” offers an overview of the quantum sciences research being conducted by the U.S. military. Besides the bad news for quantum radar research, the report notes applications of quantum sciences that still offer promise, include quantum sensing, quantum computers, and quantum communications. An alleged Chinese quantum radar prototype shown off in 2018., CHINESE INTERNET In 2019, the DSB published an unclassified summary of its Limited Distribution report “Applications of Quantum Technology.” Craig Fields, the director of DSB, wrote in the summary that quantum technologies “exhibit remarkable potential to enhance or upend current warfighting capabilities” and that it is crucial for the DOD to “maintain the leading edge in understanding advances in these technologies.” Aside from concluding that quantum radar will not offer the U.S. military any upgraded sensing capabilities, the report reached many other conclusions about quantum sensing: DSB Quantum sciences define the way the physical universe works at the subatomic level. Essentially, it’s a way of describing how the particles that compose atoms work and interact with one another. Quantum radar differs from other radar systems, in theory at least, in that it uses entangled photons to detect objects rather than reflected radio waves. That is, quantum radar relies on a phenomenon called “quantum entanglement,” in which these subatomic particles are effectively linked together in pairs based on quantum properties. This appears to be true regardless of distance, which may allow for very fast interaction between entangled particles even if the distance between them is very large. When a change occurs in one of the properties of an entangled particle, a corresponding change will occur in its paired mate. For example, if one particle in an entangled pair has an upward spin, the other must have a downward spin. Thus, the theory goes, when one of the entangled particles emitted by the quantum radar encounters an object, the other entangled particles should respond accordingly and instantly, allowing for much more precise and rapid detection of targets. If entangled particles emitted by a quantum radar strike an aircraft, for example, their entangled pairs should respond instantaneously. In the video below, a scientist at the Dutch research institute TNO explains the basic principles behind quantum radar: As with any emerging technology that has the potential to lead to revolutionary military applications, there are questions about adversaries’ capabilities when it comes to quantum technologies. The CRS report’s authors ask specifically “How mature are U.S. competitor efforts to develop military applications of quantum technologies?” and “To what extent, if at all, could such efforts threaten advanced U.S. military capabilities, such as submarines and stealth aircraft?” Those questions have been a concern for some time, given several quantum radar-related announcements made over the last few years. MIT reported in 2019 that quantum radar had been demonstrated for the first time in Austria, but China made headlines prior to that in 2018 when it announced it had developed a quantum radar system that could detect even the most robust stealth platforms. Canada began funding a quantum radar project that same year. There were even earlier reports that China was pursuing the development of satellites based on similar concepts that were claimed to be able to render stealth obsolete. Similar claims are frequently made about new radar technologies, but so far, they’ve mostly been hyperbole. While the recent DSB report may cast doubts on the future of quantum radar to bolster the United States military’s tracking and detection capabilities, there is still plenty of opportunity for the DOD to leverage the latest in quantum information sciences to improve other capabilities and systems. The Office of the Secretary of Defense does not offer an exact figure in its latest budget request for funding for all total quantum sciences research in the 2022 Fiscal Year, but the DSB’s report estimated that the Pentagon had allocated upwards of $688 million for quantum technologies and research in the current fiscal cycle. In the Pentagon’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) asked for $29 million more for “Quantum Information Science Technology Innovation” through its Technology Innovation program element, although work on quantum radar is not among the plans listed. DOD In 2020, the U.S. Navy designated the Naval Research Laboratory as its Quantum Information Research Center , while the Air Force Research Laboratory has its own quantum sciences research initiatives. The Department of Energy is also investing heavily in quantum information sciences . The DSB has previously noted that the DOD’s interest in quantum technologies “far outweighs commercial interest” and that “the Department will need to be the key investor to bring these technologies to fieldable readiness levels,” and has suggested partnering with academia to advance its research. The DSB found that quantum sensing, quantum computing, and quantum communications still hold promise, and these are all areas the OSD has outlined in its FY2022 budget request. Quantum sensing involves using properties of entanglement to develop sensors that are much more sensitive than traditional systems. Applications include more accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) systems; making more sensitive magnetic sensors for maritime surveillance; detecting underground structures and nuclear material; and more. Quantum computing, meanwhile, could offer processing speeds exponentially higher than what are available today. Artificial intelligence and machine learning among the top priorities for quantum computing research, and the DSB recommended in 2019 that the DOD “must monitor and understand technological progress in quantum computing, both domestically and abroad, in order to rapidly take advantage of emerging advances.” As AI becomes more and more integrated into the DOD’s operations from front to back, quantum computing will obviously become a larger research priority. Finally, quantum communications could one day leverage entanglement in order to create point-to-point encrypted communications that can be secured to the point of being nearly impervious to eavesdropping or cyberattacks. Last year, however, the DOD’s Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering pointed out that all three of these research areas all still long-term prospects , and that the Department should remain realistic about its timelines. Nevertheless, as recently as February of this year, the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering was boasting that its research into quantum sciences could allow for new levels of aircraft or missile tracking. Now that this report has claimed that quantum radar offers no enhanced capabilities, it may be that the DOD shifts its quantum sciences research priorities to other applications.

Adam Kehoe and Marc Cecotti,"Updated on Jul 20, 2021",FAA Data Shows Strange Pattern Of Military Encounters With Unidentified Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Federal Aviation Administration has seen a dramatic increase in drone-related incidents , recording approximately 10,000 reports in the last five years. The War Zone has identified a substantial number of military encounters with unidentified aircraft among those reports, often in sensitive airspace. While some of the incidents represent typical hazards associated with commercial drones, others are indicative of advanced capabilities, including the ability to fly at relatively high altitudes and to potentially operate in coordinated groups. More so, it’s not just what’s happening, it is where it is happening that is so intriguing. The incidents appear to have predominantly impacted the U.S. Navy and Air Force, with a pronounced geographic nexus off the coast of the southeastern United States, as well as another in the southwestern United States. Many of the incidents we identified occurred far out over the ocean in military training ranges that have become known for ongoing sightings of unusual aircraft. Notably, there were far fewer similar incidents reported to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in other areas that also host a great deal of military activity, such as off the West Coast or around Florida. It is unclear if this is because fewer incidents happen in those locations or if it is because reporting practices are inconsistent, or a mixture of both. Authors’ illustraton Among the reports, we found almost two dozen that involved troubling characteristics. For example, in 2018, an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter pilot reported a near mid-air collision with two small drones operating between 16,000 and 22,000 feet. The incident led to the cancellation of planned activities. Another report in 2017 cited as many as eight unidentified aircraft operating in sensitive airspace off the East Coast. In a 2020 incident, a quadcopter flew within 15 feet of an F-35 operating at 8,000 feet. While the reports describe a pattern of incursions and hazards that have persisted over years, it appears that there is little official coordination between government stakeholders on the issue. Our many Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the FAA, Air Force, and Navy about the incidents surfaced little in terms of documentation beyond the minimal details available in the public reports. Asked for comment, spokespeople for the Navy’s Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Virginia Capes (FACSFAC VACAPES) and the Department of Defense’s Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force offered no clarification about the apparent lack of documentation or procedures surrounding incidents like these. Details regarding the Navy’s claim that it has revamped the process for reporting incursions into military training areas and other potentially hazardous encounters with unidentified aircraft remain unclear. The FAA Reports In Context The War Zone has created a unified dataset based on disparate FAA quarterly records of drone incidents. Based on our analysis of key terms in these reports, at least fifty incidents involved military aircraft or controlled airspace. Approximately half of those involved incidents that occurred at unusual altitudes for commercial drones, involved serious safety hazards to military aircraft, or took place in designated military operating areas. Tellingly, the strangest reports tend to be clustered in one of two areas: the waters off the eastern seaboard from North Carolina to Delaware, and in the broad vicinity of southern Arizona. Both areas are home to a bevy of sensitive military training ranges and special-use airspace. Several of the coastal incidents involved drones operating far from shore, as many as 80 to 100 miles off the coast. The eastern seaboard was previously the focus of New York Times reporting on a series of sightings of unidentified objects by military aviators. The objects were described by fighter pilot Ryan Graves as having the ability to loiter for long periods and fly at high altitudes. The New York Times reported that the issue became so serious that formal aviation safety reports were filed. More recently, 60 Minutes examined the broader topic of unidentified aerial phenomena and prominently quoted Graves, saying that pilots observed unusual aircraft “every day for at least a couple [of] years.” In May 2020, The War Zone obtained the eight hazard reports that were implied to have existed by the New York Times via a Freedom of Information Act request last year. According to those reports, seven of the incidents involved F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets, with most of the events occurring between 2013 and 2014 in an area off the coast of Virginia and North Carolina known as the W-72 warning area. One separate incident occurred in 2019 involving an EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jet, flying in an area off the coast of Maryland known as the W-386 warning area. VFRmap.com The reports detail a series of safety issues concerning small unidentified objects. In an April 23, 2014 report the commanding officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11) wrote “although this report is primarily submitted for tracking purposes, it is only a matter of time before this results in a midair [collision] in W-72.” Another report filed just days later described a “near mid-air collision with a balloon like object.” While those reports show a concerning pattern of safety incidents, they do not describe any overt exotic capabilities, although some are quite odd. These include multi-rotor drones hovering at extreme altitudes far out to sea and a jet-powered cruise missile-like craft. The War Zone previously detailed a number of other oddities in the reporting of these cases — for instance, nearly half of incidents were described from just one squadron, VFA-11. Considering the many other squadrons based in the same vicinity, it stands to reason that only certain units were officially reporting encounters, or that the criteria for reporting varied between units. The full scope of the incidents remains unclear. The eight reports available in the Navy’s Web-Enabled Safety System (WESS) Aviation Mishap and Hazard Reporting System (WAMHRS) are not the only recent military reports concerning incidents involving unidentified aircraft. The War Zone separately reported on a further 25 incidents reported in the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFAS). Those reports span from 2014 to late 2019 and involve locations across the world, including remote areas like Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. As in the Navy cases, some involved near-collision with unidentified aircraft. In one notable instance an “unidentified remotely piloted aircraft” came within 15 feet of C-17A Globemaster III cargo aircraft. A Growing Pattern Of Incidents With this historical context in mind, the FAA records compiled by The War Zone add to a picture of a steady stream of incidents occurring off the eastern seaboard, including up to October of 2020. It bears noting that FAA records of drone incidents past December 2020 have not yet been made public. Authors’ illustration Records of the incidents, while brief, paint a sobering picture. A majority of the incidents occurred within over-water military test and training ranges. In one 2017 incident, an E-2 Hawkeye reported an unidentified and unknown aircraft flying at 16,400 feet via radar. An F/A-18 separately verified the track and reported eight other possible unidentified aircraft operating in the same vicinity. An earlier incident in 2016 described an F/A-18 observing four unidentified aircraft, one colored red and the others black, hovering at 11,000 feet over 100 miles from the North Carolina coast. Later in 2018, a “balloon shaped UAS with a camera” flying at 13,500 feet nearly caused a mid-air collision, forcing two F/A-18s to split their formation to avoid the object. One especially notable incident involved two silver, cylindrical aircraft flying in the vicinity of Washington, DC on September 17, 2017. The cylindrical objects were spotted by an F-16 flying at about 4,000 feet in a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) area, approximately two miles northwest of Joint Base Andrews. The information was relayed to Potomac Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), which provides air traffic control service to the Baltimore-Washington and the Richmond-Charlottesville areas. The presence of the drones was put into the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) system, which provides a continuous broadcast of essential information to nearby pilots. The incident is notable both for the unusual appearance of the aircraft, and its presence near such highly monitored and well-defended airspace. Authors’ illustration Apart from the coastal events, an entirely separate cluster of incidents have been reported in a concentrated area in the American Southwest. The region has become known for strange unidentified aircraft incidents, and just recently, The War Zone reported on a bizarre drone chase over Tucson . The Southwest incidents have had some of the most serious safety consequences. On January 13, 2020, in the vicinity of Glendale, Arizona, a quadcopter was described as flying within 15 feet of the cockpit of a U.S. Air Force F-35, at an altitude of 8,000 feet. The encounter prompted evasive action from the pilot. Incidents have also involved breaches of restricted airspace, as in a June 17, 2020 event near Albuquerque, New Mexico. In that incident, “electronic sensors” advised an F-35 of a drone flying at 31,500 feet in a restricted area. Before we move on to some conclusions, you can check out all of these outlying reports for yourself below: The Reports in Chronological Order Note: all FAA UAS incident reports are available from August 2015 to December 2020 here .

Using the details available in FAA reports, we filed targeted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Air Force’s 4th Fighter Wing about certain incidents referenced above, as well as a more general request regarding similar incidents. The 4th Fighter Wing responded to our requests with a “no records” reply. Notably, FOIA responses will typically identify if classified records exist, but cannot be released. A “no records” reply indicates that the 4th Fighter Wing could not locate records related to the incident. A more far-ranging FOIA request to the Air Force Safety Center is pending at the time of writing, and we continue to file requests with other units that may have been involved in these incidents. In the past, The War Zone also inquired with Air Combat Command (ACC) about the Air Force’s role, or lack thereof, in dealing with this ongoing national security issue. One of the key missions of the Air Force is to defend national airspace – this is not the Navy’s mission as some may think. Our initial attempt to seek clarification from ACC was ultimately referred to a Pentagon public affairs officer who oversees all public communication regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). After that referral, The War Zone received no substantive reply to our questions. Subsequent FOIA disclosures to John Greenewald at the TheBlackVault.com showed that behind the scenes, Air Force public affairs officials had in fact compiled some answers to The War Zone ‘s questions. Those answers were evidently held by the Pentagon’s spokesperson. Lack of transparency continues to make it entirely unclear what steps, if any, the Air Force is currently taking with respect to this issue. The Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT), the Navy’s main aviation command on the East Coast, also denied having records on any of the incidents. The War Zone filed a broad request that included incidents in the W-72 and W-122 warning areas, as well as other specific incidents mentioned in the FAA data. AIRLANT replied that they “found no responsive documents” on any of the incidents. A further request of the processing notes of our inquiry produced an internal conversation within that clarified “as far as these 3 separate FOIAs, we have no information to provide. There are no current procedures in place to gather and maintain those records on file.” A separate communication clarified “there are no procedures/requirements in place to maintain that data for more than 1 year unless an incident resulting in a hazrep [hazard report] was involved.” The same communication described current procedures: “when a ‘range fowler’ [sic] is reported, ATC [air traffic control] makes a standard broadcast to advise SUA [special use airspace] participants. The information is gathered and reported through the DEN (Domestic Events Network). Those reports are filed with daily traffic count and reports and purged yearly.” The Domestic Events Network is a communications system established by the FAA to share information about potential airspace threats between a wide range of partner agencies. The FAA also replied to FOIA requests, but notified us that they have no additional records because the events occurred outside of a 45-day record retention period. The War Zone has reached out to the FAA’s Office of Communications for comment. We were told, “The FAA implements restrictions prohibiting drone flights over certain national-security-sensitive locations at the request of the U.S. military and other federal agencies.” The FAA otherwise declined to comment on the specific incidents or existing procedures for coordinating with military authorities. The Department of Defense spokesperson for the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) acknowledged an inquiry about the incidents, but has not provided substantive comment at the time of writing. The remit of the UAPTF is to examine reports of “incursions by unauthorized aircraft into our training ranges or designated airspace.” It remains unclear if the UAPTF has actively examined any of the nearly two dozen cases we’ve identified, or what their response has been to date. While these responses do not preclude the possibility that documents and records exist elsewhere, they do suggest that the stakeholders closest to these issues do not maintain historical records on unusual incidents. We continue to seek clarification and to identify if documentation exists in other channels, or if these incidents are simply not rigorously collated and analyzed. A Concerning Pattern Continues To Grow In recent years, it has become clear that there is a pattern of unidentified aircraft operating in sensitive airspace, often used by the military, and acting in unsafe ways. The most significant recent example was an incident involving multiple aircraft apparently harassing United States Navy vessels off the coast of Southern California over a period of several days. In response to that reporting, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday confirmed that the aircraft are still unidentified , and that there have been other incidents involving other service branches and even other militaries. FAA records documented here substantiate this reality, and show a continued pattern of training range incursions that are documented to have spanned years. While some incidents may be due to relatively harmless enthusiasts operating drones, others are much harder to explain. The repeated operation of aircraft and balloons far out over the ocean, often in very particular military warning areas, indicates a potentially much more serious intent. The response of the Department of Defense to this situation remains opaque. Our findings here suggest a potential documentation gap, where significant incidents are sometimes reported to the FAA, but not otherwise rigorously recorded or internalized by the Department of Defense. If there are other channels of investigation, for example through the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force or another intelligence component, the Department of Defense is currently unwilling or unable to comment on them. Given the seriousness of the issue and the often confusing governmental response, it is perhaps unsurprising that the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DOD OIG) has begun an evaluation of the Pentagon’s broad handling of the matter. The announcement of the evaluation came in the context of an already eagerly expected Senate report on unidentified aerial phenomena. Currently, media interest and speculation about the possible identity of these aircraft is at a fever pitch. Much of the discussion has centered around the prospect of extraterrestrial visitors. The discussion has largely been spearheaded by figures like former Pentagon official Luis Elizondo, who publicly alleges that the Department of Defense has covered up information on the UFO topic. Elizondo recently lodged a complaint with DOD OIG, claiming that he has been the victim of reprisal since his resignation. While some cases remain genuinely odd, to date the vast majority are readily explainable within existing conventional technology. Tyler Rogoway recently argued in a War Zone editorial that the Pentagon may be overlooking the possibility that foreign competitors play a role in at least some of these incidents. Advances in relatively simple unmanned technologies make it increasingly possible for foreign military forces and intelligence services to deploy electronic intelligence gathering platforms in a very low-risk, high reward manner that could explain many sightings. There is a well-established historical precedent for this, as well. As reported above, there is ample evidence of repeated occurrences of sightings in or near military training ranges that would be very high-value targets for electronic reconnaissance. Whatever the ultimate identities of these aircraft turn out to be, it is clear that they represent an ongoing national security concern. These are not isolated incidents but routine occurrences and we know the majority of which go unreported. Despite the number of them, it remains difficult to publicly document the response of government stakeholders, raising significant concerns that the issue is not being adequately addressed even after so much public attention and so many promises from the Pentagon.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2021",Close-Up Photo Shows China’s New Aircraft Carrier Rapidly Taking Shape,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Work is well underway on the next aircraft carrier due to join China’s fast-expanding navy . A leaked photo now brings us our closest view yet of the vessel, which is set to provide the People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN, with a significant leap in capabilities, including catapults for launching aircraft, a major advantage over the service’s previous two, smaller aircraft carriers with their “ski jump” takeoff ramps. The as-yet unnamed new carrier, currently known by the designation Type 003, has been under construction at the Jiangnan Shipyard outside Shanghai since at least late 2018. Earlier this week, it emerged that a Tik-Tok user had managed to take a very close-up photo of the vessel, shot from drydock where it is being built, and upload it to that social networking service. The image was deleted soon after, but not before it had been saved and shared elsewhere online. A satellite view of the Type 003 aircraft carrier under construction, dated February 18, 2021., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Although not conclusive, the image seems to quash recent speculation that the carrier would feature a third aircraft elevator on the port side toward the stern, to complement the two starboard-side elevators. The elevators are necessary to move aircraft between the hangar and flight decks; the more lifts available, the greater the capacity to move planes around. In comparison, the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class design has four elevators. At the same time, more elevators can actually complicate how space is used on the flight deck and the U.S. Navy decided to have three aircraft elevators on the latest Ford class carrier , with the size and position of these lifts intended to enhance operations. The two previous PLAN carriers have two elevators each, on the starboard side. To date, most imagery of the new carrier had been limited to satellite and other aerial imagery of varying quality. The three huge modules that make up the bulk of the Type 003 were in position in the drydock by July last year, with most of the keel and lower parts of the hull joining them by September. Using this earlier imagery, some observers have extrapolated that the warship will likely have a displacement greater than the figure of 80,000-85,000 tons originally projected. This would bring it closer to the U.S. Navy’s own supercarriers, which have a displacement of around 100,000 tons. What’s more, the Type 003 design is expected to be equipped with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), rather than relying on the “ski jump” ramps used on the PLAN’s two in-service carriers, the Liaoning (Type 001) and Shandong (Type 002). The use of EMALS could potentially boost sortie-generation rate on the new carrier, despite it apparently not featuring additional aircraft elevators. Introducing an EMALS is a significant technological challenge, one that has faced its fair share of problems in the United States, but if perfected will allow the PLAN to operate larger and heavier carrier aircraft, such as fixed-wing airborne early warning (AEW) platforms, and to launch and recover existing J-15 multirole carrier fighters at heavier weights, with a significant increase in the number of sorties the carrier can generate. EMALS would also permit the carrier to launch lighter drones, a prospect that we have examined in detail in the past . Even if the Chinese EMALS fails, or if the equipment is not ready in time for the Type 003, the alternative conventional steam catapults that have also been tested would also present a big advance compared to the “ski jump.” Unlike the U.S. Navy’s supercarriers, the Type 003 is expected to use conventional rather than nuclear propulsion. Overall, the Type 003 represents an optimized original aircraft carrier design that will incorporate lessons learnt during initial operations with the Liaoning and Shandong . The first of these is the former Kuznetsov class carrier Varyag , which was transferred to China by Ukraine, entered service in 2012, and declared initial operational capability in 2018. The second, Shandong , while built in China, follows very similar design principals to the Liaoning and entered service in late 2019. On at least one occasion, the first two carriers have taken part in joint operations . The launch of the Shandong , in April 2017. This is China’s first indigenously built aircraft carrier., LI GANG/AP What’s clear, above all else, is the speed with which Beijing is developing its aircraft carrier capabilities. Progress on the Type 003 build has been impressive, despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some reports predict the Type 003 could be launched next year , which would tally more or less with an unclassified February 2020 report from the Office of Naval Intelligence anticipating that that the carrier could enter service in 2024. While the Type 002 project was less ambitious, it’s still noteworthy that it was only around five years between laying the keel for the future Shandong and that vessel’s commissioning into service. Just as important as the speed at which this was achieved is the experience that will have been gained by the China’s shipbuilding industries that are now working on the Type 003 and which will surely build more carriers in the future, too. Unconfirmed reports last year suggest that work on PLAN’s next carrier — the Type 004 — was due to start soon, possibly at Dalian Shipyard in Liaoning. There are persistent rumors that this vessel will be both larger than its predecessors and will be nuclear powered, but other assessments suggest it will utilize the Type 003 design. Ultimately, however, it seems likely that nuclear power will be the PLAN’s goal. Western reports have frequently speculated that the PLAN may eventually build a force of six aircraft carriers. On the other hand, other observers claim that Beijing ultimately plans for “10 or more” carriers, which would clearly be a much longer-term ambition. While the carriers themselves seem to be proceeding at an impressive pace, developments within the PLAN’s burgeoning carrier aviation branch are a little less clear. Production of the original J-15 carrier fighter, suitable for non-catapult operations from the decks of the Liaoning and Shandong has so far yielded at least 36 production aircraft, Chinese military aviation expert Andreas Rupprecht told The War Zone . Since the allocation of serial numbers is somewhat confusing, the actual total may be greater, but Rupprecht expects that production could eventually yield as many as 60-70 J-15s to serve the first two carriers’ air wings. A PLAN J-15 multirole fighter recovers to its carrier., IMAGINECHINA VIA AP IMAGES A catapult-capable version of the Chinese naval Flanker, sometimes described as the J-15T, has also now been tested from land bases and there are meanwhile also reports of a so-called J-15B version equipped with advanced radar, avionics and weapons. It would make sense, of course, if all these features were brought together in a production version of the catapult-capable Flanker to operate from the Type 003, as well as the Type 004 and potential future carriers. Rupprecht considers it likely that the J-15T — two of which have so far been identified — are essentially intended as demonstrators for the future, catapult-compatible J-15B. Seen in the background, this J-15T reveals the bar on the nose gear added for catapult launch., CHINESE TV SCREENCAP The ultimate fate of the J-15 may also depend on progress made with a widely rumored carrier version of the FC-31 stealth fighter , possibly designated J-35, although this is unconfirmed. Since the basic design of the J-15 dates back to the Cold War-era, Soviet-designed Su-33 , and it has come in for criticism on more than one occasion , it does seems likely that China is already be working on a more capable successor, although, despite plenty of rumor, so far there is no firm evidence of a navalized FC-31. The introduction of catapults on the Type 003 also opens the door to embarking a fixed-wing AEW aircraft, a prototype of which is already under test , a fact initially confirmed by photos that appeared last summer. The twin-turboprop KJ-600 is analogous to the U.S. Navy’s E-2 Hawkeye and appears superficially similar. Once fielded aboard the Type 003, the KJ-600 promises to revolutionize the way the PLAN carrier air wing operates, providing long range surveillance against air, sea, and land targets as well as battle management and networking capabilities. The PLAN already has some experience with carrier-based AEW assets, in the form of the Z-18J, a derivative of the Z-18 heavy-lift helicopter with a retractable radar antenna attached to the rear ramp. All in all, the PLAN’s burgeoning carrier capability reinforces the great lengths to which Beijing is going to match the U.S. military in the region and to develop its power-projection and true blue-water capabilities. Inevitably, this is seen against the ongoing tensions between China and the United States , especially in the flashpoints of the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea . In its 2020 report to Congress on the Chinese military, the U.S. Department of Defense pointed to the Type 003 in particular as a major development within its planned multi-carrier force: “China’s next generation of carriers will have greater endurance and a catapult system,” the report reads. “In particular, China’s aircraft carriers and planned follow-on carriers, once operational, will extend air defense coverage beyond the range of coastal and shipboard missile systems and will enable task group operations at increasingly longer ranges.” The Liaoning flanked by a Type 052C destroyer and a Type 054A  frigate., PLAN The PLAN clearly has ambitions further afield, too, evidenced by its decision to establish a new naval base in Djibouti , in a strategic position close to the entrance to the Red Sea, which U.S. officials consider will be suitable for supporting aircraft carriers. There are also two new Fuyu class fast combat support ships that have been specifically tailored to support aircraft carrier operations. On the other hand, it has to be remembered that China is still very new to the aircraft carrier game. Few other countries that have operational carriers regularly embarking fixed-wing aircraft and while the PLAN may be the latest to join this elite club, it will still require many more years of experience before its carrier arm reaches its full potential.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 14, 2021",Two Iranian Navy Ships Are About To Sail Into The Atlantic And That’s A Big Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Iranian Navy’s new sea base-like ship Makran and Sahand , its most modern warship , have reportedly rounded southern Africa’s Cape of Good Hope and appear to be heading toward the Atlantic Ocean. This would be the first time Iranian naval vessels have operated in the Atlantic and previous reports have indicated that their final destination is in Venezuela , where they might offload a shipment of weapons. This latest news about Makran and Sahand also comes two days after the Kharg , one of Iran’s largest and most important naval ships, sank after suffering a major fire , the causes of which remain unclear. Politico , which first reported that Makran and Sahand could be making their way toward the Atlantic last week, put out a new story on June 4, 2021, regarding the ships passing the Cape of Good Hope. Iran has announced multiple planned naval missions to Venezuela in the past, but has never actually succeeded in doing so. The Iranian Navy’s Sahand ., AP The same U.S. officials who had relayed the information about the Iranian naval vessels to Politico also said there was still a possibility the vessels could turn back. There were unconfirmed claims on social media following the loss of Kharg on June 2 that Iranian officials had canceled the planned voyage to Venezuela so that Makran could continue the sunken ship’s mission, which had purportedly been to bring Iranian military personnel to Russia. The exact intended goals of any Iranian naval mission into the Atlantic, in general, or to Venezuela, specifically, are unknown. Earlier this week, Iranian officials stressed that their country has a right to operate warships in any international waters and warned the U.S. government against interfering with those activities, but did not confirm or deny any details about where Makran and Sahand were headed or why. Satellite imagery that emerged earlier this week, which was first reported on by USNI News , indicated that Makran was carrying up to seven small fast attack craft on its top deck. These appeared to be members of Iran’s Peykaap family of boats , the original version of which was derived from a North Korean design, or some other similar design . The Peykaap II and Peykaap III variants, the latter of which are also referred to as Zolfaghars, can carry anti-ship cruise missiles. An Iranian anti-ship missile-armed Peykaap II fast attack craft., Morteza Akhoondi via Wikimedia This, in turn, prompted reports that the ship could be delivering those boats, as well as other military cargoes, to Venezuela. Makran , which the Iranian Navy formally commissioned into service in January, is an oil tanker converted into what has been described as a “forward base ship” and now most notably features a relatively large open flight deck on its bow end. The vessel, which you can read more about in general here , also has a large crane for moving materiel around and would have ample space to serve as a more general transport, if required. “The delivery of such weapons would be a provocative act and a threat to our partners in this hemisphere,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said in a statement earlier this week. “As such, we would reserve the right to take appropriate measures — in concert with our partners — to deter the delivery or transit of such weapons.” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has openly talked about buying weapons from Iran and there have been reports in the past of growing military and non-military cooperation between the regimes in the two countries. Both countries are subject to significant international sanctions, especially from the U.S. government and with a major emphasis on preventing them from making money from their oil and related industries. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro meets with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran in 2016., Supreme Leader Press Office Last year, Iran sent multiple shipments of gasoline, via tanker ships , to Venezuela. In August 2020, the U.S. government notably announced that it had succeeded in using legal mechanisms to stop four Liberian-flagged tankers that had been bound for Venezuela carrying Iranian gasoline and seize their cargoes. Those ships were detained near the strategic Strait of Hormuz , which links the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Iranian-made fast attack missile boats could certainly bolster the Venezuelan Navy’s own capacity to deter any such attempts to intercept commercial ships closer to its own shores, as well as its ability to conduct more general coastal patrol missions . Last year, Maduro’s regime brushed off an attempted coup , details of which continue to emerge and have only become more bizarre as time has gone on, which included mercenary forces, some of whom were veterans of U.S. special operations units, arriving by sea in small boats. It’s also possible that Iranian personnel could use the fast attack craft in upcoming exercises together with Venezuelan forces. Similarly, Makran and Sahand could demonstrate Iran’s own ability to provide immediate security for future shipments of gasoline, or anything else, to Venezuela or other countries. It is important to note that, while Iran has often touted Sahand as a destroyer or a frigate , the 2,000-ton-displacement ship, which is a derivative of British-made warships supplied to the Shah’s Iran in the 1970s, is much more accurately categorized as a corvette. There is also nothing to support previous Iranian claims that the ship has any “stealth” design features. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ok_0RhvAm4Q However, it is still a reasonably well-armed vessel with launchers for the Qader subsonic anti-ship cruise missiles, a design derived from the Chinese C-803, and Sayyad-2 surface-to-air missiles, a reverse-engineered version of the U.S. RIM-66 Standard Missile-1 (SM-1). They also have a 76mm main gun and torpedo tubes, as well as various automatic cannons and machine guns for close-in defense. This would certainly present an impediment to any foreign navy, coast guard, or other law enforcement entity seeking to board and seize tankers or cargo ships it might be escorting. On an even more basic level, while Makran and Sahand represent, at best, a token deployment. Even just sending them into the Atlantic would show the Iranian Navy’s ability to operate in the Western Hemisphere at all. If the two vessels do continue on their apparent present course, this voyage, any similar naval missions that follow, is certain to become a feature in Iranian propaganda. The regime in Tehran routinely criticizes, as well as outright threatens , the U.S. Navy’s presence in the Persian Gulf, and has recently resumed a campaign harassing American naval activities there. Iranian officials, as well as their Venezuelan counterparts, would undoubtedly relish the opportunity to have warships ‘in America’s backyard.’ Whatever happens, there, of course, remain significant questions about the Iranian Navy’s ability to conduct long-range transits to or from the Atlantic on any sort of regular basis going forward. The loss of Kharg , ostensibly a replenishment ship that could also transport cargo if needed, is a major blow to Iran’s ability to conduct any sort of naval activities outside of the Middle East. A picture of the Kharg , which sunk earlier this week after suffering a major fire., Hossein Esmaili/Mehr News Agency The circumstances surrounding Kharg ‘s sinking remain murky, but there is already much speculation that it could be related to a clandestine campaign that Israel had been conducting against Iranian commercial and naval vessels . The focus of these Israeli attacks has reportedly been on hampering Tehran’s ability to export oil, gasoline, and other petroleum products and to ship weapons and other military materiel to allies and proxy forces around the Middle East. Israeli is also widely believed to be behind various acts of suspected sabotage against nuclear and oil-related facilities, among other sites , inside Iran, as well. The same day that Kharg sunk, a leaking pipeline also exploded at an oil refinery outside of Tehran, touching off a massive blaze that took a day to get under control . Iranian authorities are now investigating exactly how that incident unfolded. All of this comes as President Joe Biden’s administration continues to seek rapprochement with Iran, including indirect talks with Tehran over the U.S. government’s return to a controversial international deal over Iranian nuclear ambitions. President Donald Trump’s administration withdrew from that agreement in 2018 and Iranian authorities have since violated all of its key terms. A core issue in the current negotiations is the relaxing of various crippling U.S. sanctions on Iran. With all of this in mind, the appearance of Makran and Sahand in the Atlantic, let alone in a Venezuelan port, could offer another tool for Iranian officials to apply pressure on the United States, among other international opponents. Iran would hardly be the first country to seek to send signals to the U.S. government by sending naval and other military assets to Venezuela , as well as into the Atlantic more generally . All told, while the direct, immediate impact of the two Iranian warships sailing into the Western Hemisphere may be minimal, their arrival, which looks increasingly imminent, still promises to be a significant geopolitical development, especially for officials in Tehran and Washington, D.C.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 3, 2022",‘Air Force Two’ Replacement Dropped With Funds Redirected To Supersonic Transport Research,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ​ ​​​​The U.S. Air Force has redirected funding to work on supersonic and even hypersonic passenger aircraft that could eventually provide a very different kind of successor to its four C-32A special air mission transport aircraft, itself a commercial derivative of the out-of-production Boeing 757-200. The service is now looking to retire without direct replacement its fleet of C-32As, better known by their “Air Force Two” callsign used when the Vice President is onboard. Since the 2003 retirement of the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic transport, the aerospace industry at large has wrestled with the conflicting demands of high-speed flight and low-cost, reliable operations, and some contenders have fallen by the wayside. Today, however, with United Airlines’ announcement that it has signed an agreement to acquire 15 examples of the Mach-1.7 Overture airliner from Boom Supersonic , it seems like the kind of technology the Air Force is looking at has inched closer to a realistic proposition. One of the Air Force’s four C-32A special air mission transports., Tyler Rogoway The Air Force’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget , which it released on May 28, 2021, reveals that funding for what is described as C-32 Executive Transport Recapitalization is eliminated entirely, with the last budget allocation for this effort amounting to $6.197 million in Fiscal Year 2021. What’s particularly intriguing about the demise of the C-32A recapitalization effort is that the Air Force says it has already redirected the remaining funds from this program into separate, but related research on high-speed transport aircraft. Essentially, an exotic complement to the Air Force’s existing VIP fleet based on heavily adapted airliners and bizjets. “After 2020, remaining funding in [C-32 Executive Transport Recapitalization] was applied to the evaluation and maturation of advanced high speed transport scale aircraft with potential to expand the defense industrial base and serve as C-32A replacements at the appropriate time,” the budget documents state. The Air Force declaring that it’s shifted its interest from finding a potentially like-for-like replacement for the small fleet of four C-32As, to instead study high-speed executive transports is interesting, to say the least, although it was rather buried in the budget documents. Work in this area is already underway, albeit on a fairly small scale so far. Last year, the Air Force awarded contracts to three different startups that are working in the field of high-speed executive transports. One of these was the aforementioned Boom Supersonic , which also rolled out its XB-1 “Baby Boom” supersonic demonstrator jet last October. Forthcoming trials using the XB-1 will help inform the development of the Overture supersonic airliner. Burning up to 100-percent sustainable aviation fuel and carrying 65-88 passengers, the Overture is planned to take to the air in 2026. The XB-1 “Baby Boom.”, Boom Supersonic The other two companies are Exosonic , another aviation firm focused on supersonic aircraft development, and hypersonic aerospace startup Hermeus Corporation . While the C-32A may not have a replacement, it’s not planned to leave Air Mobility Command service until 2040, according to the budget documents, which state that the aircraft have an average of 18 years of service remaining. The C-32As first entered service in 1998 and are operated by the 1st Airlift Squadron, 89th Airlift Wing at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. A C-32A from the 89th Airlift Wing on the flightline at Youngstown Air Reserve Station in Vienna, Ohio, in 2019., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Christina Russo The C-32As are still slated for some further upgrades, with a request for $1.949 million in Fiscal Year 2022, compared with $2.947 million in Fiscal Year 2021. “This funding may include emerging modification requirements to support Program Management Administration (PMA), Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS), systems integration lab, trainers, equipment, other government costs, and Senior Leader Communications System modernization efforts,” budget documents state. Improvements have been ongoing for the C-32A for some time, including an “interior refresh” that brings the appearance of the C-32A’s interior closer in line with the presidential section of the VC-25A , known as “Air Force One” when the president is flying in it. A $16-million contract to upgrade the interior of just one of the jets was awarded in 2018. The new-look C-32A interior., PATRICK LEAHY’S WEBPAGE Other upgrades have occurred to the C-32A fleet in recent years, including enhanced cockpit avionics, defensive systems, and greatly enhanced communications systems. In the past, the Air Force, together with the Navy, also had much more ambitious plans to replace not only the C-32A Executive Airlift (EA) plane, but also the Air Force’s E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) “Doomsday Plane,” and the Navy’s E-6B Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) and Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) aircraft, with a common airframe . The Air Force describes those platforms slated for replacement as “aging and increasingly difficult to support.” However, this effort — which was dubbed NEAT (standing for NAOC, EA, ABNCP, and TACAMO) — was wound up in September last year “with no impact or actions for the C-32 fleet.” Since then, the Air Force has instead pushed forward with its own E-4B replacement , while the Navy has turned its sights to a variant of the C-130J for its future TACAMO platform. So, what happens next for the Air Force’s tentative high-speed executive transport plans? While the small contracts with the three startups will get completed, it’s hard to envisage what might happen after that. It’s worth remembering, too, that the contracts involved so far are small and research-oriented, with less than $2 million going to Hermeus, for example. An artist’s concept of a notional hypersonic executive passenger transport aircraft for the Air Force., Hermeus Corporation Then there is the question of requirements and practicality. While a plane that can convey senior officials around the globe faster and more efficiently, as well as travel longer distances on shorter notice, would be welcome, it will likely be a singularly expensive procurement item and could also require costly bespoke support equipment. When it comes to operations, overland supersonic flight is currently still prohibited in the United States and in Europe, reducing the utility of an aircraft of this type — whether in military or commercial hands. On the other hand, a supersonic aircraft in this class could potentially also be adapted to a range of other missions, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) or even strike. This is in addition to just moving even small groups of materiel and people quickly over intercontinental distances. The Air Force is already looking at ways to execute markedly faster logistics between two locales, including using rockets to deliver things very quickly to any suitable point on the globe. So, a high-speed transport, even of limited capacity would be a highly attractive proposition. We have discussed this in detail in this past piece of ours. The budget documents don’t seem to reveal additional plans beyond this reallocation of funds, although a more concerted effort of this kind would clearly have to be funded through some other part of the budget in the future, now that the C-32A recapitalization seems to have come to an end. In the end, far less exotic traditional  airliner types may still replace the C-32As, but the Air Force could at least augment its VIP fleet with high-speed aircraft to be used where applicable. For instance, domestically, the C-32A is often used to get into and out of smaller airstrips, for instance, something that no high-speed transport will not be capable of doing. As such, while more clarity has been provided on the future of the C-32A, and there are no plans for a direct successor for the time being, it remains to be seen whether a future “Air Force Two” might transport its high-ranking passengers at supersonic speeds, or even faster. The fact a major airline has expressed its confidence in the concept can only be good news for the Air Force when it comes to realizing its high-speed VIP transport dreams, however.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",What It Was Like Dogfighting In The F-14 Against America’s Secret MiG Squadron,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a recently posted new video, a former F-14 Tomcat Radar Intercept Officer, or RIO , describes exactly what happened when he was chosen to take part in the ultra-secretive Constant Peg program and given the unique chance to fly against actual enemy aircraft not far from a desolate airbase near Tonopah , Nevada. The video , on Ward Carroll’s YouTube channel, is well worth a look, since it deals not only with the mighty F-14 fleet air defender, but also Constant Peg, which yielded the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron, or “Red Eagles,” America’s Cold War MiG aggressor squadron . Since the existence of that program was formally declassified in 2006, more and more details, as well as photos and video , have gradually come to light. There are plenty more tales to tell . In the fall of 1985, Ward was assigned to Fighter Squadron 32 (VF-32), the “Swordsmen,” and, after coming off his first deployment aboard the Forrestal class aircraft carrier USS Independence , was now engaged in workups for his second deployment, a process that took him to Fallon, Nevada — a hotbed of naval fighter activity, then , and now . A VF-32 F-14A Tomcat launches from the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy in 1986., NATIONAL ARCHIVES “One day we were informed that we were going to participate in an exercise called Constant Peg, something I had never heard of before we got to Fallon,” he recalls. Constant Peg, of course, was the brainchild of Air Force Colonel Gaillard R. Peck, who had the idea of revamping dogfight training using actual Soviet-made fighter jets. The elite training unit would be made available to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps pilots. You can see Peck’s awesome brief on the Constant Peg program in this past article of ours . Retired Air Force Colonel Gaillard Peck Jr., the former 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron commander., U.S. Air Force/David Bedard Ward explains how the instructors serving with the 4477th were the cream of the crop, their posting requiring around 3,000 flight hours in tactical jets as well as graduation from the Air Force Fighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada , or from the Navy’s Topgun program. In order to preserve the secrecy of the unit, these instructors were technically based at Nellis, a deception that extended to their family members living nearby. For their day job, however, they would be shuttled by C-12 transport plane 150 miles north to Tonopah — “Wild West kind of operations,” in Ward’s considered opinion. At the time Ward had the chance to go up against the 4477th, the unit was flying the Soviet-made MiG-21 Fishbed and the derivative Chinese-made F-7, as well as both air-to-air and air-to-ground versions of the swing-wing MiG-23 Flogger . The maintenance effort was another aspect of the “Red Eagles” that really caught Ward’s eye. Mirroring the pilots who flew the jets, the technicians who looked after them — both Air Force personnel and civilian contractors — were the very best in the business. Not only did they sometimes have to fix broken jets using spare parts harvested from crashed aircraft and secreted out of foreign countries by CIA agents, but they kept up an aggressive schedule of flight operations. As of 1985, this called for eight MiG-21 and three MiG-23 sorties each morning, and the same pattern in the afternoon — meaning 11 jets had to be ready to go at any time of the day, without any kind of established spares source. Members of the 4477th TES pose with one of the squadron’s MiG-21s, in around 1986., U.S. AIR FORCE After a briefing from 4477th crews at Fallon, and another telephone call with the pilots who they’d be flying against, it was time for the sortie itself. This pitted Ward and his pilot, callsign “Truck,” against both an F-7 and a MiG-21 in the space of around 45 minutes. Using a common radio frequency, the pilots were expressly prohibited from using the real names of the threat aircraft. The Air Force had given the Flogger the cover designation YF-113, while the Fishbeds and F-7s were collectively referred to as YF-110s. An air-to-air variant of the MiG-23 — in this case an export MiG-23MS variant — of the type that Ward flew against in 1985., U.S. AIR FORCE First up was the Flogger and Ward’s initial impression was that the jet was much smaller than he’d anticipated. Until now, the most he’d seen of a MiG-23 was in grainy intelligence photos. After joining up with the air-to-air variant of the MiG-23, the first point on the flight plan was a speed demo. With Tomcat and MiG-23 side-by-side, the command came over the radio: “On my mark, go to full afterburner.” In the F-14A, the TF30 engines had to be carefully advanced through the stages up to full military power. Not so in the MiG. “Bottom line is, the MiG-23 just walked away from us … First lesson learnt, don’t try to outrun a MiG-23,” Ward says. An F-14 demonstrates its impressive dogfighting capabilities as it turns with an adversary A-4F Skyhawk in 1982., U.S. NAVY Next up were maneuvers with the Tomcat alternating between defensive and offensive starting positions. With the MiG-23 on the offensive, a max-g turn by the F-14 was enough to force the MiG to overshoot immediately. Subsequently, with the F-14 on the offensive, the Navy jet was able to keep pace with the turning MiG, maintain the advantage, and get in close enough for a potential gun kill. The third Flogger event was a neutral setup, starting with the jets three miles apart and at 350 knots. This time, the MiG-23 pilot dived very low and very fast, and the F-14 crew lost sight of it over the desert. The Soviet jet then reappeared on their wing line and took a simulated shot — it was “a real eye-opener” for Ward and his pilot. Ward poses with an F-14 in the same year that he experienced the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The YF-110 — an F-7 in this case — was next and, conversely, this looked bigger than Ward was expecting. In the speed demo, the F-14 could keep pace with the Chinese Fishbed clone. In the defensive setup, however, the F-7 was able to hang in the turn with the Tomcat, demonstrating a similar turn rate, but a smaller radius over the first 90 degrees of the turn. Beyond that, the F-7 pilot was “spat out,” unable to keep tabs on the Tomcat and overshooting. With the F-14 on the offensive, Ward and “Truck” could stay glued to the Fishbed throughout the turn. The neutral setup provided another surprise for the VF-32 crew. With the F-7’s limited turning ability in mind, they didn’t expect the bandit to enter a one-circle fight. But then, the F-7 went vertical “in a way that was very surprising.” The adversary pilot deployed flaps in a “magic move” and was suddenly looming behind the F-14 in an offensive position. Another lesson learned. Tonopah Test Range Airport in 1982. , U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE “That was so awesome to actually see MiGs for real,” Ward reflected as they headed back from their adrenaline-filled trip over the Nevada desert. A big part of the Constant Peg program was elminating ‘buck fever’ pilots may get when actually seeing a long-touted foreign adversary for the first time, causing them to freeze or be distracted from making a kill. Meeting the “Red Eagles” was enormously useful for Ward and the tactical lessons imparted from this kind of highly realistic training would be put to use by Tomcat crews during clashes with Libyan jets over the Gulf of Sidra and later in Operation Desert Storm over Iraq. A fully armed F-14A from VF-32 on a combat patrol off of the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy during Operation Desert Storm in 1991., U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE The two VF-32 aviators also left Fallon with the niggling feeling that there was something more at Tonopah, hidden by the already-secret MiGs. They had been told to not divert to Tonopah Test Range Airport unless they experienced a total failure of some kind. Even a single-engine emergency would have required nursing their jet back to Fallon. “I think there’s something they care about more than the MiGs,” Ward’s pilot, “Truck,” observed at the time. A 4450th Tactical Group F-117A and a T-38 chase plane over Tonopah Test Range Airport soon after the stealth fighter was revealed to the public., NATIONAL ARCHIVES There was something else there, of course, with the F-117 stealth combat jet program being run out of the same base. This remarkable aircraft wasn’t revealed to the public until 1988, although the Constant Peg pilots knew about it, and how the exotic planes flew out regularly under cover of darkness. It was, as Ward points out, “A miracle that they were able to develop and operationally test the stealth fighter in absolute secrecy .” It’s appropriate, therefore, that the same base still sometimes plays host to the F-117, as the stealth jet continues its mysterious second life .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army plans to stop major research and development work on a huge artillery piece , intended to be able to hit targets out to a range of 1,000 miles or more, by the end of this year. Instead, the service wants to move funds it would have spent specifically on this Strategic Long Range Cannon into a more general account that it could use to help mature various advanced technologies. The update on the Army’s plans for the Strategic Long Range Cannon (SLRC) program were contained within its proposed budget for the 2022 Fiscal Year, which was released on May 28, 2021, as part of the larger U.S. military-wide budget request. In lieu of funding for the SLRC line item, the service asked for just over $72.6 million for a new account called Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) Planning for Super-System and Technology Product Prototyping. A model of a Strategic Long Range Cannon concept, in black, situated between models of more traditional tracked self-propelled howitzers., US Army “This effort [SLRC] is projected to end in FY 2021,” the Army’s budget documents say to explain the request to “realign” this funding with the broader line item. The new, separate planning and prototyping effort “will execute prototyping in support of Soldier evaluations in potential areas of deep strike munition/munition systems, advanced navigation/networking capability, and/or advanced Soldier, vehicle, and platform capabilities.” It is possible that this new funding stream, which includes work on “deep strike munition/munition systems,” may continue, in part, to fund certain activities related to the SLRC. However, even if this is the case, the requested $72.6 million would be spread between those efforts and the other areas of interest described in the Army budget documents.  As such, this would still likely reflect a significant cut in funding for the cannon program, which had, by itself, received just over $61.8 million and almost $62.8 million in the 2020 and 2021 Fiscal Year budgets. The section on the Strategic Long Range Cannon in the Army’s 2022 Fiscal Year budget proposal., US Army The portion of the Army’s proposed 2022 Fiscal Year budget discussing the new TMI Planning for Super-System and Technology Product Prototyping line item. The number in the last column is the requested funding for this account, in millions of dollars., US Army The Army does say that it plans to complete various research and development and testing of SLRC components in the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. This includes work on the very large rocket-assisted projectile that was supposed to give the cannon its 1,000-mile-plus range, as well as “system integration and technology maturation for SLRC to include designs for long lead prototypes to be used in upcoming major system level demonstrations.” The service is also looking to “scale and perform prototyping on components including objective cannon, gun carriage, and test platform.” A graphic, seen below, showing a notional SLRC design that emerged last year showed the gun on a “platform” style mount similar to that used in conjunction with the Cold War-era 280mm M65 cannon, a weapon specifically designed to fire nuclear artillery shells that is better known as Atomic Annie . That platform was depicted attached at the front to an 8×8 Oshkosh M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) tractor and at the rear to a three-axle trailing section. The implied a concept of operations similar to that employed with the 83-ton M65, wherein the weapon would be employed from a fixed position after being detached from the tractor and trail. US Army “We have to work through the design of the test asset, so we can begin to work while the objective system is being built and then work through the propulsion and bring our industry partners on to work the business end of the system, and that’s kind of where we are,” Army Brigadier General John Rafferty, head of the Long Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team (CFT) within Army Futures Command, told Defense News earlier this year. “Then you can just imagine from here, it’s assembling the system, then scaling up everything. This is really starting small and validating the models that we’ve been using and then scaling it up to the full propellant charge, full projectile design, to get it up to the range.” At that time, however, Rafferty revealed that work on the SLRC was largely on hold, awaiting the completion of a technical feasibility study from the independent National Academy of Sciences , and that a planned live-fire demonstration of a prototype cannon in 2023 had been all but canceled. “It’s a big bet to see what is possible in those ranges that have an integrated cannon system and a way to shoot things that might be far less expensive,” Rafferty said. “I think that [the National Academy of Sciences study] also gives an important data point for [Army Futures Command] and for the Army senior leaders to review as an independent assessment of the feasibility of this and then we’ll be ready to continue after that.” The Army’s budget documents do not provide any specific reasons for why it has decided now to look to close out the main SLRC account. However, this is hardly the first time the U.S. military, among others , has explored the idea of a very long-range supergun, projects that often present both technical challenges and logistical hurdles. The M65s, for instance, were ultimately only in service for around seven years, between 1955 and 1962, and were only ever assigned to units forward-deployed in Germany, Japan, and South Korea. The remains of an experimental 16-inch gun that was developed during the Cold War under the U.S.-Canadian High Altitude Research Project (HARP). While HARP’s main focus was on potential low-cost ways to get payloads into space, the underlying supergun technology also had the potential for broader military use., Brohav via Wikimedia Ground-based artillery has, historically, offered significant flexibility, especially when compared to combat aircraft. Guns , as well as rocket artillery systems , are a highly efficient way to provide persistent fire support across a broad area, and are able to readily shift focus from one target to another, as long as it is within their range. They also generally have significant magazine depth and can rapidly move from one area to another, including in order to reduce their vulnerability to hostile counterattacks. They can do all of this without the cost and complexities associated with basing aircraft, which would also have to deal with issues around flying in potentially contested airspace, at multiple locations within a theater of operations. A gun with a range of 1,000 miles or more would be able to exploit those inherent benefits to an even greater degree, as long as sufficient logistical resources existed to move what would be very heavy weapons into suitable firing positions and keep a steady stream of the large, specialized ammunition flowing to them. At the same time, when the SLRC effort was first publicly announced in 2018, one of its biggest potential benefits was simply being a very long-range, ground-based strike weapon that was compliant with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , or INF, between the United States and Russia. That agreement prohibited both parties from deploying ground-launched nuclear or conventionally-armed cruise and ballistic missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles. However, this impetus is now gone. In 2019, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump pulled out of that deal over Russian violations . Since then, the Army, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, have begun investigating a variety of ground-based missile systems , including hypersonic weapons , that would have been banned under the INF. All of this can only have impacted the service’s cost-benefit calculus with regards to the SLRC, which, as Brigadier General Rafferty acknowledged earlier this year, is a very complex weapon concept. With all this in mind, it would now appear that the Army has decided to drastically scale back its supergun ambitions, if it hasn’t canceled the project entirely.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",This Is What Pilots Actually See Inside Red 6’s Augmented Reality Dogfighting Goggles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Augmented reality systems are on the verge of making a huge impact on how America’s military fights and trains. When it comes to the latter, one company, aptly named Red 6 , has identified an inflection point where cost and existing capabilities become problematic for America’s tactical aircraft communities—training for air-to-air combat. While contractor aggressor services have ballooned in recent years to bring down the cost of providing bad guys for frontline fighter pilots to train against, while also upping the potential density and complexity of the threats that can be portrayed, Red 6 thinks it can do much of this without any other jets, pilots, and millions in yearly fuel costs all. This can be accomplished by moving the adversary aircraft into the synthetic realm via augmented reality goggles. Now we finally get to see exactly what the pilots do when donning Red 6’s increasingly capable helmet-mounted hardware. You can read all about Red 6, where the company has been, and where it plans to go, in this in-depth feature interview with its founder and former F-22 Raptor pilot, Daniel Robinson. In it, he talks about how Red 6 started out by creating a huge geometric open-sided cube in the sky to test the original idea and has progressed with better hardware and software ever since. The tech has developed to the point where pilots are actually dogfighting synthetic AI-enabled fighters in augmented reality using Red 6’s gear. And, of course, without any actual flying hardware constraints, any aircraft with any performance capabilities can be accurately represented. So what does this look like from the pilot’s perspective? We can finally share the answer to that question below: Red 6’s system is called the Airborne Tactical Augmented Reality System (ATARS). The company officially describes ATARS as “the first wide field-of-view, full color, demonstrably proven outdoor Augmented Reality solution that works in dynamic outdoor environments. ATARS allows Virtual and Constructive assets into the real world by allowing pilots and ground operators to see synthetic threats in real-time, outdoors. and critically, in high-speed environments. By blending Augmented Reality and artificial intelligence and using both the indoor and outdoor space around us as a medium, Red 6 has redefined the limits of how the world will experience, share, and interact with its information.” CEO Daniel Robinson donning an ATARS for a test flight., Red 6 Red 6, which just closed a $30M Series A financing round, with the vast majority of those funds coming from Snowpoint Ventures , is on the attack and plans on spreading its innovations into other combat domains in the future, just as we discussed in our big interview piece. Still, the potential for this system to revolutionize one of the most costly aspects of preparing for modern warfare—air-to-air combat training—is becoming very real. The savings from introducing this system, even to a limited degree, for some recurrent air-to-air training would be massive in terms of all the costs involved, including the wear-and-tear these training flights impose on the adversary aircraft, which is usually a similar fighter from the unit’s own squadron. The company scored another big win last March when Dr. William Roper, who left his previous job as Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics earlier this year, and is considered a highly influential visionary by some, joined Red 6’s advisory board. This vote of confidence from one of the Pentagon’s leading minds on airpower definitely helped the company’s position as a potential major market disruptor. As for what comes next, Red 6 is about to enter into phase three of their Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) initiative with AFWERX , which will see ATARS deployed aboard T-38 Talon trainers of the 586th Flight Test Squadron at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. There, Air Force pilots will put ATARS through its paces. The next step will be integrating it into an F-16 Viper fighter jet, which will bring another level of challenging performance to the concept. 586th Flight Test Squadron T-38 over White Sands Missile Range. , USAF At the very least, we can hope that allied air forces will have another tool to better and more efficiently train their pilots where applicable in the not so distant future, and in essence, augmenting the reality of their training capabilities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2020",Cruise Missile Variant Of Navy’s JSOW Glide Bomb Is On The Chopping Block,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has reversed its plans to field a stealthy cruise missile derived from the AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon glide weapon, or JSOW. In lieu of these previous plans to acquire the AGM-154E Joint Stand-Off Weapon-Extended Range, or JSOW-ER, the service is now looking to buy another type of stealthy cruise missile, a design related to the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extend Range, or JASSM-ER. The expectation had been that the Navy’s F-35C Joint Strike Fighters would be able to carry JSOW-ERs internally, allowing them to employ the weapons while flying in their stealthiest configuration, something they will not be able to do with the JASSM-ER. The Navy’s latest budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year, which it released on May 28, 2021, as part of the larger U.S. military-wide budget proposal, makes clear that it has abandoned the JSOW-ER effort. The service has asked for no funding for JSOW research and development in the coming fiscal cycle because of that decision and the completion of work on cryptographic upgrades for the datalinks on the AGM-154C-1 JSOW variant. Separately, the service confirmed to Aviation Week that it had decided to purchase what it described as JASSM-ERs. An unpowered AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bomb., MKFI via Wikimedia “JSOW Extend Range development has been removed from the program roadmap,” the budget documents state bluntly. “The Navy has decided not to pursue JSOW ER capability.” The section of the US Navy’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget request dealing with JSOW-related research and development., USN The budget documents do not provide any additional information as to the reasons why the Navy made this decision. In 2019, the Navy had announced plans to issue a sole-source contract to Raytheon, the current manufacturer of the JSOW, for the development of the JSOW-ER derivative. At that time, it expected to begin fielding these weapons, integrated onto its F-35Cs, as well as F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , no later than 2023. What the Navy’s exact requirements for the JSOW-ER were are unclear, but Raytheon had previously pitched two different powered JSOW derivatives, both of which had the same general form factor as the original unpowered glide bomb. The company had flight-tested the second design, which had a Hamilton Sundstrand TJ-50 turbojet installed in the tail, in 2009, reportedly demonstrating its ability to hit targets out to a distance of nearly 265 miles. The tail end of a JSOW-ER prototype showing its turbojet engine., Raytheon Those earlier powered JSOW designs also carried over the pop-out wings from the original glide weapon, the first examples of which began entering service in the 1990s. The original AGM-154A version carried a load of 145 BLU-97/B cluster bomblets. Depending on the release profile, AGM-154s, which have a very small radar cross-section, can glide to targets up to 70 miles away. The JSOW-ER would’ve given the weapon significant additional stand-off range, which is increasingly valuable as potential near-peer opponents, such as Russia and China, as well as smaller adversaries , continue to expand and modernize their air defense capabilities . Unpowered JSOWs already give Navy jets an important stand-off weapon for engaging enemy air defense assets. The new cruise missile would also have been able to leverage the JSOW’s modular payload capability, as well as other upgrades it has received over the years, giving it added flexibility. The aforementioned AGM-154C-1, which carries a multi-part warhead designed to penetrate hardened targets, also has an imaging infrared seeker that gives it increased accuracy and the ability to target moving ships. That seeker is also immune to electronic warfare jamming. The basic AGM-154C, as well as other AGM-154 variants, including the A model with its cluster munitions payload and the A-1 variant with its 1,000-pound-class high-explosive warhead, can only be used against fixed targets using their GPS-assisted inertial navigation system guidance package. All of the JSOW types that remain in U.S. military service have also been upgraded with two-way datalinks that allow them to receive new targeting information in flight, as well. You can read much more about the JSOW in detail in this past War Zone feature . On a number of levels, scrapping the JSOW-ER for the extended-range variant of the increasingly popular and combat-proven JASSM family makes sense. The U.S. Air Force removed its JSOWs from service in 2008, leaving the Navy as the only U.S. military service still employing those glide bombs. In addition, other portions of the Navy’s budget proposal say that its JASSM-ER will not just be a standard AGM-158B, but will instead be a service-specific version of that weapon that also leverages components of the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). LRASM is derived from the core JASSM design. The Navy says its JASSM-ER version will, as a result, have both anti-ship and land-attack capabilities. Details about the Navy’s JASSM-ER variant as laid out in the service’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget proposal., USN In 2018, the Navy achieved an early operational capability with LRASM on the Super Hornet. The Navy now plans to integrate LRASM onto its F-35Cs , as well as its P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft , and the Air Force has also added that weapon to the B-1B bomber’s arsenal . An artist’s conception of an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter carrying a pair of AGM-158C LRASMs under its wings., Lockheed Martin It’s also worth noting that Lockheed Martin, which produces the JASSM series, has integrated the AGM-158A variant onto older F/A-18 Hornet variants for both Australia and Finland . All of this could help simplify the process of adding the JASSM-ER to the available arsenals for the F/A-18E/F and F-35C, as well as ease logistics and sustainment burdens. With the Air Force pursuing multiple new JASSM variants right now, it could open a pathway to additional capabilities for Navy jets down the line, too. At the same time, JASSM series missiles, to include the LRASM, are too big to be carried internally on any variant of the F-35. This had been one of the clear potential benefits of the JSOW-ER, which would give Navy F-35Cs, as well as potentially F-35As flown by the Air Force or foreign allies and partners, extra stand-off capability while operating in their most stealthy configuration. Carrying JASSMs or LRASMs externally on pylons under the wings can only impact those jets’ stealthy characteristics, though it still offers them a valuable stand-off capability. The JASSM-ER’s range is at least 575 miles, significantly greater than the demonstrated range of the TJ-50 turbojet-powered JSOW, according to publicly available information . Under contract from the Air Force, Lockheed Martin is now working on a JASSM-XR variant that could have a range of more than 1,000 miles, while still retaining the same form factor as the AGM-158B. It is also important to note that the Navy will continue to field unpowered JSOW variants, which can be carried internally on the F-35C. An F-35C with its internal weapons bays open showing it carrying a pair of AGM-154 JSOWs, as well as two AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), during a test., Lockheed Martin The JSOW-ER isn’t the only new stand-off weapon in development that the Navy’s F-35Cs could carry internally, as well. Just this year, the Norwegian Defense Materiel Agency, or Forsvarsmateriell (FMA), in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, conducted the first test launch of a Joint Strike Missile (JSM) cruise missile from an internal weapons bay on an F-35A. The JSM, which Norwegian defense contractor Kongsberg is developing together with Raytheon in the United States, and that a number of international F-35A operators are already looking to acquire , is an air-launched derivative of Kongsberg’s surface-launched Naval Strike Missile (NSM). The NSM, a weapon the Navy and the Marine Corps are acquiring for ship and ground-launched use , respectively, is primarily an anti-ship weapon, but has a secondary land-attack capability. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter prepared to launch a Joint Strike Missile during a test in February 2021., FMA In addition, it’s not clear if the Navy’s decision to drop out of the JSOW-ER program spells the end of that project completely. In November 2020, the U.S. government approved a potential sale of various aircraft munitions to the United Arab Emirates. That package included 50 AGM-154Es , among other things. Raytheon could certainly seek to finish work on this weapon as a private venture and offer it for export. A dozen countries, including the United States, have unpowered JSOWs in service and could be interested in the cruise missile derivative. That would also give the Navy an easy way to circle back to the JSOW-ER in the future, should it decide to do so. For now, at least, the Navy has made clear that it no longer has any intention of buying cruise missiles based on the JSOW glide bomb design.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jan 22, 2021",Some Chinese-Made Drones Cleared By Pentagon For U.S. Government Use,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For years, members of Congress, the Department of Defense, and even the White House, among others, have raised security concerns surrounding the use of foreign-made drones, especially ones built in China. At least some of those fears may have been unfounded, however, according to a new analysis conducted by the Pentagon. A report issued in May cleared the use of some drones made by Chinese manufacturer Da Jiang Innovations, better known by the acronym DJI, for use by the U.S. government. Nevertheless, many American officials believe these threats remain and are pressing, and must be addressed. According to a summary of the report reviewed by The Associated Press , as well as other outlets , the Pentagon found no evidence of backdoor exploits or harmful software in two drone models made by DJI specifically for the U.S. government. “DJI Government Edition versions that were tested, show no malicious code or intent and are recommended for use by government entities and forces working with US services,” the summary reportedly says, though the bulk of the report remains classified. When reached by The Associated Press , the report’s author, U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Adam Prater, who is assigned to U.S. Army Special Operations Command, declined to comment and said he was not authorized to speak to the media. A DJI Phantom 4 quadcopter, Wikimedia Commons There are growing fears about potential backdoor exploits being integrated into the electronic components of various Chinese-made products, including reports about computer chips that may have been tampered with. This, in turn, has led many U.S. lawmakers and military leaders to raise questions about whether drones manufactured in China might be used to transfer sensitive data from inside the United States to that country’s intelligence agencies or the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). DJI, based in China’s Shenzhen province, produces some 80% of the world’s commercial drones , and many of these end up in the fleets of U.S. government agencies and departments. Nearly every list of best-selling or best-performing drones ranks DJI models among the top , if not the top across the board. Despite the May 6 report issued by the Pentagon, which downplays the potential threat that DJI drones may pose, Congress is still considering a ban on foreign drone technologies. A bill introduced by Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, would, if passed, institute a ban on U.S. government acquisitions of drones manufactured in China, as well as other “covered foreign entities.” The bill, titled the “American Security Drone Act of 2021” defines those entities as: (A) An entity included on the Consolidated Screening List . (B) Any entity that is subject to extrajudicial direction from a foreign government, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security. (C) Any entity the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense, determines poses a national security risk. (D) Any entity domiciled in the People’s Republic of China or subject to influence or control by the Government of the People Republic of China or the Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security. (E) Any subsidiary or affiliate of an entity described in subparagraphs (A) through (D). Independent think tanks have issued their own analyses that support the bill’s aim, with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies asserting that “the companies that DoD has listed so far represent just the tip of the iceberg” when it comes to ties between Chinese technology firms and the PLA. Similar concerns have had far-reaching effects, as was the case in 2020 when the United States almost blocked the future deployments of two U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter squadrons to the United Kingdom due to worries over Chinese-made telecommunications technologies being rolled out across that country and the potential for information-gathering it posed. DJI flagship store in Shenzhen, China, DJI For these reasons, the U.S. Army banned all DJI-made drones in 2017. DJI executives pushed back on the allegations at the time, stating that none of those claims were “accompanied by evidence or analysis demonstrating that there’s a factual basis behind the allegation.” Nevertheless, in January 2021, the White House issued an executive order that sought to mitigate the use of drones that might “present unacceptable risks and are manufactured by, or contain software or critical electronic components from, foreign adversaries.” Specific adversary nations listed in the report included North Korea, Russia, Iran, and, most significantly, China. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Interior had also grounded its entire drone fleet stating that while unmanned aerial systems are critical to its mission, the department “must ensure that the technology used for these operations is such that it will not compromise our national security interests.” That decision, which affected all drones the department was using at the time, regardless of where they were made, but was clearly seen as primarily targeting Chinese-made types in use at the time, came on the immediate heels of a spate of bizarre drone sightings across Colorado and Nebraska that remain unexplained to this day. Worries over drone safety are not unfounded nor are they based solely on growing concerns about Chinese influence and spying capabilities. In addition to opening the door for potential cybersecurity threats, drones are posing an increasingly dangerous physical threat. Many recent incidents within the United States borders , some over critical infrastructure , or above overseas military installations , highlight the increasingly salient threat posed by small drones and even off-the-shelf commercial models. While the U.S. government is still developing strategies to mitigate the physical drone threat , the Pentagon’s recent report should at least calm some worries over the cybersecurity implications of the government’s use of DJI drones, specifically. Congress has yet to vote on the American Security Drone Act of 2021, so it’s unknown what impact the Pentagon’s report on DJI drones will have when it comes to legislating this issue. Nevertheless, the debate over the use of foreign-made drones highlights the more wide-ranging issue of American reliance on overseas manufacturing, particularly when it comes to technologies for use in national security or infrastructure. Given that China and Taiwan manufacture the vast majority of the world’s computer chips and essential telecommunication technologies, there have been frequent calls for America to build its own domestic manufacturing base for microelectronics to avoid altogether the threat of backdoor exploits or insecure supply chains. Whether or not the United States can wean itself off of this reliance Chinese-made goods will no doubt be a significant factor in Sino-U.S. relations moving forward.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 19, 2021",Arguably The Iranian Navy’s Most Critical Vessel Has Sunk In The Gulf Of Oman,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of Iran’s most important naval vessels, previously the biggest in its fleet, the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy replenishment ship Kharg has caught fire and sunk in the Gulf of Oman, with the cause of the blaze still under investigation. The fire reportedly broke out in the engine house at around 2:25 am local time today and the ship sunk around 20 hours later, after efforts to put out the blaze failed. Reports from semi-official Iranian news agencies suggest that approximately 400 crew were on board as part of a training mission. All were apparently evacuated by other boats and helicopters before the 679-foot ship went down around six miles from the Iranian port of Jask, near the Strait of Hormuz. A spokesman from the Iranian Navy said the fire was so intense that half of the ship’s hull melted and broke off. Around 20 sailors apparently received minor injuries during the incident and some received treatment at the naval hospital in Bandar Abbas, a port city in southeastern Iran that is situated along the strategic Strait of Hormuz that is home to the Iranian Navy’s main base of operations. IRIS Kharg ., Hossein Esmaili/Mehr News Agency The IRIS Kharg was ordered during the rule of the Shah and completed in the United Kingdom in 1977 as a modified Ol class fleet replenishment oiler. Post-revolution, it was finally delivered to Iran in 1984 after protracted negotiations. The vessel served in the Iran-Iraq War, but since then, it has been increasingly used to support operations further from Iran’s own shores, including venturing as far as the Asia-Pacific region, with a visit to China in 2013. Other high-profile actions included anti-piracy missions in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Although completed as a replenishment ship to support other vessels underway at sea, the Kharg has also been used to transport cargo and as a helicopter platform, with both a helipad and hangar facilities. For many years, the Kharg was essentially the only Iranian naval ship capable of longer-range operations and as such its capabilities were regularly talked up to an absurd degree , with it frequently being described as a ‘helicopter carrier.’ The cause of the fire is unconfirmed, but so far there are no indications one way or the other that the incident might have been the result of hostile action. However, the loss of the vessel comes after a period in which there has been a series of explosions aboard other ships in the Gulf of Oman, although, so far, none have apparently sank. The U.S. Navy has blamed Iran for targeting vessels with limpet mines and has presented footage showing members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded example of one of these devices from a ship. Tehran has consistently denied these accusations. There have also been apparent tit-for-tat operations by both Iran and Israel targeting shipping, including reports of Israel conducting clandestine attacks on Iranian ships carrying oil , as well as weaponry, to Syria, where it is supporting the regime of Bashar Al Assad. According to the Wall Street Journal , Israeli began this campaign against Iranian shipping in late 2019 and has since targeted at least a dozen ships with weapons including naval mines . In April this year, the M/V Saviz , an Iranian government widely believed to be a mothership for the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, seen in the video below, was also the victim of an attack in the Red Sea. The ship is though to have been used to assist Houthi rebels in Yemen and conduct other types of clandestine operations in the region. Meanwhile, Iran and its regional proxies have been blamed for a series of attacks on tankers sailing in the Gulf of Oman in the past year. Last November, for example, a Maltese-flagged oil tanker was the victim of an apparent naval mine , or perhaps a limpet mine, in the Red Sea, an event that we discussed here . Once again, there is no indication so far that the Kharg may have become a target for one of Iran’s rivals and it would not be the first time that a naval disaster has struck the country. Last July, an Iranian missile mistakenly hit a friendly vessel during a military training exercise, also near Jask. On that occasion, 19 sailors were killed and 15 wounded. In 2018, meanwhile, an Iranian destroyer, the IRIS Damavand , sank in the Caspian Sea , after hitting a breakwater in an incident that claimed the lives of two sailors. There is also no evidence that the Kharg was in any way related to an ongoing mission involving apparent Iranian support for Venezuela. The Iranian Navy’s recently commissioned forward-basing ship, IRINS Makran , a converted oil tanker, left its port in April carrying seven high-speed missile-attack craft on its deck. Reports suggest that the vessel is heading to Venezuela, although Iranian officials have neither confirmed nor denied this. The forward-basing ship Makran ., IRANIAN STATE MEDIA While the Makran offers some of the same capabilities as the Kharg , today’s incident represents a significant loss for the Iranian Navy, especially in terms of its capacity to conduct operations further afield. While there are two Bandar Abbas class fleet oilers available, these are much smaller and altogether less capable. Whatever the reason for the fire aboard the Kharg , its loss will surely be felt by the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy as it increasingly looks to operate further from its traditional operating waters in the Gulf of Oman.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 5, 2021",Not Even The Monarchy Wants This New Royal Yacht,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Almost as soon as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to spend up to around $280 million on a new Royal Yacht, the Royal Family itself moved to distance itself from the proposal, apparently considering it “too grand” for the modern era. The prime minister, who has long supported the project, unveiled the plans for the new vessel two days ago, apparently with the hope of naming it after Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh, who died earlier this year. Reports from the United Kingdom suggest the Royal Family was less than impressed with that idea, too. “It is not something we have asked for,” an unnamed senior royal source told The Times about the ship. The same newspaper also reported that the Queen herself was unenthusiastic about the plan to build a new national flagship. It might be expected that a country facing the combined economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic slump , as well as the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, would be inclined to share that viewpoint. The Royal Yacht Britannia in Hull, northeast England, as part of the Queen’s Royal Silver Jubilee tour in 1977., East Riding Archives/Wikimedia Commons Since the monarch no longer undertakes overseas trips and the Royal Family will reportedly not use the new ship for any personal travel, it may well simply be a case that they consider the ‘Royal Yacht’ name superfluous or even misleading. In fact, the ship as Johnson has described it will be more of a floating advertising vehicle to promote British trade around the world in the post-Brexit era than it will be a direct successor to the previous Royal Yacht Britannia , a luxury vessel that was decommissioned in 1997 without replacement. The new ship, which is planned to be built in British shipyards, and will be crewed by Royal Navy personnel, will fly the flag for the United Kingdom during governmental summits and international talks, as well as hosting trade fairs, for example. “This new national flagship will be the first vessel of its kind in the world, reflecting the U.K.’s burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation,” Prime Minister Johnson declared . Prime Minister Boris Johnson outside 10 Downing Street., CROWN COPYRIGHT It was apparently also Johnson’s plan to name the ship in honor of the Duke of Edinburgh, who was a naval officer, although this has seemingly been abandoned under pressure from the royals. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh onboard HMS Endurance reviewing the fleet in 2005., CROWN COPYRIGHT Indeed, it appears the very concept of devising a new Royal Yacht is not one that the Royal Family has been involved in. “It is a government decision, Buckingham Palace has not been involved in the decision, but we respect it,” a palace source told The Times . Without the palace’s support, the argument for a Royal Yacht — or at least, a vessel bearing its name — seems less convincing. While senior royals will be able to make use of the vessel during government-led overseas visits, it will be a far cry from the former Royal Yacht Britannia , upon which the Royal Family made regular holidays, often escorted by a Royal Navy warship. Police officers on motorbikes in front of Royal Yacht Britannia in 1977., East Riding Archives/Wikimedia Commons In all, the Royal Yacht Britannia , which made its maiden voyage in 1954, completed 968 state visits and also served as the location for the honeymoon cruise of Charles and Diana, the Prince and Princess of Wales, in 1981. So, while the Royal Yacht branding seems tenuous, the plan to have the new ship constructed by a U.K. shipyard could win more popular support as could the call to build a vessel that “reflects British design expertise and the latest innovations in green technology,” in the government’s words. The timescale to realize this is fairly ambitious, calling for construction to begin next year, followed by service entry within the next four years. It would be expected to serve for around 30 years. Despite reports that the vessel will “boost the ailing shipbuilding industry,” currently the United Kingdom’s naval shipyards, at least, are looking fairly healthy. Work is underway on eight Type 26 and five Type 31 frigates, while the latest defense review outlined plans to build up to five new Type 32 frigates, up to six Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), and ultimately a new class of Type 83 destroyer. These are in addition to three Fleet Solid Support ships needed to support the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, and a Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance Ship. The U.K. government’s vision of the Royal Navy in 2030 as outlined in its latest defense review., U.K. Parliament It’s also fair to say that similar Johnson plans to promote British interests have been met with mixed reactions. Last year, the Royal Air Force’s VIP-configured Voyager tanker transport aircraft appeared in a new high-visibility paint job with the Union Jack on the tail at a cost of over $1.1 million. The repainting of this aircraft, which can be used by the prime minister, members of the Royal Family, and other senior officials, was controversial, to say the least . The Royal Air Force’s specially painted VIP Voyager, known as Vespina ., CROWN COPYRIGHT It seems that despite the palace’s lukewarm reaction to the new Royal Yacht, the plan is to push ahead with it regardless, although it’s hard to make a convincing case for the requirement when other countries successfully manage to conduct high-level meetings and promote trade and industry without the need for a bespoke national flagship. In parliament, the plan has already attracted criticism from the opposition Labour Party. “Right now, our country faces huge challenges, and there’s no sign the government has a plan for the recovery,” said Labour’s shadow treasury chief secretary, Bridget Phillipson. “If this ship is going to be part of a genuine plan for Britain’s future, the government must set out clearly how it will boost trade, jobs and growth in every corner of our country.” Royal Yacht Britannia underway on the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario, in 1959., Library and Archives Canada Johnson previously brought up the idea of a new Royal Yacht back in 2017 , when he was serving as Foreign Secretary. At the time he suggested it could be paid for using private backing, although it’s unclear if that is still being considered as an option. Although the idea failed to gain much traction within Johnson’s Conservative Party back then, there has been some vocal support for the proposal since, in particular the Daily Telegraph running its own campaign to drum up support for it. One of its arguments has been that “trade days” aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia helped encourage lucrative trade deals, although this is very hard to verify. Interestingly, the Queen also lobbied in the past for a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia , one of her senior officials telling the government in 1995 that she would “very much welcome” a new ship once this vessel was decommissioned. The related documents have since been removed from public view , but it now seems abundantly clear that her stance on this matter has changed in the intervening years. There’s also an argument to be made that sending high-level delegations, royal or otherwise, around the world on a boat will bring a whole set of new force-protection and security issues that will have to be addressed. This ship, literally a big floating national symbol, would also present a massive target in an age where even non-state actors possess advanced weapons like anti-ship cruise missiles. While the Royal Navy may have been the winner in the recent defense review , the government still has to pay for building and then operating its planned new ships, with the new Royal Yacht not only eating into much-needed budget but also likely demanding an escort vessel for at least some of its deployments. There are already concerns major that tasking commitments for escort vessels for Britain’s two carriers will not be met, along with many other independent naval priorities around the globe. Of course, should the as-yet-unnamed new Royal Yacht bring in the business that’s promised, it might ultimately make good on its approximately $280 million pricetag. By way of contrast, a Type 31 frigate costs around $350 million. On top of the acquisition budget, however, there is also the cost of running the ship. In 2017, that was estimated at $12 million a year. If it fails to live up to its promise, the new flagship could become an embarrassing white elephant and an expensive security risk on top of it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 28, 2021",The Navy’s Railgun Looks Like It’s Finally Facing The Axe In New Budget Request,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After some 16 years of research and development, the U.S. Navy appears poised to kill its electromagnetic railgun program . The service has not asked for any new funding for the project in its latest budget request and says it will wrap up all the work it has planned now by the end of the current fiscal year, before effectively putting what’s left of this effort into storage. The Navy’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget , which it released on May 28, 2021, as part of the larger U.S. military-wide request, zeroes out two separate line items related to railgun research and development. It also shows that the service did not ask for, or receive, any funding for the project through the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Research account in the Fiscal Year 2021 budget. It did, however, get nearly $9.5 million in requested funding, plus another $20 million that Congress decided by itself to add on top of that, through the INP Advanced Technology Development portion of the budget for that fiscal cycle. Since the Office of Naval Research (ONR) formally began work on the railgun project in 2005, funding for it has come through a number of different line items. In the past, this sometimes caused confusion and led to erroneous reports that the program had been canceled. The Navy’s plans now seem to be clear. With regards to the INP Advanced Technology Development account, the budget documents say that “the decrease in funding from FY 2021 to FY 2022 is due to the completion of Advanced Technology Development efforts under this Activity.” This line item also says that the objectives for this program in the 2022 Fiscal Year are “N/A” and does not make any mention of future work funded through other portions of the budget. The portion of Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Research line item from the Navy’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget request covering the electromagnetic railgun program., USN A portion of INP Advanced Technology Development line item from the Navy’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget request dealing with electromagnetic railgun program., USN USN A section from the Navy’s 2022 Fiscal Year budget request discussing the $20 million Congress added on top of its request for funding for the railgun program in the preceding fiscal cycle., USN “Railgun technology and knowledge attained will be documented and preserved,” according to a separate section describing the purpose of the extra funds Congress added to the program in the 2021 Fiscal Year, further indicating that the plan is now, at best, to shelve the project indefinitely. “Railgun hardware will be realigned to maximize its sustainability to facilitate potential future use.” The War Zone has reached out to ONR for further information on the exact fate of the railgun program and how it or other entities within the U.S. Navy or elsewhere across the U.S. military might leverage any of the project’s existing work. The Navy has tested at least two different railgun designs since 2005, one from BAE Systems and one from General Atomics , with the former being the primary prototype the service has used in its previous research and development efforts. Both of these weapons functioned in the same way, launching solid projectiles using powerful electrically-generated magnetic fields. The General Atomics prototype railgun that the Navy tested., USN As of 2017, ONR said that it had demonstrated the ability of at least one of these weapons to fire rounds at speeds greater than 4,500 miles per hour, or around six times the speed of sound, in land-based testing. That same year, it also showed that it could fire a salvo of rounds in relatively rapid succession from the BAE Systems prototype. The stated goal at that time was to develop a design capable of hitting targets of various kinds , ranging from ships and threats ashore to aircraft and incoming missiles, up to 100 miles away. In the past four years, however, the status of this program and any milestones it may have achieved have becoming increasingly murky, due in no small part to a gag order the service imposed on virtually any public discussion about this work. The last major development the service publicly acknowledged was its decision to move all of the work, including the prototype railguns, from the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWC Dahlgren), in Virginia to the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in New Mexico. At that time, there was also public discussion about a possible upcoming at-sea test off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The Navy had originally planned to fire a prototype railgun from a ship in 2016, before repeatedly pushing back that timeline. The service had previously said it expected operational examples of these weapons to be in service by 2025, as well. Artwork depicting the USNS Millinocket , which is now designated as a Spearhead class expeditionary fast transport, with an electromagnetic railgun installed in a test fixture on its rear helipad., USN There had also been multiple reports in recent years indicating that the Navy was close to canceling the railgun project, through funding continued at relatively steady levels right through to the current fiscal year. The appearance of a Chinese naval railgun in an advanced state of development in 2018 had also looked as if it could reinvigorate the Navy’s own effort. China’s railgun prototype surprised the world and it was throught that its existance might influence the U.S. Navy to forge ahead on its floundering railgun project., Chinese internet The railgun test ship. pic.twitter.com/bl95mRttGM — dafeng cao (@dafengcao) June 12, 2019 Now, whatever may have happened behind the scenes, the end of the railgun program, at least publicly, does appear to be in sight. At the same time, especially given the secrecy surrounding the existing project, its worth pointing that railgun-related work could still continue in the classified realm. It is also important to note that the Navy had already spiraled off work on Hyper-Velocity Projectile (HVP), based on the design of the round for the railgun, but which could be fired from other weapons, including 5-inch naval guns and 155mm howitzers, at speeds up to Mach 3. The service has said that this is still fast enough to engage a wide variety of targets compared to traditional gun-fired ammunition. A U.S. Army XM1299 155mm self-propelled howitzer did successfully shoot down a BQM-167 target drone acting as a surrogate for a cruise missile during a larger, multi-faceted experimental last year. An old briefing slide showing the Navy’s vision for how it might employ railgun-fired projectiles, as well as HVPs fired from other guns, against a variety of targets., USN A 5-inch gun on a test stand on the ground and an M107 self-propelled howitzer modified to serve as a land-based testbed for the Navy’s 155mm Advanced Gun System (AGS), one of the main weapons on the service’s Zumwalt class stealth destroyers , also fired HVPs during that same event . The HVP, which the Navy has also tested at sea from the 5-inch gun on an Arleigh Burke class destroyer, has been discussed as one potential way to get some capability out of the AGSs. In 2016, the service had announced it would not buy any 155mm Long Range Land Attack Projectiles (LRLAP), after units costs soared, leaving those weapons without any ammunition . Mockups of HVPs designed to be fired from, top to bottom, 5-inch naval guns, 155mm howitzers, and electromagnetic railguns., Joseph Trevithick The Navy is also exploring ripping out the AGSs on two Zumwalt class destroyers it has already received, as well as the third example, which is in the latter stages of construction, and replacing them with entirely new weapon systems. One possibility may be launchers for future hypersonic weapons . Progress on various hypersonic missile programs may be among the factors that have led the service to stop work on the railgun program. Though not necessarily as flexible as the railgun was expected to be, the Navy has a number of hypersonic missiles in development now that still promise to be versatile. This includes the SM-6 Block IB , which is designed to be able to promptly engage a variety of aerial and surface threats . “We’ve learned a lot and the engineering of building something like that that can handle that much electromagnetic energy and not just explode is challenging,” now-retired Navy Admiral John Richardson, then Chief of Naval Operations, said during a talk at the Atlantic Council think tank in 2019. “It’s too great a weapon system, so it’s going somewhere, hopefully.” Still, he added that, in his opinion, the railgun program had been a “case study that would say ‘This is how innovation maybe shouldn’t happen.'” Congress could still add money to the final Fiscal Year 2022 budget to keep this program alive. However, the aforementioned justification lawmakers gave for giving the Navy extra funds for the project in the current fiscal year indicates they agree with the service’s current plan. The Navy does now plan to retain hardware and documentation related to the past 16 years of railgun work, in case it wants to revisit the concept again in the future. For now, at least, the service’s ambitions to field weapons of this type look like they have finally come to an end. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Robert Hopkins,"Posted on Feb 19, 2021",The History Of American Presidents Flying Aboard Doomsday Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of America’s most closely guarded secrets is the procedure to ensure the survival of the president and his or her senior defense advisors in the event of a national emergency. Until the advent of nuclear weapons, this was easily accomplished by means of secure basement-level rooms at the White House and the Pentagon . Soviet acquisition of “the bomb” changed this calculus, necessitating the relocation of the president and his advisors to long-term facilities outside of Washington DC, such as the Alternate National Military Command Center at Raven Rock, Maryland. As nuclear weapons became more powerful, the increasing vulnerability of even these bunkers reduced their value to America’s post-crisis Continuity of Government (CoG) program. Two options enhanced this survivability equation: airborne and shipborne command posts . In July 1960 Strategic Air Command (SAC) evaluated the use of five Boeing KC-135As as backups to the SAC underground command post at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. This test proved successful, and on February 1, 1961, SAC began 24/7 Looking Glass airborne alert, so named because it mirrored the capabilities of SAC’s primary command post. At the same time, the Air Force recommended a similarly configured KC-135 be stationed at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland as a National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) for the president and his advisors. The Navy suggested using the modified cruiser USS Northampton located in the Chesapeake Bay as a National Emergency Command Post Afloat (NECPA). An E-4B flying over the Capital., US National Archives NIGHT WATCH NEACP operations began on February 19, 1962 with three KC-135A airborne command post aircraft assigned to the Night Watch program. One KC-135A, manned by a Joint Alternate Command Element battle staff (known by their static “back-end” call sign Silver Dollar), was on 24/7 alert and could be launched within 15 minutes. A second KC-135A was on a one-hour alert. The third jet was used for training when it wasn’t undergoing maintenance. A Silver Dollar KC-135A., Photo by Frank MacSorley via Stephen Miller Acquisition of KC-135Bs equipped with turbofan engines, receiver air refueling capability , and enhanced communication gear resulted in the March 1966 delivery of three replacement NEACP EC-135Js. The USS Northampton assumed NECPA duties in March 1962, augmented the following year with the USS Wright . By 1964, one ship was on alert at all times. The battle staff included 17 officers and 22 enlisted personnel. You can read all about these obscure but fascinating ships in this past War Zone feature . USS Wright with its deck refitted into an antenna farm for the NECPA mission., US Navy Surprisingly, there is no record of any NEACP inspection visits—let alone flights—by either President John F. Kennedy or Lyndon B. Johnson. Indeed, the very first presidential NEACP flight took place on May 11, 1969, when Richard M. Nixon flew from Homestead Air Force Base in Florida back to Andrews on an EC-135J. Among those accompanying Nixon on the two-hour and eight-minute, 900 nautical mile flight were his assistant for national security affairs Henry Kissinger, advisors H. R. “Bob” Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, press secretary Ron Ziegler, military aide Air Force Colonel James Hughes, U.S. Army Major General Charles Myer (a signals and communications expert), Air Force One pilot Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Albertazzie, Nixon’s physician Dr. Walter Tkach, and Secret Service agents Ronald Pontius and Arthur Godfrey. Considering the absence of windows, the presence of a 15-member battle staff, and the paucity of “executive seats,” the flight must have been uncomfortable and claustrophobic, to say the least. Haldeman recorded the experience in his journal : Came back to DC on the Airborne Command Post—and they staged a briefing and a test exercise. Pretty scary. They went through the whole intelligence + operational briefings—with interruptions, etc. to make it realistic. Exercise proved to P. that when the Russians appear to be launching an attack our options are pretty limited + our retaliatory strike power is pretty weak. Fascinating plane—with command room set up—all kinds of communications, display boards, rear projection, etc. Took P. a while to get into the thing (his mind was on the peace plan) but he finally did—and was quite interested. Asked a lot of questions re: our nuclear capability—and kill results. Obviously worried about the lightly tossed-about millions of deaths. An EC-135J NEACP. , Author’s Collection Nonetheless, press reaction was negative to the very notion of the president surviving a nuclear strike while the nation floundered in devastation. In an April 1974 Washington Monthly article “ Nixon’s Flying Füherbunker ,” Mary Meehan quoted Arkansas Senator William Fulbright’s 1972 lament that if Americans heard “that danger was threatening the country [and] the President and all his staff…boarded a plane and [had] taken off and left the United States to whatever fate it may suffer … I am sure that in England, during World War II, when Churchill was standing there, trying to encourage his people to resist, it would have been a strange sight if he had taken off in a plane instead.” Meehan continued, saying that after a nuclear exchange killed 80% of the American population, “…your Commander-in-Chief will be flying around above the wreckage, getting even with the Russians and making plans for the next generation of peace.” It is hard to disentangle the media hatred of Nixon from the issue of presidential survival, but other critics wondered if there was a need for the Secretary of the Treasury to survive in order to collect income taxes in a post-apocalyptic hell and the Post Master General to register the millions of dead. Bigger is Better The EC-135J NEACPs were arguably only second-generation systems, vulnerable to electromagnetic pulse (EMP), as well as having inadequate crew space, limited computational and data storage facilities, and outdated communication suite technology. Planning for a replacement Advanced Airborne Command Post (AABNCP) began in the early 1960s. SAC originally wanted a fleet of Lockheed ‘EC-5s’, but the airplane’s troubled production and political considerations resulted instead in the selection of Boeing’s 747. In addition, SAC intended that the E-4A (later modified to E-4B standards ) would replace both the entire Looking Glass EC-135C and Night Watch NEACP EC-135J fleet based at Andrews on a one-to-one basis. An E-4A., Lindsay Peacock In 1971, then-Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird directed the procurement of seven E-4s, with the planned first delivery in 1975. Three of these would be delivered as part of Phase I, Block I as E-4As, with the fourth delivery as an E-4B under Phase I, Block II. Options for the remaining three jets would be exercised contingent upon satisfactory completion of initial operational testing and evaluation (OT&E). On July 28, 1975, then-Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, under President Gerald Ford, eliminated the seventh planned jet, and, due to excessive cost overruns, deferred any decision on the remaining two unbuilt jets until FY79. One month later, Schlesinger articulated specific duty assignments for the four extant E-4s: One airborne 24/7 for SAC’s Commander-in-Chief (CINCSAC) One on ground “hot alert” (crisis or increased defense condition—DEFCON) for NEACP One “common” backup One flight crew and battle staff trainer Obviously, these plans were unrealistic, especially the 24/7 CINCSAC mission (it was not clear if this was a replacement for the Looking Glass or if this was CINCSAC’s dedicated alert jet). Moreover, the “common” requirements meant that all E-4s would have to be configured for both the SAC and NEACP missions. A presentation underway in the briefing room aboard the E-4A., National Archives, Still Pictures Branch, RG 342B, box 30 Cancellation Jimmy Carter was the first president to fly aboard an E-4 NEACP on February 11, 1977, some three weeks after his inauguration. During the 1-hour, 33-minute flight covering some 500 nautical miles from Andrews to Warner Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, Carter and Georgia Senator Sam Nunn were briefed on the NEACP mission and capabilities by U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Anderson W. Atkinson, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Deputy Director for National Military Command System (NMCS). Three days later, Carter directed then-Secretary of Defense Harold Brown to cancel all remaining E-4 orders claiming they were expensive and unnecessary. Carter had made clear that, in the event of a nuclear attack on the United States, he would remain in Washington DC, and allow Vice President Walter Mondale to assume the presidential mantle after becoming airborne in the NEACP at DEFCON 2. However, gallant and patriotic this might seem, Soviet SS-N-6 Serbs fired from Yankee class boomers would reach the White House in six to 10 minutes, making this a meaningless gesture. Presidential Daily Diary, Jimmy Carter Library Of the seven original E-4s, one was canceled under Ford, two under Carter, and four remain operational today. And no, the E-4 doesn’t sit alert with one (or all four) engines running. At normal alert locations such as Offutt or Grissom Air Force Base (now Grissom Air Reserve Base) in Indiana, facilities are in place that obviate the need for power-on alert. At remote locations, leaving one engine running is an option. Ronald Reagan was the second president to fly aboard an E-4 on November 15, 1981, from Kelly Air Force Base in Texas to Andrews. As with Carter, he received a briefing by Lieutenant General Philip C. Gast on the communications systems linking the NEACP with the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon and the ANMCC at Raven Rock. He spent the balance of the flight working alone in a forward cabin. Interestingly, the entry for November 15 is missing from the presidential Daily Diary file at the Reagan Library, so the full details of the flight and its manifest are not known. Reagan about to board an E-4A. , Ronald Reagan Presidential Library In February 1982, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci invited Vice President George H. W. Bush to participate in the Ivy League command post exercise by flying in the NECAP, but Bush declined. There is no record of Bush flying in the E-4B NEACP while president, nor is there any record of his successor William J. Clinton doing so prior to the August 23, 1990, introduction into service of the Boeing VC-25A, which duplicated some of the NEACP’s command and control functions. In 1994, the E-4B NEACP was renamed the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), with its duties expanded to include support of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responses to natural disasters and other non-nuclear crises. In the absence of declassified official documents, it appears that under an extreme crisis, such as a nuclear or biochemical attack on the entire United States, the President and his NCA advisors would not become airborne in the traditional VC-25A, popularly referred to as Air Force One, but would instead relocate to the E-4B NAOC. This was apparently contradicted during the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in 2001, when President George W. Bush remained aboard a VC-25A after stopping briefly at Offutt, where one E-4B was ready for his immediate use. Another E-4B was caught on camera launching out of Andrews right after the attacks , resulting in a rash of conspiracy theories , and yet another one was shortly airborne over the Midwest. Rare photo of an E-4B next to a VC-25A. , Andrew Dwight One can assume that Bush and his advisors determined that he did not require the full services of the NAOC and could continue using his VC-25A. This proved unwise, as there were reportedly significant constraints on the VC-25A’s communications that would have been alleviated by the E-4B’s suite. Official records have not indicated that Presidents Barack H. Obama, Donald J. Trump, or newly elected Joseph R. Biden have flown in the NAOC. With the future of the E-4 up for grabs in the proposed Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC), Biden or his successor may be the first to fly in the next generation of airborne command posts.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 25, 2021",New Details Emerge On The “Highly Modified Drone” That Outran Police Helicopters Over Tucson,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last month, The War Zone reported on a bizarre drone encounter that occurred in the skies above Tucson, Arizona. According to reports, on the evening of February 9, 2021 around 10:30 PM local time, a helicopter belonging to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, encountered what has been described by KOLD’s Dan Marries , who interviewed an FBI agent assigned to the case, as a “highly modified drone” in controlled airspace. Another helicopter operated by the Tucson Police Department’s Air Support Unit was called in to help track and potentially identify the drone alongside the one from CBP, but the drone was able to evade them both and remain unidentified. Shortly after the incident was disclosed, the FBI released a statement asking for help from the public regarding any information related to the encounter. In the days since we first reported on the Tucson drone encounter, individuals have reached out with new information that adds further context to this still-developing story. A source with direct knowledge of the incident’s details told The War Zone they believed the drone was highly unlikely to be battery-powered based on the altitude, distance, and speed at which it flew. The source also stated it seems as though the drone was equipped with an infrared camera based how it was able to dynamically maneuver, including in relation to the helicopters chasing it, despite the low level of ambient light at the time of the incident. They also added that it is “only logical that it was looking towards DM’s [Davis Monthan AFB] flight line” based on its location. We can now also confirm that the CBP helicopter involved was indeed an Airbus AS350 , commonly used by CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) branch for aerial patrol and surveillance missions. An Airbus AS350 operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP The same source also tells us that the unusual drone was first spotted near a complex of fuel tanks just west of Runway 12 at the U.S. Air Force’s Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. This is well within the Class C airspace that surrounds Davis-Monthan, as well as the Tucson International Airport, and is very close to the fence line surrounding the base. Class C airspace is defined by the FAA as “airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a certain number of IFR [instrument flight rules] operations or passenger enplanements.” The FAA states that “for flight near airports in controlled airspace, drone operators must receive an airspace authorization prior to operation” and that these authorizations “come with altitude limitations and may include other operational provisions.” In a statement , the FBI wrote that the drone violated 18 USC 39B , “Unsafe operation of unmanned aircraft,” which includes “knowing or reckless interference or disruption of a manned aircraft, and the operation of unmanned aircraft in close proximity to airports.” The FBI called the drone’s actions “illegal and extremely dangerous,” yet added that it’s “possible the drone operator(s) are not aware they are violating the law.” The description of the drone’s initial observed location would appear to match the location of a terminal owned by Kinder Morgan, an energy company that operates fuel pipelines and other energy infrastructure. Some 40% of the natural gas consumed in America flows through Kinder Morgan’s pipelines. On their website , Kinder Morgan states that their terminals are used to store and handle various fuels, petroleum products, and chemicals – clearly not the place anyone would want an unauthorized or unidentified drone to be loitering. While drones are used in pipeline and tank inspections, and by Kinder Morgan specifically for those tasks, the unique nature of what has been reported in this incident does not appear to suggest this drone’s operators were executing that type of professional work. Runway 12 at Davis-Monthan AFB, right, and the Kinder Morgan terminal, left. , Google Maps The drone’s initial observed location was also largely confirmed by a post from another individual on JetCareers.com, which describes itself as “an online community of airline, corporate and professional pilots including air traffic controllers, dispatchers and mechanics.” In a forum post dated February 10, 2021, a moderator of that forum with the username MikeD wrote the following account of the incident: Last night, there was one just east of KTUS at about 1200’ AGL cruising eastbound. It passed about 30’ away co-altitude with a police helicopter flying the opposite direction. Helo made a 180 turn to give chase. The quad copter was described as approximately 5 feet long by about 3 feet wide, with a single green flashing LED light. It continued east into KDMAs airspace and began orbiting the base over the parallel taxiway near the fighter jet ramp. TUS and DMA towers were unaware of it, as was U90 [an FAA approach tower] controllers. The operator apparently realized by this time that the drone was being followed, because it then proceeded northwest at high speed and climbing, with the helo and another LE helo in trail. The copter began to climb and flew out of the TUS area about 50 miles to the northwest of town into the middle of nowhere desert out by the mine west of KAVQ. It was last seen climbing through 14,000’ and into the undercast, where it disappeared. The helos remained in VMC [Visual Meteorological Conditions] obviously, and one hung around for about an hour, to see if it would reappear descending, or if there was any vehicles driving through the middle of nowhere as either the operator or someone to potentially recover it. Neither appeared. U90 informed their FAA chain of command about it, but that’s as far as I’ve heard so far. Interesting in both the range and the altitude, both control-wise in terms of line of sight, as well as battery life as it comes to the endurance of the thing. The concerns with it being around air traffic and a near mid-air, as well as it being over an Air Force base with security sensitive aircraft, are all all concerning. Definitely not something commercial off-the-shelf that one would buy at the local store. The radar track of the Tucson Police Department helicopter that pursued the drone, a Bell 206B JetRanger II with the U.S. civil registration code N305PD, shows that it took off from Tucson International Airport and flew towards the edge of the airspace above Davis-Monthan. It then followed the drone to the northwest away from the city before circling back. Sources have confirmed this was indeed the police helicopter that was sent to aid the CBP AS350. RadarBox These new accounts add a fairly significant detail to the story: that the mystery drone spotted over Tucson was first seen in the airspace adjacent to, or even over, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and later flew through the base’s confines. As such, this incident would add to the growing number of recent drone incursions which have worryingly occurred in military-controlled airspace or near sensitive installations. In fact, there is a precedent for unknown drones flying at night being interested in critical energy infrastructure in Arizona. In September 2019, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station near Phoenix was the site of what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) described as a “ drone-a-palooza ,” an incident which remains unexplained to this day. The Class C airspaces surrounding Tucson International Airport (KTUS) and Davis-Monthan AFB (KDMA), SkyVector.com So far, the controller of the drone remains unidentified, as does the drone itself, which seems to have had advanced capabilities based on multiple accounts. Curiously, a portion of a police report which aired on a local news report about the incident notes that the observer in the Tucson Police Department’s helicopter was unable to observe the drone when looking through night vision goggles. KOLD/OFFICIAL TPD DOCUMENT There is a precedent of drug cartels using drones to transport both drugs and munitions across the southern border, and it has been speculated that this may have been the case in this instance, but Tucson is over 50 miles from the border. In addition, it makes little sense why smugglers would have an interest in an energy storage depot or an Air Force Base. There is also plenty of experimental aircraft activity in the area, with multiple airstrips of varying sizes in close proximity. Raytheon Missiles and Defense also operates a facility just south of Tucson, but this type of unscheduled flight close to a major metropolitan area and even over an Air Force Base and up into flight levels, above where a normal helicopter can fly, is far from typical when it comes to experimental aircraft testing. In fact, it is outright illegal behavior by the FAA’s own rules. Whatever the case may be, the drone’s reported proximity to both an international airport and an Air Force base is worrying. The drone’s reported altitude and the fact that it outran two law enforcement helicopters is also concerning, given the increasing threat drones pose to critical infrastructure and defense installations. We will continue to investigate this strange incident and will report back when we find out more. ​ Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com Brett Tingley Air Helicopters Unmanned"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 24, 2021",Rocket Delivery Of Cargo Anywhere In An Hour In New Air Force Budget Proposal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released new details about its questionably ambitious plans to develop a capability to send payloads weighing up to 100 tons, including cargo and potentially personnel, roughly equivalent to the maximum load of a C-17 airlifter , anywhere in the world within one hour via a space launch rocket or derivative thereof. The service now wants to demonstrate the basic feasibility of this concept in a real end-to-end test next year. This and other information is contained in the service’s proposed budget for the 2022 Fiscal Year, which includes a request for nearly $48 million in additional funding for this program. This is an almost five-fold increase over the funding it received for this project for the current fiscal cycle. The Air Force 2022 Fiscal Year budget request, which was released on May 28, 2021, as part of the larger proposed budget for the U.S. military as a whole for that fiscal cycle, also identified the blandly-titled Rocket Cargo program as one of the service’s “Vanguard” efforts. The service first unveiled the concept of Vanguard Programs , a way to identify advanced research and development efforts of particularly high interest, last year. Rocket Cargo is the fourth Vanguard, with the others being the Skyborg initiative to develop an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” able to fly various types of future unmanned aircraft, the Golden Horde networked swarming munitions project, and the Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3) effort. The Rocket Cargo program is looking into the capability to send a payload roughly equivalent to the maximum load that a C-17 airlifter, such as the ones seen here, can carry, anywhere in the world within one hour., USAF “The Department of the Air Force seeks to leverage the current multi-billion dollar commercial investment to develop the largest rockets ever, and with full reusability to develop and test the capability to leverage a commercial rocket to deliver AF cargo anywhere on the Earth in less than one hour, with a 100-ton capacity,” the service’s budget documents explain about the main goal of the Rocket Cargo program. “The Air Force is not investing in the commercial rocket development, but rather investing in the Science & Technology needed to interface the capability with DoD logistics needs, and extend the commercial capability to DoD-unique missions.” This is roughly in line with how U.S. military officials have described this concept in the past. In October 2020, U.S. Army General Stephen Lyons, head of  U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), talked about the potential to move “the equivalent of a C-17 payload anywhere on the globe in less than an hour.” The official Air Force fact sheet for the C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft says its maximum payload capacity is approximately 82 tons. At that time, Lyons had announced partnerships with SpaceX and Exploration Architecture Corporation (XArc) to further explore this concept. SpaceX has been a pioneer in the development of reusable rockets for space launch purposes, while XArc is a consulting firm offering primarily space-related design services. Artwork associated with the Rocket Cargo program that the Air Force has previously released, seen at the top of this piece and below, has depicted what appears to at least be a derivative of the SpaceX’s Starship spacecraft, which the company is developing now to carry cargo and passengers for commercial purposes. An Air Force briefing slide that mentions the Rocket Cargo program and shows one potential concept of operation., USAF The Air Force’s latest budget proposal talks about using traditional, as well as non-traditional contracting mechanisms, such as Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), to support the Rocket Cargo effort. The Air Force also appears to have formally started the Rocket Cargo program as its own distinct project outside of any broader advanced research and development initiatives last year. The service received just over $9.7 million in funds for the project, which it also describes as a “major thrust,” in its 2021 Fiscal year budget. The salient details about the Rocket Cargo program from the Air Force’s 2022 Fiscal Year budget request. The three columns to the right are funding for the program in the 2020 Fiscal Year ($0) and 2021 Fiscal Year ($9.731 million), and the requested funding for it in the 2022 Fiscal Year ($47.9 million)., USAF USAF Almost all of that funding was reallocated from a general “Future Transformational Capabilities” account that provides money to “identify game-changing transformational Science and Technology investment opportunities through the WARfighter-TECHnologist (WARTECH) process,” which “brings together technologists and DAF [Department of the Air Force] requirement officials to assess the best intersection of technology readiness and DAF future force design priorities.” In the 2022 Fiscal Year budget request, TRANSCOM, with its strategic airlift mission, is one of two commands the Air Force has identified as being potentially able to make use of the Rocket Cargo capability. The other is Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), where it could allow special operations forces “to perform current Rapid-Response Missions at lower cost, and meet a one-hour response requirement,” according to the budget request. A low-quality copy of a slide from a briefing US Transportation Command chief Army General Stephen Lyons gave in 2020., TRANSCOM The Air Force says that to “utilize modeling, simulation, and analysis to conduct operational analysis of Rocket Cargo concepts, trajectories, and design considerations and verify military utility, performance, and operational cost” is part of its plans for the program in the 2021 Fiscal Year, which ends on September 30. The service also intends to “gather operational data from on-going commercial large-scale, instrumented, reusable launch events.” The service’s plans for the 2022 Fiscal Year are significantly more ambitious and include finishing “initial AFRL [Air Force Research Laboratory] wind tunnel testing to assess novel trajectories needed for air-drop capability, and high-speed separation physics” and completing “industry outreach for loadmaster concepts including novel container designs, load/unload concepts, and testing the compatibility of AF cargo with rocket launch and space environments.” Beyond that, the Air Force actually wants to “test and demonstrate an initial one-way transport capability to an austere site” and “perform an early end-to-end test to fully identify the technical challenges.” From what we’ve seen already, the Air Force has been looking at one concept of operation for Rocket Cargo that involves sending reusable rocket-boosted vehicles, such as SpaceX’s Starship, via space or at least extremely high altitudes within the atmosphere, to forward locations. They would then land at those sites, be unloaded and/or reloaded, and then sent back to their initial departure point. The 2022 budget request mentions an “air-drop capability,” which indicates that the service is also interested in the potential for a vehicle flying in space, or at least close to it, to release payloads over a designated drop zone. In addition to prior public discussions of the Rocket Cargo concept, there has also been talk about the possibility of prepositioning cargo in space for rapid deployment in a crisis or other contingency. The immediate benefits, at least in general principle, of having any combination of these capabilities are obvious. The ability to very quickly deploy forces and other equipment and supplies to respond to rapidly developing situations on the ground could be valuable in a wide array of scenarios, ranging from high-end conflicts to humanitarian missions. At the same time, the potential pitfalls of the concept, which has been explored to varying degrees since the beginning of the Space Race in the 1950s, are equally clear. There are many unresolved questions about the basic operational practicality of employing something like a reusable spacecraft to send cargo, let alone personnel, to forward locations, not to mention trying to then get those vehicles ready for a return trip in any sort of austere environment. On top of that, it’s not clear how survivable this general concept of operation might be given the potential difficulties that could be involved in concealing these kinds of launches and shielding the noisy craft from enemy attacks during the landing procedure. A launch from a forward site would have to involve a rocket booster full of fuel, which could only make it a very attractive target, as well. An artist’s conception from 1963 of Douglas Ithacus T-100 cargo and personnel carrying rockets launching groups of Marines on a mission from the deck of an aircraft carrier., Douglas via Scott Lowther The Air Force does say that “rapid launch capabilities from unusual sites, characterization of potential landing surfaces and approaches to rapidly improve those surfaces, [and] adversary detectability” are among the things that the Rocket Cargo program will explore. How the service might seek to solve any of those problems remains to be seen. Beyond these operational considerations are underlying cost questions, as well. At the time of writing, SpaceX says on its website that a launch involving its reusable Falcon 9 rocket costs around $62 million, while one using its larger Falcon Heavy is approximately $90 million. These prices are, of course, dependent on various factors, including the need to get objects into orbit rather than move them along a suborbital route, and are based on payload weights significantly larger than the Air Force’s stated 100-ton goal for Rocket Cargo. Last year, SpaceX said that the average Falcon 9 launch cost was closer to $28 million . The company’s CEO, Elon Musk, has also said he hopes the cost of future Starship launches will be as low as $2 million. Regardless, none of these figures are lower than the cost to send a C-17 to virtually anywhere in the world. The War Zone has previously estimated that it would cost around $540,000 to get the job done with one of these planes. This is just over a quarter of Elon Musk’s cost goal for Starship launches and exponentially lower than the price of an average Falcon 9 launch, according to SpaceX’s figures. Globemaster IIIs also have a well-established capability to land in very austere locations , refuel, and depart. Speed is, of course, the central difference, with this notional C-17 flight taking around 18 hours. At the same time, unless the underlying operational and other practical issues surrounding the Rocket Cargo concept can be resolved, the benefits of being able to reach any locations in an hour or less may not be something the Air Force can exploit to its full potential. There are certainly possibly niche missions, such as the rapid reinforcement of facilities overseas, a U.S. Embassy under attack , for instance, a scenario where the dramatic landing of a spacecraft-like vehicle might actually be beneficial from a psychological warfare perspective , where this could still be valuable capability. However, it’s not clear if this would justify the cost to develop and field this capability to any significant degree. As already noted, this is hardly the first time that the U.S. military has explored this concept without being able to turn it into a practical capability. One of the most recent efforts, known as Small Unit Space Transport and Insertion (SUSTAIN), which the Pentagon’s National Security Space Office and U.S. Marine Corps worked on in the 2000s, was stated to be “doable” by the end of the next decade. This clearly turned out not to be the case. A briefing slide regarding the Small Unit Space Transport and Insertion (SUSTAIN) program from circa 2009., DoD The hope is definitely now that reusable space launch technologies, such as those pioneered by SpaceX and that are also being developed by other companies , are game-changing enough to help Rocket Cargo succeed where previous programs have failed. The Air Force is certainly eager to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept now and it will be very interesting to see how any such real-world testing in the next year or so goes.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 3, 2020",16 Chinese Airlifters Made A Run Over The South China Sea At Malaysian Airspace,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Malaysian Air Force has reported a “suspicious flight” into international airspace off the coast of eastern Malaysia by no fewer than 16 Chinese military aircraft. The aircraft, which reportedly mainly consisted of People’s Liberation Army Air Force long-range transports, were intercepted by Malaysian Hawk Mk 208 light combat aircraft. While this is not the first such incident, it appears to be by far the biggest in recent years. According to a statement from General Dato’ Sri Ackbal Bin Hj Abdul Samad, the commander of the Royal Malaysian Air Force, or RMAF, the Chinese aircraft were detected as they entered part of the Malaysian exclusive economic zone covered by the Kota Kinabalu Flight Information Region (FIR), one of the two in the country, and as they were approaching Malaysian national airspace. One of the PLAAF Y-20 transports intercepted by the RMAF., RMAF The statement from the RMAF says the service was alerted to the PLAAF aircraft by radar from the service’s Air Defense Center in Sarawak at 11:53 am local time. The Chinese aircraft were reportedly flying in a long trail formation, each separated by around 60 nautical miles. They changed direction once over the Luconia Shoals, a reef complex in the contested South China Sea , and then headed back toward the Chinese mainland. Information provided by the RMAF indicates the PLAAF aircraft were flying at an altitude of between 23,000 and 27,000 feet and a speed of 290 knots as they passed from the Singapore FIR into the Malaysian exclusive economic zone, before approaching to within 60 nautical miles of Sarawak province, on Malaysia’s eastern coast. There is no evidence that they violated Malaysian airspace. The RMAF says it made “several attempts” to call upon the PLAAF aircraft to contact Kota Kinabalu Flight air traffic controllers, but no response came and when they entered the FIR it scrambled Hawk Mk 208s at 13:33 pm local time. The RMAF jets were standing on alert at Labuan Air Base in northeast Malaysia, the closest fighter base to the incident. The Hawks intercepted and performed a visual identification of the aircraft, which comprised Ilyushin Il-76 and Xian Y-20 transports, although some sources claim that other, so far unidentified types, were part of the formation.

Labuan Air Base is also marked with a green circle. , RMAF “This incident is a serious matter against the threat of national sovereignty and aviation safety based on the density of air traffic in the airline route in the Kota Kinabalu Flight FIR,” a statement from the RMAF read. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has taken note of this matter through the Ministry of Defense.” The Chinese embassy in Kuala Lumpur countered by saying the aircraft were conducted routine flight training and “strictly abided by” international law, without violating any other countries’ airspace. PLAAF Y-20 seen from the cockpit of one of the intercepting RMAF Hawks., RMAF “China and Malaysia are friendly neighbours, and China is willing to continue bilateral friendly consultations with Malaysia to jointly maintain regional peace and stability,” Reuters reported a Chinese embassy spokesperson saying. The waters off the east coast of Malaysia are already hotly contested, with China, Malaysia and Vietnam all having claims on the extended continental shelf that contains oil and gas reserves. In the past, this friction have led to maritime standoffs involving vessels from all three nations, among them ships from the China Coast Guard which have reportedly harassed Malaysian oil and gas work. This is carried out by the country’s state-owned Petronas company, within the Malaysian exclusive economic zone but also within areas jointly claimed by the other two countries. In particular, the aforementioned Luconia Shoals have been the focus of tensions and China reportedly has vessels monitoring this area almost permanently . Another area rich in natural resources, the shoals fall within Malaysia’s exclusive economic zone but also claimed by China and Taiwan. The area is routinely patrolled by the Malaysian Coast Guard, RMAF, and Royal Malaysian Navy. Five RMAF Hawk Mk 208s, of the type involved in the interception, led in formation by a two-seater., Xu Zheng/Wikimedia Commons The tensions in the South China Sea region have also involved the United States, leading to encounters between American and Chinese naval forces , including a near-collision between warships from the two countries in 2018. China’s expansive claims over virtually the entire body of water are rejected by every other country in the region, and most of the international community, too. As to the precise purpose of the latest aerial maneuvers by the PLAAF, the mission seems to bear the hallmarks of a readiness exercise by the service’s strategic transport fleet and there seem to be parallels with the kinds of mock assaults that are flown by U.S. Air Force airlifters, too. This branch of the air force has seen significant expansion in recent years as Beijing seeks to reinforce its extra-territorial ambitions after many years of neglect.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Previously, the PLAAF had only a limited ability to transport large military loads rapidly over considerable distances, but its logistical reach in the air has been expanded by first acquiring Il-76s from Russian production and then developing its own strategic airlifter, the Y-20, which you can read more about here . A closer view of one of the Il-76s intercepted off the Malaysian coast., RMAF Late last year, the first firm evidence emerged that the Y-20 was also now flying with indigenous WS-20 turbofan engines , not only offering more power than the previous Russian-made engines but also eliminating dependency on foreign suppliers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 28, 2021",Here Are The Major Airpower Developments In The Pentagon’s Latest Budget Proposal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Months later than usual, the Pentagon has finally released its budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year, which starts just a little over five months from now. The overall request comes in at approximately $715 billion in proposed defense spending, just over $11 billion more than it has received for the current fiscal cycle. When it comes to U.S. military airpower, the new budget proposal contains a number of interesting developments and generally underscores a broad push across the services, but especially by the U.S. Air Force , to cut older aircraft in order to buy new aircraft and otherwise focus on advanced development efforts . Hundreds of aircraft of various types are now on the chopping block and the Air Force, specifically, would see a decline in the combined size of its fleets if the budget, in its current form, is approved. This is also just the first part of plans that could see the divestment of even more planes and helicopters in the next five years as the Air Force, as well as the Navy and Marines , continue to move ahead in modernizing and otherwise consolidating their fleets . What follows is a brief overview of the most important details regarding major U.S. military aviation programs from the Pentagon’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget proposal: The U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps are asking for funds to buy 85 F-35s, in total, which includes examples of all three variants of the Joint Strike Fighter. This is six more F-35s than the three services asked for in the 2021 Fiscal Year budget request, but 11 fewer jets that Congress ultimately provided funding for in the current fiscal cycle. The Air Force, specifically, wants money to procure 48 F-35As, while the Navy is asking for funds to buy 15 F-35Cs for itself, as well as five more C variants and 17 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps. As said would be its plan last year, the Navy is not asking to buy any new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets in this budget proposal, as it shifts its focus to the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. The Navy is also looking to accelerate the retirement of its remaining legacy F/A-18A/B/C/D Hornets , including through the potential replacement of some of those jets now serving in the aggressor role with ex-Air Force F-16s . The Air Force hopes to receive funds to buy another 12 additional F-15EX Eagle II fighter jets . The service has already received funding for eight F-15EXs in the 2020 Fiscal Year budget and a dozen more in the budget for the 2021 Fiscal Year. The Air Force is looking to retire 48 F-15C/D Eagles . It had previously been reported that the service was looking to divest the entire F-15C/D fleet by 2026, with most of these aircraft being replaced by F-15EXs. The Air Force hopes to shed 47 of its oldest F-16C/D Vipers . This is part of a plan to retire 124 so-called “pre-block” Vipers by 2026, with the service working to rationalize the fleet to include only variants built to the Block 40 and subsequent standards . The equates to the retirement of six squadrons worth of F-16C/Ds and, at present, the last four of these units will stand down before F-35As arrive to replace them . As part of its broader aerial combat plans, the Air Force is looking $1.5 billion to support its Next Generation Air Dominance program (NGAD), which is separate from the Navy’s effort. This is an increase of around $623 million compared to the funding the Air received for NGAD, which is seeking to develop various advanced aerial combat technologies and has already produced at least one demonstrator airframe , for the 2021 Fiscal Year. The Air Force wants to cut its 42 A-10 Warthogs . This would shrink the Air Force’s overall A-10 fleet down from 281 to 239 aircraft. On the bomber front, the Air Force is asking for $2.873 billion for continued work on the B-21 Raider stealth bomber , an increase of $30 million over its 2021 Fiscal Year request, which it says is “to prepare for initial production” of these aircraft. The service’s goal, at present, is to buy at least 145 Raiders in the coming years. The Air Force wants $716 million to support its B-52Hs , a significant increase compared to the $483 million it asked for in the 2021 Fiscal Year budget request, and it says this added funding will go toward efforts “ to replace engines , upgrade radar & communication systems.” When it comes to aerial refueling tankers, the Air Force wants to retire another 18 KC-135Rs and 14 KC-10As . The Air Force wants to buy 14 more KC-46A Pegasus tankers, which continue to struggle to perform the aerial refueling mission even on a limited basis . The Air Force is looking to divest 20 Block 30 RQ-4 Global Hawk drones . The service had previously announced its desire to get rid of these older Global Hawks and its intention to replace them with a mix of other platforms, including an unspecified “penetrating” intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft. The Air Force is again looking to stop buying MQ-9 Reaper drones , entirely. The Navy is looking to pause purchase of additional MQ-4C Triton drones, “to allow the Integrated Functional Capability-4 (IFC 4.0) design to mature, which will eliminate concurrency risk and minimize the retrofit cost,” as well as retire its remaining RQ-4A B road Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator (BAMS-D) drones. The Air Force wants to divest four of its 16 E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management aircraft. The Air Force is hoping to buy 14 additional HH-60W Jolly Green II combat search and rescue helicopters. The service has previously acknowledged that these helicopters will need significant upgrades after delivery to adequately perform their core mission set. The Air Force is also seeking to push back the procurement of its first back of MH-139A helicopters by a year over unspecified technical issues that have caused a delay in receiving certain Federal Aviation Administration certifications. The Air Force is looking to procure three more MC-130J Commando II special operations transports. The Air Force’s budget proposal includes a request for funds to buy one E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft to replace one that crashed in Afghanistan last year. Earlier this year, the service had also disclosed it was looking at expanding the overall E-11A fleet size by 2026. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is asking for funds to buy six light attack aircraft as part of its Armed Overwatch program . In May, SOCOM awarded contracts to five companies to demonstrate prototype designs for this program in trials that will start later this year and wrap up in early 2022. As always, it is important to note that this is just a budget proposal and that Congress will have the final say in which of these provisions, if any, get approved in the end. Lawmakers routinely block requests and even insert additional funding for certain aircraft the Pentagon and the various service branches have not asked for. There are already a number of these provisions that will almost certainly face at least some backlash from legislators. For instance, members of Congress blocked a similar proposal from the Air Force in the 2021 Fiscal Year budget request regarding cutting the A-10 fleet and forced that service to walk back its plans to retire KC-135 tankers in the face of serious and still-ongoing issues with the KC-46A that severely limit its capabilities. The Air Force is also notably required, by law, at least a present, to secure a waiver before it can retire any Global Hawks. There has been pushback from legislators to the service’s efforts to stop buying MQ-9 Reaper drones in favor of the development of a successor, known as MQ-Next , too. In addition, there have already been heated debates this year between members of Congress and U.S. military officials over the future of the F-35 program, especially the Air Force’s component thereof . That service still wants to buy more F-35As, but is also now looking at a new clean-sheet fighter design to at least supplement those jets, which is presently referred to as the Multi-Role Fighter , or MR-X. Will all this in mind, it’s not surprising that U.S. military officials have already been defending their various portions of the overall budget proposal in the weeks leading up to its formal release. As we do every year, The War Zone will examine the line-item budget documents in more detail as they are released for additional details about the U.S. military’s future plans with regards to airpower, as well as in other domains. We will be sure to highlight any other major developments and surprises that we find along the way.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When you are in the media business covering a very specific topic set you can’t help feel the false impression at times that you have seen most of what there is to be seen. But once in a while a new bit of information or a photo will really grab you. This was the case on Saturday while scrolling through Twitter. The photo above popped up and it just made me freeze and stare. The TV in the background seemed to go quiet. I felt transported. The image was uniquely heartbreaking, sailors releasing their fellow sailors overboard in white body bags—a mass burial at sea that somehow looked like another day on the job for the almost child-like faces tasked with such a solemn deed, but you knew that was anything but the case. These were battle-hardened men long before their time. After probably a solid 30 seconds of gazing at that frozen moment in time, I read the short post. The image was taken at the height of World War II, during some of the darkest days in the Pacific. Burial detail in the burned-out hangar deck of the USS Intrepid on November 26th, 1944., USN/Archive I found the image in the U.S. National Archives. Its official description reads as such: “Burial at sea for the officers and men of the USS Intrepid (CV-11) who lost their lives when the carrier was hit by Japanese bombs during operations in the Philippines.” By Lt. Barrett Gallagher, November 26, 1944 What had actually happened was the Intrepid was on station with its task force off the Philippines on November 25th when, at high noon, a major Japanese raid on the flotilla resulted in two kamikazes barreling into Intrepid . A massive fire ensured. By the time the fires were put out hours later, 69 sailors had been killed and many more were wounded. The damage was so bad that Intrepid pulled off station and headed to San Francisco for repairs, finally arriving there nearly a month later on December 20th, 1944. This short video is straight from the Intrepid Air And Space Museum and includes remarkable images from that day: The incident became known as Intrepid’s darkest day. While the ferocity of the attack and the heroism that ensued is hard to fathom, the solemn image of what came a day later puts it all into perspective. Young sailors burying their friends and shipmates at sea en-masse. One day they were there—youthful and courageous men, all with dreams, hopes, and unique senses of humor—the next day they were not, their bodies consumed by the sea in strict naval tradition. NHHC On this Memorial Day, I remember those sailors, putting it all on the line in the hell that was the Pacific Theater. They defended their ship and their shipmates with everything they had against an enemy who turned their own pilots and planes into hell-bent guided missiles.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 31, 2020",Stealthy Variant Of China’s Z-20 Black Hawk Clone Emerges In Concept Model Form,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s hard push to master low-observable (stealth) technologies is anything but a secret. With one stealth fighter in service, another in testing , a number of advanced stealthy drones in development, as well as two stealthy long-range strike aircraft , it’s only natural for the People’s Liberation Army to work toward applying advanced low observable design principles, material sciences, and manufacturing processes to rotary-wing aircraft. We may have just gotten our first glimpse of what that may end up looking like, or at least where such an interest lies. The model in question was spotted by @HenriKenhmann who runs the Eastpendulum.com website. Henri notes that the screenshot was from the Chinese Helicopter Research & Development Institute, which is a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). The aircraft shown appears to be a stealthy adaptation of China’s Z-20 medium-lift helicopter , which itself is something of a clone of the H-60 Black Hawk . The Z-20’s story is a unique one in itself, as most don’t realize that China was a purchaser of the Black Hawk in the ’80s, during a period of time when the United States was exporting some military capabilities to China. That ended with the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989. Regardless, the Z-20, like America’s H-60/S-70, is quickly evolving into the preeminent multi-service, multi-role platform for the PLA. Harbin Aircraft Industry Group, which makes the Z-20, is also a subsidiary of AVIC. PLA Z-20s flying in formation., VCG/VCG VIA GETTY IMAGES Using the Z-20 as a basis for a stealthy transport helicopter takes zero imagination as that is exactly what the U.S. military did with its experimental ‘Stealth Hawks’ that were made famous by the Bin Laden raid in 2011. Those specially modified Black Hawks were really the product of research that dated back to the dawn of the H-60 in U.S. Army service, with other low observable variants coming before it, one of which The War Zone discovered and presented in this exclusive story . In addition, it’s worth noting that American stealth helicopter research predated those aircraft on multiple fronts, including decades of research into quieting helicopters and masking their infrared signature, stealth kits for existing military helicopters , and of course the aborted Comanche stealth reconnaissance and attack helicopter program, which resulted in flying prototypes before being canceled. Many other studies by multiple aerospace manufacturers into low observable helicopters occurred over the second half of the 20th Century, as well. A Black Hawk with low observable modifications that likely existed sometime in the 1990s. , Uncredited There have been indications that China has been working on stealthy helicopter designs, especially in terms of attack and scout helicopter types, but the potential development of a stealth transport helicopter is somewhat of a less rumored affair. With all that in mind, one would think China would have a lot of catching up to do in order to produce something like a stealthy Z-20, but that really isn’t the case for two reasons. One is espionage, especially in the cyber domain . China has pilfered an avalanche of American aerospace secrets over the decades from virtually every major manufacturer and from with the Department of Defense. Still, the biggest leg up they have is a result of the very raid in which America’s stealthy Black Hawks were first utilized. When the downed stealthy Black Hawk was demolished via an explosive charge at Bin Laden’s Abbottabad compound , its tail, which was sitting high atop the wall that surrounds the residence, remained intact. We may have never known these helicopters even existed if it was destroyed. Pakistan subsequently carted off the tail, which was of an extremely exotic design, and used it as a geopolitical bargaining chip in the turbulent aftermath of the raid. It is known to have been closely examined by America’s adversaries, namely by Pakistan’s other top weapons provider, China. The tail was eventually returned to the U.S. after roughly three weeks of fiery diplomacy. The ‘Stealth Hawk’s’ exotic tail design, including its shrouded tail rotor hub, multi-blade design, and faceted composite structure, left outside the Bin Laden compound. , Public Domain/Uncredited A tail of a helicopter is not the helicopter itself, but short of the intact fuselage, it is the next best thing. It gives a lot of engineering away in a single package. In the case of the ‘Stealth Hawk’s’ tail, it appeared to have comparatively drastic low-observable treatments, especially considering the helicopters were still using a four-bladed main rotor that is found on the standard H-60. The material sciences, manufacturing methods, the tail rotor’s unique shrouded and multi-blade configuration, gave China a massive amount of highly classified know-how into achieving a stealthy Black Hawk derivative. I have been told by one source that the loss of that tail upped China’s knowledge base on low-observables by at least a decade, especially when it comes to helicopter applications. The coating alone, along with the composite structure design, was a huge compromise in intellectual property. So, now that China has its own indigenous Black Hawk, it can only be expected that they will try to replicate a stealthy variant. Considering how big a role helicopters in general play in the PLA’s extra-territorial ambitions, such a program could very well become a high priority. This is evidenced in some way by the anchors on the model—this is a Naval design. This would be highly beneficial considering the People’s Liberation Army Navy is pumping out large amphibious ships at an amazing rate . Being able to clandestinely—or at least survivably—infiltrate over the horizon in complex littoral environments has a huge number of advantages. This is especially true for special operations and for things like combat search and rescue (CSAR). The proliferation of stealth aircraft makes CSAR a real challenge. How are traditional helicopters supposed to survive in areas where even a stealth fighter could not? Low observability helps reduce some risk in this regard and increases a mission’s chances of success. Above all else, the ability to execute surprise targeted raids deep inside contested airspace is a capability the PLAN certainly would have a high interest in. Any plan to seize Taiwan, in particular, could greatly benefit from this capability and the PLA already sees helicopters as a major component of any such plan. The Chinese stealthy Z-20 model in question has some interesting features, including a trapezoidal airframe that is similar to the earliest U.S. ‘Stealth Hawk’ studies, which you can read all about here . Note the shrouded main rotor hub, and, like America’s actual Stealth Hawks, this design still uses the Z-20’s main hub (five blades instead of four on the H-60/S-70). Also of note is the exhaust appears to be ducted into an enlarged tail boom and exhausted out of a spread-out upper vent system to minimize infrared signature. It is possible that air induction vents on the tail’s bottom’s lower ‘soffit’ are meant to mix the engines’ hot exhaust gasses with cool air. They could even help provide air to the engines themselves. The blades, with their cranked tips, and which appear to droop significantly, could be indicative of a new composite design. Chinese Media via @HenriKenhmann While still sporting a shrouded hub and an inclined angle, the tail appears less intricate than the American ‘Stealth Hawk’ tail. This could be for a number of reasons. First, it could just be representative in nature, not illustrative of the exact design, with the actual tail design too sensitive to display in such a forum. Second, this design could be more concerned with radar signature reduction than acoustic signature reduction. The tail rotor can make as much noise (if not more in some instances) on a helicopter than the main rotor. Going to a six or seven-blade composite design as seen on the U.S. ‘Stealth Hawk’ is thought to be as much about acoustic signature reduction as hiding from radar. Retaining a four-bladed setup would be easier and may still accomplish the low-observable requirements for the Chinese Navy’s needs. One odd part of the design stands out, the main gear look fixed, which wouldn’t help its radar cross-section, especially from the critical lower-front hemisphere. Maybe they do retract in some way or it is a feature they plan on dealing with later, should this design move ahead into a prototype state (assuming it hasn’t already). The stealthy Z-20 is seen in the background of this shot, which includes what appears to be a hybrid-electric manned sensorcraft concept.  , Chinese Media via @RupprechDeino While we are at it, we should mention the exotic aircraft concept sitting next to the stealthy Z-20 model. It appears to be a hybrid gas turbine-electric manned combat aircraft of sorts. The wings are capable of pivoting upward giving it a VTOL capability. At least some of the prop-rotors are designed to fold in on their nacelles for streamlined forward flight. It features a fighter-like radome up front and a large ventral sensor turret. Alternatively, this could represent a notional directed energy weapon (laser). The craft is quite interesting as it could be useful for operations from the PLAN’s LHDs and LPDs to support rotary-wing operations in less than extreme threat environments. It could also operate from tiny landing areas on small islands and at austere bases. Also of note, the U.S. Special Operations community is looking for something similar , albeit in a more multi-mission transport role. Similar design concepts do exist, such as NASA’s Greased Lightning demonstrator, along with many other designs in the emerging eVTOL space, so this type of idea is not exclusive to China, albeit representing it in a militarized configuration may be. Chinese Media via @RupprechDeino When it comes to China’s take on a ‘Stealth Hawk,’ only time will tell if such an idea actually comes to fruition. Considering the pace and wide array of investments Beijing is making into low-observable aerospace capabilities, it seems nearly inevitable.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 10, 2021",Croatia Is Getting French Rafale Multirole Fighters To Replace Its Veteran MiG-21s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Croatia has officially announced that its next fighter jet will be the French-made Dassault Rafale , representing a huge advance in airpower capability for the Balkan country, which is a member of NATO but still operates the Soviet-era MiG-21 Fishbed . Confirmation of plans for a 12-jet Rafale buy should bring to an end a long-running saga to procure new fighter equipment for the country, which saw a previous deal for ex-Israeli F-16C/D Barak jets fall through. A Tweet today from the Croatian government’s official account on that social media site quoted Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic as saying that the French Rafale offer was chosen since it offered the best price and that “Croatia gets the best rated and equipped aircraft — Rafale F3R, in the latest standard.” The tweet added that the deal means Croatia will have “the most advanced fighter aircraft in this part of Europe.” A single-seat Croatian Air Force MiG-21bisD Fishbed fighter jet., Gojanovic123456789/Wikimedia Commons Certainly, the Rafales will provide a huge leap in capabilities for the Croatian Air Force, which will advance from a second-generation fighter armed with short-range air-to-air missiles, to an advanced fourth-generation jet offering active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, precision attack, and many other potential new capabilities. Reuters has reported that the 12 Rafales will be acquired at a cost of $1.22 billion. They will replace the Croatian Air Force’s current fleet of eight single-seat MiG-21bisDs and four two-seat MiG-21UMDs. At last count, according to AirForces Monthly , only four single-seat MiGs were actually available for their primary quick reaction alert air defense mission, due to serviceability issues. Croatia’s MiG-21s underwent a modest upgrade in Ukraine that was supposed to enable them to serve until 2024. However, this was primarily an overhaul and is in no way comparable to the extensive modernizations undertaken on Indian or Romanian MiG-21s, for example. The Rafale won in Croatia against rival offers that comprised new Lockheed Martin F-16 Block 70/72s , new Saab JAS 39 Gripens, second-hand Eurofighter Typhoons from Italy, and second-hand F-16s from Norway, Greece, or Israel. Efforts to find a successor to replace the aging MiG-21s date back well before this, however. The Croatian Ministry of Defense first launched the selection process for new fighters in mid-2015, although this had to be restarted when a new Croatian government was formed in late 2016. A deal for 12 second-hand Israeli F-16C/D Baraks, valued at around $500 million, which also including training support and a simulator, collapsed in 2019 after the U.S. Congress refused to approve the transfer of the jets. Under the Third Party Transfer (TPT) guidelines, U.S. officials requested Israel remove all its indigenous modifications from the aircraft before selling them to Croatia. Since the Baraks were heavily modified with indigenous avionics and weapons this would have been a significant undertaking. The selection process then experienced further delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, there have also been persistent concerns over whether Croatia can afford a highly sophisticated replacement for its MiG-21s. Although Croatia’s gross domestic product is slowly increasing, only 1.83 percent of this was allocated for defense spending in 2020, or just over $1 billion to cover the demands of the entire military — no other NATO nation operating fighter jets has a smaller defense budget. The cockpit of a Croatian MiG-21., Roberta F./Wikimedia Commons Arguably, a light combat aircraft, such as the Korea Aerospace Industries FA-50 , may have been adequate for the country’s fairly limited air defense requirements. Another option would have been to buy a smaller number of high-end fighters and then add more at a later date. While the prime minister has stated that the Rafale offer came in at the best price, it’s hard to see how it could compete with second-hand F-16s, for example. As it is, the Croatian Air Force’s major regional antagonist is Serbia, which only recently withdrew the last of its own MiG-21s from service. The Serbian Air Force now operates 14 MiG-29s , including four aircraft from an original Yugoslavian order that survived the NATO Allied Force campaign in 1999, four second-hand jets donated by Belarus, and six provided second-hand by Russia. The last of these jets were handed over this month and plans call for them all to be upgraded to a standard similar to the MiG-29SM , although they would still be considerably less capable than the Croatian Rafales. While the Rafales being supplied are second-hand and will be taken from French Air Force stocks, they will be upgraded to the advanced F3R standard, a similar approach to that selected by Greece for its recent 18-aircraft Rafale order. F3R provides, among others, RBE2 AESA radar, improved Link 16 datalink to enhance interoperability, an updated Spectra self-defense/electronic warfare suite, and an automatic ground collision avoidance system. Weapons options in the F3R are expanded to include the MBDA Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, the Thales TALIOS targeting pod, and the laser-guided variant of the Sagem Hammer precision air-to-ground weapon. So far, it’s unclear what weapons Croatia will acquire for its fleet. Beyond the immediate regional considerations, Croatia’s choice of the Rafale might open up the possibility of taking on new missions, as well as closer integration with France and other fellow NATO members. In the past, Croatian officials have spoken optimistically about taking part in NATO operations — perhaps including the Baltic Air Policing mission, or similar activities — but it’s not clear how realistic these ambitions would be for a fleet of 12 fighters. As it is, domestic quick reaction alert (QRA) and other operations to protect Croatia’s own airspace will likely remain the core missions of its fighter jets, meaning the Rafale’s full multi-mission capabilities are unlikely to be fully exploited. U.S. Air Force F-16C and F-15C fighter jets fly over the Adriatic Sea alongside an Italian Air Force F-35A and (far right) a pair of Croatian MiG-21s. The formation was put up during Exercise Astral Knight, on May 21, 2021, this multinational exercise bringing together the U.S. military and forces from Albania, Croatia, Greece, Italy, and Slovenia., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Malissa Lott Speaking to The War Zone on condition of anonymity, a former Croatian Air Force MiG-21 pilot explained that he saw the Rafale as “absolute unnecessary overkill” for the country, adding that, even today, only around 30 percent of the MiG’s capabilities are actually being utilized — primarily, QRA scrambles and training for these same missions. Describing the Rafale decision as politically motivated, he said he was concerned that no serious cost/benefit calculation had been provided for the full planned service life of the new jets and he also pointed out that the existing infrastructure at Zagreb-Pleso Air Base will require significant renovation, including modern hangars. A U.S. Navy pilot is strapped into a Croatian MiG-21 ahead of a familiarization flight., U.S. Navy/Journalist 2nd Class David Valdez As regards personnel, the same source was also less than convinced that the Rafale was the right choice for Croatia, pointing to a shortage of pilots, most of who are old and lack full NATO-standard training, including in the basics of modern airspace management. As for the technical staff, there is also a lack of personnel and these have limited experience of modern maintenance procedures. Clearly, the Rafale package will need to include extensive training elements and provision will have to be made to modernize supporting infrastructure. Finally, it should also be remembered that today’s announcement is a political one and that the final contract and conditions still have to be negotiated and agreed upon. Regardless, by choosing Rafale, whether it makes the best sense for the air force or not, Croatia is making a clear statement of intent in terms of defense modernization. Above all, it is good news for France and Dassault, who have added another nation to the growing list of Rafale customers.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 7, 2021",Navy Details Its Plans To Add Ex-Air Force F-16s To Its Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is moving ahead with plans to introduce more F-16 Viper fighter jets to replace ‘legacy’ F/A-18 Hornets used in the adversary role. The War Zone has reported in the past about Navy aspirations to add ex-Air Force Vipers to its ranks, and originally broke the story when it was still little more than a crewroom rumor. Now part of the Pentagon’s formal budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year, which you can read more about here . The request seeks to accelerate the retirement of the Navy’s remaining ‘legacy’ F/A-18A/B/C/D Hornets and the acquisition of replacement aggressor jets for a portion of these jets should help achieve that. Already operated exclusively by Reserve units, the ‘legacy’ Hornets are now to be retired by 2022, two years earlier than planned, with around 55 examples slated to go over the next 12 months. Among these are some of the Navy’s most important adversary airframes that frequently push fleet pilots to their limits. An F-16C from the Air Force’s 64th Aggressor Squadron prepares to refuel over the Nevada Test and Training Range during a Red Flag exercise in February 2021. The Navy has confirmed its plans to acquire more F-16 adversary jets from Air Force stocks., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Dwane R. Young According to the documents released today as part of the budget request, an additional 26 F-16s are being sought by the Navy, with plans to transfer these from the Air Force beginning in 2022. The aircraft will comprise 20 single-seat Block 32 F-16Cs and six two-seat Block 25 F-16Ds. The F-16Cs “will be upgraded to maintain common configuration with the USAF program,” according to the Navy and will be supported by contracted maintainers, with the aim of saving money. Under the latest budget plans , the Air Force plans to divest 47 of its oldest F-16C/Ds, part of a wider plan to retire 124 Vipers by 2026. The aim of that initiative is to provide an Air Force fleet that consists only of Block 40 models and later. Quoted in Seapower Magazine earlier this year , Vice Admiral John Mustin, chief of Navy Reserve, said that the second-hand F-16s would be drawn from Air Force and Air National Guard stocks. The reason the F-16s are required at this point is that there simply aren’t enough Super Hornets available to equip frontline and training units as well as support the high-end adversary mission; the Navy wants to stop buying F/A-18E/Fs entirely in FY22. So far, only VFC-12, the “Fighting Omars,” based at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, is in line to receive Block 1 F/A-18E/Fs for the red air mission. You can read more about their transition to the Super Hornet in this special feature of ours . The Naval Air Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC), which includes Topgun, also operates a handful of F/A-18E/Fs, too. The Vipers will join an overall Navy adversary fleet that already includes 15 F-16s (10 single-seat F-16As and four two-seat F-16Bs) that are operated primarily by Topgun instructors at Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon, Nevada. These comprise part of the high-end Navy adversary fleet, which is currently being bolstered by the F/A-18E/F Super Hornets that are now going to VFC-12. VFC-12 ‘legacy’ Hornets in ‘Flanker look’ during a Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Progam training event., U.S. NAVY Supplementing the high-end assets, the low- to mid-end adversaries comprise 43 F-5 Tiger IIs (40 single-seat F-5Ns and three two-seat F-5Fs), with another 22 F-5s (16 single-seat F-5Es and six F-5Fs) procured from the Swiss government last year are due to be upgraded prior to entering service. That still leaves a requirement to replace the ‘legacy’ Hornets with VFA-204 , the “River Rattlers,” based at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base (NAS JRB) New Orleans, Louisiana. While this squadron might seem like the obvious candidate for the F-16s, sources tell The War Zone that these Vipers will join VFC-13, the “Saints,” at Fallon, since the type is already operated at the Nevada base, and it also offers considerable range space. NAS Fallon is also where critical training is done for carrier air wing workups and fighter tactics instruction, as well as tactics development and more. In the process, VFC-13’s current F-5s will go to VFA-204. Four ‘legacy’ Hornets assigned to VFA-204 over southern Louisiana’s wetlands during a photo exercise in 2009., U.S. Navy The budget request confirms plans to operate the F-16s and F-5s through 2035, as they continue to provide a red air threat for Fleet Replacement Squadron, Carrier Strike Group, Carrier Air Wing, and Unit Deployment Plan training programs. Of course, Navy aggressor F-16s are hardly a entirely new concept. During the mid-1980s, the service acquired 26 examples of the bespoke F-16N version as part of an overhaul of its adversary fleet to better replicate newer threats like the MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker . You can read more about these especially capable Vipers in this previous feature , although their career was short, with retirement following in the mid-1990s. A classic shot of an F-16N dogfighting with an F-14A Tomcat of VF-213 during Topgun training at Naval Air Station Miramar, California, in March 1989., U.S. Navy The Navy again moved for Vipers in 2002-03, when 14 F-16A/Bs were transferred to the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) primarily for use by the Topgun program . These jets had been manufactured for Pakistan before an embargo prevented their delivery. A Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center F-16A lands at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, in April 2015., U.S. NAVY The F-16, in general, is currently in the ascendancy as an aggressor asset in the United States. As well as the Air Force’s 18th Aggressor Squadron (AGRS) at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska and the 64th AGRS at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, the type is now also flying with a private contractor, Top Aces, whose ex-Israeli F-16s you can also read about here and here . Now that the Super Hornet is joining VFC-12, the addition of F-16s to the Navy ‘bandit’ fleet will also ensure that strike fighter pilots are exposed to dissimilar high-end types, too. So, with the Navy set on acquiring a significant number of additional F-16s, and with a fast-paced timeline to get them into service, it shouldn’t be long before we get to see exactly how these aggressor Vipers will be employed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 15, 2021",Navy Confirms It Wants To Ditch Its Very Young Mk VI Patrol Boats In New Budget Request,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has confirmed that it plans to divest all 12 of its Mk VI patrol boats as part of its budget proposal for the 2022 Fiscal Year. The War Zone was first to report that these patrol boats, the oldest of which are only six years old, were slated for early retirement. This announcement comes despite earlier indications that the service might have reversed this controversial decision. The service’s overview of its Fiscal Year 2022 budget request also confirms that it will not directly replace these boats, which it took delivery of between 2012 and 2015. Instead, the plan, at present, is for a mixture of existing Navy and Coast Guard vessels to take over the missions that the Mk VIs had performed, including visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations, support to mine-clearing activities , and general force protection, to include the escort of high-value warships and submarines in and around sensitive areas, such as the Persian Gulf region . A Mk VI patrol boat is hoisted onto the  Watson-class large medium-speed roll-on/roll-off cargo ship USNS Soderman in Guam., USN A pair of Mk VIs sail in the Persian Gulf just off the coast of Manama, Bahrain., USN “The Navy reallocated the associated end strength savings to higher priority Navy programs,” according to a Navy document highlighting various significant portions of its proposed 2022 Fiscal Year budget. “The final deployment for the affected Coastal Riverine companies is scheduled to be complete by approximately the end of 2021.” The Navy expects to free up approximately $74 million by getting rid of the Mk VIs. This is “despite having spent nearly $200 million in recent years to buy the craft and establish training and support efforts,” according to USNI News . The timeline laid out in the 2022 Fiscal Year budget request is slightly delayed compared to what the Navy had originally considered for the divestment of the Mk VIs, which had previously been expected to be completed by the end of September of this year. In April, the service told Naval News that it had halted those specific plans , which had suggested that it might have reversed the decision to retire these boats entirely. However, Navy Lieutenant Rob Reinheimer, a service spokesperson, had also stated “we are not going to speculate on the program’s future.” The decision to acquire the Mk VIs was originally in response to an urgent request in 2007 from U.S. Fifth Fleet, which forms the core of Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), the top Navy command in the Middle East, for additional capacity to support the aforementioned mission sets. The service had originally planned to buy 48 of these patrol boats and was still publicly advocating for increasing the total size as recently as 2019. In the end, however, only a dozen were purchased, which are now spread between Coastal Riverine units forward-deployed in the Persian Gulf, based in the U.S. island territory of Guam in the Pacific, and bases in the continental United States. The Mk VI has a top speed of 45 knots and can cover a distance of up to 750 nautical miles, without refueling, when traveling at a cruise speed of 25 knots. This is significant endurance for these 85-foot-long, 72-ton-displacement patrol boats. These also have relatively impressive capabilities for a craft of their size, including a main armament consisting of two turrets with 25mm automatic cannons, one on the bow and one toward the stern, along with various machine guns. In addition, they have robust communications and sensor suites and were designed with open-architecture mission systems that were intended to make it relatively easy to integrate new and improved capabilities as time went on. Navy personnel have also demonstrated their ability to launch small drones and unmanned underwater vehicles from the Mk VI to support various missions and generally improve situational awareness. A Navy sailor launches an RQ-20 Puma drone from the top of a Mk VI patrol boat., USN Sailors onboard a Mk VI patrol boat work with a small unmanned underwater vehicle., USN Just earlier this year, the Navy highlighted how the Mk VIs have become increasingly costly to operate and maintain , something that is no doubt exacerbated in part due to the small size of the fleet and their limited commonality with other smaller watercraft also in service now. The service has also called into question their utility in supporting future major conflicts, including against potential near-peer adversaries, such as Russia or China. As The War Zone explored in detail when we first reported this story in February, there are significant questions about how well the Navy is served by divesting the Mk VIs. In recent years, the service has repeatedly highlighted its need for additional operational capacity , broadly, to include to support lower-end mission sets in order to free up larger, more capable warships for higher-end operations. One would imagine that assigning the missions that the Mk VIs had performed to other existing platforms would only increase the operational strain on them. In addition, while the Mk VIs might not necessarily be suitable for direct high-end engagements in future major conflicts, this would not preclude their employment in lower-threat areas tangential to where the heaviest fight might be occurring that are nevertheless important to defend. Beyond that, the operational requirements that drove the Navy to buy these patrol boats in the first place continue to exist. A Mk VI patrol boat maneuvers to enter the well deck of the Whidbey Island class dock landing ship USS Comstock during an exercise in 2020. The Navy had previously talked up the potential of using amphibious warfare ships as motherships to support expeditionary Mk VI patrol boat operations, or otherwise help deploy them to forward areas, during future conflicts., USN Earlier in May, a U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat fired warning shots at small boats belonging to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that were maneuvering aggressively in the vicinity of the Ohio class guided-missile submarine USS Georgia as it passed through the strategic Strait of Hormuz , which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. That was the third such altercation between American warships and IRGC watercraft in just over a month and was the second time that U.S. personnel had fired live rounds to warn off the Iranians. In addition to Coast Guard patrol boats, Navy Cyclone class patrol craft were also involved in all three of those incidents, while the Mk VIs, ideally suited to these kinds of operations, were conspicuously absent. The service has also been in the process of decommissioning the Cyclones , which are larger, but older, than the Mk VIs, again without a direct replacement. This raises further questions about its capacity to perform force protection and other lower-tier missions in potential hotspots, such as the Persian Gulf. The Cyclone class patrol craft USS Shamal leaves Mayport, Florida, in February 2021 ahead of its decommissioning., USN All of this comes as the Navy has also faced serious hurdles in employing its two subclasses of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), which presently cost as much as an Arleigh Burke class destroyer to operate and maintain. In the service’s 2022 Fiscal Year budget request, it is again looking to retire the first two examples of both the Freedom and Independence class LCSs, which have long been relegated to training and test and evaluation duties, and that it has determined cannot be made suitable for operational use without major upgrades. At the same time, the Navy remains very committed to the LCS program and expanding their operational use, especially in the Pacific . It is important to note that Congress could intervene to block the Navy’s plans for the Mk VIs. Lawmakers still have to approve the entire proposed U.S. military budget for the 2022 Fiscal Year, which begins on Oct. 1, and then actually appropriate funds to pay for it. Legislators routinely make significant changes to proposals from the Pentagon and the various service branches, including both cuts to and the addition of extra funds for certain projects, before passing any annual budget or other defense spending package. Regardless, the Navy has now formally spelled out that it wants to get rid of all 12 of its Mk VI patrol boats in the next fiscal year.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 21, 2021",Mysterious Black Towed Target Was Built To Support Airborne Laser Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A month ago, we published a photo of a strange , SR-71-looking drone or target-like craft that existed at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico in the early 1980s. The goal was to find out exactly what this mysterious system was and why it existed. We subsequently reported on a trail of information about the development of the system and the fact that it was a high-speed towable target that was developed in the mid-1970s, a version of which held the moniker TDU-X. We also saw some indications that it may have been used, at least in part, to assist in developing and testing of the Airborne Laser Laboratory (ALL) , which was also based out of Kirtland at the time. Now we have the definitive story on exactly what this was and what it was used for at the sprawling New Mexican base. The answer to the final part of this mystery comes to us from Dr. Darren Raspa, a historian at the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Phillips Research Site at Kirtland. Following our series on the mystery craft, and apparently unrelated to our inquiries to the AFRL on the matter, Raspa dug into the archives at the facility to find an answer, here was his email to us after he made his discovery: Mr. Rogoway, et al.— After reading your latest piece on this from 7 May , I was intrigued by the reference to the Airborne Laser Lab [ALL] program, which my archive houses the majority of the document repository. What you see in the photograph is a tow target used in testing the high-power beam of the ALL in flight. These tow targets allowed ALL pilots and crew to refine their aiming, point, and tracking of an aerial target, such as would be required when taking down a strategic missile, which was the ALL’s mission. The pictured tow target is called the HEL-X, and was used briefly in testing the ALL APT system and was deployed from an F-4. HEL-X was abandoned as a tow target because when it was reeled back in, at about 10 feet from the aircraft it would go into wild oscillations. The attached footage I’ve recovered illustrates all of the above and clearly shows the TDU indicated in your mystery photograph. Hopefully this solves the mystery! My best to you, -Darren Dr. Darren A. Raspa Historian Air Force Research Laboratory Phillips Research Site Kirtland AFB, NM The video of an F-4 deploying and retracting the HEL-X that Dr. Raspa sent is excellent. Check it out below: In our previous piece, we thought the towed target in question may have been related to ALL test work at Kirtland, stating: In the 1970s and 1980s, AFWL was also involved in directed energy work, particularly lasers, making good use of its proximity to the Sandia Optical Range, also in New Mexico, which was subsequently renamed the Starfire Range. With this in mind, it’s interesting to note that a written response from the Pentagon to a question from the Senate Appropriations Committee regarding the Fiscal Year 1983 defense budget request mentions that the “first in-flight propagation of destructive laser energy to a tow target” was among the “specific accomplishments to date” for the NKC-135A Airborne Laser Laboratory (ALL) aircraft. The Air Force conducted various tests involving the NKC-135A ALL aircraft, which was fitted with a 10.6-micrometer carbon dioxide laser, between 1975 and 1984. That testing also including shooting down air-to-air missiles , including AIM-9 Sidewinders, and target drones. It’s certainly possible that Kirtland also used later TDU-X variants, or more substantial derivatives of that design, to support its airborne laser work.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 28, 2021",That Mysterious Black Target From Kirtland AFB Was Related To A Program Called TDU-X,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two weeks ago, The War Zone published a brief story on a picture of a curious-looking black object, described as a “tow target,” but with a shape reminiscent of an SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, taken at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1980. Thanks to information readers sent to us, especially from Grigory Omelchenko, we have now been able to identify a contemporary program to develop a high-speed towed aerial target to support the testing of infrared and electronic countermeasures, or IRCM and ECM, respectively. That target, known as TDU-X, is very similar in size and shape to the object seen in the picture from Kirtland. The caption for the 1980 picture of the object at Kirtland, which is available through the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, simply says “Technicians conduct a bench test on a diagnostic tow target.” There is very limited information readily available on the TDU-X, as well. It is worth noting that the U.S. military’s Aeronautical and Support Equipment Type Designation System (ASETDS) uses “TDU” as the general category code for towed targets. An “X” suffix of some kind is often used within the U.S. military to denote still-experimental systems that have not yet received some form for formal nomenclature, such as the Air Force’s T-X trainer , which subsequently became the T-7A Red Hawk , and the Navy’s FFG(X) frigates , now known as the Constellation class . The mystery tow target photographed at Kirtland Air Force Base in 1980., USAF “The TDU-X tow target is a large center of gravity towed vehicle that has the payload capacity to carry IRCM/ECM devices for airborne testing,” according to a 1976 report from Georgia Institute of Technology’s Engineering Experiment Station (EES). “The target has subsystems to support the IRCM/ECM devices. These subsystems are infrared/radar signatures, scoring, command receiver, telemetry and beacons. Those subsystems that radiate or receive a signal have unique antenna pattern requirements.” Between 1975 and 1976, personnel at the EES had conducted tests regarding the “radiation properties of several antenna systems” on the TDU-X, as well as BQM-34 Firebee and BOMARC target drones, the latter of which had been converted from retired surface-to-air missiles . That work was done under contract to what was then known as the Air Force Armament Laboratory (AFATL) at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. AFATL has since evolved into the Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and remains at Eglin. The EES tested emissions from five antenna systems on the TDU-X. These included multiple L and X-band antennas, treated as a single system, along with a G-band beacon, all used to help track the target from air and the ground, according to the report. There was also an antenna used to send telemetry data to nodes on the ground and another one to receive instructions from offboard platforms. Lastly, there was an antenna linked to a Digital Doppler (DIGIDOPS) system used to help score the performance of the countermeasures onboard. A drawing of the TDU-X from the 1976 EES report showing the locations of various antennas., Georgia Institute of Technology A complete description of the functionality of the TDU-X’s antenna’s from the 1976 EES report., Georgia Institute of Technology “Computer techniques were utilized to model the TDU-X tow target and to calculate antenna radiation pattern coverage for the antenna systems,” the report added. “A scale model of the target was fabricated and the computed patterns were verified by actual measurements.” There is a drawing of the TDU-X in the EES report, but it’s unclear if it depicts the scale model used in the testing or the actual system that this subscale test article was meant to represent. The general design, with its elongated fuselage and two short wings with nacelle-like pods on their tips, each of which has two outward-canted fins attached to it, is virtually identical to a subscale wind tunnel model that the Air Force tested in 1971. Those wind tunnel tests were conducted at the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) at what was then Arnold Air Force Station in Tennessee on behalf of AFATL. This model “tow target” was tested in five configurations, with different nose cones and wing-tip fin arrangements, at simulated speeds of between Mach 0.5 and Mach 0.9. What is today known as the Arnold Engineering Development Complex , also abbreviated AEDC, at Arnold Air Force Base, remains one of the Air Force’s premier wind tunnel facilities. A report on those tests does not offer any additional information on the development of these towed targets, when the project first began, and what the requirements might have been for any final design at that time. A wind tunnel model of a tow target design that the Air Force tested in 1971. This planform shows a clear relationship to the TDU-X and the tow target photographed at Kirtland in 1980., USAF A picture of the model actually in a wind tunnel at the Arnold Engineering Development Center in 1971., USAF Different fin configurations on the wind tunnel model., USAF An “inlet” nose configuration, rather than a full nose cone, on the wind tunnel model., USAF The report from AEDC says that the wind tunnel model was 1/6th scale and has a diagram that shows its dimensions. It had an overall length of just over 31 inches, with the solid nose cone fitted, and a wingspan between, not counting the wingtip fins, of just over eight and a half inches. As such, the full-size tow target it was meant to reflect would have been around 15 and a half feet long and have a wingspan of around 4.3 feet. The War Zone had previously estimated that the tow targeted photographed at Kirtland in 1980 was around 12 feet in length, so 15 feet would make sense. The basic dimensions of the tow target model that underwent wind tunnel testing in 1971., USAF It’s not clear how long the TDU-X program lasted or whether it led to the actual adoption of this towed target. At least some actual flight testing did occur. A picture, seen below, of an Air Force F-4D Phantom II fighter jet carrying one of these targets on its centerline pylon, in a 1975 document offers an overview of Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), to which AFATL was assigned at the time. The caption simply says “F-4 Phantom aircraft carries a TDU-X tow target on a test of electronic counter measure devices in a controlled environment,” but does not say where it was taken. The aircraft is seen flying over a beach, which could indicate it was shot over the Florida coast near Eglin. To this day, the Air Force and other U.S. military services make use of expansive ranges over the Gulf of Mexico off Florida for tests and training. A US Air Force F-4D Phantom II fighter jet with a TDU-X tow target on its centerline pylon., USAF It’s also not entirely clear how it was meant to be employed in practice, but if it was at all similar to other towed targets, it would have used some system to reel it out behind an aircraft carrying it in flight. Radars and infrared seekers, as well as infrared cameras, could then be pointed at it from other aircraft, as well as from positions down below, to test the efficacy of any IRCM/ECM payloads it might be carrying. A tow target trails behind and below a US Navy QF-4B Phantom II. The high-tensile wire that connects the target to the aircraft is not clearly visible. This shows a typical way of employing such systems., DOD It’s not clear if the TDU-X was designed to be used destroyed as part of any such testing. The description of the tow target photographed at Kirtland as a “diagnostic” system could indicate that it, as well as the earlier TDU-X, may have been simply intended to gauge the performance of radars, seekers, and other sensors against the payloads it was carrying in non-destructive tests. In addition, in a way, as described, the TDU-X sounds very much like a predecessor to modern towed electronic warfare decoys that are employed on various kinds of combat aircraft used by the Air Force, as well as the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, along with foreign military forces. The TDU-X is also clearly related to the object seen in the 1980 picture from Kirtland, though the latter notably has what appear to be ram-air turbine blades on the fronts of its wing-tip pods. There is no indication from any of the available material on the TDU-X design that it included, or was expected to eventually feature, any similar turbine arrangement. It is worth noting that many towed target systems are attached to aircraft via pods that have ram-air turbines to power the reel system that extends and retracts them. These fans could be linked to power generation systems to run other internal systems, including electronics, without a direct connection to the aircraft, as well. Some podded electronic warfare systems use ram-air turbines for this exact reason. A close-up of what appear to be ram-air turbine blades on one of the wingtip pods on the tow target photographed at Kirtland in 1980., USAF A US Navy QF-4B with a different kind of tow target system on its centerline pylon. Ram-air turbine blades are clearly seen on the portion of the system that remains attached to the aircraft., USN The shape of the fuselage of the black “tow target” at Kirtland is also different in some respects from what we’ve seen of the TDU-X design. At least one side of the forward fuselage is notably flat, with a bulge closer to the wings, rather than the uniformly cylindrical shape of the TDU-X’s fuselage. A close-up of the Kirtland tow target’s fuselage showing the flat portion of one side and a bulge closer to the wings. , USAF Beyond that, the Kirtland tow target has the logo of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL), rather than AFATL. AFWL has since morphed into the Directed Energy Weapons Directorate of AFRL and remains at this base. In the 1970s and 1980s, AFWL was also involved in directed energy work, particularly lasers, making good use of its proximity to the Sandia Optical Range, also in New Mexico, which was subsequently renamed the Starfire Range. With this in mind, it’s interesting to note that a written response from the Pentagon to a question from the Senate Appropriations Committee regarding the Fiscal Year 1983 defense budget request mentions that the “first in-flight propagation of destructive laser energy to a tow target” was among the “specific accomplishments to date” for the NKC-135A Airborne Laser Laboratory (ALL) aircraft. A written response from the Pentagon to a question from Senate Appropriations Committee regarding the Airborne Laser Laboratory program in relation to its Fiscal Year 1983 budget request., US Senate The Air Force conducted various tests involving the NKC-135A ALL aircraft, which was fitted with a 10.6-micrometer carbon dioxide laser, between 1975 and 1984. That testing also including shooting down air-to-air missiles , including AIM-9 Sidewinders, and target drones. It’s certainly possible that Kirtland also used later TDU-X variants, or more substantial derivatives of that design, to support its airborne laser work. The NKC-135A Airborne Laser Laboratory aircraft. The turret, and associated hump, on top of the fuselage, housed components of the carbon dioxide laser system., USAF What might have happened to this black tow target and how many more of them AFWL might have had remain unclear. The example in the 1980 picture has has “7702-4” painted on the side, which could indicate it was the fourth example in a batch of them. It’s also not clear exactly what programs, beyond the possible connection to the ALL testing, they might have supported and how. It is also worth mentioning that two separate people claimed this thing was being developed as a towed decoy for the B-1A bomber before it was canceled. It is possible that an offshoot of this towed target program did have that concept in mind, but we cannot find any evidence that anything came of it. A towed electronic warfare and even infrared-enabled decoy for the B-1A would have been quite useful for ensuring its survivability. The B-1A was envisioned to have one of the most advanced electronic warfare suites ever created. Was a towed decoy part of this program? We don’t know, but we intend to find out., USAF Such a decoy would have to of been capable of being stable at high speed and the small towed decoys we know today were just not possible during the 1970s when the B-1A was being developed. It’s also worth noting that the B-1A’s born-again successor, the B-1B, was one of the first aircraft in the USAF’s stable to received modern towed decoys. So maybe there is something to these claims, we just need to find documentation of it. The War Zone has reached out to AFRL’s History Office to see if any additional information is available. In the meantime, the available information about the TDU-X has already provided interesting insights into other work the Air Force was doing that is clearly related to the mystery object photographed at Kirtland in 1980.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 13, 2021",The Story Behind The Thunderbirds’ Black-Tailed F-4 Phantom And “Captain Carbon”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s Air Demonstration Squadron, better known as the Thunderbirds , has flown a number of different jets over the years, all of which have carried variations on a distinctive and instantly recognizable red, white, and blue paint scheme. It’s a patriotic, high-visibility look that’s very well suited to their already attention-grabbing airshow routines . However, between the late 1950s and early 1970s, when the team flew the F-100C Super Sabre and then the F-4E Phantom II , one of the jets always had a very distinctive variation on this livery, with an all-black tail. There’s a very good reason for why the “slot” jet, the aircraft assigned to fly in the position right behind the lead plane, was colored this way and why the individual at the controls invariably became known as ‘Captain Carbon.’ The Thunderbirds’ black-tailed jet first emerged after the squadron began flying the F-100C in 1956. The team, which was formally established three years earlier, had previously flown the F-84G Thunderjet and then the F-84F Thunderstreak . A Thunderbird F-4E, circa 1971, with the black tail., YouTube capture The Super Sabre, which had entered service in 1954, had given the Air Force its first fighter capable of flying at supersonic speed in level flight. The jet, and its afterburning Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojet , rated at 11,700 pounds of thrust, then brought that capability to the Thunderbirds. Sonic booms continued to be a part of the squadron’s routine, if whoever was hosting the airshow they were attending allowed it. This continued even after the team transitioned from the F-100 to the F-4, until the Federal Aviation Administration banned supersonic flight over the United States entirely in 1973. The F-100Cs also apparently created a different problem for the Thunderbirds, as retired Air Force Colonel Steve Dwelle, who flew with the team between 1971 and 1972, after flying 198 combat missions in the F-100 during the Vietnam War, explained in an interview with the Blue Angel Phantoms YouTube channel , seen in full below, in 2018. “Well it started, to my knowledge, in the F-100-era,” Dwelle said of the black tail. “The slot pilot, when he’s tucked into position, his tail is right up in the exhaust of the lead ship airplane.” What this meant was that the slot aircraft was also right in the path of the lead ship’s exhaust plume, and all the sooty gasses inside it. It’s not hard to imagine how the slot jet might’ve looked after a routine. Many early tubrojet engines, including the J57, were notoriously “dirty.” “Over the course of time, the crew chief had to keep wiping all this soot off the tail and wiping it off, and wiping it off, and wiping it off,” Dwelle continued. “Finally they decided that … they’d just leave it on there and see what happens.” What happened is pretty obvious. “So that’s what happened and it’s just carbon that’s coming out of the engine and sticking to the tail,” Dwelle said. “We affectionately refer to the slot pilot … as ‘Captain Carbon.'” The use of the black tail continued when the Thunderbirds transitioned to the F-4E in 1969. These jets each had a pair of J79 turbojets rated at 17,900 pounds of thrust, at full afterburner, apiece. The introduction of tubofan engines and smokeless combusters, the latter of which were also added to later versions of the J79, among others, eventually led to the disppearance of the black tail. The practice was gone by the time the Thunderbirds began flying the far more anemic T-38 Talon jet trainer in 1974. Each of those jets had a pair of J85 afterburning turbojets . These engines were also just substantially less powerful, but also more economical than any variant of the J79. With their afterburners going, they are rated at around 2,900 pounds of thrust. The slot jet’s tail black did not return when the Thunderbirds began flying F-16 Vipers in 1983, either, which leveraged the far less smokey F100 turbofan. It’s not clear if that pilot in that position still gets the Captain Carbon nickname, either. It’s also interesting to note that the Navy’s flight demonstration team, the Blue Angels , do not ever appear to have had to deal with a black tail on their slot jets, including their F-4s . Today, the black-tailed Thunderbirds, a creation of crew chiefs fed up with having to constantly clean soot off the slot jet, are just another interesting piece of the team’s storied history.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 1, 2021",Here Are The Pentagon’s “Tough Choice” Cuts To Airpower As Part Of Its 2021 Budget,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has released its latest budget request , covering the 2021 Fiscal year, which includes approximately $705 billion in planned spending. This is $13 billion less than the U.S. military asked for last year , but still relatively close in terms of overall expected funding. Still, given this drop in funding, senior U.S. military officials have said that they had to make tough choices to meet various core goals within these constraints. This plateau in budget toplines is also expected to continue in the immediate future, impacting planning over the next five years. This has produced a number of notable cuts, as well as increases, both big and small, in spending amid realignments in priorities. This is particularly apparent in the planning for various military aviation programs, which are traditionally big-ticket items in the annual defense budget. Here is a brief look at the key details about U.S. military aviation programs that are laid out in the Pentagon’s proposed Fiscal Year 2021 Budget: The U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps are requesting funds to buy 115 new fighter jets. In total, all three services are asking for 79 F-35s, which includes examples of all three variants . This is 19 fewer F-35s than the Pentagon received funds to buy in the 2020 Fiscal Year. The Air Force is seeking 12 additional F-15EX fighter jets , which it would add to the eight it received funding for in the 2020 Fiscal Year. The Navy wants funds to buy 24 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets, which would be in the Block III configuration . The Navy plans to halt purchases of Super Hornets after the 2021 Fiscal Year, shifting focus to a future combat aircraft under its Next Generation Air Dominance , or NGAD, program. The Air Force’s unrelated Next Generation Air Dominance program, also abbreviated NGAD, will see its budget increase in the 2021 Fiscal Year from approximately $900 million to $1 billion. This is $46 million less than what the service had said last year that it planned to request for NGAD in the 2021 Fiscal Year budget. The Air Force wants to retire the 17 oldest B-1B Bone bombers in the 2021 Fiscal Year, something that had been previously reported . This would leave the service with 43 combat coded B-1Bs, along with two others set aside for test and evaluation duties. The Air Force intends to retire the 44 oldest A-10 Warthogs in the 2021 Fiscal Year. This would reduce the total number of Warthogs in need of upgraded wings from 109 to 65. The Air Force’s overall A-10 force would drop from nine to seven squadrons, reducing the size of the overall fleet from 283 aircraft to 239. The service had put forward a plan previously to reduce the total number of A-10 squadrons to six, which Congress rejected . The Air Force is looking to retire 16 KC-10As and 13 KC-135R tankers in the 2021 Fiscal Year. The service will buy 15 more troubled KC-46A Pegasus tankers and maintain a Congressionally-mandated fleet of 479 tankers in total. The service has not changed its opinion that the KC-46A is not yet capable of conducting combat operations and won’t be able to do so for years. The Air Force is planning to cut all 21 of its older Block 20 and Block 30 RQ-4B and its three EQ-4B Global Hawks. The service says it wants to focus on new, more survivable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms instead of the RQ-4Bs. The U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane fleet, as well as the newer Block 40 RQ-4Bs, will remain in service. The EQ-4B carries the highly specialized Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) payload. The Air Force wants to buy five E-11A manned BACN-carrying aircraft to make up for the divestment of the EQ-4Bs. The service just loss of one of its four existing E-11As in an accident in Afghanistan in January 2020. The Air Force also says it will scale back the number of MQ-9 Reaper “ orbits ,” each of which consists of multiple drones, from 70 to 60. The Navy does not plan to buy any additional MQ-4C Triton drones in the 2021 or 2022 Fiscal Years, but wants to purchase 13 of them between Fiscal Years 2023 and 2025. Some of those drones will be configured to take on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance roles that manned EP-3E Aeries II aircraft currently perform. MQ-4Cs will also replace the remaining Navy RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Demonstrator (BAMS-D) drones by Fiscal Year 2023. Iran shot down one of the BAMS-D drones in June 2019. The Navy wants to begin buying MQ-25 Stingray tanker drones starting in the 2023 Fiscal Year and buy 12 of them in total through the 2025 Fiscal Year. U.S. Special Operations Command is seeking approximately $100 million in funding to buy its first five “armed overwatch aircraft.” These will be a single-engine turboprop design, such as the Embraer and Sierra Nevada Corporation A-29 Super Tucano or Textron AT-6 Wolverine . Separate contracting documents show that SOCOM has a possible requirement to purchase up to 75 such aircraft. This follows the Air Force officially announcing that its own plans to acquire a similar light attack aircraft are dead . The Air Force is looking to continue with plans to purchase two A-29s and two AT-6s for various test, evaluation, and training activities. It’s important to note that all of this is dependent on approval from Congress. Legislators have often inserted additional funding for specific aircraft, or reject requests for other procurement efforts, based on various factors, during the negotiations that will now occur up on Capitol Hill. It’s also worth pointing out that there is no specific mention of unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) in the budget documents we have seen so far. This is an area where the U.S. military, particularly the Air Force and the Navy, had expended considerable resources on and produced significant results in the past, but which has all but disappeared from public discussion about future U.S. airpower capabilities in recent years. Even less autonomous ‘loyal wingman’ drones were not mentioned in the briefings. The Air Force has also said that documents showing it expected to purchase a single production B-21 Raider stealth bomber in the 2021 Fiscal Year were “in error.” The War Zone will be examining the actual line-item budget documents, which have not been released yet, in detail with regards to airpower developments, as well as other efforts. As such, there are likely to be more surprises in the coming days. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces U.S. Air Force"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 5, 2018",Check Out This Backpack-Mounted Signals Intelligence System Worn By A Marine Special Operator,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recently released picture of Marine Raiders conducting realistic urban training shows an operator wearing a backpack with a large tubular antenna sticking out it. While this system, and the entire picture, looks like it could be ripped straight from a blockbuster action movie or modern military first-person shooter video game, it is a very real tool that is able to detect and geolocate enemy signals. This can provide useful real-time intelligence about enemy forces and their movements, as well as improved general situational awareness. The Raiders in question were training in Nashville, Tennessee , together with regular Marines, earlier this month, as part of what is known as a Raven exercise . Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) uses Raven exercises to prepare Raiders for upcoming deployments. In one picture, seen at the top of this story, the Raider carrying the system in question, which is part of a larger family known as the Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS), is crouching in front of a Western Star truck in a warehouse, while another provides immediate security. In another shot, seen below, what may be the same JTWS-equipped Raider is seen together with other Marines outside what could be the same building. Marine Raiders, as well as conventional Marine infantrymen, take part in a Raven exercise in Nashville, Tennessee in May 2021. A Raider on the right is seen carrying a man-portable Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS), as evidenced by the large tubular antenna protruding from his backpack., USMC These pictures, and others from this same Raven exercise, describe what is happening as a mock “night raid” and that the exercise, as a whole, “simulates real-life tactical scenarios to enhance overall unit interoperability, effectiveness and lethality against an adversarial force.” Integrating the backpack-mounted component of the JTWS family into this exercise would have have given the combined force of Raiders and conventional Marines an important additional source of information during the drill, just as it would in real life. The exact capabilities of this particular system, which appears to be the most recent iteration of the “body-worn” segment of the larger JTWS family, are unclear. Marine Raiders use a Humvee to provide security during the mock night raid conducted as part of the recent Raven exercise in Nashville. What appears to be the antenna associated with a JTWS, possibly just another appearance of the backpack-mounted system, is seen on top of the vehicle., USMC A 2019 briefing from U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) JTWS Program Manager said that this system was capable of providing very-high-frequency/ultra-high-frequency (VHF/UHF) direction-finding capability. Other sources make clear that even the backpack elements of the JTWS family have some level of geolocation and communications intercept capabilities. This means that they can both determine the source of a radiofrequency emission and, if it’s a certain type of unencrypted radio or other communications chatter, listen in on it. A briefing slide describing the general capabilities of various components of the JTWS family, including “body-worn” systems., SOCOM Available information also indicates that location data can be displayed, even for moving targets, overlaid on digital map on a hand-held tablet-like device, along with other relevant information. In the picture at the top of this story, the Raider carrying the system can be seen looking down at this portable user interface. Operators should be able to push this information to other units or larger command centers, as well. An image showing the kind of information that the operator of a backpack-mounted JTWS can view on their hand-held tablet-like device. , SOCOM In the past, SOCOM has described the various versions of these backpack-mounted systems as a “Threat Warning, Force Protection, and Situational Awareness toolbox.” In short, they offer even small units a way to spot hostile or potentially hostile forces before they necessarily see them, as well as providing a clearer picture of the immediate battlespace, in general, based on the locations of different kinds of radiofrequency emissions. In addition, when conducting raids and other direct action missions, as well as long-range “special reconnaissance” operations , it can help pinpoint the positions of targets of interest, as well as collect other potentially actionable signals intelligence (SIGINT) data, in near real-time. It’s possible that the system may be able to spot certain kinds of improvised explosive devices that use remote triggers of some kind, such as cell phones, which regularly ping their networks to ensure they remain connected. A slide from a 2018 briefing that offers other details about the backpack-mounted components of the JTWS family., SOCOM It is worth pointing out that man-portable radio direction-finding equipment and even more robust signals intelligence systems are hardly new. Various types have been employed by conventional U.S. forces , as well as special operations units, too. The particular system employed in this recent Raven exercise also has a general outward look that is very similar to various backpack-mounted electronic warfare jammers , primarily intended to disrupt improvised explosive devices, that have been in widespread service for years now . A US Army soldier from a conventional unit carrying a Wolfhound system, another type of backpack-mounted signals intelligence suite., US Army A US Marine carries a THOR II backpack-mounted electronic warfare jammer designed to counter improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan in 2012., USMC Different iterations of the various components of the JTWS, alone, which also includes larger systems designed for installation on various kinds of manned and unmanned aircraft, boats, and ground vehicles, have been in service for decades now. In the early 2000s, there existed at least some legacy signals intelligence systems already available to SOCOM, including man-portable types, were also officially made part of the larger JTWS family. Other backpack-mounted systems that have been part of SOCOM’s JTWS family over the years., SOCOM “The legacy SOF [special operations forces] SIGINT systems have demonstrated the high value of tactical SIGINT during many recent missions involving SOF,” then-Brigadier General Donald Wurster, an Air Force officer serving at that time as the director of SOCOM’s Center for Intelligence and Information Operations, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee all the way back in 2004 . “The acquisition and fielding of JTWS is key to providing enhanced situational awareness, force protection and time sensitive intelligence for targeting to supported SOF elements.” However, as one writer for Soldier Systems Daily noted while discussing JTWS developments in 2017, “while I used an early version of this system in Haiti over 20 years ago, it has come a long way from the AN/TRQ-30 DF [direction-finding] loops first fielded to 3rd Group [the U.S. Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group ] in 1990. They were the height of 1950s technology and the receiver used like 30 D cell batteries.” A drawing showing one type of tripod-mounted loop antenna used with AN/TRQ-30 man-portable direction-finding system. , US Army Advances in general computing power and the continued miniaturization of electronics mean that signals intelligence suites, as well as related electronic warfare and electronic support measures systems, have been steadily improving in overall capability, while shrinking in size, over the years. This is not to mention more recent developments in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning that look set to revolutionize intelligence gathering and electronic warfare, among other aspects of future conflicts , broadly. Advanced electronic warfare capabilities , many of which are building off of existing signals intelligence systems , in particular, are of growing interest across all of the branches of the U.S. military, including among conventional and special operations units. This comes as adversaries and potential opponents, especially potential near-peer competitors, such as Russia and China , have been making their own significant strides in these fields, which could have serious ramifications for American forces in future combat operations and non-combat activities. This is something The War Zone has explored in depth in the past. With all this in mind, it seems more than likely that man-portable signals intelligence systems just like the ones that Marines Raiders brought to this recent Raven exercise, as well as similar electronic warfare suites that can fit inside a backpack, will become an increasingly common feature in future U.S. military operations, whether they involve special forces, conventional units, or both.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 12, 2021",A Squadron’s Worth Of Paul Allen-Owned Warbirds Is Up For Sale,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The aviation legacy of the late Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and vintage aircraft enthusiast, continues to offer up more potential treasures for those with deep pockets. While the world-record breaking Roc satellite-launcher aircraft and Allen’s personal MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jet have since found new owners , now a small squadron’s worth of warbirds are up for sale, too. The one caveat is that the aircraft up for grabs are all in serious need of work if any of them are to be restored to airworthiness, but that’s by no means impossible for at least some of them. The planes in question are all former restoration projects acquired by Allen as part of his extensive historic aircraft operations, which included the Flying Heritage & Combat Armor Museum at Paine Field in Everett, Washington. F8U-1E (F-8L) Crusader N37TB is among the jets awaiting new ownership., Courtesy Aircraft Sales What set that fabulous collection apart was the painstaking efforts that went into restoring its aircraft, with no effort spared to maximize their authenticity and replicate their original appearance where possible. But not all of its projects were completed, which brings us to the aircraft now available via two different warbird brokers, Platinum Fighter Sales and Courtesy Aircraft Sales . Paul Allen with the Flying Heritage and Combat Armor Museum’s Polikarpov I-16 fighter., Miles Harris/Wikimedia Commons So, say you have some space in your hangar, and time and money enough to plow into a project of this kind, here’s what’s on offer: B-17E Flying Fortress: $9,000,000 Probably the jewel in the crown among the planes for sale is this 1942 example of the legendary World War II heavy bomber . One of only a few surviving Seattle-built examples, the bomber, N12355, is partially dismantled but in very good condition — reportedly a full 80 percent of the structure is fully restored , with just the nose and cockpit needing substantial work. Originally handed over to the U.S. Army Air Forces in May 1942, the bomber soon ended up with Honeywell, who used it to test an autopilot system, the C-1 , which could be combined with the revolutionary Norden bombsight for accurate high-level bombing. Honeywell used the bomber to test a range of other systems as well, including an electronic turbo-supercharger control system and blind landing equipment, during 1,800 hours of wartime test flying. The B-17E rear fuselage., Platinum Fighter Sales In the immediate post-war years, the aircraft passed through the hands of various civilian owners, spending time as an instructional airframe at the University of Minnesota, which acquired it for all of $350. In 1952 the Flying Fortress went onto the U.S. civil register and it then spent a period based in Canada where it was used for aerial survey, a growth industry in the country at that time, including time spent flying out of Thule in Greenland . A set of engines, in pristine condition after restoration., Platinum Fighter Sales In 1964 the aircraft changed owners again, now headed for Bolivia, where it operated as a cargo transport, including carrying refrigerated meat. The B-17 went into storage in Bolivia in 1980 and remained there until bought by World Jet, Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to where it was flown in 1990. Paul Allen bought the aircraft in 1998 and had it flown to Seattle where it resides today. The B-17E while operating from La Paz, Bolivia, registered as CP-753., San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives The vendor claims this has the potential to be the “the finest B-17 restoration in the world,” and, judging by the available photos, that looks entirely possible. It would be a welcome addition to the small number of B-17s that can be seen flying today. Mitsubishi A6M5 Model 52 Reisen: $950,000 Rarer still than a B-17 is this 1943 example of the Imperial Japanese Navy’s iconic World War II fighter, the Mitsubishi Zero. Described as a “time capsule,” this remarkable fighter, construction number 1303, has the potential to be rebuilt to an airworthy condition but is just as valuable in historical terms as it is now, despite decades of wear and tear, together with its original Sakae 21 radial engine. The A6M5 and its Sakae 21 engine, Platinum Fighter Sales The Model 52 version of the Zero was introduced in 1943 in an attempt to address the appearance of advanced new Allied fighters that had by now seriously eroded its combat prowess. Diving speed, for example, was increased through a number of changes including a reduced wingspan. Still visible on the fuselage is the name of the Technical Air Intelligence Center that test-flew the Zero after the war., Platinum Fighter Sales This example was built by Nakajima under subcontract in March 1944 and served in the Mariana Islands, probably doing battle with U.S. Navy aircraft during the carrier air raids on Peleliu. It was finally captured by U.S. forces on Saipan the following July and then brought back to the United States by aircraft carrier for technical evaluation. Both American and British pilots flew the Zero and it was also demonstrated together with a B5N Kate torpedo bomber as part of the ‘Victory Squadron,’ to encourage people to buy war bonds. After a ground looping accident in October 1945, the Zero was abandoned for scrap at Naval Air Station Atlanta, Georgia. Fortunately, it was retrieved for display at the privately owned Atlanta Museum. After many years left out in the open, the fighter was acquired by Paul Allen in 2000. Another example of an A6M5 captured by U.S. forces on Sapian., San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives F9F-2 Panther: $100,000 This asking price looks like a relative bargain for an example of the U.S. Navy’s classic carrier-based single-seat jet fighter of the early 1950s. First accepted by the Navy in May 1951, this Panther, Bureau Number 127147, is also a veteran of the Korean War, sailing to the war zone in September that year aboard the carrier USS Antietam . By October, the fighter was operating as part of Carrier Task Force 77 off Korea’s east coast, assigned to VF-837. The jet flew multiple combat missions, mainly in the interdiction and armed reconnaissance roles, and it took damage from ground fire on two occasions. The Panther was then turned over to the U.S. Marine Corps in Japan before returning to Korea for mainly close air support missions, this time flown from the airbase at Pohang, assigned to VMF-115 and then to VMF-311. The F9F-2, with wings removed., Courtesy Aircraft Sales The F9F-2 fuselage alongside the wings, tailplane, and engine., Courtesy Aircraft Sales After 756 hours of combat the Panther returned to the United States and to a training unit at Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas. The fighter was then transferred to the Argentine Navy, with which it served from around 1959 until 1971. This was the only Argentine Panther to return to the United States, when it was sold to a private owner in Texas in 1995. It’s unclear when the Panther ended up in Paul Allen’s care, but it seems it has received little in the way of restoration work since. F-84G Thunderjet: $100,000 While the Republic Thunderjet may be well known for its U.S. Air Force service and its role as a fighter-bomber in the Korean War, less well known is the fact it also served in communist hands during the Cold War. This F-84G, U.S. serial number 51-11126, originally flew with the Air Force’s 54th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Rapid City Air Force Base, South Dakota, from December 1952, as part of Air Defense Command. Once the unit began replacing its Thunderjets with F-86 Sabres, the aircraft went to Strategic Air Command’s 407th Strategic Fighter Wing at Great Falls Air Force Base in Montana February 1954. Later that year it was handed over to Air Materiel Command at Hill Air Force Base in Utah and was then prepared for transfer to Yugoslavia under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. Over 200 Thunderjets were delivered to Yugoslavia in this way, after that country’s broke off close relations with Stalin’s Soviet Union.

It was one of two bought by a U.S. individual in 1990. It passed through the hands of several other private individuals before ending up at the Flying Heritage & Combat Armor Museum in around 2001. It’s currently stored with wings and tail removed, pending restoration.

Bureau Number 143769 also flew with the Marine Corps, under VMF-334 and VMF-323 at El Toro, California. The F8U-1 in its hangar., Courtesy Aircraft Sales By 1960 its frontline career was put on hold, and it served with VU-7, a utility squadron, providing target towing. After a period in storage, it was reworked in 1966 for service with another Marine squadron, VMF-511, at Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. The wings of the F8U-1., Courtesy Aircraft Sales In 1968 it was loaded to Boeing and continued to be used by the manufacturer for support and test duties including variable camber wing research. After Boeing’s use for it came to an end, the Pacific Northwest Aviation Historical Foundation attempted to acquire it, but this fell through and it eventually ended up with Paul Allen. F8U-1E Crusader: $100,000 The improved F8U-1E added a limited all-weather capability to the Crusader and this example, Bureau Number 145527, was delivered to the Navy in April 1959. Early service was spent with VMF-232 at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, and then VMF-251 and VMF-312 at Atsugi, Japan. The latter squadron took the aircraft to sea aboard various aircraft carriers in the Asia-Pacific region. Two of the Crusaders were formerly owned by Thunderbird Aviation, Inc., which provided contractor services to the military., Courtesy Aircraft Sales In 1962, the Crusader returned with VMF-312 to El Toro, California, and after time with VMF-232 at Kaneohe Bay and VMFAW-122 at El Toro, it took on a training role, most likely with the Marine Corps Air Reserve. By 1967, the Crusader had undergone an overhaul for service with VMFAW-212 at Kaneohe Bay and a year later it was at Iwakuni, Japan, with VMFAW-235. Build your own Crusader., Courtesy Aircraft Sales The Crusader was then operated by a Navy squadron, VF-194 aboard the USS Oriskany before being upgraded to F-8L standard, including new wings that could carry more fuel and ordnance. Thereafter, the jet was used for training before being struck off charge in 1970. Its history then becomes unclear, but by 1987 it was acquired by Thunderbird Aviation, Inc., which provided support for military and commercial aviation research, development, and testing efforts, although it’s not clear if the Crusader was ever flown under this company’s charge. When Thunderbird went bankrupt, the Crusader was sold in 1997, passing on to a new owner in 2001, and then being sold to the Flying Heritage & Combat Armor Museum a year later. F8U-2 Crusader: $100,000 Last of the three Crusaders is this F8U-2, Bureau Number 145592, which was handed over to the Navy in July 1959 and first assigned to VF-103 at Oceana, Virginia. The jet then transferred to VX-3, an air development squadron, at the same base. After a spell with VMF-333 at Beaufort, South Carolina, it was back to VF-103 at Oceana and then a period in Europe, with VF-11 at Rota in Spain. Forward fuselage of the F8U-2, with refueling probe deployed., Courtesy Aircraft Sales The 1960s saw the Crusader make carrier cruises aboard USS Forrestal and USS Independence , with VF-103 and VF-84, respectively and, in 1963, in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the jet was at Key West, Florida, on behalf of Southern Air Defense Command. Next was a period with VU-4, a fleet utility squadron, training pilots at Oceana and Cecil Field, and with VU-10 at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 2, 2021",KC-46A’s Long-Troubled Vision System Can’t Even Reliably Show The End Of The Refueling Boom,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report says that boom operators aboard the U.S. Air Force’s troubled KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tankers are using shadows cast on the receiver aircraft to guide the boom into the receptacle. That means that, on a cloudy day, boom operators sometimes have to rely simply on past experience in the role to achieve a successful ‘hookup’ with a thirsty aircraft. These details emerged after Air Force Magazine ’s Pentagon editor, Brian Everstine, joined a refueling flight out of Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport, Michigan, on May 25. The base was being used for training as part of Air Mobility Command’s flagship Mobility Guardian 2021 exercise, which featured a single KC-46A. This was the first time a member of an independent media outlet had ever flown onboard an Air Force Pegasus tanker. A U.S. Air Force KC-46A taxis prior to takeoff during Exercise Mobility Guardian 2021 at Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport, Oscoda, Michigan, on May 18, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Lawrence Sena In the past, The War Zone has looked in detail at the problems relating to the KC-46A’s Remote Vision System (RVS), which the boom operators use to connect the boom with receiving aircraft. It’s a critical system on the Pegasus and fundamental to its ability to operate as a tanker for receptacle-equipped aircraft from the U.S. military and its allies. It’s also a new kind of technology for Air Force refueling aircraft. The service’s previous tankers have all had position for the boom operator to physically lie in at in the rear fuselage, from where could watch the boom directly with their own eyes and guide it into the receiving aircraft. The KC-46, in contrast, has the boom operator seated in the aircraft’s main cabin where they perform their task via the RVS. Since this is a hybrid 2D/3D system, the operators wear special glasses that are, at least in principle, supposed to provide enhanced depth perception while viewing through a flatscreen. Everstine got the chance to see the RVS in action, as the KC-46, deployed from McConnell Air Force Base , Kansas, refueled F-16 fighter jets from the Ohio National Guard. What he described about the system is worth repeating in full: “The camera feed does not accurately show the end of the boom — there’s about another foot and a half beyond what is visible on the screen, so boom operators use the shadows to gauge where the tip is before connecting to the receptacle. If there’s no shadow, on a cloudy day, for example, the operator has to rely on experience, rather than technology, to make the connection.” Basically, the deficiencies with the RVS sound a lot worse than had been previously reported. Earlier reports stressed that the RVS problems were centered around the issue of depth perception, something that Everstine also noted on his flight: “Even with the 3D goggles, depth perception is difficult. Moving the refueling boom around the F-16’s canopy to then line up with the receptacle, flying at 290 knots, is a delicate process. While wearing the goggles, the center of the screen is sharp, but when you look to the edge of the screen, it gets blurry and disorienting.” A demonstration of the KC-46A Remote Vision System demonstration at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Colby L. Hardin Previous accounts had pointed to the problems caused by shadows, glare, and other environmental factors making it hard for the boom operator to have a good sense of what’s going on. In 2019, for example, Bloomberg stated that “shadows or the glare of the sun can hamper the view in rare instances, possibly resulting in scraping the other plane or difficulties in performing a refueling, according to the Air Force.” In the same year, an Air Force official explained to Defense News that “There is a slight difference between the motion viewed in the RVS versus what is actually occurring in the physical world.” That now seems as if it might have been a serious understatement. At one point in the Mobiliy Guardian maneuvers, for instance, the weather during the sortie prevented a C-5 Galaxy strategic transport aircraft from taking on fuel, when “direct-sunlight washout” meant the RVS screen was no longer useable. In the Pentagon’s own analysis on the KC-46’s progress, as part of the Director Operational Test and Evaluation Annual (DOT&E) reports, the issue has only ever been described in vague terms, as a “lack of visual acuity.” However, this latest report from Air Force Magazine strongly suggests that the RVS has a fundamental problem to begin with and that the shadows, in particular, have been used by boom operators as a workaround. Furthermore, it seems to be apparent that the effects of shadows can be both a solution and a problem, depending on the context. Amid all the other difficulties that have faced the KC-46, the RVS has surely been the most enduring one. It’s for this reason that work is now underway on an ‘RVS 2.0’ that will provide all-new equipment, including a laser ranger to measure the distance between tanker and receiver, color rather than black and white screens, plus augmented reality for the boom operator. All in all, the RVS 2.0 advances are expected to fix the current problems of depth perception and the problem of visually tracking the boom itself. Everstine confirmed that the RVS 2.0 is now undergoing its preliminary design review, and that Air Mobility Command is “cautiously optimistic” about the outcome. Under a 2020 agreement with Boeing, the manufacturer is covering all the costs of developing and installing the RVS 2.0, but it won’t actually begin to be fitted to new-build aircraft until 2023, while retrofitting of previously delivered aircraft will begin a year after that. As well as the new RVS, the fixes provide a modified boom to address the aforementioned stiffness problem. During the same Air Mobility Command exercise, A-10 attack jets couldn’t be refueled at all. The KC-46 is still awaiting clearance to provide this platform with fuel, due to a separate and long-running “stiff boom” problem, which runs the risk of damaging the receiving aircraft . A KC-46A refuels an A-10 during a test flight in 2016. The Pegasus has not yet been cleared to refuel this aircraft., Boeing/John D. Parker Just today, it emerged that the ongoing effort to redesign the boom , costing $100 million, could likely have been avoided had the Air Force taken note of problems that had emerged much earlier in the program. Alarmingly, a technology readiness assessment (TRA) — which assesses the maturity of critical hardware and software technologies — also revealed that Boeing engineers used no new or novel technology in the design of the boom because the design was “based on that of the well-proven KC-10 [refueling boom] and the control laws [were] based on the Italian KC-767A and Japanese KC-767J control laws.” “We reviewed the preliminary design review documentation and found that it showed a refueling boom design that differed significantly from the proposed design that the independent review team documented in the TRA report,” the Pentagon’s Inspector General states in a recent report into the KC-46 program. Meanwhile, with RVS 2.0 still some way off, Boeing has developed an interim ‘RVS 1.5’ to enhance image quality on the boom operator’s screens, but the aircraft used in Mobility Guardian 2021 had the original system installed. Meanwhile, the 1.5 version doesn’t do anything to address blinds spots or other factors. As we have pointed out before, even having aircraft on the ramp fully modified with the definitive RVS 2.0 doesn’t mean that they will immediately be declared fully operational and ready for combat missions. After all, the relevant personnel will have to be trained to use it. Until that happens, however, the KC-46’s utility will inevitably continue to be limited.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 4, 2022",Graffiti Artists Defaced Soviet-Era Buran Space Shuttle At Russian Space Center,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the latest undignified episode in the unhappy recent history of the Soviet Union’s Buran space shuttle orbiter , one of the surviving examples was spray-painted by graffiti artists who managed to get into the building where it’s stored in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, home of the Russian space program . The episode has created embarrassment for the Russian state space corporation, Roscosmos, and comes less than a decade after the first Buran orbiter was totally destroyed in a roof collapse, also at Baikonur, which killed eight workers. The recent graffiti incident saw several street artists infiltrate the assembly and refueling hall at Baikonur and spray various Cyrillic slogans across both sides of the rear fuselage of the orbiter. The intruders wrote the words “Good,” “Yura, we have arrived” (a reference to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin), and “Before flying to the stars, a person needs to learn how to live on Earth.” They also added their signature tags, apparently revealing that a total of four individuals were involved. Graffiti on the left side of the fuselage of the Buran orbiter., via Instagram An unnamed source within Roscosmos confirmed what had happened to state-run media outlet RIA Novosti , after one of the culprits had apparently taken to Instagram to explain how they had got into the facility, posting an account together with a photo and video and an accompanying statement: “I can say that, like Yura, I became the first.” Part of the post from the Instagram account that reveals details of the street artists’ Baikonur mission., via Instagram The images on Instagram were taken before the graffiti was applied to the orbiter but there was still plenty of detail about the planning that went into the street artists’ apparent trip to Kazakhstan, including a claimed two-day walk across the steppe. “At any moment, you can be caught by a patrol car with the police, of which there are a lot,” the account explains. “We walked at night, we were noticed more than once by searchlights, coming very close to them — if a searchlight notices you, it starts blinking and shining on you. Lie down and lie still and hope for good luck. After the spotlight locates you, a patrol car drives out and looks for you in the area where you were detected.” Another view of the graffitied orbiter, apparently revealing the tags of the four street artists involved., via Instagram Of course, it’s conceivable that whoever was responsible for posting about their Baikonur escapade was not part of the same group that painted the Buran orbiter, but that would seem more than a little unlikely. Furthermore, the story was posted by an Instagram user named burda.dobro, who uses the tag ‘Dobro’ (meaning good in Russian). This same slogan appeared on the side of the orbiter as well as in other locations, including St. Petersburg, as seen below. via Instagram In the meantime, other Instagram accounts have sought to identity and ‘name and shame’ all four alleged culprits. Suffice to say, Roscosmos reacted to the incident and the head of the corporation, Dmitry Rogozin, said that the assembly and fueling building in which orbiter has been stored will now be better protected. In particular, personnel from the Okhrana Scientific and Technical Center, responsible for the safety of much of Russia’s rocket and space industry, have reportedly now been put on guard. In a tweet today, the space agency also said that it would put forward a proposal to more properly preserve the orbiter and other “unique objects” at the cosmodrome during the next meeting of the Intergovernmental Kazakh-Russian Commission on Baikonur. Last year, Rogozin had also said that Roscosmos wanted to transfer the orbiter to a museum. The same tweet also noted that this was latest incursion into this particular building, reflecting the fact that the facility has been a previous target of intrepid urban explorers , photographers, and others simply interested in seeing a fascinating piece of Soviet space history in a truly unique setting. A view of a surviving Buran orbiter at Baikonur., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP While the story of the Baikonur graffiti was first reported today, it’s still not exactly clear when the break-in took place, since a post on RIA Novosti ’s Telegram channel quoted a space industry source as saying it occurred in April and that the graffiti has since been “painted over.” With that in mind, it’s hard to know exactly what the orbiter looks like today. Also unclear is whether this particular Buran is the second of the functional oribiters to be built, or a full-scale engineering model, since both are known to be at Baikonur. The second orbiter, nicknamed Ptichka (meaning little bird), was more formally known as Article 1.02 and was almost completed when work on it was stopped in 1988. The only Buran to actually complete an orbital mission was the first, Article 1.01, which made an uncrewed space flight, including two orbits of the Earth, in November 1988. This was the example later destroyed in the Baikonur roof collapse in 2002. The first Buran orbiter, Article 1.01, transported on the back of an An-225 transport., Ralf Manteufel/Wikimedia Commons With the demise of the Soviet Union, the entire Buran program was suspended and finally officially terminated in 1993. Planned as the Soviet equivalent to the NASA Space Shuttle, with which it shared a distinct visual similarity, the Buran orbiter featured several key differences, including not having any of its own rocket engines for liftoff, instead relying solely on the Energia launcher and its strap-on boosters. It was also capable of fully remotely controlled orbital flights, from launch to touchdown. With the first orbiter having been destroyed, and with a third, less-complete, orbiter stored in the open air at the museum in Zhukovsky near Moscow, Article 1.02 is probably the most historically significant of the Buran orbiters still in existence. In addition, there are various other full-size Buran test articles in Russia and elsewhere . Hopefully, however, the long-neglected Baikonur Burans can now be properly looked after, and this latest incident will encourage the relevant authorities to ensure that they take their rightful place in a museum, or at the very least, safe from further incidents of this kind.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 10, 2021",Plan To Buy 145 B-21 Raider Bombers Gets Endorsement From Biden Air Force Nominee,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Frank Kendall, President Joe Biden’s nominee to become the next Secretary of the Air Force, says he supports the service’s current position that it needs to acquire at least 145 stealthy B-21 Raiders in the coming years. These aircraft, work on which is steadily progressing , are set to supplant its existing B-2 Spirit stealth bomber fleet, which comprises just 21 jets, in total, not all of which are available for combat operations, as well as its aging B-1Bs . Kendall, who has worked in the halls of the U.S. government in the past, including for a time as Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, made his remarks about the B-21 fleet during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 25, 2021. Then-Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein had first publicly mentioned plans for a B-21 fleet with 145 aircraft during a separate congressional hearing in 2020. Frank Kendall at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 25, 2021., AP/J. Scott Applewhite “I think that…is a reasonable number, at this point,” Kendall told the gathered Senators in regards to the 145 B-21 figure. “We’re a long way from achieving that, and requirements may change over time…[but] as a basis to manage the program I think that’s reasonable right now.” Before General Goldfein’s comments last year, the Air Force had only publicly said that it was looking to acquire at least 100 B-21s. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), which oversees the service’s bomber fleets, has also more recently said it expects the entire bomber force to grow to 220 aircraft, 75 of which would be existing B-52Hs . There have been calls for the Air Force to buy even more bombers, overall, including from Congress , as well. It remains unclear if the plan is for all of the B-21s to be nuclear-capable. As already noted the Air Force has just 21 B-2s, which can carry nuclear weapons. It also has 76 B-52Hs, but dozens of them have been converted to a conventional-only configuration. Lastly, the service expects to retain 45 B-1Bs , which can also only carry conventional ordnance, through 2036. The current plan is to replace both the B-1s and the B-2s with new B-21s. Regardless, it’s hard to overstate how significant it would be for the Air Force to see a nearly seven-fold increase in its total number of penetrating stealth bombers. In October 2020, a total of 12 B-2s took part in the annual Global Thunder exercise , which is U.S. Strategic Command’s premier nuclear command and control drill. Those dozen aircraft represented nearly 60 percent of the entire B-2 force. https://youtube.com/watch?v=A7Zjer9_Tvs That is also the same number of Spirits that the U.S. government said were actually available for combat operations of any kind as of December 2020. At that time, eight additional combat-coded bombers were defined as “not deployed” under the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia. A number of these aircraft are going through a major upgrade program or are otherwise undergoing heavy depot maintenance. The last B-2 is set aside for non-combat test and evaluation duties. The B-2s remain the Air Force’s most capable aircraft for penetrating through dense enemy air defense networks to prosecute strikes, including those in service with near-peer opponents, such as China or Russia. The B-21 will build on those capabilities, and offer capacity, especially as a counter to China, which is also actively developing its own stealth strategic bomber . “That [countering China] is the reason, perhaps, that I’m interested in coming back into government,” Kendall also said during his confirmation hearing, adding that, if confirmed, he hopes to be able to “address that problem.” How long it might take the Air Force to receive 145 B-21s, if that remains the service’s plan in the long-term, as well as how much all that might cost, is unclear. The production schedule, as well as many other budgetary and functional details about the Raider program, are classified. Per the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in 2016, the Air Force had estimated it would cost $80 billion to buy the first 100 B-21s, equivalent to just over $89 billion in 2021 dollars. Last year, CBO estimated that the total purchase cost of one B-21 and 10 Long Range Stand-Off (LRSO) cruise missiles to go inside to be around $500 million , with the Air Force having to spend another $40 million each year to operate and maintain that complete package. A table showing CBO cost estimates for the B-21 and other US strategic weapon systems., CBO At present, there are at least two B-21 prototypes known to be in various stages of production at Northrop Grumman’s facilities at the Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. The Air Force hopes that the first of them will be completed by early 2022, with the aircraft taking its first flight in May of that year. Back in 2019, the service had said that the first flight could come by the end of this year. That same year, Frank Kendall had raised questions about the ability of the B-21 program to stay on schedule and budget, in no small part due simply to the complexity of the design. In April, Representative Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat who currently chairs the House Armed Services Committee, said that, based on a briefing he had received, the B-21 program was firmly on schedule . That briefing was “one of the most positive, encouraging things that I’ve had happen to me in the last couple of weeks,” the lawmaker, who has been particularly critical of the F-35 program and its costs in recent months, said . “[It’s] on time, on budget, and they’re making it work in an intelligent way.” Earlier this month, General Timothy Ray, head of AFGSC, also visited Plant 42 to get an update on the B-21 program. He “saw the significant progress made on the build of the first flight test aircraft,” according to an official Air Force news item . General Timothy Ray, head of AFGSC, at right, points to a B-2 test program morale patch he received during a visit to Edwards Air Force Base in May 2021. Ray also made a visit to Plant 42 at around the same time to get briefed on the latest developments in the B-21 program., USAF “We are pleased with the progress being made in the build of these test articles,” Air Force Colonel Jason Voorheis, the B-21 System Program Director and Acquisition Program Lead, also said in a statement around Ray’s visit. “The Air Force and Northrop Grumman are working closely together to make smart choices on this program to support warfighter requirements and timelines.” After the first B-21 completes its first flight, it is set to travel to Edwards Air Force Base in California to undergo more extensive testing. The Air Force has already established the B-21 Combined Test Force , which includes the 420th Flight Test Squadron and the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center’s (AFOTEC) Detachment Five, at that base. There has also been significant work to expand facilities at Edwards ahead of the arrival of the first B-21. Just this month, satellite imagery showed a new, large shade structure had been erected on an engine run-up pad right across from a secure ramp that the initial Raiders are likely to call home. Two satellite images, one from Jan. 17, 2021, at top, and one from May 24, 2021, at bottom, showing the same area at Edwards Air Force Base that is expected to host the first B-21s. The red arrow in the May 24 shot points to a new large structure that has appeared at an adjacent engine run-up pad., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The first operational B-21s are set to enter service in the mid-2020s, with the initial Raider squadron standing up at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, where the bulk of the Air Force’s B-2s are presently based, and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, which hosts B-1Bs, are in line to be the next two bases to receive Raiders. The total number of bases hosting B-21s would likely expand if the B-21 fleet does eventually grow to 145 aircraft. As Kendall noted in his confirmation hearing, “requirements may change” as time goes on, too. There continue to be concerns about possible defense budget cuts, or at least plateauing defense spending , on the horizon, which could have broad impacts on future planning across the services, as well. It is also worth pointing out that, at present, the Air Force’s bomber plans could face hurdles imposed by current and future arms control agreements. New START, for instance, puts hard limits on various nuclear weapon systems, including nuclear-capable bombers. President Joe Biden’s Administration and its counterparts in the Kremlin agreed at nearly the last minute to extend the duration of that treaty earlier this year, but it will sunset in 2026 and it’s unclear what agreement or agreements, if any, will directly replace it. Converting some bombers to a conventional-only configuration could be one way of getting around any such arms control quotas. However, the Russian government has routinely complained about similar conversions to Air Force B-52s, which the U.S. government says makes them exempt from New START. The Kremlin’s position is that the conversion process is too limited to ensure that these bombers cannot quickly regain their nuclear capability. So, while the B-21 program is currently on schedule, it still remains to be seen whether or not the Air Force’s ambitious plans for a future Raider force with 145 aircraft will ultimately become a reality.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 13, 2021",Early F-35As May Get Axed Even Though Overall Readiness Has Improved Significantly,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Figures recently released by the U.S. Air Force show that the readiness rate for the F-35A stealth fighter has made a major improvement in the last 12 months, while the stats for other fighter types within the service have remained essentially the same year over year. The development is good news for the Joint Strike Fighter program, which has rarely been far from controversy , but it could also provide ammunition for those arguing in favor of retiring the earliest least-capable F-35As, which are used mainly for training . Overall, during 2020, and despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, mission capable rates (MCR) for the Air Force’s fighters improved but the F-35A led the way. MCR is the percentage used to determine how many aircraft are ready for one or more of their assigned tasks at any given time and it serves as a valuable metric to assess maintenance efficiency as well as overall preparedness of the force at large. A maintainer checks out the first F-35A to arrive at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, back in 2011. Early-production jets like this are now facing posible withdrawal on cost grounds., U.S. Air Force/Chrissy Cuttita For the Air Force’s conventional takeoff and landing Joint Strike Fighter variant, the F-35A, the MCR increased from 61.6 percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 to 76.07 percent in FY20, according to figures obtained from the service by Air Force Magazine . While the corresponding figures for the F-15D and F-15E saw slight reductions in MCR, the readiness for the other fighter types in the force improved, albeit not by more than two percent in any instance. Some of the main reasons for the F-35A’s readiness leap were outlined by Lieutenant General Eric Fick, director of the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), to the House Armed Service Committee last month. These include a major increase in budget to buy more spare parts and the induction of additional depots to keep the jets in working order. Perhaps most important, however, is the fact that, as production continues to ramp up, the Air Force is receiving more capable F-35As with more of the type’s teething troubles ironed out. “Many of our earlier-lot aircraft require modifications, and we are working through retrofits with fleet customers to optimize the timing of these modifications to minimize operational impacts,” Fick said, according to Air Force Magazine . With the JPO eager to get investment to upgrade the earlier F-35As, so they can keep technological pace with newer deliveries, the Air Force is left with a conundrum of whether it even makes sense to invest in these increasingly obsolescent aircraft or to focus on the more MCR-friendly later production blocks, and future iterations that promise to be even more capable . It’s not the first time that the Air Force has looked at ditching some of its oldest F-35As. Back in 2017 we reported about how the service, along with the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy, was considering halting upgrade work on possibly dozens of Joint Strike Fighters. At this point it was already becoming clear that the falling unit price of the jet was threatening to make it cheaper to buy new than to update existing aircraft with loads of rework issues and older configuration hurdles, some of which will likely never come close to meeting their claimed useful life anyway. F-35s take shape at the Lockheed Martin production facility in Fort Worth, Texas., Lockheed Martin Now the ax threatens to fall on older-model F-35As that are used for training and which are not considered viable for real-world operations. Instead of investing in expensive upgrades, the Air Force should instead focus on the forthcoming Block 4 jets, Lieutenant General S. Clinton Hinote, the Air Force’s deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, has recently argued. The Block 4 F-35As are set to feature enhanced radar and electronic warfare capabilities , as well as the ability to carry new weapons . “It’s not in our plans right now, but that would be something that we would have to take into consideration,” Hinote told Military.com , noting that there were “some indications” the Air Force was already overinvested in F-35As that were suitable only for training. With the rapid growth in synthetic training aids and with the highly capable T-7A Red Hawk advanced jet trainer on the horizon, it could be an opportune time to divest these earlier F-35As, which would boost the fleet’s readiness number even higher. Clearly, there is a balance to be struck between meeting the requirements for operational assignments and training and building the size of the fleet. The F-35A fleet recently became the second largest in the Air Force’s fighter inventory, ahead of the F-15 and A-10 , but still behind the F-16 , an aircraft it was designed to replace. F-16Cs from Madison, Wisconsin, fly alongside an F-35A. , U.S. Air Force/Scott Wolff Fick said that changes that have already been made to the F-35A enterprise would continue to boost MCR in the future, buoyed by improvements to “maintenance systems and best practices.” There are still threats stalking the program, however, as Fick acknowledged when speaking at this month’s McAleese and Associates defense conference. He pointed to the cost of sustaining the F-35A and said that addressing this was a JPO priority. Overall, the operating cost of the stealth fighter is still far in excess of its targets, which were once hoped to put it broadly on par with the F-16. Just how big a factor these costs are is reflected in the fact that the price of buying an F-35A has been steadily reduced in the last decade, while the budget needed to sustain the jets has continued to grow. Major Daniel Daehler, an F-35 instructor pilot, walks off the flightline at Royal Air Force Fairford, England, after flying from Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, for the first U.S. Air Force F-35 trans-Atlantic flight, in 2016., U.S. Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Jarad Denton Fick also suggested other ideas to reduce sustainment costs, including continuing to grow up depot support, producing longer-lasting parts, and reducing the numbers of industry contractors required to support the aircraft on behalf of the Air Force. A new Performance-Based Logistics concept could also be another way of making gains on the cost front. The Air Force has already sought to address the spiraling cost of F-35A sustainment in other ways, incuding proposing a reduction in purchases of the jet by around 10 percent in the next Future Years Defense Plan. The result would trim planned acquisition from 240 to 220 jets over the five-year period. This would again point to service officials deciding against plowing more funds into early production jets and instead waiting on the Block 4 version that will offer considerably more capability. Once again, there’s also the potential for a reduction in F-35A purchases to further enhance MCR for the type, since it would relieve the burden on the supply of spare parts and on the depots. An F-35A emerges from a repair hangar after depot and unit-level modifications were completed at Hill Air Force Base, Utah., U.S. Air Force/Alex R. Lloyd This is just a proposal, however, and is not yet set in stone. In particular, the Air Force is still preparing its ongoing TacAir study , part of a wider assessment of the optimum balance for the service’s future tactical fighter force, which is also addressing whether an all-new fighter jet design might be a better option to replace its F-16s. So, while the MCR for the F-35A may be a positive for the program, it doesn’t fix the problem of how to fit the fifth-generation fighter into budget plans. Put another way, availability is on the up, but that’s of little help if the service can’t afford the sustainability model in the long term. It’s that kind of thinking that has prompted Air Force leaders to look for alternatives to the F-35A, while the recent proposal to retire the F-22 in the 2030s indicates that the service is willing to take a firm stance even with its most-capable assets that were previously deemed untouchable. Of course, the F-35 already has something the F-22 does not—scale. There are 283 F-35As flying with the USAF today, roughly 100 more than the F-22s. F-22s from the 94th Fighter Squadron, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, and F-35As from the 58th Fighter Squadron, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida., U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Shane A. Cuomo We also need to bear in mind that, while FY20 brought a boost for F-35A MCR, we don’t know where the figure lies as of now. In particular, an engine shortage that was first reported earlier this year is likely to have had an effect. As of last April 21, for example , 21 Air Force F-35As were grounded without serviceable engines, although 15 of them were otherwise classed as flyable. President Biden’s pick for Secretary of the Air Force, Frank Kendall has been critical of the Joint Strike Fighter in the past, recently told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the jet “the best tactical aircraft of its type in the world.” It’s hard to say what stance he may take once in his expected new position, but other lawmakers have been more forthright. Speaking in March , House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith said he was ready to “cut our losses” on the F-35 and stop throwing money into a “rathole.” Ultimately, in terms of ‘iron on the ramp,’ the primary question for the Air Force is how best to replace the F-16 around the 2030s. The service’s message is that the answer could still be the F-35A, but only if the sustainment costs can finally be brought under control.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I was doing some research on a Bell 222 whose operator has painted the helicopter in the classic Airwolf two-tone scheme when I came across what is among the most lavish homes in America—one that came replete with a full-size replica of Stringfellow Hawke’s beloved “Lady.” The absolutely mind-boggling mansion in question, which is called “Billionaire” and was built by LA developer Bruce Makowsky, is perched high over Los Angeles in one of the most exclusive areas of Beverly Hills. It originally had an asking price of a whopping $250M when it was listed in 2017 . For the ultimate Airwolf fan, you can look at it like buying the helicopter and the house is free! No really, even for this part of the Los Angeles area, this place is absolutely bonkers. Louis Vuitton bowling alley? Check. James Bond-themed movie theater? It’s got that. It even has its own ultralounge garage. Yes, you read that right, basically a gallery-like garage that takes up an entire floor and acts as your own personal vegas-like hostpot—one packed with $30M worth of exotic vehicles. The entire place is a big send-up to vehicles and industrial design. Listen, at the time of it being put-up for sale, this was the most expensive house listed in America, OK. So yeah, we are talking batshit money here. What’s so intriguing is that, from what we understand, it is very tough to get a private helipad in Los Angeles. So, this was basically an art installation, and to massive Airwolf fans like me, and maybe even you, the Lady is absolutely fine art, both in pop-culture and basic engineering aesthetic terms. The core Bell 222/230/430-series design remains one of the most attractive flying machines ever created. But really liking Airwolf and having a decommissioned Bell 222 with extremely accurate Airwolf modifications trucked and craned onto the roof of a home you plan of selling for a quarter of a billion dollars is a whole other level of commitment to the franchise. Yeah, not exactly a feature for everyone. Quite the monumental risk actually, to the point where I can only solute the original owner. Upon closer examination, the helicopter/art installation in question appeared very familiar, especially its fake rotors. One really high-quality Airwolf recreation did exist in a helicopter museum out east. So, I dug a little more, and here is what I found out. Yes, the replica on the roof of the mansion is indeed this aircraft. Here is how it ended up there, according to the Tennessee Museum of Aviation, which displayed it for a period of time: A new, full-size replica of the Airwolf helicopter was created by Steven W. Stull, for display in the Helicopter Headquarters museum located in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, using a non-flying Bell 222 with molds taken directly from the originals used in the show.  After the Helicopter Headquarters closed, the replica was put on loaned [sic], for display at the Tennessee Museum of Aviation located in Sevierville, Tennessee, between 2007–2015. The owner of the Airwolf replica sold the Bell 222 to a private collector in California. The replica is now on top of a $250 million mansion in Bel Air, California. The replica Lady seen at the Tennessee Museum of Aviation in 2011., HrAtsuo/wikicommons After it was sold on eBay , the new owner had it shipped via truck to famed car customizer West Coast Customs in Los Angeles. “ Yo dawg ,” the West Coast Customs tie in is pretty interesting. Obviously having a replica like this inside a museum is one thing, having it be able to weather the elements outside atop a cliff is another. Also, the long-grounded Bell 222 had some hangar rash that needed to be cleaned up. View this post on Instagram A post shared by West Coast Customs (@westcoastcustoms) The interior is clearly for fun. , WCC Facebook Page So, that all makes sense now, but here’s the catch—the aircraft was removed by the mansion’s new owner during the summer of 2019. Also of note, the fake grass helipad it was sitting on is no longer marked with an “H” either. This isn’t surprising, really. Having a non-functioning helicopter sitting atop your house really isn’t something most super wealthy people are looking for, Airwolf or not. By May of 2019, the Airwolf replica was gone from the mansion’s roof., Google Earth That leads us to what is now a burning question, where did this high-quality recreation end up? It turns out that the aircraft was hoisted off the mansion and sent to Celebrity Helicopters at Compton Airport. From what we can tell, she still sits outside the hangar of Celebrity Helicopters/ Tomorrow’s Aeronautical Museum there as part of a display that includes other famous or iconic helicopters types: Google Earth Celebrity Helicopter Facebook So, there you have it. The mansion that had its own Airwolf may no longer be a thing, but the replica still exists. And as with so many of these things, the story of how the aircraft ended up there and what happened to it is more interesting than anything else. At least in this case, it aviation heirloom still survives, so no reason to play a sorrowful strain on the cello on the lakeside dock of your mountain hideway while shedding a singular tear at sunset.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, has confirmed that an Iron Dome battery accidentally shot down an Israeli Skylark drone during a recent conflict with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. The downing of the Elbit Skylark unmanned aircraft has reportedly caused great concern among Israeli officials, who are worried about what it might mean for future operations where significant numbers of friendly and hostile drones , and potentially manned aircraft, are likely to be zipping around above the battlefield in relatively close proximity. Israeli media outlet Haaretz was first to report on the accidental shootdown, which the IDF subsequently acknowledged. It’s not clear when the incident occurred and how many drones, overall, Iron Dome defense systems may have destroyed in the recent fighting in and around Gaza. The IDF had announced on May 17 that Iron Dome had claimed its first drone kill in combat . Palestinian militant group Hamas also said it had launched a number of unmanned aircraft at Israel during the conflict, including examples of a new “suicide drone” called Shehab, which you can read more about here . An IDF soldier prepares to launch a Skylark I drone. An Iron Dome defense system shot down a Skylark drone during the recent fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip., IDF “As part of the round of fighting in Gaza and as part of the defense of the country’s skies, an IDF Skylark drone was hit by Iron Dome,” was all an IDF spokesperson would tell Haaretz , with similar statements subsequently given to other outlets . “The incident is under investigation.” This recent conflict began on May 10, 2021, though it was precipitated by a number of earlier crises, as you can read about in The War Zone ‘s past reporting . Israeli officials and Hamas, the principal Palestinian group in Gaza, agreed to a ceasefire, brokered by Egypt , on May 21. The fighting was defined primarily by Palestinian militants in Gaza firing huge barrages of rockets into Israel, with the IDF responding with massive air and artillery strikes on the enclave. An estimated 4,300 rockets were launched toward Israel and there were some 1,500 IDF airstrikes in the nearly two weeks of fighting, according to The Times of Israel . Approximately 243 Palestinians died, including both militants and civilians, some of the latter being children, over the course of the fighting. In Israel, there were 13 fatalities, 12 of which were civilians, also including children. Iron Dome, which is primarily designed around what is known as the Counter-Rockets, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) mission, was also a major player in the conflict, intercepting hundreds of incoming rockets. This defense system and its Tamir interceptors can also be employed against small drones, as well as low-flying manned aircraft, and has also demonstrated the ability to engage cruise missiles . The Iron Dome was tested in a range of complex scenarios and successfully intercepted and destroyed targets simulating existing and emerging threats, including the simultaneous interception of multiple UAVs as well as a salvo of rockets and missiles. 2/2 — Ministry of Defense (@Israel_MOD) March 16, 2021 It’s not clear which specific Skylark model was shot down, but the IDF is known to operate the Skylark I , which is designed to be launched by hand via a slingshot-like system and operated by a small team of dismounted personnel. “Weighing only seven kilograms [~15 pounds], the drones are small, efficient and practically unnoticeable in the air. Equipped with a live video feed, they can fly for up to three hours, at night and in all weather conditions without being detected,” according to one official IDF news story . The Skylark’s manufacturer, Elbit, also makes the Skylark 2 and 3 drones , which are significantly larger designs and it’s not clear if the IDF operates either of these types. Whatever the case, “the IDF is investigating the incident and is worried about it because the entirety of the IDF’s combat plans prepared in recent years are based on multi-dimensional fighting with close coordination between land, air and sea forces,” according to Haaretz . “The shooting down of a drone raises doubts whether the IDF is sufficiently prepared and possesses the necessary capabilities to conduct a long period of fighting without harming its own forces.” “During the Israel-Gaza conflict, representatives from a foreign aviation authority allowed Israel to leave its airspace open to civilian aviation after Israeli officials made the case that the Iron Dome has the capability to distinguish between hostile and non-threatening aircraft,” Haaretz ‘s report added. As already noted, exactly what led to the Iron Dome battery inadvertently shooting down the Skylark is unclear. It is known that much of the functioning of a complete Iron Dome system, which includes a number of launch units each loaded with up to 20 interceptors, along with associated radars and a battle management and control unit, is heavily automated. On at least one occasion in the past, a huge group of Tamir interceptors were fired after the system misinterpreted machine gun fire as rocket launches. The concern the IDF clearly has here also has to do with discrimination, but the bigger issue would seem to be whether Iron Dome can readily discern between small friendly drones and hostile ones. Israel’s security services have been pioneering users of unmanned aircraft, including loitering munitions , but drone technology is rapidly proliferating, including among non-state actors. Even lower-end designs, including commercially available types , which can be adapted to carry warheads or otherwise employ improvised munitions , present very real threats now. #Hamas Military Wing Al-Qassam have released footage of their drones used in the recent attacks on #Gaza border area pic.twitter.com/Sr6uH3N8gW — Aurora Intel (@AuroraIntel) May 13, 2021 Skylark is a prime example of how deeply unmanned aircraft are integrated into the IDF’s current concepts of operation. These drones, which, as noted, have a very low acoustic signature, are operated by teams assigned to a specific unit of the Artillery Corps known as the Sky Riders. They deploy to provide immediate and actionable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support during various kinds of operations, including hostage rescue missions or raids to kill or capture specific terrorists. They have also helped scout for signs of tunnels where militants can hide or store munitions in the past. “The need for [visual intelligence] has changed,” the then-deputy commander of the Sky Riders, identified only as Major Nimrod, told The Times of Israel in 2018. “There are more tunnels now, more enemies hiding among a civilian population.” The targeting of tunnel networks in Gaza, colloquially referred to as the “Metro,” was a major component of the IDF’s response to the rocket and drone launches from Gaza during the recent fighting. There were even reports that Israeli officials deliberately misled news outlets into thinking a ground incursion had started at one point in order to try to drive militants into those tunnels and then engage them. At the same time, drones will also be a feature in any higher-end conflicts that Israel is likely to find fighting in the future. Amid the fighting in Gaza, the IDF also shot down what was described as an Iranian “armed drone” near Israel’s border with Jordan. “Iran sent an armed drone to Israel from Iraq or Syria,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a press conference on May 20, speaking alongside visiting German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. “Iranian forces launched the armed drone, which our forces intercepted on the border between Israel and Jordan.” It remains unclear who Netanyahu was referring to specifically when he said “Iranian forces” and whether he may have been referring, in part, to Iranian-backed proxies that operate across the Middle East. In the past, Israel has accused members of the Quds Force , the arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responsible for conducting operations outside of that country, of directly leading attacks on Israel, including from Syria , in instances where proxies were also involved. It’s also important to note that there have long been issues surrounding discrimination and so-called non-cooperative target recognition (NCTR) when it comes to air and missile defense, generally. It is very unlikely that Skylark and other drones of similar size, and even some larger designs, carry commercial transponders , let alone the kinds of highly specialized identification friend or foe (IFF) gear found on more traditional military aircraft that is intended to help prevent this kind of fratricide. Without these systems to help rapidly identify aircraft, air defenders have even tragically mistaken commercial airliners for threats on more than one occasion . Friendly-fire incidents have occurred in spite of the presence of IFF systems , too. Of course, the increasing use of smaller drones that may not even be physically able to accommodate IFF systems will certainly add a new dimension to these issues. It may simply turn out that such losses become an accepted part of future operations, at least to some degree, helped by the fact that there is no risk in these situations to a human pilot. All told, it’s hardly surprising that Iron Dome’s accidental shootdown of the Skylark would give IDF officials pause, even if a solution or solutions to the underlying issues may be readily apparent. The recent fighting in Gaza put immense strain on Iron Dome batteries, highlighting the challenges that continuous mass saturation attacks pose to the system, in general, something The War Zone recently explored in depth . That reality already presents significant incentives for Israel’s opponents to simply expand their rocket and drone arsenals with hopes of overwhelming these defenses. One would imagine that the IDF might be worried that news of this friendly fire incident could also inform how militants and terrorists seek to employ their own drones in the future to try to confuse Israeli air and missile defense personnel. It is already well established that swarms of fully autonomous networked drones, and even mass drone attacks with a lower degree of coordination , inherently have the ability to overwhelm defenders and otherwise make it hard for them to respond in the most efficient manner. Various other countries are no doubt keeping a close eye on this new news about Iron Dome’s performance during the recent fighting in and around Gaza in order to inform both future drone and counter-drone efforts . It will be interesting to see what new details may now begin to emerge about this incident and what it might mean for Iron Dome, as well as broader efforts to counter the growing threat of hostile drones in what is likely to be increasingly congested airspace over future battlefields.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 22, 2021",Russian Tu-22M3 Backfire Bombers Based In Syria Are Going To Patrol The Mediterranean,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has officially confirmed that Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers are now at Khmeimim airbase in Syria, as we reported yesterday . The Russian Ministry of Defense has also now stated that they will operate in a maritime role over the Mediterranean Sea, reflecting Russia’s expanding reach in the region and suggesting a return to the kinds of missions that Soviet bombers flew in the Cold War, when they kept track of NATO warships operating in the area. We now know that three Tu-22M3s touched down at Khmeimim yesterday, making use of the extended second runway at the base, which has been resurfaced and outfitted with new lighting and communications equipment. The base, as The War Zone predicted earlier this year , is now better able to support operations by all three of Russia’s bombers — the others being the Tu-95MS and Tu-160 — as well as heavy transport and maritime patrol aircraft. Crew disembark from a Tu-22M3 bomber after landing at Khmeimim Air Base., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP “Crews of the long-range bombers will acquire practical skills in practicing training tasks in new geographic areas during flights in the airspace over the Mediterranean Sea,” a statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense declared, although there were no details about the duration of the deployment or whether the Tu-22M3 will become a more regular visitor to the Syrian base. “After completing training tasks for the development of airspace in the maritime zone of the Mediterranean Sea, the long-range bombers will return to permanent airfields on the territory of the Russian Federation,” the statement adds. According to independent defense analyst Guy Plopsky, the individual bombers have been drawn from Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS, bases at Shaykovka , in western Russia, and Belaya, in the Russian Far East. Clearly, positioning even a handful of long-range bombers at Khmeimim provides Russia with a significant force-projection capability around the Mediterranean and not just in Syria, where these bombers have been used in combat in the past . Based on the unrefueled range of a typical, armed Tu-22M3, targets within the Black Sea are also within reach, as is Libya, where Russia is also involved in an ongoing civil war , and the basing provides added reach across northeastern Africa and the Middle East, as well.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION As well as being embroiled in the Libyan crisis, Russia has also been looking to expand its activities, and physical presence, elsewhere in Africa, especially. That has included plans to establish a Russian naval logistics and support base in Sudan in the east of the continent. More recently this effort was reportedly suspended , although Moscow has disputed this . Notably, the three bombers at Khmeimim are not capable of inflight refueling , which would be of tremendous utility when operating in this theater. However, the refueling probe, deleted from the Backfire under the START I (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) regulations, is reportedly now being reinstated in the wide-ranging Tu-22M3M upgrade. A graphic showing the typical unrefueled range of a Tu-22M3, armed with a single anti-ship missile, operating from Khmeimim. The mission profile includes portions of the mission at high altitude, plus some supersonic flight., GOOGLE EARTH / www.scottmurray.me Even so, the confirmation of a primary maritime tasking is also significant, as it provides Russia with additional offensive capabilities against NATO surface vessels in the region, as well as ports, airbases , and other coastal infrastructure. A tweet showing a purported flight track of a Tu-22M3, said to be conducting its first training mission from Khmeimim, on May 25: During the Cold War, approximately half of the Backfire fleet was assigned to Soviet Naval Aviation, but since 2011 all surviving aircraft have been operated by the Russian Air Force, today known as the VKS. The switch to maritime training in the Mediterranean suggests that the VKS is now working to reinstate at least something of this Cold War-era capability. In many ways, the Tu-22M3 is better suited to anti-shipping strike and other offensive maritime missions than aerial bombing sorties over land. As we have discussed before , its weapons options against ground targets are limited to unguided ordnance, albeit some aircraft being upgraded with the SVP-24-22 navigation/attack system that improves accuracy when using ‘dumb’ bombs. In its maritime role, the primary weapon of the Tu-22M3 was traditionally the Kh-22 standoff missile, known in the West as the AS-4 Kitchen. This is a huge, delta-winged weapon now carried exclusively by the Backfire. The first of these missiles were completed as long ago as 1962. The 38-foot Kh-22 is powered by a liquid-fuel rocket that propels it to a speed of over Mach 4 for the terminal run-in to the target. A Kh-22 missile preserved on a former Ukrainian Air Force Tu-22M3. , Pavel Adzhigildaev/Wikimedia Commons The Kh-22 is available with an active radar seeker for attacking warships. There is also a version that combines radar with Doppler navigation that is used to attack stationary targets on land, such as airfields or harbors. The missiles carries either a nuclear warhead or an optional high-explosive charge, the conventional version being limited to the anti-ship version. Each weapon weighs around 12,000 pounds and the Tu-22M3 normally carries one or two, although three can theoretically be fitted. Maximum range after launch from high altitude is over 300 miles, reduced to around 200 miles when launched from lower altitude. The successor to the Kh-22, again only available to the Tu-22M3, is the Kh-32, which appears outwardly similar to the earlier missile. This weapon has improvements to the motor, control system, and a different flight profile, providing a range of over 500 miles. Some reports suggest this missile is available only as an anti-ship weapon. Work to introduce the Kh-32 to the Tu-22M3 has been ongoing for some time now, with the bombers gradually being equipped to utilize the new weapons. The anti-ship mission could well take on an additional resonance if the bombers are still stationed at Khmeimim when the Royal Navy’s Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) maritime task force arrives in the Mediterranean as planned. The centerpiece of this is the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , making its first operational deployment. The carrier sailed from its homeport on May 22 and its embarked F-35B stealth fighters are slated to conduct combat operations over the Middle East. The presence of supersonic-capable Russian bombers, armed with powerful anti-ship missiles, could alter limited aspects of that deployment. The latest Backfire mission continues Moscow’s pattern of stationing long-range bombers at airfields outside Russia, with previous deployments to Venezuela and South Africa , albeit both on a short-term basis. The move is a significant development for Russia geopolitically, as well as underscoring why Moscow has spent so much effort propping up the Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. However the Tu-22M3s are ultimately used from their Syrian staging post, the deployment provides evidence that Russia is keen to once again wield long-range airpower in the Mediterranean region and potentially provide another means of holding NATO targets in Europe at risk.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The emergence of photos and videos of Russian Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers apparently taken in Syriaâ€™s coastal Latakia province suggests that the aircraft are now operating, for the first time, from Moscowâ€™s Khmeimim airbase outpost in that country. Earlier this year, The War Zone examined runway extension work at the base which would help accommodate the big swing-wing bombers, and you can read more about that here .Â The latest imagery, posted to Twitter as well as the Russian Telegram social media network, purportedly dates from today and shows a pair of Tu-22M3s â€” which are only operated by the Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS. While the bombers are only seen in the air, and not on the ground at the base itself, the fact that at least some of the images show the landing gear extended points to the aircraft almost certainly operating from Khmeimim. A VKS Tu-22M3 returns to its base at Shaykovka in December 2017 after a deployment in support of the Syrian campaign., Russian Ministry of Defense While the recent work at the base, including extension of one of the runways by around 1,000 feet, bringing it to a length of approximately 10,500 feet, would help support longer-term deployments of these large and frequently heavily laden aircraft, it remains possible that the Backfires are only making a fleeting visit to Syria.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION / GOOGLE EARTH That the Tu-22M3 has a role to play in Syriaâ€™s ongoing civil war is clear enough, since the bombers have been utilized in the conflict in the past. Their use in the conflict has been not insignificant, as part of Moscowâ€™s efforts to prevent the collapse of the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. i can confirmğŸ‘ I shot a video of one of them ğŸ˜ğŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/MHWsx1UjqD — Bero (@BerOo359) May 24, 2021 Between November 2015 and August 2018, Tu-22M3s completed 369 combat sorties over Syria, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. For these, the bombers initially operated from Mozdok Air Base in North Ossetia, North Caucasus, the most southerly Russian airfield able to accommodate them. For a period in August 2016, Tu-22M3s also flew bombing raids over Syria from Hamedan Air Base in Iran , but this arrangement quickly broke down and Iran withdrew permission for Russian access to the airfield. Tu-22M3 bombers at Hamadan Air Base in Iran in 2016., AP While the Tu-22M3 is capable of carrying heavyweight guided air-to-surface missiles, during the Syrian campaign it has only employed freefall bombs, as far as is known. In fact, even advanced multirole fighters deployed to Syria by Russia have made use of mainly unguided ordnance in the conflict, with a predictable effect on overall accuracy. Compared to other combat aircraft at Khmeimim, however, the key advantage of the Tu-22M3 it its much larger payload â€” typically around 13,000 pounds of weapons, although a maximum of over 52,000 pounds can be lifted at the expense of a useful fuel load. So far, Backfires engaged in Syrian combat missions have been noted dropping salvoes of 12 550-pounds bombs, and on rare occasions single 6,600-pound bomb, the heaviest in the inventory . During the hotter summer months, however, the payload is typically reduced to just 10 550-pound bombs or six 1,100-pound bombs. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jMlo_zfmrMQ Operating the bombers from Khmeimim would likely allow bomb loads to be increased, as well as allowing for a greater amount of time on station, since transit times would be considerably reduced. If required, the sortie rate could also be stepped up, but that would also be dependent on the number of aircraft deployed there and on maintenance cycles. The deployment of Tu-22M3s to Syria would also provide a good opportunity to undertake trials of the upgraded Tu-22M3M version, providing this is the model that has been sent there. The Tu-22M3M is a mid-life upgrade for the Cold War-era bomber and was first test-flown in December 2018. It incorporates various items of new equipment, including a more advanced radar, a digital flight control system, enhanced navigation and communication suites, plus a revised armament control system. The latter permits the use of new weaponry including the newer Kh-32 standoff missile. Other changes include a glass cockpit, updated self-defense suite and other new avionics. The original inflight refueling probe, deleted to conform with START I (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) regulations, is also reinstated in the nose. It would not be the first time that Russia has taken the opportunity to test new combat aircraft in the Syrian theatre, having previously done the same with the Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter, for example. Having bombers in Syria is not without its risks, however. Khmeimim has, in the past, had to content with drone attacks and other indirect fire weapons operated by anti-Assad forces. Between December 31, 2017 and the end of the first week of January 2018, the base was subjected to at least two mass drone attacks , that killed multiple personnel and damaged or destroyed a number of aircraft. Should the bomber deployment prove successful, however, it might prompt Russia to send more, or other types of similar aircraft. The same base could also accommodate the Tu-95MS and Tu-160 , both of which offer the ability to carry a range of subsonic land-attack cruise missiles that are absent from the Tu-22M3.Â Tu-22M3s drop freefall bombs over Syria on a previous deployment., Russian Ministry of Defense Beyond the use of these aircraft in the Syrian conflict, an established bomber outpost at Khmeimim would also provide Russia with the ability to project strategic airpower across the Mediterranean region, potentially much more important. It would be a means of challenging NATO on its southern flank, holding targets in Europe at risk from an entirely new southern vector, as well as providing better access into the Middle East and North Africa, for example in Libya, where Moscow also has military interests . It would also be in keeping with Russian efforts to expand the operating locations of its bombers more generally, including deployments to Venezuela , South Africa , and to an expanding network of airfields in the Arctic . In the past, Russian media, including the defense ministryâ€™s own channels, have disclosed the appearance of most new equipment once it has been deployed to Syria. With that in mind, we may expect to see official confirmation of the Tu-22M3 at Khmeimim, although only time will tell if this is to be a longer-term deployment, or a brief cameo appearance. Update, May 25: As we expected, the Russian Ministry of Defense has now confirmed the arrival of the Tu-22M3s at Khmeimim, announcing that three examples have been deployed, but with no further details about the duration of the mission. According to a statement from the ministry, â€œCrews of the long-range bombers will acquire practical skills in practicing training tasks in new geographic areas during flights in the airspace over the Mediterranean Sea.â€ The statement also mentions the reconstruction work on the second runway at the airbase, which includes resurfacing and new lighting and communications equipment. â€œThe length of the runway was also increased, which made it possible to expand the capabilities of the airfield to receive and service aircraft of various classes,â€ the statement adds. â€œAfter completing training tasks for the development of airspace in the maritime zone of the Mediterranean Sea, the long-range bombers will return to permanent airfields on the territory of the Russian Federation.â€Â There remains a possibility that the timing of the bomber deployment is intended to coincide with the arrival of the Royal Navyâ€™s Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21), a maritime task force brought together for the first operational deployment of the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth . The carrier sailed from its homeport on May 22 and is due to enter the Mediterranean, from where it is planned that its embarked F-35B stealth fighters will conduct combat operations over the Middle East. During the Cold War, U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and cruise-missile-armed warships operating in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic were among the primary targets of Soviet Naval Aviation Tu-22Ms, but since 2011 the type has been exclusively operated by the Russian Aerospace Forces.Â The 3 #Tu22M3 |s seen arriving at Khmeimim are red ""15""(RF-94149), ""28""(RF-94157) &""50""(RF-34091).

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 26, 2021",Pilot Dies In Crash Of Contractor-Owned Mirage F1 Adversary Jet Near Nellis AFB (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still coming in, but a plane associated in some way with Nellis Air Force Base has crashed. The type of aircraft involved, the status of any individuals on board the aircraft, and what damage, or worse, the aircraft may have caused when it slammed into the ground, are unknown at this time. A post from the base’s official Twitter account has confirmed an “incident involving an aircraft associated with Nellis Air Force Base,” but offered no additional details. The War Zone has already reached out to Nellis for more information about this incident. Reports of a possible crash near Nellis first began to emerge just before 2:30 local time. KVVU-TV , a local Fox affiliate in Las Vegas, said that the Clark County Fire Department responded to a reported plane crash at 2245 N. Christy Lane. This address is in a residential area less than three miles southwest of Nellis. At the time of writing, online flight tracking data available through ADS-B Exchange shows a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Hughes 530 helicopter orbiting the reported area of the crash and subsequent fire. Other data showed that a Department of Energy Bell 412 helicopter had been flying in the same area following the reported crash, before returning to Nellis, and may have been one of the first aircraft on the scene. A screen shot from ADS-B Exchange showing a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Hughes 530 helicopter, with the US civil registration code N530JL, flying in an orbit over the reported crash site in Las Vegas to the southwest of Nellis Air Force Base as of around 3:00 PM local time., ADS-B Exchange Earlier flight tracking data showing, in orange, a route flown by a Department of Energy Bell 412 helicopter, with the US civil registration code N411DE, that took it over the reported crash site. , ADS-B Exchange Bryan Herbert, a former photojournalist for ONSCENE.TV and the Ridgecrest Daily Independent wrote on Twitter that “heavy black smoke and a parachute [were] seen” and subsequent Tweeted out that the aircraft involved may have been a Mirage F1M belonging to private contractor Draken International that had been using the callsign Sniper 01, but this remains unconfirmed. In a separate Tweet, he also said personnel from Nellis, the Clark County Fire Department, and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were still looking for the pilot. Draken, which provides “red air” adversary support to the U.S. Air Force, among others, began flying its ex-Spanish Air Force Mirage F1Ms out of Nellis last year . We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE, 7:15 PM EST: Officials at Nellis Air Force Base have now confirmed that a contractor-operated aircraft crashed just outside of the base’s southern perimeter, but have still not yet said what the type of aircraft was or what contractor was operating it at the time. “Multiple federal and local first responders are on scene,” a Tweet from the base’s official account said. “The incident is under investigation.” Separately, Las Vegas’ KLAS-TV , a CBS affiliate, has reported that the Clark County Fire Department has confirmed that the pilot onboard the aircraft at the time of the incident has died. UPDATE: 9:53 PM EST— Here is the official statement from Nellis AFB: A contracted-aircraft that took off from Nellis Air Force Base crashed at approximately 2:30 p.m. May 24 outside the southern edge of the base. The aircraft was owned, operated and piloted by Draken US, a Florida-based company contracted to provide adversary air support to Nellis Air Force Base. Please see below statement from our partners at Draken US on today’s aircraft incident: “Draken has received news of a downed aircraft out of Nellis AFB and the tragic loss of one of our pilots. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the people and families affected by this event. We are doing everything in our power to assist them in this time of need, and we are working closely with federal, state and local authorities. Draken US is also cooperating with investigating agencies to determine what led to this tragic accident,” said Draken US. The men and women of Team Nellis send our deepest condolences to the teammates, friends and family of our Draken wingman. The pilot’s identity has not yet been released. No other personnel were on board. Multiple federal and local first responders are on scene. The NTSB is investigating the incident. Media queries related to Draken US should be directed to Christina Childs at cchilds@drakenintl.com . We still do not know the type of aircraft involved in the incident. UPDATE: 10:31 PM EST— The NTSB has confirmed it was a Mirage F1. There has been video posted from the scene on Facebook showing the fiery wreck among a number of homes. This could be troubling news for Draken’s and ATAC’s Mirage F1 operations, which are just spinning-up. This is the second Mirage F1 aggressor crash in recent months, after a Mirage F1 owned by ATAC went down in Florida in February of this year. In addition, Draken lost another aircraft in 2016 while operating out of Nellis AFB, an A-4 Skyhawk. In both crashes the pilots survived.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 28, 2021",Russia Shows Off Tiny Fleet Of Titanium-Hulled Sierra II Attack Submarines In New Video,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video from the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television channel has offered an inside look at the country’s titanium-hulled , nuclear-powered Sierra class attack submarines , including relatively close-up views of their wake detection systems . The footage shows interior spaces, including the inside of the escape pod on one of the submarines, as well. It also gives a look at various force protection measures the Russian Navy employs, including divers armed with specialized underwater guns and shoulder-mounted launchers that fire small depth charges used to engage enemy combat swimmers. The episode of TV Zveda ‘s “Military Acceptance” program that aired over the weekend, which you can watch in full below, centered on the Russian Navy’s Project 945 and Project 945A submarines. These are also known in Russia as the Barrakuda and Kondor classes, respectively, while NATO refers to them as Sierra I and Sierra II class submarines. Within the first minute of the episode, the camera pans across Pskov , the second Sierra II class submarine built, and the last of only four Sierra class boats constructed, overall. Elements of its “Wake Object Detection System,” known in Russian as the System Obnarujenia Kilvaternovo Sleda , or SOKS, are clearly visible on the sail, including two protrusions right at the front on the top of it. There is also a relatively small mast on top that appears similar to one associated with SOKS array found on some Project 971 nuclear-powered attack submarines, also known as Akula class boats to NATO. It is worth noting that the mast on Pskov lacks the protrusions seen on the SOKS-associated one on some Akulas and maybe be unrelated to that sensor suite. There is also a sponson on the right side of Pskov ‘s sail that could also be part of this sensor system. Another view of the SOKS suite on Pskov , including a relatively small mast on top, seen behind a folding windscreen on top of the sail. , TV Zvezda capture A portion of the SOKS system on top of the sail of an Akula class submarine., RT capture Interestingly, the other Sierra II class submarine, Nizhniy Novgorod , does not have the small mast on top of the sail, though it does have the pair of protrusions at the front and the side-mounted sponson. A view of Nizhniy Novgorod clearly showing the SOKS gear at the front of the sail, as well as the side-mounted sponson, but no mast on top of the sail., TV Zvezda capture Wake detection systems have been almost exclusively associated with Soviet and subsequently Russian submarines, though other countries have explored the concept over the years, including quite recently in the case of the U.K. Royal Navy . From what is known about the various SOKS suites, which first emerged in the 1960s, they are primarily designed to detect other submarines underwater by picking up the changes in water density they leave in their wake. There have also been reports suggesting that at least some SOKS versions may be able to detect traces of certain chemicals, such as flakes of sound-reducing coatings peeling off or oxygen-generating system byproducts released into the water, as well as nuclear radiation. Regardless, SOKS and similar systems are intended to offers a passive, non-acoustic sensor option to supplement active and passive sonars. You can read more about the advantages this could offer for stealthily tracking and then potentially engage enemy submarines in this past War Zone piece . SOKS is just one of the reasons why the Sierra II s, the first of which entered service in 1990 and that are understood to be very quiet, making them difficult to detect and track, remain some of the most capable attack submarines in Russian Navy service today. Their titanium alloy hulls are another core focus area of the “Military Acceptance” episode, as its title, “Titanium Submarines,” makes clear. Using titanium provides added strength and, as a result, allows these boats to dive deeper than their steel-hulled counterparts. Titanium also has the benefit of being more corrosion-resistant, a very positive attribute for warships and submarines that spend much of their time plowing through saltwater , and are also only very weakly magnetic. At one point during this recent episode of “Military Acceptance,” a Russian Navy sailor shows how a magnetic flashlight will not stick to the inside of the hull. Despite some suggestions that this could help the submarines evade detection by aircraft with magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD) or escape magnetic mines , there is more than enough other metal used elsewhere in their construction to negate any such signature reduction from the titanium hull. A Russian Navy sailor shows the extremely low magnetism of the titanium alloy hull on one of the Russian Navy’s Sierra II class submarines by dropping a magnetic flashlight, which does not then stick., TV Zvezda capture However, titanium is also expensive and complicated to work with, especially when building large structures, such as the pressure hulls of submarines. Workers building the Soviet Union’s Project 705 submarines, another titanium-hulled design also known as Lira or Alfa class, reportedly had to perform many of their tasks inside specialized facilities filled with inert argon gas while wearing cumbersome “moon suits.” The later Akula class, a design that did not have a titanium hull, was similar in many respects to the Sierras , but was also cheaper to build. Ultimately, only four Sierra class submarines, two of each subclass, were ever built. The first Project 945 boat entered Soviet Navy service in 1984, followed by the second example in 1987. As already noted, the first of the Project 945As joined that service in 1990, right before the collapse of the Soviet Union, with independent Russia taking delivery of the second example of this subclass in 1993. A major difference between the two types was in the composition of their torpedo tubes, with the Sierra I s having four 530mm tubes and two 650mm ones, while the Sierra II s had six 530mm tubes. From these tubes, both subclasses could employ a variety of torpedoes and torpedo tube-launched missiles, including the unusual SS-N-16 Stallion anti-submarine missile, which you can read more about here . All of these boats were assigned to the country’s Northern Fleet, but only the pair of Project 945As, Nizhniy Novgorod and Pskov , remain active today. There had been plans to overhaul the two older Project 945 boats, but it’s unclear what the status of that modernization effort is. The Sierra I class Kostroma , which is reportedly inactive, is seen in the TV Zvezda presentation docked together next to the two Sierra II class submarines. From left to right, an Akula class submarine, the Sierra II class submarine Nizhniy Novgorod , the Sierra II class submarine Pskov , and the Sierra I class submarine Kostroma ., TV Zvezda capture The TV Zvezda footage also includes various shots of the inside of Nizhniy Novgorod , including the main command center onboard, where significant portions are blurred out.

The APS is visually similar to an AK-series assault rifle , but also fires a unique underwater round with a long dart instead of a traditional bullet. Both of these weapons have very limited range underwater, with the APS only being able to hit targets at around 100 feet away at relatively shallow depths. The SPP-1M can only hit targets at around half that distance. Both of their maximum effective ranges get progressively shorter at greater depths. They can be used above the water, if absolutely necessary, but with even greater range and accuracy penalties as their projectiles are designed to be stabilized in water, not air.

This presentation from TV Zvezda also comes as the service continues to modernize and expand its submarine, as well as surface fleets, something that continues to be an area of major interest and concern to the Kremlin’s potential adversaries, including members of NATO, and chiefly the United States. As it stands now, the two remaining titanium-hulled Sierra IIs with their SOKS suites and other features look set to be important parts of the Russian Navy’s submarine force for years to come.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 17, 2021",Belarus Now Wants You To Believe Hamas Sent Bomb Scare That Led To Journalist’s Capture,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Belarus now claims that Palestinian militant group Hamas was behind yesterday’s sensational diversion of Ryanair Flight FR4978 to Minsk, the Belarusian capital, that led to the arrest of opposition journalist Roman Protasevich. Meanwhile, the airline’s CEO Michael O’Leary has suggested that Belarusian KGB agents were also aboard the aircraft. After initially downplaying the incident, the airline subsequently deemed it as “air piracy,” with O’Leary himself describing it as a “state-sponsored hijacking.” There is now a growing push for bans on flights crossing Belarusian airspace, led by Lithuania and Latvia’s airBaltic . Meanwhile the United Kingdom has recommended its airlines avoid the area and it has also suspended Belarusian national carrier Belavia’s operating permit to the U.K. The Ryanair 737-800, operating between Athens and Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, was diverted to Minsk while flying over Belarus yesterday due to an alleged security alert. “It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist and his travelling companion … we believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well,” O’Leary told Irish radio station Newstalk Breakfast . Seen here in Gdansk, Poland, in 2019, Ryanair 737-800 SP-RSM was the aircraft involved in the incident over Belarus. , Andrzej Otrębski/Wikimnedia Commons Protasevich is the former editor of Telegram channels Nexta and Nexta Live , and is widely regarded as a key commentator in mobilizing the opposition to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko . Belarusian air traffic control informed the crew of a potential security risk on board — widely reported as a bomb scare — and a fully armed Belarusian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jet escorted it into Minsk National Airport. This is a standard response for these kinds of instances, all around the world , although data from the flightradar24.com website shows the airliner was only two minutes from Lithuanian airspace when it was diverted. Tadeusz Giczan, the current editor of Nexta , tweeted that the bomb scare had been triggered by Belarusian KGB agents aboard the plane. When he became aware of what was happening, Protasevich reportedly began handing over his laptop and other personal items to his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. Other accounts suggest that Protasevich had become suspicious of the situation when he noticed someone following him at Athens Airport. Once on the ground, the passengers were disembarked, their luggage searched, and Protasevich was arrested by Belarusian authorities, reportedly telling fellow travelers beforehand that “I’m facing the death penalty here.” Sapega was also taken off the plane but her current status is unclear. After more than six hours on the ground, local authorities deemed the 737 to be safe and it was cleared to depart to Vilnius. It landed there safely at 9:25 pm local time and was welcomed Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte. Simonyte herself declared that the aircraft had been “hijacked” and described the incident as an “unprecedented attack on the international community”. Multiple reports had suggested that another four individuals also disembarked at Minsk, now apparently confirmed by O’Leary’s remarks to Newstalk Breakfast . Although not stated explicitly, the implication is that Belarusian security services — which still use the Soviet-era KGB name — were shadowing Protasevich prior to his flight. The blogger has lived in exile in Lithuania since 2019. Sapega, a Russian citizen, is currently studying in Lithuania. Belarus has been steadfast in its view that its officials took the correct course of action. Today, Artem Sikorsky, director of the Belarusian Aviation Department of the Ministry of Transport, presented what’s claimed to be a bomb threat sent by Hamas via email. “We, the Hamas soldiers, demand that Israel cease fire in the Gaza Strip,” the purported message read. “We demand that the European Union renounce its support for Israel in this war. It is known that the participants of the Delphi Economic Forum are returning home on Flight 4978. A bomb is planted in this plane. If you do not fulfill our demands, the bomb will explode on May 23 over Vilnius”. A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the recent Gaza Strip conflict had already come into effect two days earlier . Another discrepancy with that narrative is that the supposed warning was sent to Minsk, rather than Vilnius, that actual destination and target. State media in Belarus confirmed that Lukashenko personally gave the order for the response. “There is no doubt that the actions of our competent authorities … fully met established international rules,” said Anatoly Glaz , a spokesman for the Belarusian foreign ministry. Clearly, Protasevich is a thorn in the side of the Belarusian authorities who have accused him of helping orchestrate last year’s mass protests against Lukashenko. These had followed accusations of election fraud and were met with a heavy-handed response from Minsk. Nexta , in particular, played a significant role in getting around an official media blackout and was also fairly instrumental in reporting on the violence of the subsequent crackdown . Since yesterday’s dramatic events, officials in Latvia and Lithuania have called for the airspace over Belarus to be closed for all international flights and already some airlines have diverted their flights accordingly. As well as airBaltic, other commercial carriers that appear to have taken such action are Austrian Airlines, and Wizz Air of Hungary. Ukrainian officials are also reportedly drafting similar guidelines for their own carriers. For its part, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has contacted national authorities in the region to “raise awareness of the situation,” so that each airline can make its own risk assessment. Leaders of other nations have also meanwhile condemned the Belarusian actions and U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has called for Protasevich’s immediate release. “This shocking act perpetrated by the [Lukashenko] regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, including U.S. citizens,” a statement from the U.S. Department of State declared . “Initial reports suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military aircraft to escort the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation.” Initially, Ryanair did not mention Protasevich’s arrest, only noting that the airliner had been cleared to depart Belarus “together with passengers and crew.” Following a wave of social media criticism, an updated statement from the airline issued today described the action as “an act of aviation piracy.” “The outrageous and illegal behaviour of the regime in Belarus will have consequences,” tweeted President of the European Union (EU) Commission Ursula Von der Leyen. “Those responsible for the Ryanair hijacking must be sanctioned. Journalist Roman Protasevich must be released immediately. [The European Commission] will discuss tomorrow action to take.” Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, said the incident was “serious and dangerous” and called for an international investigation. Unsurprisingly, the nature of the incident has generated considerable discussion and concern has been raised about how easy it could be for other regimes to take similar action. “If aircraft can be forced to the ground … in order to punish the political opponents of tyrants, then journalists here in the UK, politicians anywhere in Europe will find it harder to speak out,” said Tom Tugendhat, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the United Kingdom. It will also be interesting to see what measures the EU will call for once it has met today to discuss the situation. Following the crackdown on last year’s protests, the EU imposed sanctions on numerous Belarusian officials, including Lukashenko. For its part, the Belarusian leader has sought to establish closer ties with its ally Russia, including expanding military cooperation , although, so far, that has had mixed results, with plans to establish a Russian airbase on Belarusian territory falling through . We will have to wait and see what kind of fallout from yesterday’s incident is still to come. Curously, however, a day later, on May 24, Belarusian authorities reportedly prevented Lufthansa Flight LH1487, an Airbus A319, departing Minsk for Frankfurt, due to a “because of a terror threat.” Passengers were apparently requested to leave the aircraft and undergo further security checks and it arrived in Frankfurt almost two hours late . At this point, it’s not clear exactly what the circumstances were and whether there is a direct connection between the two events. We will continue to update this story as more details become available. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 9, 2021",How General Atomics Is Going All-In On Making Its Drones Relevant In A Peer-State Conflict,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics has revealed a new small drone design that can be launched in mid-air from the MQ-9 Reaper , the company’s flagship product, as well as its MQ-1C Gray Eagle . The disclosure of this unmanned aircraft, the name of which has not been released, but that is in development now, is part of a larger vision for how the MQ-9 and MQ-1C could be employed in the future, including in support of higher-end conflicts. In addition to acting as unmanned motherships for smaller drones , there are also efforts underway to improve their self-defense capabilities and expand their mission sets. General Atomics’ Aeronautical Systems, Inc. division, or GA-ASI, released concept art, seen above and below, featuring the unnamed drone along with other materials it provided as part of the 2021 Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC), which began on Monday and wraps up today. This annual event is being hosted virtually for the second year in a row due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. An artist’s conception of an MQ-1C Gray Eagle carrying, among other things, a previously undisclosed smaller unmanned aircraft capable of being launched in mid-air under its right wing. Two Area-I ALTIUS-600 drones are also seen flying to the right., GA-ASI “This rendering represents the first public look at one of our new, unannounced prototypes, which has been in development for some time and is really a remarkable addition to the product line,” C. Mark Brinkley, the Director of Strategic Communications & Marketing at GA-ASI, told The War Zone . “As a whole, our sUAS/ALE family of systems presents a great opportunity to extend the capabilities of the MQ-9 and MQ-1C for the future fight.” Though he could not provide detailed specifics about the drone, Brinkley said that it was one component of “a family of small UAS,” or unmanned aircraft systems, which also includes Sparrowhawk and General Atomics’ entry into the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) LongShot program. Sparrowhawk is another small drone designed to be launched and recovered in mid-air, which you can read more about here . LongShot is exploring concepts for air-launched unmanned systems armed with air-to-air weapons that could extend the reach of the platform employing them, something you can read more about here . General Atomics’s Sparrowhawk, which is designed to be both launched and recovered in mid-air, seen under the wing of an MQ-9., GA-ASI From what we can see in the artwork, the newly unveiled small drone design has a front-mounted propeller, pop-out wings, and a v-tail, and also appears to have some low observable (stealthy) features. Its general form and function do appear similar to Sparrowhawk, which also has a v-tail, but has a different pop-out wing configuration and propulsion system. Close-up looks at the newly unveiled General Atomics small UAS design as seen in the concept art released for SOFIC., GA-ASI The MQ-1C artwork also shows that drone flying together with a pair of Area-I Agile-Launch Tactically Integrated Unmanned System (ALTIUS) 600 drones. GA-ASI has already demonstrated the ability of the Gray Eagle to launch the ALTIUS-600 in flight and the U.S. Army has been actively using these drones as part of work on its Air Launch Effects (ALE) program. Brinkley said that the family of General Atomics drones that includes the newly revealed design is also “sometimes known as air-launched effects.” The goal of the ALE program is to develop a family of smaller drones that can be launched from larger manned or unmanned aircraft and that are capable of working together as networked swarms to perform various missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic attack, and even lethal strikes. You can read more about the ALE effort here . The Army has also been using the ALTIUS-600 to explore the potential for deploying ALE systems from the ground and the U.S. Air Force has also air-launched at least one of these drones from an XQ-58A Valkyrie’s internal payload bay . US Army personnel launch an ALTIUS-600 from a DAGOR ultra-light vehicle during an exercise., US Army “Army Futures Command (AFC) has identified a future fight in an Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS)-rich environment where platforms must be survivable, attritable, or expendable to deliver sensing capabilities effectively where 1) The MQ-1C Gray Eagle flies racetrack patterns tangential to the IADS threat, at 80 km [~50 miles] distance, 2a) ALEs deploy from the MQ-1C Gray Eagle as the forward most element of the advanced team in areas of expected enemy contact in order to detect, identity, location and report (DILR) and attack/disrupt/decoy threat assets to initiate disintegration of the IADS,” according to an official 2020 Army contracting notice. The word “attritable” that is used here refers to platforms that, while not explicitly expendable, are low-cost enough where they could be employed in areas where it would otherwise be less palatable sending more expensive ‘exquisite’ designs. The concept of operation General Atomics envisions for employing the unnamed smaller UAS from the MQ-9 is very similar to these stated plans from the Army. “Our larger aircraft can transport these small UAS systems thousands of miles into the operational area, and provide the long-range sensors needed to identify potential targets of opportunity,” Brinkley explained. “Once identified, the small UAS can swoop in for a closer look, provide positive ID, and then track hostile actors,” he continued. “That data is passed back to the MQ-9 or MQ-1C, which has the robust communications suite necessary to transmit that data anywhere in the world where the information is needed. As a team, the large/small UAS combo will be a key element for targeting, intelligence, reconnaissance, and networking across the future combat spectrum.” GA-ASI has also made clear that it sees MQ-9s and MQ-1Cs deploying smaller drones as key to how those platforms will able to support operations in more contested environments during future higher-end conflicts, just like the Army does. The Reaper and the Gray Eagle were designed originally more with operations in permissive airspace in mind and have been shown to be vulnerable even to lower-tier air defense capabilities . “By employing these smaller UAS, Reaper and Gray Eagle operators will be able to penetrate, disintegrate and exploit anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) air defenses, and support operations in any domain,” Brinkley added, though, of course, any such penetration would be indirect. “Meanwhile, the greater standoff afforded by these smaller UAS increases the survivability of the larger aircraft by placing them outside the kinetic range of tactical surface-to-air missiles.” These small drones are just one of a number of efforts to reduce the vulnerability of the Reapers and Gray Eagles, as well as give them additional mission sets, to help ensure their relevance going forward. The concept art of the MQ-1C carrying one of the newly disclosed UASs also shows that aircraft equipped with a new self-protection pod that GA-ASI has been working. The company had announced in January that it had finished a flight test demonstration of this system, which it had developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with SOCOM, on the MQ-9. The pod has built-in radar warning receivers, as well as an AN/AAQ-45 Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasure (DAIRCM) system. The AN/AAQ-45 uses an array of electro-optical and infrared sensors to detect and track incoming missiles, and can then employ a laser against threats that employ infrared seekers to blind and confuse them, throwing them off course. The podded self-defense system also has a countermeasures dispenser that can release decoy flares , chaff , and the BriteCloud expandable radio-frequency decoy. That latter countermeasure, which you can read more about here , is used to lure away radar-guided missiles. As part of the materials it provided for SOFIC, GA-ASI also released artwork depicting an MQ-9 equipped with the self-defense pod, as well as an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile. The U.S. Air Force has been exploring arming its Reapers with these air-to-air weapons for self-defense and potentially other roles, including knocking down incoming cruise missiles . An artist’s conception of an MQ-9 Reaper equipped with the self-defense pod and armed with an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, as well as other weapons and stores., GA-ASI The concept art of the MQ-9 launching two of the smaller UASs also shows that Reaper fitted with a Scalable Open Architecture Reconnaissance (SOAR) pod under its right wing and a Rosetta Echo Advanced Payload (REAP) under its left wing. SOAR is a signals intelligence suite that “provides identification, geolocation and characterization of RF Signals of Interest (SOI) for the formation of Electronic Order of Battle,” according to General Atomics’ website . REAP, designed and built by Ultra Electronics , is a communications and data-sharing system. An infographic showing various payloads General Atomics has or is developing for the MQ-9, including the SOAR and REAP pods., GA-ASI REAP underscores another potential future role for the MQ-9, as a communications and datalink gateway node. GA-ASI says that this pod “provides the foundation for an Open Mission Systems (OMS) capable communications gateway (ABMS building block).” An open-architecture system is one designed to be readily adaptable and upgradeable to give existing systems additional functionality and enable all-new capabilities. ABMS is the U.S. Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System program, which is a broad initiative exploring a wide array of new technology to improve networking and associated capabilities , with a heavy emphasis on leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning . The REAP pod is also notably one of three pods that the Air National Guard is now exploring as part of a large upgrade package, referred to as Ghost Reaper, for its MQ-9s. General Atomics first unveiled the Ghost Reaper concept in 2020. A Reaper from the 174th Attack Wing, an element of the New York Air National Guard, flew with a set of Ghost Reaper pods during the recent iteration of the annual Northern Edge exercise in Alaska. The other two pods that are part of this configuration are a Centerline Avionics Bay Pod, which provides an expansion area where various additional systems can be installed, and Northrop Grumman’s Freedom Pod. The Freedom Pod contains the advanced Freedom 550 software-defined radio , which, depending on its exact configuration, has the power to translate between a wide array of different and otherwise incompatible waveforms, as well as sport an infrared search and track (IRST) system. An MQ-9 Reaper assigned to the New York Air National Guard’s 174th Attack Wing with, from left to right, an Agile Pod configured as a surrogate for the REAP pod, the Centerline Avionics Bay Pod, and the Freedom Pod., USAF Between REAP and the Freedom 550, the Ghost Reaper concept could turn the MQ-9 into a powerful data-fusion node, able to collect information from various sources, including its own onboard sensors and ISR data collected by drones it has launched, and then help push it out to other aircraft, as well as friendly forces down below. The Air Force has said specifically that these pods will allow Reapers “to receive and pass information to and from older fourth generation and newer fifth-generation aircraft,” a major area of interest for the service for years now. “REAP bridged surveillance imagery video from a Coyote unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to ground command-and-control assets,” according to a story from Aviation Week last September . “Follow-on versions of REAP include Link 16 integration, providing low-latency tactical data link information to military personnel in the air and on the ground. This new capability would allow the Joint Terminal Attack Controller to designate an attack aircraft to hit a target.” Raytheon’s Coyote family of small drones is another design that is increasingly popular within the U.S. military, as a whole. Coyote variants have been employed in a number of research and development efforts regarding swarming technology over the years, especially within the U.S. Navy , and the Block 3 design is now being employed in a new round of work in this vein, which you can read more about here . On top of all that, the Freedom Pod’s IRST would offer a way to passively watch for aerial threats, either to the drone itself or an other assets it might working with, even stealthy aircraft or missiles, and in environments where there is significant electronic jamming. General Atomics has also flight tested its Avenger drone with a Lockheed Martin Legion Pod equipped with an infrared search and track (IRST) system, as seen here. , GA-ASI All of this comes as the future of the MQ-9, in particular, is increasingly uncertain. Last year, the Air Force announced, unexpectedly, its desire to stop buying any additional Reapers , citing how vulnerable they would be in a higher-end conflict. The service then initiated a replacement program for these drones, known as MQ-Next, which you read more about here . Congress blocked those plans by inserting funding for additional Reapers in a defense spending bill that became law in January despite a veto from then-President Donald Trump. However, the Air Force continues to make clear that it is working to move beyond the MQ-9 . General Atomics is also now pitching the MQ-9 as an alternative option to SOCOM’s Armed Overwatch effort . The Armed Overwatch program is looking to acquire an armed manned aircraft of some kind to replace Air Force Special Operations Command’s U-28A Draco fleet . SOCOM envisions the Armed Overwatch aircraft operating primarily in more permissive environments in support of lower-end conflicts. Of course, any future replacement for the Air Force’s MQ-9s, as well as the Army’s MQ-1Cs, is likely still years away from entering widespread service, meaning that Reapers and Gray Eagles could very much benefit from upgrades and add-on capabilities that could make them more relevant in higher-end conflicts in the near term. General Atomics says that it hopes that the smaller air-launched UAS it revealed this week at SOFIC will fly for the first time in 2022. Brinkley, GA-ASI’s Director of Strategic Communications & Marketing, stressed that the development of many of these new capabilities, including work on Sparrowhawk and the launching of ALEs from Army Gray Eagles, has already progressed to a significant degree. “We’re not talking about some distant future here. It’s not ‘Star Trek.'” he said. As such, other existing and future operators of the Reaper, or other variants and derivatives of that design, could also be interested in these new capabilities for their drones. This operator base is now notably growing thanks to changes last year in the U.S. government’s restrictions on exporting unmanned aircraft. All told, the coming evolution of the capabilities of both the MQ-9 and MQ-1C within the U.S. military, especially their increasing ability to launch smaller unmanned aircraft, potentially in networked swarms, looks set to be full of exciting new developments in the coming years, if not months.

Adam Kehoe and Marc Cecotti,"Updated on Dec 18, 2021",Multiple Destroyers Were Swarmed By Mysterious ‘Drones’ Off California Over Numerous Nights,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In July of 2019, a truly bizarre series of events unfolded around California’s Channel Islands. Over a number of days, groups of unidentified aircraft, which the U.S. Navy simply refers to as ‘drones’ or ‘UAVs,’ pursued that service’s vessels, prompting a high-level investigation. During the evening encounters, as many as six aircraft were reported swarming around the ships at once. The drones were described as flying for prolonged periods in low-visibility conditions, and performing brazen maneuvers over the Navy warships near a sensitive military training range less than 100 miles off Los Angeles. The ensuing investigation included elements of the Navy, Coast Guard, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The incidents received major attention, including from the Chief of Naval Operations—the apex of the Navy’s chain of command. The following is our own investigation into these events, during which we discovered these events were far more extensive in scale than previously understood. A Strange Story Emerges Last year, documentary filmmaker Dave Beaty uncovered initial details about the events, centering on the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Kidd (DDG-100). That initial account described a tense encounter, culminating in the deployment of onboard intelligence teams. USS Kidd ., USN New documents significantly expand the public’s knowledge of the scope and severity of that incident and reveal others that occurred around the same time. These details come largely from our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, which resulted in the disclosure of deck logs from the ships involved. Additionally, our investigation utilized hundreds of gigabytes of automatic identification system (AIS) ship location data to forensically reconstruct the position of both military and civilian ships in the area during this strange series of events. By using the USS Kidd ‘s position as a starting point, we were able to identify several other ships in close proximity to it during the incidents in question, including U.S. Navy destroyers USS Rafael Peralta , USS Russell , USS John Finn, and the USS Paul Hamilton . Subsequent FOIA requests for these ships’ records allowed us to build a composite picture of the events as a whole. USN Night One: July 14th, 2019 It appears the incidents began with an initial ‘UAV’ sighting by the USS Kidd around 10:00 PM on the night of July 14th, 2019. Deck logs like the one below provide information about the course and speed of the ship. Additionally, they record any other relevant information about unusual events or changes in the ship’s behavior. This log records the first drone sighting: Navy via FOIA As previously reported, two drones, typically described as UAVs or unmanned aerial vehicles throughout the logs, were spotted by the Kidd. The Ship Nautical Or Otherwise Photographic Interpretation and Exploitation team, or “SNOOPIE team,” refers to an onboard photographic intelligence team tasked with documenting unknown contacts, events of interest, and other objects of interest on short order. A member of a destroyer’s SNOOPIE team with a video camera in hand., USN Though an Aegis-equipped ship like the USS Kidd has some of the most sophisticated sensors on earth, sailors equipped with consumer-grade cameras act as a kind of nimble spotting and event recording team, able to quickly adapt to changing conditions while providing situational awareness and recording what they see through traditional video and photo methods. You can see a SNOOPIE team in action and one of their products in the video below: Moments after the sighting on July 14th, the USS Kidd entered into a condition of restricted communications designed to enhance operational security and enhance survivability. This is noted throughout many of the logs as “River City 1.” During the events, the ships often engaged “emissions control,” or EMCON, protocols designed to minimize their electronic emissions profile. Less than 10 minutes after the sighting, the USS Kidd advised the USS Rafael Peralta of the situation. The USS Rafael Peralta logs show that at around 10:00 PM it activated its own SNOOPIE team. They also show that reports of additional sightings were coming in from the USS John Finn . Navy via FOIA For its part, the logs of the USS John Finn simply reported possible UAV activity, and deactivation of the ship’s AIS transponder system. In fact, the selective deactivation of AIS was a challenge for us in reconstructing ship positions, as we sometimes had to rely on cross-comparison of deck logs to locate the position of the ships. Shortly after the initial sighting, a red flashing light was spotted. Navy via FOIA Among the more dramatic entries in the logs from this incident is the one below from the USS Rafael Peralta, describing a white light hovering over the ship’s flight deck. Navy via FOIA The log reflects that the drone managed to match the destroyer’s speed with the craft moving at 16 knots in order to maintain a hovering position over the ship’s helicopter landing pad. To further complicate what was already a complex maneuver, the drone was operating in low visibility conditions (less than a nautical mile) and at night. By this point, the encounter had lasted over 90 minutes—significantly longer than what commercially available drones can typically sustain. The red-lit bridge of an Arleigh Burke class destroyer at night., USN According to AIS data, few civilian ships were in the immediate vicinity. AIS is not strictly mandatory in all cases, and can be turned off, so it is possible other vessels could have been nearby, as well. The civilian bulk carrier Bass Strait , cited later in the investigation, was situated towards the northern edge of the encounter area. A Liberian-flagged oil tanker, the Sigma Triumph, was just south of the position of the three destroyers. The ORV Alguita , a 50-foot catamaran, briefly a subject of interest in the official investigation that would come, was just off the western tip of San Clemente Island. Importantly, San Clemente Island is owned by the Navy and is frequently used for military training and testing purposes. The following map shows maritime traffic around the ports of Los Angeles and San Diego on July 14th. The position of each ship at 10:00 PM is marked with a black indicator, and the track of the ship before and after the incident time is marked with colored dots. The approximate positions of each cluster of ships are numerically marked. Author’s illustration The two groups of destroyers and the ORV Alguita form a roughly triangular shape with each side approximately 50 nautical miles long, containing an area just over 1000 square nautical miles. The Bass Strait and the USS Paul Hamilton were in relatively close proximity at marker one. The ORV Alguita was off the northern tip of San Clemente Island at marker two. The USS Kidd was at marker three, and the formation of three destroyers was at marker four. The tanker Sigma Triumph was just to the west of the formation of three destroyers, at marker five. Night Two: July 15th, 2019 Due to new FOIA disclosures, we now know that another major series of incursions occurred on the following night, July 15th, 2019. This time, the USS Rafael Peralta was the first to spot the objects and to deploy its SNOOPIE teams at 8:39 PM. Navy via FOIA By 9:00 PM, the USS Kidd had also spotted the drones and again deployed its SNOOPIE team. The drones seem to have pursued the ships, even as they continued to maneuver throughout the incident. Navy via FOIA By 9:20 PM, the USS Kidd logs simply remark “Multiple UAVs around ship” – with the word  “above” crossed out: Navy via FOIA 17 minutes later, the command is issued to man Mark 87 stations: Navy via FOIA The meaning of this is not exactly clear, but it could be referring to the Mark 87 Electro-Optical Director that is a component of the massive infrared and optical turret known as the Mk20 Electro-Optical Sighting System (EOSS) located above the bridge. This system was originally meant to help direct the ship’s 5-inch gun, but also provides surveillance and tracking over long distances. The War Zone has done a complete profile on this powerful optical system , which could have been useful in trying to understand what was going on around the ship and to possibly identify the drones at night. The Mk20 EOSS., USN/L3Harris The reference could also be in regards to the ship’s 25mm/87 Mk38 chain guns that are also equipped for remote use via a FLIR ball, although this is less likely. There is also the Mk 87 line throwing rifle adapter used for firing lines to other ships during underway replenishment and other activities, but this makes little sense in the context of the moment. At approximately the same time, the USS Russell records a frenzy of activity: Navy via FOIA The logs describe drones dropping in elevation, and apparently moving forward and backward, left and right. Meanwhile, the USS Rafael Peralta received a radio call from a passing cruise ship, the Carnival Imagination, notifying them that the drones are not theirs, and that they also see as many as five or six drones maneuvering nearby: Navy via FOIA The incident continued into the night, with the USS Rafael Peralta first recording two UAVs and then four UAVs near their ship: Navy via FOIA Approaching midnight, the USS Russell reports a final sighting: Navy via FOIA Despite the nearly three-hour duration of the event, none of the warships involved appear to have been able to identify the drones. An Arleigh Burke destroyer underway at night., USN In contrast to the first night, the second set of encounters occurred closer to shore. Several of the drone sightings placed their position between San Clemente Island and San Diego. The approximate positions of the ships and drone sightings are depicted below. Note that the track dots indicate the position of the ships throughout the event, with a larger black dot indicating the position of each ship near the start of the incident at 8:45 PM. Author’s illustration The Official Investigation As might be expected for such an unusual set of encounters, a formal investigation appears to have been launched immediately. The first email we obtained was dated July 17th, and referenced earlier phone conversations. By the morning of July 18th, a Navy liaison to the Coast Guard began requesting updates for information on vessels involved in the encounter, citing “higher-level visibility.” Navy via FOIA An hour later, a special agent with Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), assigned to 3rd Fleet as a “Staff CI Officer,” with CI likely standing for “counter-intelligence,” thanked a colleague in the Coast Guard. They mentioned that the information would go directly to the commander of the Pacific Fleet and to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) – the top of the Navy hierarchy, and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Navy via FOIA It appears the initial focus of their investigation was the ORV Alguita. An email sent just 10 minutes later expressed the need to relay information about the ship to a larger team. Navy via FOIA By this time, an agent with the Los Angeles office of the FBI was included in the email chain. Preliminary information indicated that while the ORV Alguita did have drones onboard, they had very limited capabilities. Navy via FOIA A follow-up email on the evening of July 18th indicated that the Coast Guard had contacted the ship directly via satellite phone. Based on the subject line reference to San Nicolas Island and the time period given by investigators, it seems the ORV Alguita was being examined specifically for the events of July 14th. Navy via FOIA The investigators had encountered several problems at this point. The owners of the Alguita denied operating a drone during the time in question, and claimed that their drones were incapable of operating more than a few feet from the ship. Further, the Phantom IV drone is a small quadcopter and has a maximum flight time of 28 minutes, according to manufacturer DJI , which is inconsistent with the long durations of the incidents and general performance described as observed in the deck logs. Phantom 4 Pro., DJI Although not referenced in these emails, the Alguita was also significantly west of the events of the second night, July 15th, based on AIS data. Apparently recognizing that ORV Alguita was a poor fit, investigators conceded that they needed to keep looking. Emails reflect that Navy intelligence began to take a more active role in the investigation by July 19th, with the director of the Maritime Intelligence Operations Center (MIOC) within 3rd Fleet, identified by the acronym C3F, “looping in” the rest of the command’s intelligence office, or N2. Navy via FOIA Investigators next sought to rule out the possibility that the drones were operated by the Navy itself. By Tuesday of the following week, a representative from the Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility (FACSFAC) based in San Diego clarified that UAVs were only operated by the Navy in certain limited areas. They then provided the following map of operational areas (OPAREAS) with a breakdown of platforms in use. Navy via FOIA Somewhat cryptically, one of the investigators referenced “recent observations” and further clarified the need to “correlate or rule out operations.” He further requested data detailing operations between the 14th to the 17th of July. Navy via FOIA FACSFAC San Diego, in turn, sent spreadsheets of scheduled activity during that time, and explained that UAV operations are highlighted in yellow. Though the flight schedules released to us for July 14th are completely redacted, the underlying highlighting is visible. No yellow highlighting can be seen for July 14th: Navy via FOIA By the afternoon of July 23, the investigators were still grappling with determining the intent behind the incidents. Navy via FOIA The last email disclosed to us was from July 25th. It references a classified briefing on drones (referred to here as UAS). Navy via FOIA A further FOIA request for information about these briefings was denied due to their classification level. After July 25th, the email trail turns cold. Remarkably, the drone incidents began occurring again around this time. Renewed sightings occurred during the early hours of July 25th and July 30th, just as investigators were beginning to examine classified briefings and were apparently still seeking to identify the intent behind the July 14th and 15th incursions. The incident on the 25th involving the USS Kidd began around 1:20 AM, with the SNOOPIE team being deactivated around 1:52 AM. Navy via FOIA The incident on July 30th was longer, with the team activated around 2:15 AM and only deactivated by 3:27 AM: Navy via FOIA Navy via FOIA These later incidents are notable because they occurred during the investigation, and after FACSFAC San Diego had been closely consulted. At the time of writing, we do not have complete deck logs for the month of July except for USS Kidd , so it remains uncertain if other ships also continued to have drone encounters later in the month. Further information continues to emerge from FOIA requests, but based on the available evidence it appears that the initial investigation did not ultimately identify the source of the drones. Increasingly Pressing Questions Cumulatively, these new details raise a host of difficult questions. It is unclear why anyone would operate drones near Navy warships in such a brazen manner. Commercially available drones are not commonly capable of flying for such long durations across great distances with speeds in excess of 45 miles an hour. Based on the pooled data available from the deck logs, we estimate the drones traversed at least 100 nautical miles in the July 14th incident. Furthermore, the drones were able to locate and catch a destroyer traveling at 16 knots in conditions with less than one nautical mile of visibility. Equally baffling, their operators appear to have coordinated at least five to six drones simultaneously. Then there is the question of line-of-sight control, and control methods in general, which make the capabilities described all that much more puzzling. A U.S. Navy destroyer cruises under the stars. , USN To be sure, San Clemente Island and nearby training area FLETA HOT are hosts to a bevy of testing, which can include classified programs. Is it possible that the drones were operated by the military itself in an errant test of some kind? If so, the incursions continued after a concerted investigation that reached the highest level of the Navy hierarchy. It also appears that no UAV activity was scheduled by FASFAC San Diego during July 14th. On the other hand, it is a general area where extremely strange things have occurred in the past . If the drones were not operated by the American military, these incidents represent a highly significant security breach. If they were part of some kind of covert action, it is nonetheless unclear why they were flown so openly and so frequently in almost a harassing manner. More troubling still, if a foreign state actor was involved, where exactly were the drones launched from? One thing is fairly sure: the U.S. Navy has a large amount of data on these events. The documents above reflect that multiple independent photographic intelligence teams were deployed. These teams are only a small part of a sophisticated suite of surveillance capabilities and advanced sensors , including the ability to detect radio emissions in the vessels’ vicinity, available to any one of the ships involved. This is on top of the land-based sensors that closely surveil the area. In fact, it is puzzling that those sensors, coupled with a likely extensive photographic record, were not sufficient in and of themselves to resolve the matter. This calls into question the “drone” designation. Was there ever even a hard description of these craft beyond lights in the sky? The question remains: who was operating these craft with apparent impunity, and for what purpose, and was this extremely bizarre case ever resolved? Our investigation is into this event is still underway and we will update you as soon as more information becomes available.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 1, 2021",Border Patrol Helicopter Had Bizarre Encounter With Mysterious “Highly Modified” Drone (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The FBI has announced the start of an investigation into a strange near-miss incident that occurred on February 9, 2021 in the skies over Tucson. At around 10:30 p.m. on that date, a helicopter operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, was reportedly buzzed by a “high powered” drone that followed it up to a high altitude. Multiple law enforcement agencies also attempted to follow the drone to the point that they could identify its operator, but were unsuccessful. As of the time of writing, the exact kind of helicopter involved does not appear to have been identified. CBP operates a number of different helicopter types , with its Airbus AS350s, Airbus EC120s, and Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawks being among the types that fly regularly in the southwestern United States, including along the border with Mexico. A CBP Airbus AS350 A-Star, CBP Dan Marries of KOLD News , a local CBS affiliate out of Tucson, Arizona, reported the story, as seen in the video in the tweet below. Marries said law enforcement personnel tracked the drone for over an hour at altitudes as high as 14,000 feet. Marries even refers to the drone as “heavily modified,” though it’s unclear exactly how or where that claim originated. If this drone was indeed flying as high as 14,000 feet, that would rule out much of the off-the-shelf drone technology available on the commercial market and place it into a more advanced category. We are pursuing more information about what exactly was meant by “heavily modified.” According to The Associated Press , the drone appeared to have taken off from an unknown location five miles south of Tucson before flying north over the city. At some point in its flight, the craft came “dangerously close” to the CBP helicopter. The FBI is now asking for the public’s help for any information related to the incident. A FBI statement , reads in part: The Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeking to identify the person(s) responsible for illegally flying a drone near a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter. On February 9, 2021, at 10:30 p.m., employees of CBP informed the Tucson Police Department that a drone was flying dangerously close to their helicopter. Over the next few hours, multiple law enforcement agencies worked to locate the drone’s operator but were unsuccessful. The drone appeared to launch from an area about 5 miles south of Tucson and flew across Tucson and north over Marana. No one was injured and no other similar incidents have been reported involving this specific drone. In 2018, The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act included 18 USC 39B, which federally criminalizes “Unsafe Operation of Unmanned Aircraft.” Specifically, knowing or reckless interference or disruption of a manned aircraft, and the operation of unmanned aircraft in close proximity to airports. While the drone(s) did not come into direct contact with an airplane or cause a pilot to make an evasive maneuver, the actions are illegal and extremely dangerous. Anyone flying a drone as prohibited by law can face federal criminal charges, fines, and imprisonment. It is possible the drone operator(s) are not aware they are violating the law. We encourage anyone with information to assist in this investigation to contact the FBI at 623-466-1999. Tips can also be reported to tips.fbi.gov . While the FBI is involved, it’s not clear if the US military was involved in any way in the initial incident or in this ongoing investigation given that Davis-Monthan Air Force Base sits on the outskirts of Tucson, some five miles southeast of the city. The base is home to the 355th Fighter Group, which operates 83 A-10 Thunderbolt II close air support aircraft, as well as hosting rescue, mission support, maintenance, and medical groups. The massive AMARG boneyard also sits adjacent to the base. If the reports of the drone’s launch site are accurate, that would mean the drone could have taken off close to the base. Tucson International Airport also lies to the south of the city, however. Regardless, this is highly controlled airspace where an unmanned aircraft of this nature should not be freely operating. Davis-Monthan AFB (red marker) occupies a large swath of land southeast of Tucson., Google Maps The incident in Tucson is only the latest in a string of events in the region in which unknown drones or otherwise unidentified aircraft have eluded law enforcement. In 2018, a Learjet reported an unidentified craft flying at 40,000 feet above Southern Arizona, an incident The War Zone was the first to report on . An eerily similar incident happened recently over New Mexico. In 2019, drone incursions occurred over Arizona’s Palo Verde nuclear power plant , prompting an investigation from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Just south of Arizona, Mexican law enforcement agencies have been struggling to mitigate the threat posed by drug cartels who are increasingly turning to commercial drones to deliver improvised explosives and assassinate their enemies. DHS OIG More broadly speaking, in late 2019 and early 2020, Colorado and Nebraska were the sites of numerous drone sightings which remain unexplained to this day. Military installations have also seen their share of drone incursions in recent years. The THAAD anti-ballistic missile batteries in Guam as well as multiple U.S. Navy vessels have had numerous encounters with what have been reported as unidentified drones. The proliferation of commercially-available drones is presenting a significant issue for the Armed Forces, as air crews are now reporting airborne encounters with drones at an alarming rate . In an attempt to mitigate the drone threat, the federal government penned an Executive Order earlier this year aimed at limiting the use of foreign-made drones and restricting the use of unmanned vehicles near sensitive sites . A month prior, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, released new guidelines on how critical infrastructure installations can prepare for and defend against drones. Still, in a June 2020 report, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of CBP, concluded that “DHS’ capability to counter illicit UAS activity remains limited” and that drones “present an emerging threat to the Nation as their popularity grows.” The report specifically mentions “harassment” as a threat category, such as buzzing a government helicopter. DHS As we have reported over the past several years, the threat posed by small, seemingly innocuous commercial drones and their slightly more advanced militarized siblings is rising. America’s most robust air defenses weren’t designed with small, low-powered, unmanned aerial systems in mind, and in many ways the United States government is playing catch-up to the r apid proliferation and evolution of lower-end drone technology. Our adversaries are well aware of this shortfall, and in some cases are developing low-end swarming drone systems designed to exploit this vulnerability, as well as other potential concepts of operation. The War Zone is pursuing Freedom of Information Act requests in relation to this incident. We have reached out to the FBI field office in Phoenix but have yet to receive comment. We will update our reporting as the story develops. UPDATE, 5:06 PM CST: After publication, Dan Marries of KOLD in Tuscon provided additional information. Marries said the drone was “Modified enough to reach an altitude of 14,000, speeds in excess of 100 mph with a headwind, and range of 70 miles.” Marries also passed along his segment about the drone encounter that aired on Tucson’s KOLD News. In the segment, Marries interviews FBI special agent Nowak (no first name given), who said the drone made “erratic maneuvers” and even strayed into military airspace. According to Nowak, the helicopter had to take evasive action to avoid the drone.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 30, 2021",Here’s Why Aggressor Learjets Were Making Mock Attack Runs Towards Philly Last Night,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It looks like contractor-operated Learjet 35 aggressor jets were putting the latest iteration of the U.S. Navy’s cutting-edge Aegis air defense system to the test last night, with a series of flights directed against the USS Rancocas , also known as “The Cornfield Cruiser,” a unique ship-like laboratory located in New Jersey, around 20 miles outside of Philadelphia. The Learjets were from Phoenix Air, whose other adversary support work is usually seen in a more traditional maritime context, acting as marauding cruise missiles and enemy airplanes for U.S. Navy ships to defend against. You can read more about what this actually looks like in practice in this previous feature . John Wiseman, who tweets as @lemonodor , first brought our attention to this interesting aggressor activity. He had been alerted to the simulated attack runs by referencing publicly available flight tracking data. In fact, a bot that he has specially developed notified him that four aircraft — Learjet 35s with the U.S. civil registration numbers N32PA, N56PA, N71PG, and N545PA — were operating in close proximity, for roughly an hour, and over land. A Phoenix Air Learjet lands at Naval Air Station North Island, California., Jerry Gunner/Wikimedia Commons The aircraft were operating from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. Considering the flight patterns and the general location it seems glaringly obvious that the Phoenix Air jets had one particular target in mind: the USS Rancocas , more properly known today by its formal title, the Vice Admiral James H. Doyle Combat Systems Engineering Development Site, or CSEDS, in Moorestown, New Jersey. The Rancocas name is derived from the closest body of water to the installation, Rancocas Creek. Carrying electronic warfare pods , the Phoenix Air Learjets are equipped to represent a range of different “bad guys” for target emulation. They may have been simulating anything from bombers to anti-ship cruise missiles, but all four seemed to be making obvious target runs directed at the CSEDS, in a wide line-abreast formation, flying between 16,000-18,000 feet and at a speed of about 300 knots. The repeated attack runs saw the aggressors fly out toward New York City, off the coast of Long Beach on Long Island, and off Lakewood in New Jersey, before returning to their target. CSEDS is a facility devoted to research and development for the long-serving and often-improved Aegis system and is in fact a commissioned naval vessel, manned by Navy sailors and supported by civilian contractors. Its nickname, “The Cornfield Cruiser,” comes from the fact that it features the 122-foot-high superstructure of a major surface combatant and is equipped with all the sensors you would find on a U.S. Navy Aegis-equipped cruiser or destroyer. The ship-like structure looks freakishly out of place among the nearby fields. The location of the “Cornfield Cruiser.”, Google Maps As well as using aggressor jets to provide realistic threat simulation, it should be noted that the CSEDS facility can also test its systems by tracking commercial flights around New York City, a very practical and low-cost way of measuring its capabilities against more predictable aerial contacts. The facility saw a massive expansion in 2015, which now supports testing of the SPY-6 radar. , U.S. Navy The facility was first opened in 1977, but underwent a massive redevelopment in 2015. The expanded site has hosted the powerful SPY-6 radar system since October 2020. The AN/SPY-6(V)1 Air and Missile Defense Radar System is installed at the CSEDS last October., U.S. NAVY The enormous SPY-6 radar unit., RAYTHEON As for the SPY-6, this radar is set to be installed on Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers and work has already begun to integrate it onto the first of those ships, the future USS Jack H Lucas , which is due to be delivered to the Navy in the 2023 Fiscal Year. “The radar will provide new and improved fleet capabilities, and installing and integrating it at the CSEDS will provide needed lessons learned to the Navy and its industry partners,” according to the service. One of the main advantages the SPY-6 will offer is the ability to simultaneously perform anti-air warfare and ballistic missile defense . Many other U.S. Navy ships are slated to receive a version of the SPY-6 known as the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR). You can read all about this in this past feature story of ours. The arrival of the SPY-6 actually marked the first significant hardware upgrade for the CSEDS since it received an array from the ill-fated USS Cole (DDG-67) in 2010, a decade after that warship was damaged in a terrorist attack in Yemen. Testing the SPY-6 in this controlled environment on land will ensure that the Navy and the manufacturer can iron out any problems before the system is installed on a fleet warship. Having aggressor jets put it though its paces is a vital part of that and, with that in mind, we may well see similar mock attacks played out over “The Cornfield Cruiser” in the future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 18, 2021",The New Air Force One’s Custom Hangar Facility Is Taking Shape,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The enormous hangar that will be used to maintain the U.S. Air Force’s two new, sometimes controversial , and staggeringly expensive VC-25B jets that will serve in the Air Force One role is quickly taking shape at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. The construction project, which is costing around $250 million, is required since the new jets are marginally bigger than the earlier VC-25A models that are now in use. Recently obtained detailed satellite imagery, dated April 11, 2021, shows the considerable progress made so far on the huge two-bay hangar, which covers an area of 366,000 square feet, has a length of 660 feet, a width of 575 feet, and a maximum height of 115 feet, according to the Washington Business Journal . When it comes to fitting the VC-25Bs inside, the width of the building is of particular importance, with each of the aircraft having a 225-foot wingspan, larger than the VC-25A, which spans a little under 196 feet. A satellite image showing the expanse of Andrews Air Force Base, with the new hangar under construction in the top left corner., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Official documents have described the new hangar as being designed to “evoke a sense of flight and stateliness through its use of materials, massing and embellishments.” This reflects the fact that this is an environment that’s a far cry from the cluttered halls familiar to most aircraft maintainers. Architectural plans for the new hangar, showing side elevations., NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION It’s not just the maintenance hangar itself that’s changing the face of Andrews Air Force Base, which sits just outside Washington, D.C. While work continues on the VC-25Bs in San Antonio, Texas, which are being converted from orphaned 747-8i , an additional 70,000 square feet at Andrews is required for warehouse support areas, while 60,000 square feet is being given over to new administrative buildings. The contract for the hangar was awarded to Clark Construction, headquartered in nearby Bethesda, in late 2018. Additional infrastructure required to sustain operations by the new Presidential aircraft includes aircraft access taxiways, parking aprons, engine run-up pads, lighting, a refueling system, vehicle parking lot, access roads, perimeter security fencing, and landscaping. As for the aforementioned security fencing, this will be “more decorative in nature than the lower-cost, chain-link fencing normally used for airfield security.” All this is expected to be completed by April next year.

This was itself a seriously costly construction project, the custom-built, bunker-like building featuring unique hardening to protect the aircraft. In the accompanying images, the existing VC-25A hangar is the hexagon-shaped building to the north. A closer view of the custom-made VC-25A hangar with one of those aircraft parked outside., GOOGLE EARTH U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Of course, with a project as big and costly as the new Air Force One, it’s not surprising that the aircraft require specialized infrastructure. We have covered the specific details of the forthcoming VC-25Bs before, but it’s worth bearing in mind they are about as far removed from their commercial 747 cousins as it’s possible to get. Among others, they will feature the most advanced defense countermeasures system available, and are protected against electromagnetic pulse caused by detonating nuclear warheads. The aircraft will also be fitted with the most advanced secure airborne communications system of its kind and a bespoke interior with all that’s required for the Commander-In-Chief to go about their work remotely. All this, plus the infrastructure, including the new hangar, will cost around $5.3 billion. Even taking the VC-25Bs alone, at $4.7 billion they will be the most expensive aircraft ever built. And that’s taking into account the much-publicized claims by former President Donald Trump that he personally slashed the cost of the jets. A more detailed view of the new VC-25B hangar under construction., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION As it stands today, the Air Force One recapitalization program is running late, however. According to a recent report from Defense One , delivery of the first VC-25B has been delayed and won’t be handed over by the end of 2024 as planned. A new timeline has not been confirmed. “We’re going to obviously have to look at the schedule [and] we have to look at it pragmatically,” Lieutenant General Duke Richardson, presently the Military Deputy within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics at the Pentagon, admitted earlier this month. The reason for this latest holdup is a dispute between manufacturer Boeing and subcontractor GDC Technics, which was selected to install the aircraft’s interiors but ran into delays of around 12 months. The Air Force now expects another firm to pick up responsibility for the interiors, according to Richardson. A desktop model of the VC-25B wearing Trump’s preferred new Air Force One paint job., AP—COPYRIGHT 2019 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Prior to this setback, the program also faced other delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the wider supply chain and workforce. As a result, Boeing last month announced a $318 million loss on the VC-25B project. Under the terms of the contract, the manufacturer will cover any cost overruns the program incurs. Of course, questions over costs have been a persistent feature of the program, from the supposed savings of using second-hand aircraft , down to and including the manuals for the aircraft , which alone have a price tag of $84 million. Exactly when the VC-25Bs arrive at Andrews is, not now at least, unclear. Once they touch down, however, it seems that they will have the high-end hangarage befitting such a prestige — and pricey — program.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman is developing a new derivative of its AGM-88G Advanced Anti-radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range, or AARGM-ER, designed specifically for surface-to-surface strikes against targets on land and at sea. The company says that the weapon leverages work it has already doing on both the AGM-88G, a U.S. Navy-led project, and a general air-to-surface derivative, the Stand-in Attack Weapon , or SiAW, which it is developing for the U.S. Air Force. It is also be designed with an eye toward being able to use a launch system installed inside a shipping container, a concept first unveiled for AARGM-ER three years ago that The War Zone was first to report on . The Virginia-headquartered defense contractor included a product sheet on what it is presently calling the Advanced Reactive Strike Missile, or AReS, in the materials it released as part of the annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC), which ended today. The National Defense Industry Association (NDIA) held this event virtually, for the second year in a row, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet with captive-carry AARGM-ER test article under its wing during a flight test., USN This appears to be the first public mention of AReS, which comes four years after the Navy officially initiated the development of the AARGM-ER and three years after the SiAW program emerged publicly. The Navy plans to field the AARGM-ER on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler and it will also be able to fit inside the internal bays on the service’s F-35C Joint Strike Fighters . The Air Force’s F-35As are also set to carry AARGM-ER, as well as SiAW, internally. From the very beginning, it has been clear that the AGM-88G’s design is highly modular and that this was a deliberate decision to support the development of additional variants and derivatives. Before AReS’ appearance, there had already been talk about an air-launched anti-ship missile based on the AARGM-ER. A briefing slide that offers a look at the internal components of the AARGM-ER, highlighting its modular design, and offering additional details about the weapon., USN “Leveraging already fielded Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) technology, Northrop Grumman’s surface-to-surface strike weapon, AReS, is a natural continuance of the rapidly evolving AARGM family of weapons,” the marketing literature says. The missile is a “surface-launched extended range strike weapon for land and sea targets in complex A2/AD [anti-access/area denial] environment.” The are no specific performance specifications given for the AReS in the product sheet, but Northrop Grumman says that it, like AARGM-ER and SiAW, will fly at supersonic speeds. The exact ranges of the AARGM-ER and the SiAW are also unknown, but are expected to be significantly greater than that of the existing AGM-88E Advanced Anti-radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), from which the AGM-88G itself is derived. The AGM-88E has a range of around 80 miles and hits Mach 2 during sprint toward the target in the terminal phase of flight, according to publicly available information . The AReS brochure says that it will be capable of “employment beyond the range of enemy cruise missiles and integrated air defense systems,” which would indicate a maximum range of at least hundreds of miles. It’s not clear whether AReS will use one or more additional propulsion stages or additional rocket boosters to achieve that, but the marketing material does say that “utilization of existing booster(s) reduces integration risk.” Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor Steve Trimble Tweeted out that Northrop Grumman is looking at using a Mk 72 booster , which is presently used on variants of the Navy’s SM-3 and SM-6 missiles , or a Mk 135 , found on the Tomahawk cruise missile, on the AReS together “with a new interstage.” Northrop Grumman also says that AReS will feature an “advanced, multi-mode seeker,” but doesn’t offer any more details about that guidance package in the marketing literature. It would seem very likely the missile would heavily leverage the guidance options already being integrated onto the AARGM-ER and SiAW. The AGM-88G’s guidance section is identical to the one on the older AGM-88E and is capable of zeroing in on a target’s emissions or finding it, even if its in motion, using a millimeter-wave radar seeker. It can also simply hit a specific set of geographic coordinates using its GPS-assisted Inertial Navigation System (INS). A two-way datalink will allow the weapon to receive targeting updates in flight to help improve its accuracy. This would also allow for retasking of the missile from one target to another. In addition, Northrop Grumman says the plan is for it to have a “cooperative weapon engagement” capability, which could mean using targeting information from offboard platforms. That, in turn, would allow the weapon to fired without the launch platform necessarily being able to “see” the target using any organic sensors. The term “cooperative weapon engagement” has also been using in the context of networking munitions together into an autonomous swarm that is able to automatically shift its focus to any new, higher-priority targets that might suddenly emerge. The U.S. Air Force is already exploring exactly this kind of “networked collaborative weapon systems” concept as part of its Golden Horde program, which you can read more about here . AReS will also feature a warhead with “enhanced lethality.” This would appear to be a reference to Northrop Grumman’s Lethality Enhanced Ordnance (LEO) technology, an advanced high-explosive blast-fragmentation concept suitable for use against a wide variety of target types, which you can read more about here . The brochure also says that the sheer kinetic force of the weapon impacting a target at supersonic speed will provide an additional destructive effect. As for the launch platform, the artist’s conception of AReS that Northrop Grumman has now released shows it being fired from what appears to be a truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). This is a well-established launch system that can fire 227mm guided artillery rockets and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile, and is presently in service with the Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, among others. HIMARS will also be one of the main launch platforms for the Army’s future Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) ballistic missile. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uv8OVCcLlp4 “Significant firepower with the potential for up to 6 missiles per standard 40 ft ISO [shipping] container,” the Northrop Grumman product sheet also says. In 2018, the company had shown a model of a shipping container launch system for both the AARGM and AARGM-ER, with a nine-cell launcher. This containerized launcher, now reportedly known as the Modular Payload System, would offer significant additional flexibility, both in terms of what platforms, including ground vehicles and ships, could carry it, as well as how it might then be employed. As already noted, Northrop Grumman says that AReS is being designed with both land-attack and anti-ship capabilities, making it a very flexible weapon, to begin with. A model depicting a launcher for the AGM-88G AARGM-ER missile installed inside a standard shipping container that Northrop Grumman first showed publicly in 2018. The company says that the new AReS derivative can also be employed from a similar container launch system., Joseph Trevithick With all this in mind, the product sheet does make clear that Northrop Grumman is actively pitching AReS to the U.S. Army. That service is looking to acquire and field an entirely new slate of longer-range ground-launched surface-to-surface missiles as it looks to better prepare itself for a higher-end conflict against a near-peer opponent, such as Russia or China. It has already announced that it will be evaluating a land-based Tomahawk cruise missile , as well as a ground-launched version of the U.S. Navy’s highly-capable multi-purpose SM-6 missile . AReS could certainly be another attractive choice for the Army. With the Navy and the Air Force, and the potentially the U.S. Marine Corps, already planning to adopt the AARGM-ER, and the Air Force’s SiAW derivative also on the way, the costs to develop, procure, and sustain these new ground-launched missiles could be appreciably lower than those associated with other designs with similar capabilities. This could also prompt interest from the Marines, who are also exploring new ground-based longer-range missile capabilities, and foreign customers. The War Zone has already reached out to Northrop Grumman for additional information, but from what we know already, AReS does seem like a very logical evolution of the existing capabilities found within the AARGM-ER design, which already looks set to be a very impressive weapon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 27, 2021",China Is Testing A Beastly 20-Barrel Naval Gatling Gun (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged online that indicate testing of a new and absolutely fearsome-looking naval point air and missile defense system has been going on in China since January. The available images show that this weapon system notably features a Gatling-style rotary cannon with a whopping 20 barrels, nearly twice as many the largest close-in weapon system, or CIWS, now in service with the People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN. The pictures, which first emerged on Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo and are now circulating on social media, indicate that this system has already undergone at least three rounds of live-fire tests, in January, March, and April of this year. It is unclear what entities might be involved in the design of this weapon and whether it is expected to lead to an operational system or is simply a proof of concept. An image showing an apparent test of a 20-barrel Gatling-type naval close-in weapon system., Chinese internet It’s also not clear what the caliber of weapon is, what kind of rate of fire it might be intended to achieve, and how fast it has been able to fire. Gatling-type weapons, in general , are well known for their extremely high rates of fire compared to single-barrel guns or even other multi-barrel designs . The mounting the weapon is seen sitting in fits with the general shape and construction of other naval close-in weapon systems (CIWS), which are installed on warships as a last line of defense, primarily against incoming missiles. China already has two domestic CIWS designs that use Gatling-style weapons, the Type 730 , and its associated variants, and the Type 1130 . The Type 730 features a seven-barrel 30mm Gatling-style cannon, while the Type 1130, first seen on China’s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning , and now present on other Chinese warships , is another 30mm design with 11 barrels. A Chinese LD-2000, which uses the same turret, seen the rear of the vehicle, as the Type 730 CIWS., Tyg728 via Wikimedia A Type 1130 CIWS installed on a Chinese Type 054A frigate., Rhk111 via Wikimedia It also worth noting that the Type 730 is at least very externally similar to the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS, which uses a seven-barrel GAU-8/A Avenger cannon , the same gun found on the A-10 Warthog ground-attack aircraft. The Type 730 reportedly has an adjustable rate of rate fire, reportedly can, at maximum, spit out nearly 6,000 rounds per minute . The Type 1130’s maximum rate of fire is reported to be at least 10,000 rounds per minute . A Chinese Type 1130 CIWS in action., Chinese internet Theoretically, with Gatling-type guns, the rate of fire is mainly determined just by how fast the barrels spin. The iconic American 20mm Vulcan cannon , with its six barrels, is typically set to fire at either 4,000 or 6,000 rounds per minute, but has fired faster during testing. The Phalanx CIWS, which the U.S. Navy, as well as others , use, and which is in service in its ground-based Centurion configuration with the U.S. Army, uses a variant of the Vulcan. Compared especially to single-barrel designs, Gatling-style weapons do have the inherent benefit of being able to distribute heat build-up and other wear and tear among their multiple barrels. At the same time, they can still overheat and be fired to the point of destruction. As is evidenced by the reported rate of fire on the Chinese Type 1130 CIWS as compared to the Type 730, adding additional barrels can present one pathway to safely increasing how many rounds per minute a gun of this type can shoot. So, this new 20-barrel weapon could very well be able to operate reliably at a maximum rate of fire thousands of rounds per minute higher than even that of the Type 1130. This would be an alternative to other methods of increasing the immediate firepower for a CIWS, such as adding additional guns. That is a route that the Russians, and the Soviets before them, have taken, most recently in the form of the Panstir-ME system , which blends elements of the Kashtan CIWS with portions of the Pantsir-S1 ground-based point air defense system. Pantsir-ME, like Kashtan, has two GSh-30K six-barrel 30mm rotary cannons, each with a maximum rate of fire between 9,000 and 10,000 rounds-per-minute, but also adds eight surface-to-air missiles. Kashtan is in service in China on various warships, as well. As China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) continues to expand the size and capabilities of its surface fleets, including with the addition of larger, more advanced vessels, including multiple aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships , the demand for more capable CIWSs is only likely to grow. This has already been evidenced by the addition of the new Type 1130 to the Liaoning . Though the discussion is more commonly framed around the increasing threat that advanced Chinese, as well as Russian, anti-ship missiles, including longer-range and faster-flying hypersonic and ballistic types , present to other navies, the PLAN faces the same realities . A CIWS with a 20-barrel Gatling-type cannon with a very high rate of fire would, by definition, be able to put out more rounds, faster. This would be particularly valuable for engaging existing and future advanced anti-ship missiles, which are increasingly faster and stealthier , features that could shrink the available engagement window for close-in defenses. At the same time, unless the magazine capacity is similarly increased, this weapon might only be capable of firing a small number of total bursts before needing to be reloaded. So, while it remains to be seen if this particular 20-barrel design will make its way into operational service, it’s hardly surprising that the PLAN is looking at bigger and badder CIWSs that can spew out shells at even more blistering rates of fire as new threats continue to emerge. UPDATE, 7:35 PM EST: George William Herbert, an independent expert on missiles and nuclear weapons, has noticed that the side view picture of this new Chinese CIWS firing appears to show two barrels, one at the 12 o’clock position and one at the six o’clock position, firing at once. It is possible that ammunition could be fed in, and then ejected, at two separate points to support this method of operation, which would further increase the gun’s overall rate of fire.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",Northrop Grumman Reveals Its “LongShot” Air-Launched Missile-Toting Drone Concept (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman has unveiled concept art of its proposal for the U.S. military’s LongShot program, which you can read about more in this recent War Zone piece . The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DAPRA, announced it had awarded contracts to three companies as part of LongShot, the goal of which is to explore designs for an air-launched aerial combat drone that carries its own air-to-air missiles. The idea is that this system would extend the reach of the launching aircraft while reducing its vulnerability to the enemy, as well as offer a number of other potential benefits. The Virginia-headquartered defense contractor revealed the artist’s conception of its LongShot drone as part of a press release on Feb. 10, 2021. Two days earlier, DARPA had announced that Northrop Grumman, as well as General Atomics and Lockheed Martin , had received contracts, worth unspecified amounts, to craft LongShot “air vehicles.” An artist’s conception of Northrop Grumman’s LongShot drone., Northrop Grumman “Our collaboration with DARPA is the critical first step in the development of innovative operational concepts and solutions that will enhance our warfighter’s combat capability against a rapidly growing threat,” Jaime Engdahl, Program Director for Kinetic Weapons and Emerging Capabilities at Northrop Grumman, said in a statement. “The LongShot program enables us to combine our digital engineering skillset with our extensive knowledge in advanced technology weapons, autonomous systems, and strike platforms to increase weapon range and effectiveness.” Compared to the LongShot concept art that DARPA itself released, which shows a very cruise missile-like design , Northrop Grumman’s proposal has a more airplane-like planform. It is also has a more traditional wing and tail configuration rather than a flying wing design , which the company has become very well known for over the years . The LongShot concept art that DARPA has released, which shows a much more cruise missile-like air vehicle design., DARPA Overall, this particular design seems more consistent with a number of “loyal wingman” type drones that various other companies have in different stages of development . In particular, it has a number of very general similarities, including a v-tail and top-mounted air intake, to Kratos’ XQ-58 Valkyrie . The U.S. Air Force is currently conducting tests using XQ-58As as part of its Skyborg program , which is seeking to develop a suite of artificial intelligence-driven systems capable of operating loyal wingman drones and fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), among others . In December 2020, Kratos got a contract to design a drone to carry the Skyborg systems. Northrop Grumman has also received a contract to develop components for the Skyborg program. Interestingly, while Northrop Grumman’s LongShot concept has stealthy features, including a chined fuselage, it is shown carrying a pair of missiles externally, which would increase its overall radar cross-section. It’s not explicitly stated that the design is intended to carry weapons internally, but it likely does as the renderings show weapons bay doors. Even being able to carry smaller hit-to-kill air-to-air missiles internally in a stealthy configuration would be highly beneficial. This would give the system more flexibility and allow it to also carry outsized missiles that feature longer-range and larger warheads, such as the ones shown in the rendering. It is interesting to note that, prior to LongShot, DARPA had run a very similar program simply known as the Flying Missile Rail (FMR), the concept art for which depicted a drone loaded with two AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) on external pylons. You can read more about the FMR project in this past War Zone piece . The missiles depicted in Northrop Grumman’s new concept art, one of which has a skull and crossbones sticker of some kind on its nosecone, also appear to be a previously unseen design. It’s not clear if the company is offering a new, proprietary long-range air-to-air missile as part of its proposal, but The War Zone has already reached out for additional information about this weapon and other aspects of its LongShot concept. A close up of one of the missiles seen in the artist’s conception of Northrop Grumman’s LongShot proposal, with the skull and crossbones sticker on the nosecone., Northrop Grumman Another close-up view of the missiles in Northrop Grumman’s LongShort concept art., Northrop Grumman All told, Northrop Grumman’s artwork is fascinating in that it seems to depict a much more complex, and potentially costly, platform than DARPA seemed to be looking for in its own descriptions of the LongShot concept. As already noted, it seems to be teetering on the edge of just being a loyal wingman. This could be the play in mind, building more complex loyal wingman UCAVs and simpler missile carriers based on the same design to reach high production volumes. It also points to this system being reusable. We also know that the Air Force has been exploring air-launched loyal wingman concepts separately. Of course, from what we know so far, DARPA appears to have left the door wide open for companies to pursue various approaches to meeting the LongShot program’s requirements. So far, the agency has not provided details about any of the project’s physical or performance parameters. With Northrop Grumman’s concept art out now, artwork from General Atomics and Lockheed Martin may soon follow. It will be interesting to see how their proposals differ from this one, as well as DARPA’s own artist’s conception of a future LongShot drone. UPDATE 2/11/21: “The focus of Northrop Grumman’s DARPA LongShot contract is for vehicle design and operation employment concepts,” Jaime Engdahl, Program Director for Kinetic Weapons and Emerging Capabilities at Northrop Grumman, has told The War Zone in response to our queries. The company also directed any further questions about what missiles these drones might carry to DARPA. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway Drones"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 11, 2019",Special Operations Command Is Now Seeking A High-Speed VTOL Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New details have emerged of U.S. Special Operations Command’s interest in a new High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing, or HSVTOL, aircraft concept. Air Force Colonel Ken Kuebler, the command’s Program Executive Officer for Fixed Wing, confirmed that the command is looking at multiple options to meet this general requirement, which could ultimately lead to a replacement for the Air Force’s CV-22B Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, among others. “We’re really looking at the next generation of high-speed vertical takeoff and landing,” Colonel Kuebler told a media roundtable yesterday as part of the 2021 Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC). “I am interested in a lot of and even all of what industry has to offer.” The CV-22B Osprey is one platform that a future HSVTOL aircraft is likely to replace.  , U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Markus Maier “As you can imagine, making that capability into reality is technically hard, especially when we start talking about what might high speed be,” Kuebler added. “So, if industry has an idea, whether it’s from the engine to the platform itself, I would tell you, we’re interested in hearing about, learning about it, seeing what can be done.” Among the relevant concepts already being tracked by Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is a Bell HSVTOL design, Colonel Kuebler also confirmed. Last month , Bell received a $950,000 contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to research this concept, but few other details have been provided. As part of these emerging requirements, the U.S. Air Force, Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and the AFWERX technology incubator have also teamed up to explore the potential for HSVTOL aircraft. The aim of this AFWERX “ challenge ” is to gain ideas on new platforms that would combine high performance with helicopter-like characteristics and offer “optimal agility in austere environments ,” according to AFWERX. This organization was established to help foster innovation and accelerate the development and acquisition of novel technologies and uses these kinds of challenges to rapidly crowdsource proposals from business, academia, and the government and hopefully lead to innovations. Paralleling what Colonel Kuebler is looking for, the Air Force and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) are “seeking groundbreaking ideas that will further strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiency in contested, resource-constrained, and runway-independent settings,” said Reid Melville, Chief Innovation Officer, AFRL Transformational Capabilities Office, in regards to the AFWERX challenge. AFWERX says its near-term aim is to produce an HSVTOL “conceptual framework” that will assess the right balance of speed, range, survivability, payload, size, and flexibility for a potential aircraft platform. It’s a big ask, especially considering that the resulting aircraft would be expected to undertake a range of missions for both the Air Force and SOCOM. According to Colonel Kuebel, the AFWERX HSVTOL Concept Challenge is one component of SOCOM’s wider efforts in the field. “We are tracking several different items, whether it’s through DARPA, the labs [including AFRL], AFWERX, to look at a whole host of different technologies and different approaches. A lot of it’s focusing on the engine capability and being able to deliver both the vertical takeoff and then really how you transition that to high speed.” A slide from a briefing that Colonel Ken Kuebler, SOCOM’s Program Executive Officer for Fixed Wing, gave during the 2021 Special Operations Forces Industry Conference, which highlights HSVTOL as one of three important focus areas for his office., SOCOM For some time now, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is known to have be looking for a high-speed successor to its current CV-22B tiltrotor, which are used for extended-range infiltration, exfiltration and resupply missions for special operations forces (SOF). The Osprey can fly at a maximum of 280 knots. Last September, Lieutenant General James Slife, the current commander of AFSOC, told Flight Global that he anticipated the CV-22B replacement would likely be “a generation beyond current tiltrotor technology.” With the desire for a major advance in performance, the future platform would probably be very different in concept to the Osprey, he added. Most likely, it would also be quite different to the aircraft being developed under the Army’s Future Long Range Assault program, or FLRAA, which are not considerably faster than the CV-22B, and certainly far from the “jet speed” envisaged by Lieutenant General Slife. Air Force Colonel Timothy Hood, left, vice commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing, and Lieutenant General Slife, right, commander of Air Force Special Operations Command, escort Hayden Milberg, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, at Hurlburt Field, Florida., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Dennis Spain With the requirement for a CV-22 replacement in mind, it is not surprising that the “critical mission profiles” outlined by AFWERX are infiltration and exfiltration of SOF and equipment, personnel recovery, aeromedical evacuation, and tactical mobility. Reflecting these challenging demands, the submissions for HSVTOL have been broken down into Integrated Solutions (covering system concepts, design, and architecture) and Subsystem Solutions (including advanced propulsion and novel technologies). Interested participants have until June 22 to put forward their ideas, after which the most promising will be invited to a “Challenge Showcase” where ideas will be refined, and collaborations set in motion. Ultimately, this could lead to demonstrations, hardware prototyping and tests, and even potential production orders from the Department of Defense. With propulsion being the key factor behind the high-speed requirement, it’s possible that Bell may be looking at a more radical convertiplane concept, something that has cropped up in company patent applications. A Bell study for a new-generation convertiplane., USTPO (Trademark and Patent Office) While a tiltrotor like the Osprey is technically a convertiplane, using its rotors for lift in vertical takeoff and landing, before rotating them to operate as propellers for normal flight, it is speed-limited by using the same rotors for both phases. In the Bell study, however, the aircraft uses wingtip rotors for vertical lift and jet efflux from turbofans for forward flight, during which the rotors fold away to reduce drag. This doesn’t necessarily imply separate engines for the two flight modes, as Bell has also proposed a “convertible engine” that can switch between turboshaft and turbofan modes. Another propulsion option could involve some kind high-efficiency hybrid concept, like that used in AFRL’s Distributed Propulsion Concept Vehicle , which uses gas turbines to produce power for arrays of electric fans providing vertical lift. This kind of arrangement should improve redundancy performance and fuel economy, but it’s unclear if it would necessarily be compatible with the demands of both VTOL and high-speed flight. AFRL’s Distributed Propulsion Concept Vehicle., COURTESY GUY NORRIS Other advanced convertiplane concepts have been studied as part of a series of shadowy Pentagon programs dating back to the early 1980s and looking at the potential for stealthy special operations transport aircraft. This is something you can read more about in our two-part in-depth feature series linked here . A decade ago, for example, the Air Force was working on the Speed Agile Concept Demonstrator (SACD) concept, for a four-engine, multi-mission aircraft offering high speed and the ability to operate from short, improvised airfields. While a short takeoff and landing (STOL) as opposed to a VTOP design, it addressed many of the same issues and also incorporated a hybrid powered lift system. A Speed Agile wind-tunnel test model., U.S. Air Force Meanwhile, the Lockheed Martin Vertical Takeoff and Landing VTOL Advanced Reconnaissance Insertion Organic Unmanned System (VARIOUS) concept differs from HSVTOL in that it was unmanned and intended to fulfill a different mission set, but it does represent the kind of work being undertaken in this area in recent years. Concept art for Lockheed Martin’s VARIOUS unmanned aircraft., Lockheed Martin Then there is DARPA’s VTOL X-Plane , another program seeking to exploit the advantages of fixed-wing and rotary-wing concepts, albeit with a planned top sustained flight speed of 300-400 knots. That same program yielded the XV-24A LightningStrike , another unmanned VTOL concept developed for DARPA by Aurora Flight Sciences, now part of Boeing, together with Rolls-Royce and Honeywell, before being canceled. Boeing also got involved in the VTOL X-Plane studies, offering its Phantom Swift design that featured two large fans buried in the fuselage for vertical lift and a pair of swiveling wingtip fans for stability and control during hover and for propulsion during forward flight. Suffice to say, there are plenty of previous concepts, convertiplane or otherwise, that could help inform the current HSVTOL initiative. However this might be achieved, the need for a HSVTOL platform, in general, aligns with the Pentagon’s increasing interest in not only moving its forces considerable distances around the Asia-Pacific region in any potential military campaign against China, but also being able to do this rapidly and without guaranteed access to traditional airfields and infrastructure. The promise of jet-like speeds and the ability to operate more like a conventional fixed-wing plane would be a major development for the U.S. military in this theater, especially. While the U.S. Marines Corps already fly transpacific flights involving MV-22B Ospreys , the infrastructure and resources involved are significant . Realizing these ambitions will still be difficult, however, and significant challenges remain ahead if the U.S. military is going to benefit in the future from the huge potential offered by a high-speed, vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Still, if anyone could actually get something like this made, it would be SOCOM.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 7, 2021",Amphibious MC-130J Transport Is On Special Operations Command’s Wishlist,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military is once again looking at the potential of an amphibious C-130 Hercules variant to operate from littoral areas in support of special operations forces . The project, which in its early stages, has yielded an artist’s concept of an MC-130J Commando II multi-mission combat transport fitted with large underslung floats mounted on the fuselage. The MC-130J is the latest Air Force special operations version of the Hercules, intended to penetrate into denied areas to insert, extract, or resupply special operations forces, as well as refuel helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft. The new effort, known as the MC-130J Amphibious Capability, or MAC, came to light today in a briefing given by U.S. Air Force Colonel Ken Kuebler, U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Program Executive Officer for Fixed Wing (PEO-FW), at the annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC). At a media roundtable later in the day, Kuebler added that feasibility and operational studies regarding the project are going on now and that the command is working with unspecified “innovative partners” to hopefully prove out a lot of the concept using digital design tools. This, in turn, could help speed up the research and development and help keep costs low. A U.S. Air Force MC-130J Commando II conducts an inflight refueling mission off the coast of Okinawa, Japan., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman John Linzmeier A slide from Colonel Kuebler’s briefing that mentions the MAC concept as one of a number of “focus areas” for SOCOM PEO-FW., SOCOM It’s important to note that, while the concept art in Kuebler’s briefing, seen at the top of this article, shows huge floats added to an MC-130J, he stressed that the MAC concept is looking for an amphibian aircraft able to operate from the land, as well as bodies of water. A basic floatplane would not be able to operate from land, but adding wheels to the floats could give it this capability. There are other possibilities , as well, for how the aircraft could be made truly amphibious. The basic idea of a waterborne C-130 has been around for decades and it is a concept that certain parts of the Pentagon have mulled in the past . In fact, the aircraft’s original manufacturer, Lockheed, pitched a fully amphibious Hercules with a boat-like hull back in the 1960s, without success, though the U.S. Navy did at least undertake studies using a radio-controlled scale-model version. Lockheed has since evolved in Lockheed Martin, which is the current manufacturer of the C-130J family, including the MC-130J. A model of a C-130 with a boat hull as well as wheeled landing gear., Lockheed An artist’s conception of a boat-hulled Hercules., Lockheed The possibility of fitting a C-130J variant with pontoon-like floats attached to the fuselage, as seen in the PEO-FW concert art, is not new, either. Lockheed Martin proposed just a version of the aircraft in the late 1990s, reportedly after receiving interest from the U.S. Navy as a way to insert and extract SEAL teams, and their specialized watercraft , in littoral areas. Older Lockheed Martin artwork depicting a C-130J floatplane., Lockheed Martin Of course, strapping big floats to a Hercules would impose severe drag and weight penalties, reducing range and load-carrying capabilities, although it is not unheard of for seriously large aircraft to operate on floats. However, with the amphibious requirement in mind, it may be the case that the concept art is a simple reuse of older floatplane artwork, and not necessarily exactly what SOCOM now has in mind for its seagoing Hercules. While a boat-like hull would not have such an adverse effect on performance, it would require more significant redesign and it’s not something that Lockheed Martin has been known to be working on of late. Another artist’s conception of a Hercules floatplane., Lockheed Martin Regardless of the exact configuration, an amphibious MC-130J could offer new and novel capabilities for the U.S. special operations community, particularly as part of future expeditionary and distributed operations. The U.S. military, as a whole, has been exploring concepts of operations in recent years that focus heavily on being able to operate from austere and remote areas with very limited infrastructure in the event that large, established bases are destroyed or are otherwise unavailable. Air Force MC-130J crews already train to operate in exactly these kinds of environments and there have been many efforts in the past to expand the ability of the Commando II, as well as the older MC-130H Combat Talon II , to operate from very confined areas with little or no infrastructure. You can read more about these initiatives in this past War Zone feature . At the same time, the U.S special operations community at large is currently in a process of examining how it could contribute to higher-end conflicts , including against near-peer adversaries, such as China or Russia, and especially in the broad expanses of the Asia-Pacific region . This includes operating from small islands in the Asia-Pacific region, where there might not even be sufficient space on certain tiny islands to establish a proper airstrip quickly. An amphibious aircraft could be the perfect solution, especially in times of conflict, when existing airfield infrastructure might be placed under considerable threat, if not destroyed in a first wave of attacks. During the media roundtable, Colonel Kuebler said that potential conflicts with “peer and near-peer” opponents and other “emerging threats” were some of the drivers that had prompted the MAC project. He also acknowledged that the aircraft could be particularly valuable in the Pacific, but also pointed out that it would be able to operate from anywhere there is water. An amphibious C-130 could potentially perform a wider array of missions beyond those of the standard MC-130J, as well, and Kuebler said he “would not make that assumption” when asked if the MAC aircraft would have the exact same mission set as the Commando II. If a waterborne Hercules finally comes to fruition, various elements of the U.S. military, beyond just the special operations community, could very well be interested in acquiring them. A 2016 U.S. Marine Corps ‘toolkit’ of existing and notional capabilities for use in developing tabletop wargames includes a section on seaplanes, with a clear emphasis on operations in the Pacific. A slide from that document, seen below, provides data on a float-equipped Cessna 208 Caravan , the Bombardier (now Viking Air) CL-415MP amphibian , and the Japanese US-2 amphibian , as well as their respective ranges operating from Manila in the Philippines. U.S. Marine Corps “Seaplanes are a proven, cost-effective operational capability that can provide lines of communication to remotely dispersed EAB sites that lack port or airfield infrastructure,” the document read. EAB refers to Expeditionary Advance Base Operations, a broad concept for executing expeditionary and distributed operations the Marine Corps has been developing, which you can read more about here . The inclusion of the US-2, presently only in service with the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, and primarily used for search and rescue, underscores both the relevance of such aircraft in the Pacific and other missions they can perform, including in non-combat disaster relief and humanitarian assistance roles. China is also busily working on a much larger amphibian of its own, the AG600 , which is widely expected to have a significant military, or at least paramilitary, role, especially in support of man-made islands and other infrastructure in the hotly contested South China Sea . With all this in mind, beyond the Navy and Marine Corps, the U.S. Coast Guard could be another service that might be interested in an amphibious Hercules. It is a C-130 operator and a waterborne version could operate as a long-range search and rescue aircraft, allowing survivors to be picked up directly from the sea, thousands of miles from the shore, providing the weather and sea conditions permitted it. It’s also worth remembering that the Coast Guard operated HU-16 Albatross amphibian aircraft into the 1980s. A seaplane variant of the Hercules could also lend itself to the kinds of aerial firefighting missions that are now undertaken by Air National Guard C-130s with the Modular Airborne Firefighting System, or MAFFS . While it remains to be seen how the MAC effort will progress, and what specific kinds of roles a potential MC-130J amphibian might take on, Kuebler made clear that he felt there was “enough command interest” to be hopeful that this long-discussed concept will finally become a reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 6, 2020",Mysterious Secluded Facility With Large Hangar Emerges At Chinese Bomber Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the past few years, satellite imagery has shown a unique hangar and support facility emerging at a Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force bomber base in the eastern part of the country. This self-contained installation, which is detached from the main base and sits inside its own high-security perimeter, appeared ahead of reports that one of the units at this base, the 30th Air Regiment, appeared to be operating the WZ-8 , a large high-speed and high-flying rocket-powered spy drone designed to be launched in mid-air from the H-6N missile carrier aircraft . The construction has also come amid persistent rumors about the imminent public debut of China’s H-20 stealth bomber . Imagery that The War Zone obtained and otherwise reviewed from Planet Labs , as well as Google Earth, shows that work on this secluded addition to Luhe-Ma’an Air Base, which is situated less than 30 miles to the north of the city of Nanjing, the capital of China’s eastern Jiangsu province, began around 2017. The new hangar is around 265 feet long and 245 feet wide, as well as being quite tall, as is evident from the three rows of large windows visible on the side facing away from the apron.

There are outlines of what could be spots for additional planned hangars adjacent to the apron, as well. A satellite image of the detached extension at Luhe-Ma’an showing what appears to be an engine run-up area at the top left corner of the apron, as well as outlined areas that might eventually be the site of additional hangars., Google Earth There are also a number of other buildings, which could be administrative offices or dormitories, or more likely a mix of both, within the perimeter of this separated site. In addition, the perimeter itself appears to be fortified, with two layers of fencing all around, guard towers and lights along the northern edge, and gates on the taxiway just short of the apron and at the other end that leads to Luhe-Ma’an’s main runway. The taxiway itself, which at one point passes over a road, is approximately 3,500 feet long and 80 feet wide. Another satellite image of the detached extension at Luhe-Ma’an as of April 29, 2021.

However, it is not clear if these facilities are at all associated with Luhe-Ma’an. There do not appear to be any direct connections between this other site and any part of the base. The extension to the air base had been built on what previously appeared to be farmland and much of the surrounding area still looks to be filled with agricultural enterprises.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The exact purpose of this detached addition to Luhe-Ma’an is unclear and none of the satellite imagery that The War Zone reviewed appeared to show aircraft of any kind on the apron in front of the hangar. The adjacent base, as a whole, is relatively new, with the construction of the main portion only beginning in 2012 and being completed sometime between 2015 and 2016. Today, it is reportedly home to the 29th and 30th Air Regiments of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), both assigned to the 10th Bomber Division, part of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Eastern Theater Command. The primary aircraft based at Luhe-Ma’an are variants of the H-6 bomber, itself derived from the Soviet Tu-16 Badger , including the H-6H, H-6J, and H-6M missile carrier versions . Ok, here the summary… According to this report, the PLAAF's 10th Bomber Division got also the latest H-6J replacing either the older H-6H within the 29th or the H-6M within the 30th Air Regiment at Luhe/Ma'an division subordinated to the Eastern Theater Command. pic.twitter.com/SCdDy5FGVk — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) February 26, 2021 There are somewhat similar extensions at some other PLAAF bomber bases, notably at Anqing in Anhui Province, some 160 miles southwest of Luhe-Ma’an, which hosts additional elements of the 10th Bomber Division. Some of these also include larger hangars, but none of them have the same level of associated infrastructure and security measures, or as are secluded and highly developed, as the one seen at Luhe-Ma’an. A satellite image from 2019 of the PLAAF’s Anqing Air Base showing a somewhat similar extension at the southern end of that base., Google Earth A closer-in view of the extension at Anqing, which does have a large pass-through hangar, but otherwise has a very different in its overall configuration to the one at Luhe-Ma’an., Google Earth All told, it seems hard to believe that the facilities at Luhe-Ma’an are simply an expansion of the base’s infrastructure given the distance from the main portion, the additional security perimeter, and the unique set of self-contained facilities there. Typically, these kinds of features point to areas of military bases where uniquely sensitive activities occur. It is certainly interesting to note that pictures of WZ-8 drones with serial indicating that they were assigned to the 30th Air Regiment emerged in September 2019 , just months after the connecting taxiway was ostensibly completed. This was also when this unmanned aircraft had first emerged publicly, during preparations for a massive military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. There were also rumors at the time that these drones had been in service since as early as June 2018, shortly before the large hangar at Luhe-Ma’an was finished. Rumoured to have entered service in June 2018, it seems as if this serial number '21311' confirms the WZ-8 being operational within the 10th Bomber Division, a H-6M bomber unit in eastern China facing Taiwan and Japan.

Now, here are 21311 & 21312 from the 10. Bomber Division. (Image via Hitong's CMA-Blog) pic.twitter.com/IbJdk0XBhS — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) December 11, 2019 Various features of the WZ-8, especially a pair of large suspension lugs on top of the fuselage, strongly indicated that it was designed to be launched in mid-air from specialized H-6N aircraft. You can read more about the WZ-8 and the H-6N, the latter of which is also capable of carrying out outsized payloads, including large missiles, here and here , respectively. There have also been reports that a number of older H-6M aircraft may now also be configured to launch these drones. Some sources refer to these modified jets as H-6MWs. While no longer secret, both the WZ-8 and the H-6N still appear to be sensitive platforms within the PLAAF, which could demand more specialized facilities, such as the ones at Luhe-Ma’an. The rocket-powered drones have only been seen at a remote test base in the Gobi Desert, so this could indicate that the PLAAF is working to establish more of a true operational capability with these unmanned aircraft, or at least move them further out of the developmental phase, if it hasn’t already. From Luhe-Ma’an, which is less than 200 miles west of China’s Yellow and East China Sea coastlines, as well as around 600 miles north of Taiwan, H-6Ns, as well as H-6Ms, carrying WZ-8s would have ready access to multiple areas of strategic significance in the western Pacific region. Just in April, a dozen H-6s assigned to the 10th Bomber Division, including at least one H-6MW, took part in an exercise off China’s eastern coast.

To date, there has only been one official rendering of any kind of this aircraft, which has long been reported to be a flying wing-type design very roughly analogous to the U.S. Air Force’s B-2 . The parking/runup area on the apron at the facility in question is roughly the same dimensions as the B-2. There have been persistent rumors in recent years that the H-20 may be about to emerge publicly, none of which have so far proven to be true. In October 2018, however, an official picture from a morale-boosting gala hosted by an unspecified Eastern Theater Command bomber unit did show a logo featuring the silhouette of what appeared to be a tailless, flying wing-type aircraft. An official photograph from gala that an unspecified Eastern Theater Command bomber unit held in 2018 that shows a logo with the silhouette of a flying wing aircraft., PLAAF At that time, Andreas Rupprecht, a Chinese military aerospace expert and friend of The War Zone who tweets as @RupprechtDeino , dismissed speculation that the H-20 was about to make its public debut in the comments on this very website. At that same time, he also wrote that “I stick to my analysis I made for Jamestown, this [the official reveal of the H-20] could be within 2-3 years.” The H-20 is certainly the kind of asset that would require facilities with additional security, but that would also benefit from being able to fly, even just for test and evaluation purposes, from an established bomber base. A large hangar would be particularly useful to shield these aircraft from both prying eyes and the elements. The materials and coatings typically used in the skin on stealthy aircraft are notoriously sensitive to weather and other environmental factors. Even if the H-20 is still months or even years from starting a more public test and evaluation phase, or even entering service, it would make sense to have specialized facilities already established to support those aircraft when they do arrive. We have seen similar infrastructure developments at Edwards Air Force Base in California ahead of the arrival there of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber, which is presently expected to make its public debut next year. Another possibility might be that this satellite extension at Luhe-Ma’an is related, in some way, to the restoration of the PLAAF’s strategic nuclear mission, which formally occurred in 2017, according to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). “In October 2019, China signaled the return of the airborne leg of its nuclear triad after the PLAAF publicly revealed the H-6N as its first nuclear-capable air-to-air refuelable bomber,” an annual Pentagon report on Chinese military developments sent to Congress in 2020 added. At the same time, at least in its present configuration, this satellite extension appears to lack the kind of specialized weapon storage facilities typically associated with bases that host nuclear weapons . Of course, these are just a few possibilities as to what the PLAAF might be using this hangar and its adjacent facilities for. Its purpose could be completely unrelated to either the WZ-8, the H-20, or nuclear weapons. Regardless, the large hangar at Luhe-Ma’an, and the other associated infrastructure hidden away within its security perimeter, underscore the presence of some significant and sensitive activity going on at the base. With core elements of this detached extension to the base now looking largely finished, new hints about exactly how the PLAAF may begin to emerge.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some truly impressive photos have emerged documenting recent joint exercises in the North Atlantic involving the British Royal Navy and U.S. Navy, as well as forces from the U.S. Marine Corps. As seen in the image at the top of this story, warships, aircraft, and Landing Craft Air Cushions , or LCACs, deployed from the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group, or IWOARG, teamed up with the Royal Navy’s flagship, the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , as well as vessels from other navies. Also involved in these maritime drills, which were dubbed Exercise Ragnar Viking, were vessels from the French Navy and the Royal Norwegian Navy — an NH90 naval helicopter from one of those forces is also visible in the image above. The centerpieces of the maneuvers, however, were HMS Queen Elizabeth , which is working up for its first operational deployment within Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21), and the U.S. Navy’s Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima . That amphibious assault ship is the flagship of the IWOARG, which also includes other elements of Amphibious Squadron 4, the Harpers Ferry class dock landing ship USS Carter Hall and the amphibious transport dock ship USS San Antonio , as well as the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). Participants in Exercise Ragnar Viking underway in the Atlantic Ocean in formation during a photo exercise, May 17, 2021., U.S. Navy/Lt. Anton Ekman The Royal Navy assets for CSG21, meanwhile, are HMS Queen Elizabeth , the Type 45 destroyers HMS Diamond and HMS Defender , the Type 23 frigates HMS Kent and HMS Richmond , the replenishment tanker RFA Tidespring , the stores ship and fleet tanker RFA Fort Victoria , and an undisclosed Royal Navy Astute class nuclear attack submarine. Other warships involved in Ragnar Viking, some of which are seen in the accompanying photos, included the Virginia class attack submarine USS New Mexico , the Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyers USS Arleigh Burke and USS Ross , the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigate HMS Lancaster and the amphibious transport dock HMS Albion , the French Navy’s frigate Normandie , and the Royal Norwegian Navy’s frigate HNoMS Otto Sverdrup and corvette HNoMS Skjold . Embarked aircraft on HMS Queen Elizabeth and attached to other Royal Navy vessels included F-35B stealth fighters from both the Royal Air Force’s No 617 Squadron , the “Dambusters,” and from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211, the “ Wake Island Avengers ,” Wildcat HMA2 multirole helicopters from 815 Naval Air Squadron (NAS), anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning and control Merlin HM2 helicopters from 820 NAS, and Commando Merlin helicopters from 845 NAS. For its part, the IWOARG provided aircraft from Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 162 Reinforced, the aviation combat element of 24th MEU. A typical aviation combat element of this type normally includes 10 MV-22B Osprey tiltrotors, six AV-8B Harrier II attack jets, five RQ-21A Blackjack unmanned aerial vehicles, four CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters, four AH-1Z Cobra helicopters, and three or four UH-1Y Huey helicopters. Also attached is a pair of U.S. Navy MH-60S Seahawk helicopters, in this case from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 26, the “Chargers,” on hand to provide search and rescue and additional utility capabilities.

Anton Ekman An LCAC races through the North Atlantic alongside HMS Queen Elizabeth. , U.S. Navy/Lt. Anton Ekman The involvement of both F-35Bs and AV-8Bs in the maneuvers is notable, with the former rapidly replacing the iconic jump jet on the decks of U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships. Manwhile, integration of Marine Corps F-35Bs aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth is now well established and, as we have examined in the past , the American jets are likely to be a regular part of the air wings of the two British carriers for the foreseeable future. As well as boosting the British Joint Strike Fighter force , and lending valuable combat experience , the presence of Marine Corps F-35Bs on Royal Navy carrier decks should also mean that Marine Amphibious Ready Group working with them in the future could have a higher degree of interchangeability. There is also potential for British F-35s cross-decking — operating temporarily from the decks of U.S. Navy assault ships. Furthermore, with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps having been experimenting with employing Wasp class ships as ‘Lightning carriers,’ there is the potential for American and British flattops to work together to bring a more considerable number of F-35Bs to bear. The Queen Elizabeth class can potentially carry as many as 36 F-35Bs, although 24 Lightnings are described a “credible complement” for the Carrier Strike role. Meanwhile, the Marine Corps has said it wants to be able to deploy between 16-20 F-35Bs on each assault ship.

Mark Nash CSG21 came into these maneuvers as part of the Royal Navy’s own Exercise Strike Warrior in the North Atlantic, a separate effort involving 15 ships from four NATO countries. The two-week Exercise Strike Warrior, running from May 8-20, is bringing together more than 20 warships, three submarines, and 84 aircraft from 11 nations and is intended as a final test for CSG21 before it heads off on its first operational deployment to the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the Asia-Pacific region. By introducing Ragnar Viking to Exercise Strike Warrior, the aim was to prove that NATO forces can run both Carrier Strike Group and Amphibious Ready Group/Marine Expeditionary Unit activities simultaneously. “HMS Queen Elizabeth and the USS Iwo Jima represent a substantial concentration of maritime-based airpower,” said Royal Navy Captain Angus Essenhigh, commanding officer of HMS Queen Elizabeth . “With the involvement of warships from four NATO members, including HMS Albion , our rendezvous in the North Atlantic demonstrates the collective strength of the alliance.” The Super Stallion is guided onto the flight deck., U.S. Navy/Lt. Mark Nash The amphibious transport dock ship USS San Antonio ., U.S. Navy/Lt. Mark Nash An AV-8B takes off from USS Iwo Jima ., U.S. Navy/Lt. Mark Nash Without a doubt, Ragnar Viking provided valuable training opportunities for the participants, especially for HMS Queen Elizabeth and its supporting CSG21 vessels, and their aircraft, which have not been to sea together in such significant numbers. “The fact that the Royal Navy is able to deploy a Littoral Response Group and a Carrier Strike Group simultaneously is also significant,” Captain Essenhigh added. “Very few other navies can do this, and it underscores the United Kingdom’s substantial and enduring commitment to the security of Europe and the North Atlantic.” That last point is of particular relevance at a time in which Russian Navy activities in the North Atlantic are on the increase , especially in regard to long-duration, deeply submerged operations by its increasingly sophisticated submarine force. The aerial component for the photo exercise overflies one of the Arleigh Burke class destroyers., U.S. Navy/Lt. Mark Nash The Harrier IIs return to the deck of the Iwo Jima ., U.S. Navy/Lt. Mark Nash According to the U.S. Navy, Ragnar Viking was intended to showcase “high-end NATO cohesion, solidarity, and credibility in the Norwegian, North, and Baltic Seas.” Specific elements of the drills included a demonstration of long-range strike capabilities from the North Atlantic into Lithuania, amphibious landings in Norway, plus anti-submarine warfare and surface action group operations in the North Atlantic. All those scenarios would seem to be clearly predicated on potential Russian military activity in the wider region, with the Baltic States (including Lithuania) and Norway, which shares a long border with Russia, identified as critical flashpoints of any future possible confrontation between Moscow and NATO. As such, the North Atlantic is also a critical springboard into the Arctic region, the strategic importance of which continues to grow. It is notable, too, that the submarine USS New Mexico , before it joined Ragnar Viking, had made a rare and high-profile port visit to Tromsø in northern Norway, an event described as a signal of deepening U.S. security cooperation with Norway in the Arctic region. A Harrier jump jet kicks up spray from the deck before touching down., U.S. Navy/Lt. Mark Nash Finally, while the focus of CSG21 has been on the Carrier Strike role, the British carriers are also intended to operate in amphibious warfare scenarios as well, and also with scalable air groups that can cover both those missions, if required. An amphibious assault capability is especially important in the Baltic and North Atlantic, where the Royal Navy would be expected to operate alongside NATO allies, including U.S. Navy assault ships, as in Ragnar Viking, should Russia make a move, for example, on one of the Baltic states or Norway. Increasingly, too, the Arctic is being viewed as a potential theatre for amphibious operations, a fact that both the United States and Russia have noted. Although the Royal Navy is expecting new warships as part of a modernization drive, it is still clear that most large-scale operations would likely require significant support from NATO, and from the U.S. Navy, and Marine Corps F-35Bs, in particular. With that in mind, Ragnar Viking is likely a pointer to how the British carriers will be expected to operate in the future, whether in wartime or peacetime sceanrios. There will surely be more photo opportunities once CSG21 begins in earnest later this month — including potential first combat missions over the Middle East. In the meantime, these images provide a dramatic demonstration of NATO cooperation in the alliance’s traditional backyard. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 1, 2021",The First Privately Owned F-16 Aggressor Jet Has Taken To The Sky,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up to our big piece on Top Aces’ recently acquired fleet of second-hand F-16A/B ‘Netz’ fighters from Israel, the company has now taken one of these jets aloft for the first time. This also marks the first time a 4th generation fighter of any kind has been flown by a private adversary support firm. The maiden flight originated from Top Aces’ newly minted F-16 Center Of Excellence at Mesa Gateway Airport in Arizona. This is where the aggressor firm, which has its main headquarters in Canada, became a truly global operation and is now making a home for its budding F-16 operations. Ultimately, its fleet of Vipers is set to swell to 29 jets. Kyler Noe The flight of F-16A 78-0322, which had “Billy Bob” at the controls, lasted roughly an hour and saw the aircraft venture to the west of its home base for a number of checks, before safely returning to Mesa Gateway Airport. The aircraft itself is historic. It took part in Israel’s famous attack on Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981 and is also a MiG killer. You can read more about the jet’s history in this past piece of ours on Top Ace’s second-hand jets and their unique exploits. ADSBexchange.com Top Aces plans to use its private 4th generation fighter fleet to support the Pentagon’s growing demand for adversary air support, acting as advanced aggressors for Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps flight crews. Currently, adversary service providers largely use 3rd generation fighters , some of which are deeply upgraded , to mimic more advanced threats at a cheaper cost than using actual 4th generation fighters. It will be interesting to see Top Aces make its business case for more complex, and potentially far more expensive, private adversary capabilities. Although, the Air Force, in particular, has taken a methodical approach and upgrading the complexity of these services, so adding F-16s to the mix would seem to be a logical next step, at least conceptually speaking. Fiscally speaking, that could be another story. Kyler Noe For more information on Top Aces’ F-16 fleet, make sure to check out our special feature on the topic here . Beyond that, it looks like they threw a GoPro in the cockpit, so we may get some great video from the company of this historic first flight in the not-to-distant future.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Nov 25, 2016",Watch This Lynx Helicopter Land On A Crazy Mock Pitching Flight Deck,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Putting a naval helicopter down safely onto the flight deck of a small warship, pitching and rolling , and at the mercy of atrocious weather, is certainly one of the more exacting skills required of military aircrew. This video shows a British-made Westland Lynx tackling a wildly gyrating flight deck mockup in a unique test scenario — and one that tells us a lot about the special capabilities of this diminutive maritime helicopter. The footage almost certainly dates from the period after the first flight of the WG.13 prototype in March 1971 and before the initial-production Lynx HAS2 model entered service with the British Royal Navy in September 1976. In fact, the helicopter that we can see testing out the type’s deck-landing attributes could well be the first of the navalized prototypes, serial number XX469, which ended up being lost in an accident in November 1972. The three windows in the side door are certainly typical of the prototype batch. Rear-view of the Lynx clinging onto the dummy deck., TWITTER SCREENCAP As for the location, that’s unclear, but it is likely the Westland (now Leonardo Helicopters) plant at Yeovil, in Somerset, southwest England. Details are also hard to find on the elaborate rig that was set up to replicate a deck, complete with actual pitch and yaw, and with its own wheeled undercarriage. However, it seems conceivable that the test rig was only ever employed as part of the Lynx test program. As the video’s narrator explains, the naval Lynx incorporated a raft of features that made it ideal for small-deck operations. Instead of the landing skids found on the land-based variant, the helicopter had a tricycle undercarriage. The rotor system provided the pilot with rapid response to control inputs and plenty of control power, allowing the helicopter to be positioned exactly over the landing spot on the deck and then ensuring an accurate touchdown. Once touched down, the pilot alighted the helicopter onto a grid on the appropriately equipped flight deck, before the Lynx’s ‘harpoon’ deck-lock system came into play. The grid, approximately six feet in diameter, and made of steel, featured roughly 2-inch diameter holes all over it. The pilot selected a switch on the collective, which extended the harpoon hydraulically from below the helicopter’s belly and into the deck grid. Once it had made contact, the end of the harpoon opened out like a claw and grabbed onto the metal grid. Then the hydraulic ram reversed direction and pulled the Lynx securely down, effectively clamping it to the deck. Thanks to the fully castored undercarriage legs, the helicopter could even rotate 360 degrees, as seen in the video, while still held securely to the deck. This was achieved by the pilot using the tail rotor to swing the aircraft left or right. Westland Lynx XX469 is likely the aircraft that was used in the trials., San Diego Air & Space Museum Another useful feature allowed the pilot to select ‘sub-min collective pitch,’ a highly negative collective pitch that would force the aircraft onto the deck if the weather and pitch/roll of the deck were really bad. This wasn’t suitable for regular use as it put excessive stress on the rotor head. It could, however, be a lifesaver if the pilot missed the grid and the Lynx was at risk of rolling off the deck entirely. When it was time for takeoff, the pilot selected the same switch on the collective to disengage the harpoon before completing a standard departure. Thanks to the castoring undercarriage arrangement, the helicopter could also be rotated into the wind for takeoff, rather than having to have the ship change course.

The grid for the harpoon deck-lock is visible directly below the helicopter. , U.S. Navy/Photographer’s Mate 2nd Class Peter J. Carney Time and again, the Lynx’s harpoon system proved its worth, especially for the Cold War Royal Navy that operated small-deck warships in the rough seas of the North Atlantic and the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) Gap. When committed to action in the Falklands War in 1982, the Lynx again proved highly dependable , successfully engaging Argentine ships and submarines with anti-ship missiles and delivering troops and supplies. According to some accounts , when HMS Coventry was sunk, a Lynx remained firmly attached to the flight deck even after the warship had fully capsized. A Royal Danish Air Force Lynx landing on the deck in rough seas: https://youtube.com/watch?v=NJIZTL2ZyEw In Royal Navy hands, the last of the Lynx fleet was retired in 2017, but the type survives with several operators, some of which continue to upgrade the type for continued service. The Lynx’s successor in the Royal Navy is the much-improved Wildcat , which retains much of the DNA of the original. That includes the harpoon deck-lock, which ensures that successive generations of naval aviators can be confident in recovering on warship decks even in the most challenging environments.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Apr 14, 2021",How The Air Force Fires Live Missiles To Make Sure Pilots And Weapons Function In Actual Combat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “Fox 3!” a pilot exclaims as a radar-guided missile streaks off the wing of a fighter jet. In seconds the weapon is traveling at supersonic speed, hurtling to deliver a lethal blow to its intended target. However, this isn’t actual real-world combat, this is training for a fledgling aviator gaining vital experience, or testing a new piece of equipment or software, ensuring an air-to-air missile will work exactly as planned not during a canned training event, but in the heat of combat. The world of advanced air-to-air combat is a notoriously complex affair. The missile technology that underpins it, from short-range heat-seeking AIM-9 Sidewinders to long-range, radar-guided, AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs), represents the tip of the aerial combat spear. Harnessing that edge is a critical part of maintaining air supremacy, and it’s something the U.S. military takes very seriously. An F-15E of the 40th Flight Test Squadron fires an AIM-120 AMRAAM., USAF/SSgt John McRell Therefore, the end-to-end testing of the entire system, from pulling a weapon from its transportation container, loading it on the aircraft, flying it, engaging a target, and ultimately firing the weapon, making sure it is guiding to the target, and ultimately destroying its victim, is important in many ways. It proves the system works, plus it gives new aviators experience of the rush of using live weapons in a far better situation than the heat of combat. The world of WSEP The U.S. Air Force has recently transformed its premier live-fire weapons events as part of an effort to better combine cutting-edge squadron training with the latest operational testing. These types of mass live-fire drills started out as the famous William Tell missile-firing exercises that commenced in the 1950s, which saw rows of Century Series fighters congregating at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. Today’s Weapons System Evaluation Program , or WSEP, is still staged primarily out of the same Florida airbase, and it has cemented its position as the premier event for live-fire weapons employment for combat aviators across the U.S. military. WSEP was established as a feedback mechanism to improve upon identified deficiencies in the Department of Defense’s air-to-air combat enterprise. It also serves to build confidence for young aviators by providing the experience of actually employing air-to-air weapons — imparting a better understanding of what their weapons are capable of, as well as learning first hand about a weapon’s behavior and performance. “I’ve seen several young pilots assess their shots as “guiding” towards the target, when in reality — as a chase pilot — I watched their missile leave their aircraft and not guide towards the target at all,” Lieutenant Colonel Orion “Rhino” Vail, commander of Tyndall’s 83rd Fighter Weapons Squadron (FWS), told The War Zone in an exclusive interview. “These are fantastic learning opportunities for young pilots in the debrief, now that they have seen what the missile was not supposed to do, they will be better prepared to recognize that and take a follow-up shot if they see something like that in actual combat.” The WSEP mission “Our mission is to conduct air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons evaluation for Combat Air Force [CAF] fleet aircrews, platforms, and weapons. We prioritize the first-time shooter experience and evaluation of aircrews, while also integrating with the operational test community to inform strategic weapons decisions,” says Vail, an F-22 Raptor pilot and Weapons School graduate, whose squadron is now mandated with overseeing WSEP East at Tyndall . In the past, the USAF ran separate Combat Archer air-to-air and Combat Hammer air-to-ground WSEPs. Now, these have been incorporated into WSEP East, which is overseen by Vail’s squadron, and WSEP West at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, overseen by sister unit the 86th FWS. Both locations can include a mix of these mission sets, but with a bias toward air-to-air at Tyndall and air-to-ground at Hill. An F-15E drops a GBU-31 JDAM on the Utah Test and Training Range., Jamie Hunter “CAF Plan 53 is the new guidance that came out in May 2020. This supersedes and replaces COMACC [Commander Air Combat Command] Plan 85, which was the Combat Archer guidance, and Plan 90 which related to Combat Hammer. This has resulted in the shift to the WSEP East and WSEP West construct,” explains Vail. CAF Plan 53 has brought about a dramatic change from the traditionally separate Archer and Hammer events, with as many as 10 WSEPs per year now held at each location as dynamic, integrated events that include live air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons employment, as well as aerial gunnery. The Tyndall event is run over the nearby Gulf of Mexico range complex, with the Hill WSEP making use of the expansive Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR). Both of these now include close cooperation with the 53rd Wing , the USAF’s primary Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) organization. “There wasn’t a lot of crossing of the lines with regard to the operational test and the evaluation piece,” Vail adds, “[But] we now act more as the “E” in OT&E, as part of the fantastic vision from the USAF Warfare Center about accelerating the ability to field weapons systems faster.” An F-35A fires an AIM-120 at a QF-16 target during a live-fire test over the Gulf of Mexico., USAF/MSgt Michael Jackson Pushing ahead Illustrating the new mandate, between March 8-19, 2021, the 53rd Wing’s Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG) hosted simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground WSEPs at Tyndall and Hill. The Florida base hosted F-16C/Ds from Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, along with F/A-18E/F Super Hornets from the U.S. Navy and F/A-18 “legacy” Hornets and F-35B Lightning IIs from the Marine Corps. F-22A Raptors and F-15C Eagles from the 422nd TES and 433rd Weapons Squadron (WPS) also participated in WSEP East to accomplish operational test and Weapons School objectives. The March event included some notable weapons evaluations including an extremely long-range AIM-120 AMRAAM shot from an F-15C Eagle and the first-ever employment of the F-35B gun pod in aerial gunnery, both of which took place over the Gulf of Mexico. You can read more about the F-15’s unprecedented AMRAAM shot here . Meanwhile, WSEP West at Hill included air-to-ground work with the first live operational test drop of a GBU-53/B Stormbreaker Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) II from an F-15E Strike Eagle during the exercise. “We dropped six total SDB IIs against both moving and static targets ,” said Major Derek Anderson, F-15E pilot, and director of operations at the 706th Fighter Squadron. “The SDB II performed as expected and on target using the normal mode and net-enabled features.” The GBU-53/B incorporates advanced smart weapon logic and networking, allowing the weapon to be re-targeted in flight and also provide status feedback to those on the network. At Hill, the 86th FWS also hosted A-10s, B-52Hs, and MQ-9s which dropped munitions to train and evaluate air-to-ground weapons employment. An F-15E from the 422nd TES carrying a GBU-53/B Stormbreaker weapon., USAF WSEP East included F-16 instructor pilots and 16 first-time missile shooters from the 314th Fighter Squadron, the Viper training unit at Holloman, as well as F-16 student pilots who flew in the sorties as a learning opportunity. The Super Hornets, Hornets, and F-35Bs fired a mixture of AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 missiles, along with the aforementioned debut use of the F-35B’s four-barrel 25mm GAU-22/A gun pod in air-to-air gunnery in an operational setting. The 83rd FWS developed various profiles, to include what it calls high-G “combat-free” mission sets, against QF-16 full-scale aerial targets, as well as sub-scale drones, that were provided by the 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron (ATRS) to furnish scenarios to accomplish the various objectives. Combat Free is when an aircraft fires a missile while pulling Gs, instead of flying straight and level. It’s designed to simulate a dynamic air-to-air situation. In total, the combined units flew 295 sorties, firing 37 missiles and conducting 27 aerial gunnery missions. A complex affair An event such as WSEP, with multiple aircraft, live weapons firing, deconfliction, and many other variables, is clearly a complex affair. Mission execution is led by a qualified “Aces Chase” — an 83rd FWS pilot who is an airborne safety observer. The 81st Air Control Squadron, from the 53rd Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG), has a team monitoring and providing air control for the mission. Embedded safety observers ensure safe profile execution and can terminate the flight of any errant missiles after separation from the shooter aircraft. The “Lucky Ace” ground team, also members of the 83rd FWS, monitor the mission from the ground on the ops floor that is specifically designed for data collection and storage of missile data. “The 83rd FWS analysts and telemetry team monitor missile status and performance in real-time,” Vail adds. “Once the Aces Chase pairs the shooter to the target, the shooter begins execution of the briefed profile that the 83rd FWS program managers have developed, and the shooter has practiced for by both “chair-flying” and in the simulator [if available]. The shooter, or shooters in some cases, will use available sensors to detect, target, and identify the target. Once this sequence has occurred, and safety criteria are met, the Aces Chase will clear the shooter[s] to fire their weapon[s]. “The shooters will then hit the weapons release button in their platforms and, hopefully, the missile will successfully leave their aircraft and guide on the intended target. That doesn’t always happen though and that is exactly why we do this — to reaffirm what works — but more importantly, to identify what doesn’t work, what went wrong, and implement necessary corrections.” F-15Cs fire AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range air-to-air missiles over the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 during WSEP., MSgt Michael Ammons “Over the years, air-to-air missile shot evaluation has evolved considerably, stemming from the results of our weapons employment in Vietnam with a 10-1 kill ratio, through to a 39-1 ratio in Operation Desert Storm . WSEP has been integral to achieving those results,” explains Vail, adding that WSEP is the Department of Defense’s only weapons evaluation program. “WSEP is an incredible opportunity for our pilots, maintainers, and ammo personnel to get real-world experience loading and employing live air-to-air weapons, allowing us to validate our processes while gaining valuable experience that simply cannot be replicated in a simulated environment,” commented Capt Zachary Helton, from the 27th Fighter Squadron, during the February 2021 WSEP. “The data gained from each of these shots further benefit the Combat Air Forces as a whole, as we are able to train within the observed capabilities of each missile.” Informing the tactics What is known as the “3-dash-1 shot kill” is a manual that explains the tactics for firing missiles and data from WSEPs informs these tactics. “This manual provides aircrews in the Combat Air Forces — and the Navy fleet in F-35 specifically — with the ability to have a better understanding — that’s data-informed — with regard to their weapons employment,” explains Vail. “When they train they can reference the “3-dash-1 shot kill” to gain a better understanding in live-fly execution, but more importantly for debrief, to fully understand how their weapons performed.” While Vail’s squadron has no actual aircraft, the unit’s Program Managers are assigned from the full range of fighter aircraft types, including one Navy Super Hornet pilot . They provide a critical conduit between the WSEP team and the end-user. They are the experts that coach the visiting units through the event, making sure they gain maximum learning. “Any time units are preparing to deploy to Tyndall for air-to-air WSEP, my program managers will travel out to that unit for about a week for pre-deployment briefings. They will fly with them as part of the evaluation process to assess them during normal operations and ensure they are briefed on profiles and prepped, ready to come to Tyndall to shoot weapons.” The USAF uses the QF-16 for manned and unmanned Full-Scale Aerial Target missions., USAF Testing the systems Visiting units, and the nearby OT&E squadrons from Eglin Air Force Base can draw upon the wealth of resources that are available at Tyndall under the 53rd WEG. This includes the QF-16 that can be flown by a pilot, or unmanned from a ground control station, and BQM-167 sub-scale drones of the 82nd ATRS. Having been devastated by Hurricane Michael in October 2018, Tyndall’s 325th FW is spinning up to become a unit with three F-35A squadrons . Alongside, the 82nd ATRS is fully back in action, supporting the resident WEG. “The drone set-up and telemetry here is incredible,” enthuses Vail. When it comes to the flying targets that will have missiles fired at them, both the QF-16 and the BQM-167 are capable of being configured with varying countermeasures in the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS). These countermeasures range in frequency within the EMS from infrared through various Radio Frequency (RF) spectrums. The RF spectrums are used to simulate electronic warfare from adversary aircraft. Adversary infrared capabilities and countermeasures are also incorporated — with simulated Directional Infrared Counter Measures (DIRCM) anti-missile systems and real chaff and flares — with the intent being to employ and evaluate weapons against these realistic adversary threats. A BQM-167 is launched as the intended target for a missile shot., USAF “We shoot live missiles at the drones, and we can evaluate the weapon’s performance against a range of countermeasures,” Vail continues, adding that heat-seeking AIM-9 Sidewinder shots could previously be conducted against glowing-hot flares, but with only the F/A-18C, which is diminishing in numbers , cleared to carry the LUU-2 parachute flares, all WSEP shots are now conducted against drones. “For the more experienced aircrews or for testing we must make sure we get good data from the telemetry. To gather weapons performance data we let them ride as much as we can,” says Vail of the WSEP missile shots. “For the first-time shooter experience, the younger guys, we have them fly a profile and the drone executing some sort of defeat maneuver, so we know the weapon won’t hit the drone, but it provides sufficient experience.” Maintainers load a live AIM-120 AMRAAM., USAF Live shots Vail explains that the WSEP live shots do not just include high-time missiles that are close to being life-expired. Part of the mandate is to prove out the end-to-end build, load, engage and fire process of a weapon. So, they are typically drawn from the regular combat stockpile and then subjected to that end-to-end evaluation to ensure the whole weapon system is working as advertised. “The weapons are sent here, our team retrofits the telemetry kit [TM] in place of the warhead, and adds a flight termination system,” which means the WEG operators can disable the weapon if necessary, Vail explains. “We shoot some weapons with telemetry kits and some without. The TM kits provide the ability to provide real-time monitoring of missile performance. We monitor, and collect that data for evaluation and assessment. The weapons that we don’t retrofit with TM are primarily used for younger shooters who have not shot a live air-to-air missile previously.” Removing the warhead means that the missiles don’t detonate, and the “kill” can be scored due to its proximity to the target. This means that, in some cases, the target can live to fly another day, while the front line crews gain the all-important experience that they require. This is all about them experiencing what it is like for the missile to whoosh off the rail and guide onto a target, and under some circumstances detonate and destroy it, and not experiencing that for the first time in real combat. An F-16 fires an AIM-7 Sparrow with a inert warhead during a live fire exercise. , USAF For aerial gunnery, WSEP uses an aerial banner that is towed by either a contract Learjet or by a Hornet, or they use the Aerial Gunnery Targeting System (AGTS) towed by a QF-16. “That’s an organic capability in the WEG,” says Vail, who adds: “There had been a bit of atrophy with aerial gunnery in recent years, but it’s something we have re-invigorated with a full evaluation,” possibly reflecting a new emphasis on the full range of air-to-air capabilities for fighters. “AGTS is a cylindrical object that has a Visual Augmenter strung aft of it. It’s used as a lower-cost method of providing aerial gunnery experience for combat and fleet aircrews. There is a scoring version of the AGTS which provides feedback on the number of rounds that pass within the measuring capabilities of the system.” WSEP work-ups Part of the WSEP charter is geared toward a cycle of pre-deployment training for units, giving them the opportunity to employ the full range of weapons that they might use should they go into combat during their time downrange. Recent difficulties for units to deploy into bases like Tyndall from outside the Continental U.S. — such as those caused by COVID-19 — have seen some units conducting weapons evaluations from home stations. A recent example of this was the 493rd Fighter Squadron, which conducted live missile firings from its home base at RAF Lakenheath, England, in December 2020. “They were supposed to come here, but the whole thing pivoted due to COVID. We sent them AIM-9s and AIM-120s and helped set them up for success,” says Vail. “There are efforts in play right now regarding deployment preparation and spin up,” Vail adds. “Checkered Flag is an event twice a year by Team Tyndall, and the resident 325th Fighter Wing and the 53rd WEG host the participants. We run this coincident with WSEP East and it’s mainly aimed at the Immediate Response Force [IRF]. These are the three squadrons that are on the hook to deploy at short notice to go and handle any tasking that may arise.” “The intent of Checkered Flag is to get those three units operating together in extremely large Defensive Counter Air [DCA] missions over the Gulf of Mexico. Those VULs [Vulnerability Periods] are deconflicted from the live-fly weapons events. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have their own programs that are dovetailed into CAF Plan 53, they both come here to shoot, and we are seeing the Navy now have more emphasis on readiness and preparing their Carrier Air Wings [CVW] for deployment, so that sees less emphasis on individual units and more on the entire CVW showing up.” As well as being an environment in which to safely execute live-fire air-to-air missile profiles, WSEP now has an added element of combat tactical execution built-in, such as a realistic threat or “red air” environment, which is achieved through the use of the drones in the airspace, which can perform high-G and tactical maneuvers. “It is a substantial challenge for our team to fit wartime-like execution into the reality and necessity for safe execution,” says Vail. “We do the best we can to build scenarios that are combat representative given the constraints we operate within. WSEP is designed to evaluate effective missile shots at a fundamental level. There is not an increased tactical environment outside of flying the various profiles and firing at the full- and/or sub-scale drones.” With multiple aircraft and types completing live-fire sorties in the airspace at the same time, this requires a significant level of planning and deconfliction, with multiple agencies confirming the shot is safe to take prior to the actual firing. The USAF and U.S. Navy also conduct missile tests over the Point Mugu Sea Test Range in California, as illustrated here by the second firing of the new AIM‑120D-3 on May 12., NAVAIR Alongside the training part of WSEP, the desire to accelerate the introduction of new technology is a major focus for Lt Col Vail in support of operational testing. “We are trying to do all we can in accelerating the future faster,” he says. Commenting on new weapons such as the secretive AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM), which is now in development and due to be fielded in the next couple of years, Vail says: “I’ve been involved in discussions about that weapon.” “Prior to this role I was with the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron [TES] at Nellis AFB, so I know the guys out there. Having an operating location at Eglin means the 83rd FWS has a good working relationship with the 85th TES. That human interaction, the face-to-face conversations, mean that a lot of things come together as a result of personal relationships.” Vail acknowledges that a lot of developmental test work, such as new missile testing, is conducted out of Edwards AFB, California . “The furthest left we go is a discussion with the development test guys, most of our chat is with the operational test community.” Vail says WSEP is a far cry from just pitching up and firing missiles. The roughly two-week WSEP window involves a series of flights in carefully constructed scenarios, which add an element of real-world complexity. “We certainly have tried to include more of a “night one” battle focus,” he acknowledges. It means that WSEP is not just about shooting missiles at targets, but it blends in some of the large force exercise-type scenarios that have developed in other major training events. 90th Fighter Squadron F-22 Raptors at Tyndall in October 2020 for Exercise Checkered Flag 21-1., USAF/Amn Anabel Del Valle “I like the direction WSEP East has taken — trying to focus on air-to-air weapons evaluation against what we think the highest threat is.” It’s part of what Lt Col Vail calls “making this more missionized,” and clearly, more valuable across the range of participants that come to Tyndall to fire off the latest and greatest missiles. Despite the cost of modern weaponry, the USAF places a high value on operators and testers gaining vital experience of employing these sophisticated and lethal systems for real. When fighters head out over the ranges of the Gulf of Mexico, they aren’t simply firing off old, time-expired weapons. They are adding a critical piece to the complex puzzle of keeping fighter squadrons and their crews at the top of their game. WSEP blends advanced drone technology with emerging test requirements and essential frontline aircrew training so that when the radio call of “Fox” comes over the airwaves, the missile will be in the air and ready to deliver its killer blow.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports are still coming in about an accident involving a Qatar Emiri Air Force F-15QA fighter jet at MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois. Emergency responders were on the scene at around 7:30 am local time. The two crew members on board ejected while the aircraft was on the ground. Early reports indicated that one of them was injured and taken to hospital for observation, while the other was unhurt. Available photos and video footage show the aircraft, which is missing its canopy, sitting on a patch of grass at MidAmerica that appears to be between a taxiway and a runway, with its landing gear down. Despite an initial report from KMOV , a local CBS affiliate in St. Louis, that said that only one of the two individuals onboard had ejected, subsequent reports said that both aviators had done so . The available imagery clearly shows both seats missing from the jet. The F-15QA after its mishap earlier today., KMOV capture Boeing, which manufactures the F-15 series of fighter jets, among other aircraft, uses this airport, which sits adjacent to Scott Air Force Base, to support test and training activities. According to the St. Louis Post Dispatch , F-15QAs have been involved in “training exercises” at MidAmerica since February. A tweet that month from Scott Air Force Base’s official Twitter account confirmed that training of Qatari F-15QA pilots and weapon system officers was due to begin at the facility soon and continue “over the next several months.” Last November, Boeing announced three Foreign Military Sales contracts with the U.S. Air Force for training services and support in the Middle East valued at more than $800 million. The first of these was a previously unannounced contract awarded in 2019 to support the Qatar Emiri Air Force with F-15QA program management, maintenance, and aircrew training valued at $240 million over a five-year contract period. “Training will include in-person instruction, simulation events, and flying operations and will be held near Boeing’s F-15 production facility in the U.S. through mid-2021,” the manufacturer confirmed in a press release . The program is expected to run for a one-year period. Subsequently, Boeing plans to establish and operate an aircrew and maintenance training center for the QEAF at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar. KMOV capture Qatar has ordered 36 F-15QAs, which are the first to feature a new Advanced Cockpit System with Large Area Displays, among other improvements. You can read more about these Advanced Eagles here , which is also the variant upon which the U.S. Air Force’s new F-15EX is based. We will continue to update this story with more information as it becomes available. Update, 12:20 pm EST: The Air Force has released the following statement that confirms many of the details that we’ve already reported: “An F-15QA, recently accepted by the Air Force from the Boeing Corporation, departed the runway today at MidAmerica Airport, Ill. Two U.S. active-duty pilots who were on board ejected safely and received minor injuries. The aircraft was slated to be transferred to the Qatari Air Force through the Foreign Military Sales program. The incident is currently under investigation.” Update, 13:20 pm EST: A report from Military.com has confirmed that the mishap, which occurred on landing, involved crew from the U.S. Air Force and Navy. Both pilots sustained minor injuries, but only one was taken to hospital, as per the previous account. Both pilots are assigned to the Defense Contract Management Agency , which works with contractors to ensure equipment delivery, the aircraft in question having been handed over by Boeing earlier this week.

Adam Kehoe,"Updated on Jul 23, 2021",What We Know About The High-Altitude Balloons Recently Lingering Off America’s Coastlines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the last week at least nine sophisticated balloons have been flying off both coasts of the United States, mainly in areas usually associated with military training and testing. The transponder-equipped balloons have caught the interest of those monitoring flight tracking software, and have even been spotted from down below in a few instances. Observers have noted their ability to hold station for long periods of time and to seemingly fly against prevailing winds. With all this in mind, we decided to investigate, here’s what we found out so far. These high-altitude balloons are the property of Raven Aerostar , a division of Raven Industries , based in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. In recent years, Raven Aerostar has been known for its collaboration with Google’s parent company Alphabet in Project Loon, an ambitious venture intended to extend Internet access to rural areas. The “Loon balloons” were designed by Raven Aerostar to fly at high altitude for extremely long durations . Project Loon announced it would shut down in January this year, despite making significant technical strides. Since then, Raven Aerostar has continued to develop its balloon technologies for other sectors, notably in the realm of intelligence and defense. The high altitude balloons as seen on flight trackers off Southern California. They have caught people’s attention especially due to the fact that they can stay on station for long periods of time, seemingly flying against the prevailing winds in the area. , ADSBExchange.com The vehicles appear to be derivatives of Raven Aerostar’s Thunderhead balloon system . The Thunderhead balloons are designed to be able to persist over an area of interest in order to carry out a wide variety of tasks. According to the company , common applications include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and acting as communications relays. Additionally, the balloons can also serve roles in augmenting navigational systems. According to a recently published textbook titled “ Stratospheric Balloons : Science and Commerce at the Edge of Space” by Manfred von Ehrenfried, the Thunderhead balloon system is steerable and can be flown individually or in constellations. The Thunderhead is a super-pressure balloon (SPB) with a gondola that contains a payload, flight system, and solar panels. The balloon itself is pumpkin-shaped and composed of polyethylene. The system has two configurations: the Thunderhead 200 SPB with a 64,000 cubic foot volume, or the 400 SPB with a 400,000 cubic foot volume. The 200 SPB has a maximum altitude of 50,000 to 60,000 feet, while the 400 SPB has a maximum altitude of up to 92,000 feet. Tracks of the a balloons flying over America’s east. , ADSBexchange.com Within the main balloon, there is a smaller balloon referred to as a “ballonet.” The ballonet acts as a ballast, and functions as the central component of the steering system. Air is introduced into the ballonet using a pump, permitting the balloon to modify its weight to ascend or descend. Operators cannot directly control the course or speed, but the altitude changes, along with real-time weather awareness, allow the balloon to leverage wind patterns at different altitudes in order to navigate, including staying in a particular area for a long period of time. According to von Ehrenfried, flight times can exceed 30 days. One of Raven Aerostar’s Thunderhead balloons., Raven Aerostar Raven Aerostar produced a brief video in July of 2020, seen below, explaining the Thunderhead’s capabilities, emphasizing its ability to linger at extremely high altitudes over contested airspace. The company underscored that by networking balloons together, they can provide months of persistent services over a very large area. In the military and intelligence sense, these can include advanced networking capabilities, as well as carrying advanced radar sensors, electronic intelligence gathering systems, electronic warfare packages, optical payloads, and much more. Due to their high altitude, they can remain out of reach of many traditional anti-air countermeasures. Their recent appearance over both coasts of the United States appears to be a test of exactly this networking capability. Federal Communications Commissions records reflect an approved license for one of Raven Aerostar’s subsidiaries, Aerostar Technical Solutions, to fly balloons within a two hundred-mile radius around Vista, California from May 9th until May 30th this year. The stated purpose is to test networked radio systems, the Silvus 4400E and Silvus 4200E , on the high altitude balloons. Although the application only lists the California locations, further correspondence in FCC records show a conversation about permitting additional locations on the East Coast: Official Email The company appears to have aggressively pursued its balloon testing in recent years, with experimental radio license applications dating back until at least February 2020. Balloon tests had previously been approved and conducted across the Southeast and Southwest . For example, residents of Jackson, Mississippi may have noticed a meandering balloon track around May 4th this year. Radarbox During the same period of time, the company has been conducting tests of its new solid-state X-band radar technology platform, the HiPointer 100 . Testing appears to be taking place near Norfolk, Virginia with an experimental license approved from April 5 until October 2, 2021. Unlike these roaming balloon tests, the HiPointer 100 testing appears to be constrained to within about three miles of a Norfolk naval facility. Raven Aerostar The HiPointer 100 is designed primarily as a “perimeter defense and port security” tool according to Raven Aerostar. The device is highly portable and easy to use with minimal configuration. This includes the capability to be mounted on balloons, although it isn’t clear if it is being used in the ongoing balloon tests. At least some of the balloon trials have been associated with defense technology contracts. FCC records reflect authorization for balloon flights around Stanley, New Mexico until December 1, 2021. Supplemental application materials divulge that the testing involves work under Defense Technical Information Contract FA8075-14-D-D0014. The contract identification appears to be a typo of FA8075-14-D-00014 , a $1.8 billion dollar research contract held by Alion Science and Technology Corporation. The broader contract includes projects like this one , focused on “unmanned aircraft systems for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting and precision strike capabilities for naval air systems command persistent maritime UAS program office.” Raven Aerostar itself celebrated a five-year multiple-award contract from Naval Sea Command Systems (NAVSEA) in February of last year. The work cited involves the “Unmanned Vessel market” and their “Perception Radar solution,” according to the General Manager of Aerostar Technical Solutions, Michael Schwartz. The company has a rich history of working in the defense and intelligence realm. In 2011, engineers associated with the current balloon program were presented with awards from the Naval Air Warfare Center for its work in supporting intelligence efforts in Afghanistan. Specifically, the award cited the company’s work on the Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS), which is designed to monitor insurgent activity with high persistence balloons. Raven Aerostar also notably carried out tests involving balloons carrying ISR systems at altitudes of around 65,000 feet over six states in 2019. U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) sponsored that work as part of an experiment to evaluate whether this could a useful additional tool for supporting counter-narcotics and disaster response operations, along with more general intelligence collection requirements. Although often overlooked, balloons have seen a modern resurgence as a reconnaissance and communications platform in recent years, with intense interest from more than one service branch. The War Zone previously reported on the Army’s plans to leverage balloons that can deploy drone swarms from high altitudes and penetrate into contested airspace for extended periods of time while carrying radars, electronic warfare and electronic intelligence systems, networking relays, and other payloads as a key future operational concept. US ARMY The recent contracts with NAVSEA suggest that the Navy may be interested in some similar ideas. With that in mind, it’s also important to note that high altitude balloons with unspecified payloads were employed during a recent large-scale exercise focused on evaluating various unmanned capabilities and associated concepts of operations that the service held off the coast of southern California in April. Though the Navy does not appear to have specified the type of balloons used during that exercise, which was called Unmanned Integrated Battle Problem 21 (UxS IBP 21), footage and imagery the service released showed individuals wearing hardhats with the Raven Aerostar logo on them launching a Thunderhead. https://youtube.com/watch?v=_yQw8eANl8I In addition, intriguingly, the balloons currently deployed have been launched from or are lingering in areas that have come to be known as drone incursion hotspots involving the Navy. The balloons off the coast of Southern California have largely operated in the vicinity of San Clemente Island. In 2019, a still-unidentified group of drones harassed Navy vessels around that area over the course of several days. Author’s graphic On the east coast, some of the balloons appear to have been lingering near a naval warning area where a number of aviation safety incidents involving unusual aircraft were reported over much of the last decade. Tracks of the balloons launched off the eastern seaboard. , Author’s graphic While FCC records do not specify any specific payloads beyond the radios being tested, it is notable that balloons often equipped for reconnaissance are being fielded precisely in two recent hotspots for drone incursion activity. It is unclear if that is coincidental, although it likely is as these are established training and testing ranges, or if the Raven Aerostar balloons could play a role in monitoring for unusual activity. Raven’s systems are especially capable of detecting and pointing out targets of interest and anomalous activity and have the persistence to stay overhead far longer than any normal fixed-wing aircraft can. In the coming days, we’ll be keeping an eye out for Raven Aerostar’s balloons off the coasts of the United States, and the continued development of this intriguing but often overlooked intelligence and communications platform. We have reached out to Raven Aerostar to learn more about their fascinating platform, and about these ongoing tests.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2021",Secretive Army Suicide Drone Smashed Mock Air Defenses During Advanced War Games,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army recently tested a new, classified loitering munition, a type of weapon sometimes referred to as a “suicide drone,” as part of an advanced warfighting exercise called Edge 21 . An experimental network of manned and unmanned aircraft was also used to first locate and then cue those weapons, officially known as Joint Man-in-the-Loop Loitering Munitions, to their targets. Edge 21, which wrapped up recently, was a two-week-long Army-led exercise at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah that also involved elements of the U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps. The event was focused heavily on future aviation assets and associated concepts of operations, with the scenario revolving around simulated operations targeting enemy forces spread across a notional island chain in the Pacific. Edge 21, with Edge standing for “ Experimental Demonstration Gateway Exercise ,” was intended to help inform Army’s broader Project Convergence initiative . Project Convergence is exploring advanced networking and other capabilities, with a heavy emphasis on artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. A US Army Polaris DAGOR ultra-light vehicle launches an Area-I ALTIUS 600 drone via the Pneumatically Integrated Launch System (PILS) during Edge 21. The Army has been using the ALTIUS 600 as a surrogate to test other still-in-development concepts of operations regarding the future use of small unmanned aircraft, including in fully networked swarms., US Army “This was not a canned demonstration,” U.S. Army General John Murray, head of Army Futures Command, which is leading Project Convergence, told The Salt Lake Tribune . “We are actually trying to make things work.” A trio of the loitering munitions were launched against three separate mock targets, on representing an air defense radar, another simulating a command and control node, and a third acting as a surrogate for a Russian-made Pantsir-S1 point air defense system. The first two targets were each destroyed by a single one of these weapons. The Army aborted the strike on the third target after an unspecified issue left the drone out of position for what was supposed to be three near-simultaneous hits. The service recovered this munition and plans to use it again in the upcoming Project Convergence exercise, according to Defense News . Details about this munition itself, which has also been described as a “Long Range Effect,” or LRE, are highly classified, according to the Army. Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and friend of The War Zone Steven Trimble wrote on Twitter last week that an official video he had been shown from the exercise showed “a large, winged” design. He also said it was ground-launched. Trimble also wrote on Twitter that this munition did not appear to be related to a previously uncovered Army program known as Vintage Racer . Official documents describe that effort as centering around a missile capable of reaching hypersonic speeds, defined as anything above Mach 5, loaded with suicide drone submunitions. The Army has talked about using its future Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) short-range ballistic missiles, which could reach hypersonic velocity in their terminal stage of flight, as a way to deploy networked swarms of loitering munitions deep inside enemy territory. The Army would not confirm or deny to The War Zone that the weapons employed during Edge 21 were or were not in any way related to Vintage Racer, due to “the security classification of the munition.” The aforementioned name of the munition, which the Army confirmed to The War Zone and does not appear to have been previously reported, does make it clear that these munitions have man-in-the-loop control systems. This control concept, pioneered by Israel , means that an actual human operator “sees” what the drone sees through its onboard video cameras right up until the moment of impact. This allows that same individual to make fine adjustments, even very late in the weapon’s terminal phase of flight, giving it increased accuracy. This also provides a way to shift it away from the target should circumstances change, such as the sudden appearance of innocent bystanders in the area. The Army, interestingly, is also publicly in the process of integrating the Israel-made Spike-NLOS missile , another weapon with a man-in-the-loop control system, onto its AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The fact that the third one of these munitions was recovered for reuse after its strike was aborted also highlights one of the other inherent benefits of some loitering munitions suicide, especially compared to more traditional missiles or precision-guided bombs. These munitions have the flexibility to carry out general intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, all the while being able to immediately prosecute any targets they might find or return to a recovery point if that search turns up empty. As such, the ability to launch unused loitering munitions again also helps save money. It’s not clear how much each one of these weapons costs, but Defense News described it as “pricey.” Regardless of the Joint Man-in-the-Loop Loitering Munition’s exact design or capabilities, it is also just one part of a larger networked ecosystem that the Army is in the process of developing. During Edge 21, a manned aircraft carrying the Airborne Reconnaissance and Targeting Multi-Mission Intelligence System ( ARTEMIS ) sensor payload helped find the three targets in the first place. A modified contractor-owned and operated Bombardier Challenger 650 aircraft that the Army has been using to evaluate the ARTEMIS sensor package in recent years., US Army The ARTEMIS program, work on which started in 2019, emerged publicly last year and was, at least initially, installed on two modified contractor-owned and operated Bombardier Challenger 650 business jets. What complete ARTEMIS suite consists of is unclear, but it does include the High-Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) sensor package, which features a radar, along with electronic intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT) systems, to “allow [for] stand-off operations to detect, locate, identify and track critical targets for the ground commander,” according to an official contracting notice . An Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone also deployed a smaller unmanned system equipped with an ISR package in mid-air, which then provided additional targeting information. The exact design and capabilities of this so-called Air Launch Effects-Large (ALE-L) drone, which L3Harris has been developing in cooperation with the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), is also classified. Defense News reported that this system had a top speed of over 200 knots and a maximum range of more than 300 kilometers (approximately 186 miles), and had only flown once before this at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona in February. The idea of MQ-1Cs flying outside of the range of hostile defenses then deploying smaller, lower-cost drones to then fly into higher-risk areas is a future concept of operation the Army Futures Command has already publicly outlined . An MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone on the ground ahead of an earlier Project Convergence exercise in 2020., US Army Area-I Agile-Launch Tactically Integrated Unmanned System (ALTIUS) 600 drones were employed during Edge 21 as surrogates for the Army’s planned future Air Launch Effects-Small drones, as well. The ALTIUS 600s were launched from an ultra-light vehicle on the ground, as The War Zone has previously reported , as well as in-flight from a C-12 manned aircraft with a launch system installed inside a “wing locker.” In the U.S. military, C-12 nomenclature refers to variants of the Beechcraft King Air series. Various companies offer these lockers as general storage systems that go over the wings behind the engine nacelles on those planes. Edge 21 was reportedly the first time that the locker launch method has ever been used to deploy an ALTIUS 600 in mid-air. Commercially available wing lockers, typically used for general storage, installed behind the engine nacelles on a Beechcraft King Air aircraft., propellerpartsmarket.com Still, as part of its larger Future Vertical Lift initiative, the Army is already developing an entire family of large and small ALEs that will be capable of performing a wide array of missions, including conducting ISR, launching electronic warfare attacks, acting as decoys, and more, and doing so as a fully-networked swarm. You can read more about the ALE program and its objectives here . Armed ALEs capable of functioning as loitering munitions is also something the service is looking at, but it’s unclear how or if the Joint Man-in-the-Loop Loitering Munition may be directly related to that effort. In March, Northrop Grumman had announced a partnership with Israel’s UVision to develop a version of the latter company’s Hero 400-series loitering munition to meet an Army requirement for a “lethal” ALE. A graphic showing how the Army expects to employ various Air Launch Effects (ALE) unmanned systems in the future., US Army Within the larger Edge 21 exercise, the strikes by the loitering munitions, as well as other platforms, including Marine Corps F-35Bs , were used to help clear the way for a mock airmobile assault on enemy forces. It is important to point out that much of the new technology the Army demonstrated at Edge 21 is still largely experimental and is not necessarily intended for operational use, at least in its current form. “Sometimes they are just not going to work,” Futures Command head General Murray told The Salt Lake Tribune . “Everything that you are seeing here is what we would probably refer to as an ‘alpha’ model,” Army Chief of Staff General James McConville also stressed to Defense News . “It’s the initial model, and we know that this is not going to be the final model.” At the same time, the loitering munitions and ALEs, as well as other technologies showcased at Edge 21, such as the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) augmented reality goggles that individuals soldiers are set to start wearing in the coming years, underscore areas of growing interest to the Army, as well as the U.S. military, as a whole. The “joint” in Joint Man-in-the-Loop Loitering Munition makes it clear that this particular weapon is already being developed in cooperation with another service. The Marine Corps and U.S. Special Operations Command are both also looking to add loitering munitions to their arsenals, including man-portable types and ones that can be launched from aircraft, ground vehicles, and boats . Suicide drones are already an increasingly significant feature on modern battlefields, in general, notably being a major factor in Azerbaijan’s defeat of Armenia in a relatively brief conflict last year. Since then, sales of various types of loitering munitions on the international market have only increased. As the Army continues to push ahead with Project Convergence, and associated exercises, such as Edge 21, we will hopefully begin to learn more about emerging capabilities, such as the Joint Man-in-the-Loop Loitering Munition, that are set to transform how the service fights in the future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 7, 2021",F-15EX To Carry New Oversized Air-To-Air Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force just dropped a big hint that it’s working on a new very long-range air-to-air missile, with the F-15EX Eagle II fighter jet earmarked as the most likely candidate to carry it. The development is the first we’ve heard about a new U.S. air-to-air missile (AAM) in this class since the emergence of the Long Range Engagement Weapon , or LREW, some years ago, followed by that weapon’s apparent disappearance — at least in the public domain. Details about the new missile were disclosed by Air Force Magazine which recently obtained a series of Air Force talking points for the Fiscal Year 2022 budget. These also talk more generally about the Air Force’s plans to retire over 400 older fighters and replace them with around 300 new aircraft, including the secretive Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program and a ‘clean-sheet’ F-16 replacement , now called the Multi-Role fighter (MR-X). An F-35A fires an AIM-120 AMRAAM during a live-fire test over the Gulf of Mexico. Once again, the Air Force is now talking about a longer-range missile. , U.S. Air Force Intriguingly, the talking points also make reference to an unnamed “outsize … air-to-air” weapon, which will be able to be carried by the F-15EX. The fighter is described in the same papers as “an outsized weapons truck.” To date, the largest air-to-air weapon associated with the F-15EX was the standard AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile , or AMRAAM. While the Air Force has continued to try and wring out the maximum possible range from the AMRAAM, that weapon is now surely nearing the end of its development potential. Previously, the ability of the F-15EX to carry outsized weapons was well known but it was always expected that these would be offensive air-to-ground weapons, including hypersonic missiles which are invariably larger than most regular air-launched missiles. In particular, the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon , or ARRW, has been touted as a possible future armament option for the F-15EX. An inert AGM-183A ARRW test round loaded on a B-52H bomber. The F-15EX is also expected to carry this weapon., U.S. Air Force Now, it seems, the F-15EX’s weapons carriage capability will likely see it hauling different types of standoff weapons to prosecute targets both on the ground and in the air. In both scenarios, the F-15EX would likely be operating in less-contested airspace, or just outside hostile anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) umbrellas. Interestingly, while we know the Air Force, together with the Navy, is already working on a new AAM, which is intended to offer greater range than the current AIM-120 AMRAAM, the AIM-260 has long been assumed to be scaled to similar dimensions as the AMRAAM, especially as the F-22 Raptor is slated to be among the first aircraft to receive it. Having the AIM-260 broadly AMRAAM-sized would ensure it is suitable for internal carriage aboard the F-35 Lightning II , too, as well as any forthcoming stealth fighter designs. The AIM-260 is currently in development but details of its design and capabilities remain classified. Aside from the AIM-260, there has been speculation in the past that the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range, or AARGM-ER , a radar-killing air-to-ground weapon, would make a suitable candidate to turn into a long-range AAM. Once again, however, that weapon has been sized from the outset to fit inside the weapons bays of the F-35A and the carrier-based F-35C . An F/A-18E with a captive-carry AGM-88G AARGM prototype under its left wing., U.S. Navy Furthermore, by explicitly referring to the “outsize” nature of this new weapon, the Air Force would seem to be pointing to a different weapon altogether, one that Air Force Magazine assesses as a planned counter to China’s PL-15 AAM. The PL-15 also remains a mysterious weapon. We know that it is intended as the main armament of the J-20 stealth fighter and that it’s broadly analogous to the AIM-120D AMRAAM . However, there has been speculation in the past surrounding exactly how it achieves its presumed very long-range and whether it uses exotic throttleable ramjet propulsion . In fact, it now seems certain that the PL-15 uses a more conventional dual-pulse motor, but that its overall performance and its active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar still offer a serious challenge to the United States and its allies. Four dummy PL-15 missiles in the weapons bay of a J-20., Chinese Internet Meanwhile, China has at least been testing another very long-range AAM , photos of which showed it under the wing of a J-16 Flanker multirole fighter jet. This shadowy weapon is thought to be around 18 feet long, compared to 12 feet for the AMRAAM. In the past, The War Zone has speculated about how that weapon may in fact be tailored to destroy airborne early warning and control aircraft, and other high-value targets, at extended ranges. These Chinese weapons have been under development for some time, as have several Russian counterparts, which pose another threat to the previous dominance of the AMRAAM family. Last year, we saw the first evidence of a test launch of the very long-range R-37M (AA-13 Axehead) from a Su-35S Flanker multirole fighter, while an extended-range version of the R-77 (AA-12 Adder), apparently with ramjet propulsion, also appeared to be under test aboard the Su-57 Felon stealth fighter. A Russian Su-35S fires an R-37M missile., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP These Chinese and Russian missiles have been known about for some time now — the R-37M was first tested from a MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor as long ago as 2011. This brings us back to the LREW program, which sought to provide the U.S. Air Force with a very long-range AAM to challenge designs like these and to reinstate a capability the Pentagon lost with the Navy’s retirement of the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004. An inert Phoenix missile under the fuselage of a NASA F-15B during its study as a possible test vehicle to obtain hypersonic data., NASA/Tom Tschida Back in late 2017 the National Defense Authorization Act, the Pentagon’s budget, for the following year made reference to the LREW program, which was classed as “emerging capabilities technology development.” Back then, The War Zone described LREW as follows: This program has worked as an exploratory initiative used to identify the overall concept, technologies, kill chain structure, and baseline requirements for a new long-range air-to-air missile or family of missiles. Officially the program is aimed at “maintaining America’s air dominance.” Now the classified results of the program are supposedly being funneled down to the services where they are likely to morph into a hardware development program of record. Concept art provided for LREW showed a two-stage missile design being launched from the weapons bay of an F-22. A two-stage weapon would be a logical solution to developing a very long-range AAM rapidly, but the fact that the missile was apparently scaled for internal carriage by the Raptor raises some questions. U.S. Air Force concept art showing an F-22 launching a two-stage LREW missile., U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE VIA FLIGHTGLOBAL.COM While that concept may have involved some artistic license, the unnamed missile mentioned in the recent Air Force sounds very much as if it would be too large for internal carriage. It is possible, perhaps that LREW eventually yielded a missile that was too big for accommodation in the F-22’s main weapons bay. Taken together, however, it suggests that the new weapon is either separate from the LREW program, or the latter has since morphed into a different kind of weapon and one that is larger than when originally conceived. Moreover, since LREW was first disclosed, the idea of using the F-15 (in particular) as a ‘weapons truck’ has gained much greater traction, including using the older fighter to launch long-range missiles from a position of relative safety well behind a flight of stealth fighters which could provide targeting for these weapons via datalink . With the missile being launched remotely by the F-15, and then fed targeting updates from low-observable assets via datalink, the value of having the weapon launched by the stealth fighter itself becomes more questionable. The first F-15EX for the U.S. Air Force., VIKING AERO IMAGES There are perhaps other clues in the Air Force’s budget talking points as to how the new missile might be utilized. These make reference to “full-spectrum survivability, high speed, advanced weapons, and extended ranges” as well as a concept of operations in which the Air Force seeks to achieve “temporary windows of superiority” in “highly-contested threat environments.” One can quite easily imagine a very long-range AAM launched from distance and cued by various offboard, primarily stealthy platforms, as a way of punching holes in a dense A2/AD environment such as the kind that would be found during a campaign fought over Taiwan , for instance. Aside from the F-15EX, there is also the possibility that the new missile could also be compatible with the dimensions of the weapons bays of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. In 2019, Air Force Major General Scott Pleus, the then Director of Air and Cyber Operations for Pacific Air Forces, talked about the possibility of “A B-21 that also has air-to-air capabilities” and can “work with the family of systems to defend itself, utilizing stealth.” Regardless, with the F-15EX now making rapid progress, we might not have to wait too long to find out more details about the Air Force’s next-generation very long-range AAM. Whatever that weapon turns out to be, it’s been a long time coming and, with Chinese and Russian missile developments continuing apace, it will likely be a much-needed addition to the service’s armory.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 20, 2021",Israeli Warships Fire Missiles At Gaza While Hamas Takes Aim At Offshore Oil Platforms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports, as well as video and photos from the Eastern Mediterranean, demonstrate that the Gaza conflict is rapidly expanding into the maritime domain, with Israeli missile strikes now being launched from vessels off the coast against reported Hamas targets in the self-governing Palestinian territory. At the same time, reports from both sides in the conflict confirm that Hamas militants are meanwhile launching rockets against Israeli natural gas platforms in the Mediterranean, which, in turn, are being defended by shipborne Iron Dome air defense systems , and other assets. With significant overmatch enjoyed by the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, in the maritime domain, Israeli Navy vessels are now targeting objectives in Gaza using precision-guided missiles launched from the sea. At least one of the publically available videos appears to show the use of a Rafael SPIKE, a familiar precision attack weapon that is also available in navalized form. With an advertised range of almost 20 miles, the Naval SPIKE Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) version can be employed in a “fire and forget” mode or using man-in-the-loop guidance . In the latter mode, the missile can be fired at a specific area and then be manually steered onto the target by an operator who is seeing what the missile sees via a feed from an infrared camera in its nose. In this way, the SPIKE can also be used to reconnoiter targets before striking them, with extreme precision, as well. A gun-armed Israeli Navy rigid inflatable boat (foreground) together with a Sa’ar 4.5 class missile boat., IDF While the video below includes many of the hallmarks of SPIKE, the Israeli Navy could potentially also make use of the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Harop for attacks in Gaza. A pioneering suicide drone that is in both Israeli and foreign use , the Harop came to wider prominence after its use in the brief conflict last year between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the contested region of Nagorno-Karabakh . Like the SPIKE, the Harop has also been adapted for maritime use and recently won an order from an undisclosed navy in Asia, as you can read about here . Israeli reports suggest that, during the first six days of the current campaign in Gaza, the Israeli Navy carried out approximately 100 attacks against Hamas targets, using both missile ships and undisclosed other vessels. This is part of a wider IDF campaign that’s been waged against Gaza, with hundreds of airstrikes that have so far claimed the lives of at least 200 Palestinians. “The most significant thing, as in all of the IDF, is denying [the enemy] capabilities and establishing a strong defense,” the head of the Israeli Navy Major General Eli Sharvit told the press. “Therefore, we have attacked bases, vessels, weapons warehouses, infrastructure, and operatives. We have acted so that the naval arms of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas would be depressed.” Aside from its offensive operations launched against targets in Gaza, the Israeli Navy is also actively defending the Tamar offshore oilfield. This is located around 50 miles west of the Israeli port of Haifa, and some 14 miles off the coast of Ashkelon, which has borne the brunt of massed rocket attacks , and it lies entirely within Israel’s exclusive economic zone. At the time of its discovery, in 2009, it was the largest find of gas or oil in the Levant basin of the Eastern Mediterranean. Providing the majority of Israel’s electricity requirements, the importance of these energy reserves is such that the Israeli Navy’s latest Sa’ar 6 class corvettes are widely thought to have been tailored, at least in part, to protecting these installations. The first two vessels in this class are still being outfitted with weapons and other systems. Much of Israel’s apparent success in defeating the extensive rocket, mortar, and drone attacks it is now facing has been attributed to the Iron Dome air defense system, which you can read about in more detail here . In a ground-based context, the IDF claims that the Iron Dome air defense system has intercepted between 85 and 90 percent of rockets and mortar shells heading toward populated areas in recent days, although that figure could be questionable since Hamas has made concerted efforts to overwhelm the system . As of May 17, 10 people in Israel had been killed in the course of the 3,100 rocket attacks launched from Gaza. A Tamir interceptor missile launched from a ground-based Iron Dome system., AP A signal that the natural gas fields of the Eastern Mediterranean were under attack, or at least the imminent threat of attack, came last week when the U.S.-owned Chevron Corporation, a multinational energy concern, said it was temporarily shutting down its operations at the Tamar offshore platform. This followed a statement from the Al Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, claiming that they had targeted a “Zionist gas platform” off Gaza. “Chevron’s top priority is the safety of our personnel, our facilities, and the environment of the communities in which we operate,” a company spokesperson told the Times of Israel . Although the Israeli Ministry of Energy said the shutdown was not directly related to the statement from Hamas, Chevron, which has an almost 40 percent stake in Tanar, appeared to contradict this, a spokesperson confirming to the same newspaper that the Israeli Ministry of Energy had requested the move. For its part, the Israeli Ministry of Energy has said it is taking measures to ensure the supply of gas to powerplants continues and that the power supply is not affected. With another gas field, Leviathan, still operational, the energy situation for Israel is not as critical as it was when Tamar was temporarily shut down during fighting in Gaza in 2019 before Leviathan began pumping. Since the latest Chevron shutdown, the Times of Israel has reported that Hamas has fired “dozens” of rockets toward the Tamar gas rig. So far, there is no evidence that Hamas has successfully hit the Tamar field although the group has struck other Israeli energy infrastructure, hitting a large oil storage tank in Ashkelon with a rocket, leading to a major blaze. It’s not clear if that incident involved the deliberate targeting of the storage tank, or if it was simply the result of bombardment by unguided rockets. While there are no figures available about the relative success of the Israeli Navy vessels fitted with Iron Dome that are currently deployed around the Tamar offshore oilfield, Israeli media reports that “none of these rockets came close to striking the rig.” As well as defending against unguided rockets launched by Hamas, the Iron Dome is also effective against mortar fire and suicide drones — unmanned aerial vehicles carrying explosive warheads, which have also been used in the conflict and are potentially a more suitable weapon with which to target offshore oil infrastructure, since they incorporate some kind of guidance method. These drones share some broad similarities with the Iranian designs that have been employed extensively by the Houthis in Yemen , although they are notably smaller. Loading up Israeli Navy corvettes with Iron Dome launchers now seems to be a more frequently used tactic, first evidenced by the appearance of the Sa’ar 5 class corvette Lahav armed with two of the launchers earlier this year. On that occasion, the vessel was apparently being prepared to defeat Iranian-supplied suicide drones in the hands of Houthi rebels in Yemen. An Iron Dome battery on the flight deck of an Israeli Navy corvette., AP Last week, at least one Hamas suicide drone was reportedly downed by an Israeli Air Force F-16 fighter jet operating over the Eastern Mediterranean. There are also reports that at least one Rafael Barak 1 naval point-defense system has been deployed on a platform next to one of the rigs, to provide additional protection. The Barak 1 is primarily intended to defend against aircraft, anti-ship missiles, and drones. Other potential weapons at the militants’ disposal to attack the oil platforms include “autonomous submarines,” many of which the IDF claims to have already destroyed. Little is known about these weapons, also described as remote-controlled underwater improvised explosive devices, or RC-UWEID. They may even be low-profile or semi-submersible unmanned surface vessels and they reportedly carry a warhead weighing up to 66 pounds. Apparently, at least some of Israel’s coastal missile strikes have been directed against infrastructure supporting these operations. An official IDF video that purports to show the destruction of an “unmanned diver vehicle,” likely an “autonomous submarine”: Overall, the risk posed to Israeli offshore energy infrastructure by rockets launched by Hamas is limited; after all, the rigs present physically small targets and are located several miles from the coast. Suicide drones, on the other hand, could be a much more dangerous threat and it’s no surprise that a small armada of warships, plus patrolling fighter jets, have apparently been deployed to counter them. As for the “autonomous submarines” available to Hamas, there is no evidence yet of these having been deployed, but they are clearly a threat that the IDF takes seriously, based on its efforts to eradicate them. Once again, however, the asymmetric nature of its enemy means that Israel is having to invest considerable resources into defeating a range of threats that are frequently well hidden . This will only become more pronounced as time goes on, by all indications. The large force-protection posture around its oil platforms is another indicator of this.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",A-10 Warthog Pilots Are Using The Digital Combat Simulator Video Game To Train In VR,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Warthog pilots are now training, in part, using a literal computer game, albeit a highly sophisticated and realistic one, known as Digital Combat Simulator World , more commonly referred to simply as DCS. The 355th Training Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona is using DCS together with commercially available virtual reality headsets and other gaming peripherals to provide a low-cost way of augmenting more traditional training regimens on the ground and in the air. This underscores the growing and at times controversial interest within the Air Force, as well as elsewhere across the U.S. military, in using VR to help expand training capacity and do so on the cheap. The 355th Training Squadron’s A-10 Simulator Laboratory has been using a staple of the flight simulator gaming world, including DCS , as well as Oculus Quest and Rift VR headsets, Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog joysticks and throttles, and Thrustmaster TPR pendular rudder pedals . The computer workstations in the lab, from Volair Sim , are specifically designed for use together with flight simulator games and their associated peripherals. A pilot wearing an Oculus VR headset “flies” an A-10 in the Digital Combat Simulator World game in the simulator lab at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base., USAF A top-down view of one of the training stations in the A-10 simulator lab showing the Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog joystick and throttle and Thrustmaster TPR Pendular rudder pedals., USAF The unit had begun the process of setting up this training lab back in 2018 and personnel subsequently used money from a fund set aside for “innovation” projects to procure the commercial off-the-shelf software and hardware. Davis-Monthan is a major hub for Air Force A-10 operations and is presently home to three Warthog squadrons, two of which are combat-coded units assigned to the active-duty 355th Wing . The 45th Fighter Squadron, an Air Force Reserve squadron assigned to the 924th Fighter Group, is a dedicated Warthog training unit. A-10s assigned to the 355th Wing., USAF “VR has proven to be a tremendous tool for showing specific sight pictures that would otherwise be impossible to show via 2D pictures and traditional academic material,” a spokesperson for the 355th Wing told The War Zone , who also confirmed that technology was being used in conjunction with the DCS gaming software. “We are also using VR headsets for students to view 360-degree training footage, and communities all across the Air Force are starting to adopt similar platforms for multiple different career fields.” In a video the Air Force released last year, seen below, Air Force Major Drew Glowa, a 355th Training Squadron instructor pilot, said that, prior to the establishment of the A-10 simulator lab, training for Warthog pilots on the ground at Davis-Monthan consisted only of a mix of “classroom instruction, computer-based training, and full-mission trainers.” The FMTs are more traditional full-motion simulators where an individual sits inside a physical replica of the A-10 cockpit positioned in front of a large screen, onto which is projected a simulated environment. Whoever is “flying” the mock Warthog then goes about performing various simulated tasks with other personnel in an adjacent control center managing the entire scenario. An A-10 pilot conducts a simulated strafing run on an aircraft carrier in one of the full-mission trainers at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. An instructor pilot is seen standing next to the mock cockpit., USAF “We are using virtual reality simulation to provide an immersive trainer for students,” Air Force Major Drew Glowa, a 355th Training Squadron instructor pilot, had also said an interview for an official Air Force news item last year. “Training includes all aspects of operating the A-10 to include, but not limited to: ground operations, start-taxi-take offs, landings, formation flying, weapons employment, threat reactions, air-to-air refueling and other critical capabilities.” “There are two distinct lines of effort in our VR program,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Tim Manning, the commanding officer of the 355th Training Squadron, added in a separate interview at that time. “First is the lab where students can fly the A-10 and practice tasks and the second, is having actual flights filmed in 360-degree video, viewed on VR headsets.” The U.S. military’s use of computer and video games, or derivatives of them, for training purposes is hardly new. In 1996, the U.S. Marine Corps famously acquired a unique version of Doom II, the sequel to the equally iconic first-person shooter game Doom . Bohemia Interactive , best known for the Operation Flashpoint and Arma series of realistic military simulator games, has also supplied related software to the U.S. military . The 355th Wing’s use of DCS for A-10-related training is hardly surprising given the extreme realism the game offers, as well as the fact that an official Warthog “module” had already been created for it and was just upgraded recently to offer even more ‘extreme fidelity.’ Most DCS aircraft models feature fully ‘clickable’ cockpits and extreme realism down to controlling the aircraft’s subsystems. Even starting an aircraft in DCS is nearly identical to doing so in reality. Developed by Eagle Dynamics, which was founded in Russia, but now has its main headquarters in Switzerland, DCS was first released in 2008. DCS was an evolution of the earlier Lock On: Modern Air Combat (LOMAC) series. The underlying software is free to download, but the company sells modules for the game with new aircraft and other additional features. More than a decade on, new aircraft and more , as well as updates to existing content, are under development for this highly detailed combat flight simulator. Calling DCS simply a game may be somewhat unfair given how realistic it is, especially when combined with a VR headset, as The War Zone has noted in the past . Eagle Dynamics certainly has a commitment to authenticity and, two years ago, one of the company’s programmers actually found themselves in a jail cell in Utah after on charges of attempting to acquire sensitive flight manuals for the F-16 Viper and F-22 Raptor fighter jets in violation of U.S. arms exports laws . After his arrest, Oleg Tishchenko, a Russian national, said he needed the manuals for work, but Eagle Dynamics denied ever signing off on any plans of his to acquire the documents and insisted he was not involved in the development of the F-16 module for DCS. In June 2019, he was convicted of a number of charges, but sentenced to time served, immediately released, and deported . Using DCS, “we can now demonstrate exactly what it looks like flying on the wing of a tanker and subsequently flying to the correct position behind it to refuel,” the 355th spokesperson told us an example of the training that is now available through the A-10 simulator lab. “Leveraging DCS’s impressive visuals in VR, we are able to have students fly and practice the correct positions themselves, which is very valuable training for a single-seat aircraft. No 2D screen can show the same level of depth perception required to accurately fly these types of close formations.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=SKHldTBDPZU “This prepares them for flying events better than any other training tool we have at a higher availability,” Major Glowa, the A-10 instructor pilot, said last year. “Now we can review specific tasks in a real-world environment by supplementing our four traditional simulator bays and giving students 22 more cockpits to practice on their own or with an instructor. We can expedite ground training to prepare students for flights at a pace we have never seen. We are transforming the way we train pilots and will be able to actually increase quality faster and add remedial training at almost any time. This will expedite the time it takes to get students ready for their flights.” USAF The ability to carry out this kind of training with a high degree of realism on the ground is especially important for A-10 units. There is no two-seat trainer version of the Warthog, which means that pilots who are new to the type have no alternative but to actually fly it for the first time solo. The larger, more traditional FMT provides important simulated flight experience before then, but these are also limited in number and can be expensive to operate and maintain . As such, the A-10 simulator lab, through DCS and VR, also offers very low-cost additional simulator capacity. “It’s always challenging for us with the three squadrons here to basically find time to make sure everyone’s got enough slots to get a certain amount of training done,” according to Major Glowa. “The biggest benefit for this is that you have a low-cost option to get students actually chair-flying realistic events and sight pictures that they’ve never had before.” “You have to be able to practice like you play,” he added in the 2020 video interview. “The more we can do that, the more opportunities we have to train before we go fight the better, so this leverages that big time.” USAF The cost savings and added capacity that VR, in general, can offer have already made this an area of great interest across the U.S. military. The Air Force, in particular, has focused on leveraging VR for simulated ground-based flight training as one way to help generate sufficient numbers of new pilots, something the service has struggled to do in recent years . A Reserve Officer Training Corps cadet uses a VR headset as part of a simulated flight training session at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas in 2019. The Air Force has been expanding the use of VR in simulated ground-based flight training for years now., USAF The use of VR is already expanding into other kinds of training , too. Augmented reality (AR) is also emerging as another lower-cost avenue to provide additional training capacity . The A-10 simulator lab isn’t even the only VR-based training going on at Davis-Monthan. The 355th Operational Support Squadron has also been using VR-based simulations to help train ground personnel to conduct various tasks. A simulated flightline full of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters that is among the VR environments that the 355th Operational Support Squadron has been using to train ground crews., USAF “The 355 TRS [Training Squadron] is a key leader and trailblazer in this space and is leading the combat Air Force,” he added. “We have moved out on the Chief of Staff of the Air Forces’ message to ‘accelerate change or lose.'” At the same time, there have already been criticisms leveled at the increasing use of simulated training, with some warning that this could leave new pilots with a worrying lack of actual flying experience . Lieutenant Colonel Manning, the 355th Training Squadron commander, spoke directly to those concerns last year. “We are not cutting flights or flying hours in the syllabus, but instead we are using this technology to produce more lethal, efficient and safer A-10 pilots,” he said. “Better ground training methods will result in making the most of every flight hour. It also has the potential to be more cost-efficient for the Air Force, and maybe even a faster way to accomplish training.” As Manning makes clear, VR training using software like DCS is not a substitute for real flight training. At the same time, it certainly opens the door to significant changes to how various portions of a larger flight training program are carried out. The War Zone ‘s own Tyler Rogoway had similar observations in the past regarding how high-fidelity commercial flight simulators could be used to help with training, writing : Nothing is like the real thing. No matter how good the sim is, it isn’t actually flying. But the fact that this level of technology is now available to the consumer means that a lot of the basics can be learned at home, in VR. From mastering core procedures, to working an aircraft’s avionics, to basic flying skills, they can be learned in your living room or in a nearby office building. Instructors can be right there to help guide a pilot’s skillset without even being in the same country. The Air Force certainly appears to be continuing to refine how it uses commercially available VR, as well as things like DCS, to support its training requirements. At the same time, the experience of A-10 pilots assigned to the 355th Wing shows that there is a clear value, both in terms of cost and capacity, to expanding the use of this technology going forward. With all this in mind, DCS users can feel even more confident in the game’s fidelity. If it is good enough for A-10 pilots to learn essential skills, it has to be pretty damn good.

Responsible for developing Air Force strategy and multi-domain operating concepts, Hinote gave interviews to both Air Force Magazine and Defense News in which he filled in some aspects of the highly secretive NGAD initiative. He also explained how the timeline for that program fits in with still-ongoing planning regarding the eventual retirement of the F-22. One idea of what a manned component of the NGAD could look like, courtesy of Northrop Grumman concept art., Northrop Grumman Hinote, who is a former F-16 Viper and F-117 Nighthawk pilot , told Defense News that, at least right now, he doesn’t anticipate replacement of the F-22 with the NGAD to begin until the 2030s, by which time the Raptor will be “a 40-year-old platform.” “We don’t have to make that decision this year,” Hinote continued. “What we’re going to want to see is, when do we press from the NGAD being a developmental program to being a production program?” The Air Force has so far been tight-lipped about the timeline for when any aircraft developed under NGAD will enter service, although it was disclosed last September that at least some kind of demonstrator platform for the program is already flying. In his interview with Air Force Magazine , Hinote hinted that a second demonstrator — potentially an entirely new follow-on design — might be in some stage of production now. “As you’re allowing that program to mature, through a spiral series, you’re designing the next platform” with new software and sensor technology, Hinote told Air Force Magazine . He also hinted that new iterations could come along every five to eight years. Clinton Hinote, then a colonel, prepares to exit his F-16 after completing his final flight as the 8th Fighter Wing commander at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea, in 2014., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Armando A. Schwier-Morales That kind of rapid technology turnover is something that was espoused by Will Roper, the former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, in what was termed the “Digital Century Series,” an ambitious goal you can read more about here . Apart from this concept, the Air Force is also working on the Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Platform Sharing (LCAASP) program that aims to deliver two attritable/reusable UAV variants that will be “derived from a common system architecture that share core system features and are tailored to perform specific missions, similar to Valkyrie’s modular approach,” in the words of a policy paper from the Mitchell Institute, an airpower think tank. This is part of the Air Force’s studies into creating scalable aircraft families based around common components. However, it also seems likely that the Air Force has not settled on to what degree NGAD will be based around a manned platform or platforms. Hinote told Defense News that the program includes manned, unmanned, and optionally manned segments but suggested that not all of those might go forward into operational service. “Frankly I think we’re going to explore all of those to go forward to see exactly what the best use of this is,” he said. Meanwhile, Air Force Magazine reported that NGAD would definitely include an optionally manned platform based on its own conversation with Hinote. Of course, with the system of systems approach, it’s also possible that Hinote was specifically referring here to a platform earmarked to replace the F-22 since it seems almost certain that NGAD will incorporate at least some unmanned platforms. Exactly how the manned/unmanned conundrum plays out, Hinote did tell Air Force Magazine that, more generally, he expects autonomous aircraft to be used increasingly as force multipliers and referenced the recent first flight test of an initial version of the artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” being developed under the Skyborg program . It’s worth noting, too, that the Air Force has publicly talked about Skyborg initially being intended to support operations of loyal wingman-type semi-autonomous drones, after which the goal is to insert this technology into a more robust, fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). There has also been some discussion already about integrating some of this autonomous technology into manned aircraft, which could potentially present a pathway to turning existing or future manned types into optionally piloted ones . The Skyborg autonomy core system launches aboard a Kratos UTAP-22 tactical unmanned vehicle at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, last April 29., U.S. Air Force While it might seem somewhat late in the day to be considering such fundamental issues as whether or not NGAD will have a human pilot, Hinote provided an assurance that the program is progressing well, both in terms of the work made by the (unnamed) prime contractors and the various subcontractors. He pointed to digital design concepts and systems integration as being the cornerstones of the program and ensuring that it will be fielded in a timely manner — presumably sometime in the 2030s, based on his other statements. But, if NGAD fails to live up to all that promise and is not so quick to deliver hardware to frontline units, Hinote remains confident that the F-22 can fill the gap until its successor becomes available. An F-22 from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Gustavo Gonzalez It may be a “great airplane,” in Hinote’s words but the Raptor is increasingly becoming obsolescent for the challenging types of mission that are likely to be required in a new era of confronting near-peer adversaries, like China. Hinote provided the example of a hypothetical Chinese invasion of Taiwan in the mid-2030s as the kind of scenario in which the F-22 would no longer pass muster. Hinote explicitly pointed to the threat posed by the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter combined with advanced air-to-air missiles , suggesting this is seen as a true game-changer in the Asia-Pacific theater. The J-20 stealth fighter., CHINESE INTERNET As we have examined before , the F-22 is hamstrung by its limited range and its limited magazine depth — the amount of armament it can carry on a single sortie, a problem that it shares with the F-35 . Hinote also identified this issue. With that in mind, it is interesting to hypothesize how the NGAD might address the problem of magazine depth. This and many other factors suggest the NGAD fighter component will be larger than the F-22, while also exploiting broadband low-observability , likely being a tailless design. Another, perhaps complementary, option would be to employ the new fighter in conjunction with drones used in swarms, or individually as either sensor trucks or weapons trucks. The first F-15EX arrives at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, March 11, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Samuel King Jr. Furthermore, the F-22 is a small, maintenance-intensive fleet making it expensive to operate and it’s also increasingly under threat from advanced air defense systems, Hinote pointed out. Like the B-2 stealth bomber , another ‘silver bullet’ fleet, the Raptor is suffering, too, from the vanishing-vendor effect : a diminishing stock of parts provided by now-defunct original equipment manufacturers. To help keep the F-22 at the cutting edge, Hinote confirmed that an upgrade program would be requested under the Fiscal Year 2022 budget, addressing sensors and undisclosed new air-to-air missiles, and, beyond that, perhaps a service-life extension program. These new weapons will “be used across the entire fighter inventory,” according to Defense News , suggesting that Hinote was referring to the AIM-260 Joint Air Tactical Missile (JATM). This is expected to be broadly similar in size to the current AIM-120 AMRAAM , to permit internal carriage in the F-22 and F-35, but will offer a greater range than even the AIM-120D, to keep pace with Chinese and Russian missile developments. An F-35C launches an AIM-120 missile over a controlled sea test range in the Pacific Ocean., U.S. Air Force/Christopher Okula There is, of course, also a political edge to these discussions, in particular the need to leverage the government to fund the NGAD program. Hinote admitted to Air Force Magazine that the forthcoming budget request will include a “large … commitment” to NGAD. Leading officials talking down the future credibility of the F-22 will only help support these funding ambitions. In the final Fiscal Year 2021 budget, it’s notable that funds for the NGAD were cut slightly . Aside from the F-22 and NGAD scenario, one other item of interest that came up in Hinote’s Defense News interview was the suggestion that the Air Force could upgrade its existing F-15E Strike Eagles to the same standard as the latest F-15EX, the first of which was recently delivered to the service. That could potentially parallel the kind of remanufacturing program, that Saudi Arabia adopted when upgrading its existing F-15S jets to the advanced F-15SA standard . The alternative for the Air Force would be to buy new F-15EX aircraft to replace them, a proposal that’s been doing the rounds for some time now. An F-15E departs after receiving fuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker during a mission over Southwest Asia, in February 2021., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Trevor T. McBride Either way, it seems the hard-worked F-15E community , often the first choice for strike missions around the globe is receiving some kind of new or drastically revamped equipment. As we have spoken about in the recent past, all these plans are yet to be formalized, and discarding the F-22 ‘early’ would likely face the wrath of lawmakers. There’s no doubt, however, that interesting times for the Air Force’s tactical aviation fleet lie ahead. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 19, 2021",The Army Has Finally Revealed The Range Of Its New Hypersonic Weapon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has finally provided an official range for its future Long Range Hypersonic Weapon , or LRHW. This range figure notably means it would have been prohibited under the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , that the United States and Russia were parties to until 2019. This disclosure also follows criticism earlier this year from a senior Air Force officer about the utility of this weapon, especially in the Pacific region . “The Long Range Hypersonic Weapon provides a capability at a distance greater than 2,775 km,” an Army spokesperson said, according to Breaking Defense . This means that the LRHW can strike targets at least 1,725 miles away. For comparison, the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile, the longest-range ground-based missile system currently in Army service, can only reach targets out to 300 kilometers, or close to 186 miles. One of the first inert Long Range Hypersonic Weapon missile canisters, which are now being used for training purposes, arrive at an undisclosed US Army base in 2021. , US Army The complete LRHW missile consists of a large rocket booster with an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top. The rocket is used to loft the conical boost-glide vehicle to a desired speed and altitude. The vehicle then detaches and comes zooming back down toward its target along an atmospheric flight trajectory at hypersonic velocity, defined as anything above Mach 5. Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles are designed to have a high degree of maneuverability, especially compared to traditional ballistic missiles, even those with advanced maneuverable reentry vehicles. This makes them ideal for striking time-sensitive or other high-value targets protected by dense enemy air and missile defenses and doing so on short notice, even at extended ranges. The combination of speed and maneuvering makes it very difficult for opponents to spot and track these weapons, let alone try to defend against them, including just trying to relocate critical assets or otherwise seek cover. It had first emerged in 2018 that the Army, together with the U.S. Navy and Air Force, were working together on a tri-service hypersonic weapons program. LRHW is the Army’s component of this program, while the Navy’s portion is known as the Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) system. Last year, the Air Force announced that it was abandoning its segment, the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW) program, in favor of the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), which uses a wedge-shaped boost-glide vehicle. The LRHW and IRCPS systems both use the same core missile and boost-glide vehicle, but are being adapted for launch from ground-based and naval platforms, respectively. Details have been slowly trickling out about this joint-service hypersonic weapon in recent years, but, as already noted, the statement to Breaking Defense is the first time an actual official range has been given. An infographic showing the common boost-glide vehicle and missile design that the Army and Navy are both using in their LRHW and IRCPS programs, as well as the components specific to the Army’s ground-based system., US Army The figure is immediately interesting in the context of the INF treaty, which had prohibited the United States and Russia from deploying nuclear or conventionally-armed ground-based cruise and ballistic missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles. The Army withdrew its nuclear-armed Pershing II medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM), which had a maximum range of around 1,100 miles, from service as a result of that deal. The last of these missiles were decommissioned in 1991. US Army Pershing II medium-range ballistic missiles, where were withdrawn from service as part of the INF deal., DOD With all this in mind, it’s perhaps unsurprising that the weapon’s range has been kept under wraps for so long. The U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, only formally withdrew from the INF in 2019, ostensibly over Russia’s fielding of a prohibited ground-based cruise missile system , something the Kremlin continues to deny it has done. At that point, work on at least the underlying components of the LRHW had been going on for years. In 2017, the Navy even conducted the first flight test of what subsequently emerged was a common boost-glide vehicle design, launching it from an Ohio class submarine . The INF did not place any limitations on the development or fielding of ship- or submarine-launched cruise or ballistic missiles. In 2017, reports also emerged that the United States had begun at least exploring the development of an INF-busting missile in response to Russia’s treaty-violating cruise missile. The INF did not expressly ban the research and development of ground-based weapons with prohibited ranges, providing no actual tests were carried out and that no such weapon was actually fielded. It’s also interesting to note that the Navy consistently describes its version of this weapon, which, again, will use the exact same core missile packaged for launch from submarines and ships, as being “intermediate range.” Intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM) are defined as having maximum ranges between 1,864 and 3,418 miles, the lower end of which is still greater than the 1,725 miles figure that the Army has now provided for LRHW. LRHW is also just one of a number of post-INF land-based missiles that the Army, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, is now pursuing. Both services are looking at the possibility of fielding ground-launched versions of the Tomahawk cruise missile . The INF had led to the scrapping of a previous land-based Tomahawk variant, the BGM-109G Gryphon , which had been in service with the U.S. Air Force. A ground-based launcher fires a BGM-109G Gryphon missile during a test. , US Army The Army is also developing a replacement for ATACMS, the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), the range of which is no longer limited by that treaty. Just yesterday, Lockheed Martin announced that it had demonstrated the ability of that weapon to hit targets out to nearly 250 miles and there has already been talk of pushing that out further to somewhere between 340 to 372 miles . There is also another ground-based hypersonic weapon program, Operational Fires (OpFires), that the Army is working on, together with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The OpFires missile also carries an unpowered boost-glide vehicle and it is unclear exactly how this weapon differs from the LRHW design. The disclosure of the LRHW’s range now is also not entirely surprising. While a guest on an episode of Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute’s Aerospace Advantage podcast in March, Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), said, in no uncertain terms, that he felt the LRHW program was “stupid.” Ray was especially critical of the weapon’s utility in the Pacific, where a number of American allies, including Australia and South Korea , have already said they have no interest in hosting them. There have been reports that Japanese authorities could be inclined to allow future Army missile units onto its soil, possibly through rotating deployments . “There are a lot of countries that have to agree to this. I could see some of them probably agreeing in the European theater, maybe in the Central Asian theater, but I don’t see it coming together with any credibility in the Pacific any time real soon,” Ray said. He also touted the Air Force’s own work on the ARRW program, as well its experience with the kinds of long-range bomber operations into which those weapons are expected to be integrated, including in the Pacific. A US Air Force B-52H bomber carries two captive-carry AGM-183A ARRW test articles under its wing., USAF Ray’s comments ultimately led to a meeting between the Army and Air Force chiefs of staff and prompted public statements of support for the LRHW from other senior U.S. military officials. Land-based hypersonic weapons, as well as other ground-launched longer-range missiles, are a core component of the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) concept that the U.S. military has proposed as a way to counter China in that region, which you can read about more in detail here . As Breaking Defense pointed out , with a range of 1,725 miles, LRHWs fired from the U.S. island of Guam, where the weapons would be based without any need for foreign consent, could reach Taiwan. This would allow their potential use in response to a Chinese invasion of that island . Officials in Beijing see that island, which presently has a completely autonomous government, as an integral part of China and they routinely threaten to use military force should authorities in Taipei declare full independence from the mainland. LRHWs capable of striking targets 1,725 miles or more away would be able to reach deep inside the Chinese mainland if they could be positioned in Japan, or the Philippines, another country that has come up in discussions about basing these weapons. Having these missiles in Japan would also mean they could prosecute targets in North Korea or Russia’s Far East region. “You might aggregate Navy and Army; you might aggregate Air Force and Army, but if someone shows up to the battle and they don’t have long-range fires and the adversary does, you can’t effectively operate in that theater,” Air Force General John Hyten, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in April , speaking about future operations generally. “This means you want each service to bring those long-range fires; so, the joint warfighting concept succeeds if all of the force can apply fires wherever they happen to be, wherever the target is, whatever the lines of conflict, that is the joint warfighting concept.” All this being said, budgets are likely to be a key factor in any future discussions about Army ground-based hypersonic or other longer-range missile capabilities. The Air Force notably abandoned HCSW, its companion to the LRHW/IRCPS program, in order to refocus resources on the ARRW project. As it stands now, the Army hopes to have a prototype battery ready to begin live-fire testing of the LRHW sometime in the 2022 Fiscal Year. That unit is then expected to form the core of a limited operational capability with this weapon in the next fiscal cycle. By disclosing the LRHW’s range, the Army seems to be making a new pitch for that weapon’s place in the future mix of long-range strike capabilities across the U.S. military. In doing so, the service has also made clear that the U.S. military has now left the limitations that the INF treaty had imposed far behind.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 25, 2021",Continuous Mass Rocket Attacks Pose New Challenges For Israel’s Iron Dome System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Palestinian militants have fired more than 1,050 rockets at cities and towns across Israel from the Gaza Strip in less than two days. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, have been able to knock down hundreds of them thanks to Iron Dome defense systems and their Tamir interceptors . However, the sheer volume of rockets has underscored the limitations of employing Iron Dome against continous mass saturation attacks, which is clearly the tactic at play during this recent burst of violence. It also points to how this reality incentivizes Israel’s opponents to simply expand their arsenals in order to effectively penetrate Iron Dome defenses. The Al Qassam Brigades, the militant wing of the Palestinian group Hamas, as well as Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), have been the groups primarily responsible for these attacks, which include the largest rocket barrages aimed at central Israel ever. The rocket fire has prompted Israeli retaliatory air and artillery strikes, including a number of targeted killings of senior Palestinian militants. A long-exposure photograph of rockets being launched from Gaza toward Israel on May 11, 2021, shot from the site of an Iron Dome launch unit. , AP Photo/Ariel Schalit This includes a top commander of the PIJ’s rocket units and the heads of Hamas’ military intelligence security and military intelligence counterespionage departments. Israel has also been carrying out a campaign targeting relatively large office and apartment buildings in Gaza owned by Hamas, which it says are being used to support terrorist activities, though they may have residential apartments inside them. This is all now part of some of the worst Israeli-Palestinian fighting in years, as you can read more about in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting on this still-escalating conflict. Tensions are now growing between Arab and Jewish Israelis within the country, as well, with rioting and violent protests erupting in numerous cities and towns. Yesterday, the mayor of the city of Lod described the situation there as a “ civil war ” and Israeli authorities subsequently deployed elements of the country’s border guard to help quell the situation. The cycle of rocket attacks and Israeli retaliation is still ongoing, which in turn has kept the IDF’s Iron Dome batteries busy. Yesterday, when Israeli officials said that the total number of rockets fired was at more than 480, they said that more than 200 of them had been successfully intercepted . A complete Iron Dome system, the operation of which is heavily automated in many regards , consists of a number of launch units, each loaded with up to 20 Tamir interceptors, as well as associated radars, to spot and track incoming threats, and a battle management and control unit. Each highly maneuverable Tamir interceptor has an active radar seeker and a two-way datalink to receive additional targeting information in-flight to improve its accuracy. A proximity fuze triggers the detonation of a ring-shaped high explosive blast fragmentation warhead inside the interceptor when it gets sufficiently close to its target. You can read more about this arrangement and how it works in this past piece of ours. A general overview of the Tamir interceptor used in the Iron Dome system., Rafael Iron Dome and its Tamir interceptors are primarily designed for the so-called Counter Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM) role. However, the system has also reportedly demonstrated an ability to engage cruise missiles and small drones, as well as low-flying aircraft, as well. The IDF has reported shooting down hostile unmanned aircraft flying out of Gaza during this recent fighting, but it is unclear whether Iron Dome batteries, rather than more robust air defense assets or even combat aircraft, have been responsible for any of those intercepts. At the time of writing, there also does not appear to be any updated official tally for how many rockets have been knocked down now that the total launches have passed 1,000. We also don’t know how many Tamir interceptors have been fired at rockets in the past few days, but then failed to bring their intended targets down. As of 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Defense had said that Iron Dome had successfully engaged 85 percent of all targets it had been employed against since the system was first deployed operationally in 2011. In January of that year, the manufacturer, Rafael, said that an improved version of Iron Dome had not missed once during a round of testing, portions of which are seen in the video below. Still, regardless of what Iron Dome’s recent success rate, as well as what the total number of intercepts might be, the IDF has already admitted that it has not been able to bring down all of the incoming rockets flying at Israel from Gaza. There have also been reports of these defense systems being overwhelmed by the volume of these recent attacks, rather than this being a case of the IDF just ignoring some of the rockets, which are all unguided, that might appear headed toward areas where they are assessed to present little to no threat. Hamas and PIJ both seem to have been stockpiling rockets, at least in part, with an eye toward being able to carry out these kinds of saturation attacks to get around the defensive shield Iron Dome provides. Both groups receive support from Iran, as well as Syria , which has included smuggled shipments of artillery rockets. Palestinian militants, with outside support, have also been able to locally fabricate increasingly longer-range rockets within Gaza, as well. There are also reports that rockets are being fired from Gaza at very low trajectories, rather than along more typical higher-angle ballistic ones. This could be another way of at least attempting to circumvent Israeli defenses. It’s also important to note that a relatively intact seeker section from a Tamir interceptor was recovered in Gaza in November 2019. However, there are no clear indications one way or another that Palestinian militants have been able to operationalize any information they, or their benefactors in Iran, may have been able to glean about Iron Dome’s capabilities and limitations, as a result. No matter what combination tactics Palestinian militant groups may be employing, Iron Dome also faces more basic capacity and logistical limitations when faced with multiple barrages involving dozens, or even hundreds of rockets, carried out in relatively short time frames. It’s not clear how many Iron Dome batteries Israel has in service, in total, but, as of 2014, the plan was to eventually field at least 15 complete systems . If a single Iron Dome battery has three or four launch units loaded with 20 interceptors, that means it only has between 60 and 80 Tamirs ready to fire at any one time. With 15 batteries each with four fully-loaded launch units, the total number of interceptors available would be 1,200. While the batteries are no doubt positioned to provide some overlapping zones of protection, no single one is anywhere capable of being able to respond to rocket attacks in all the areas that the entire defensive network covers. In other words, the number of interceptors at the ready during a localized attack is probably limited to the a single battery or a small number of the total batteries deployed. In addition, it is known that the IDF’s concept of operations, at least in some cases, though perhaps not when responding to saturation attacks, involves firing two Tamirs at a single target to increase the likelihood of a successful intercept. The launchers themselves are designed to be relatively fast to reload, with the interceptors preloaded into arrays of launch canisters, but the process is not instantaneous, especially during a barrage where the battery itself is being targeted. So, it’s not at all hard to see how repeated high-volume attacks in a particular area could overwhelm Iron Dome batteries. Clearly that reality is not lost on those prosecuting these attacks. There is also the matter of the cost differential, especially if saturation attacks persist, as they have in this recent fighting, which can begin to drain existing stocks of Tamir interceptors and prompt the need to replenish them. The exact unit cost of the current generation Tamir interceptor is unclear, with past reports putting that price tag at between $40,000 and $100,000 . Even at $100,000, they are very low cost when compared to other anti-missile interceptors and other surface-to-air missiles. At the same time, even at that lower price point, if Israel has fired more than 200 of them in the past few days, that is more than $8 million worth of Tamirs. By that same calculation, 1,000 successful intercepts would mean firing off missiles worth a total of $40 million. During the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian groups in Gaza in 2014, Israeli received approximately $225 million in emergency aid from the United States specifically to boost its Tamir stockpiles. That conflict lasted around seven weeks, during which the Palestinians fired at least 4,564 rocket and mortar projectiles, according to the IDF. While we don’t know the exact cost of the different types of rockets Hamas and PIJ have been firing at Israel, they are unguided weapons and are almost certainly orders of magnitude cheaper than Tamir interceptors. Past reports have said that Hamas’ older, lower-end Qassam rockets have cost between just $500 and $600 to make, each. The cost disparity of employing Iron Dome against these lower-end threats is underscored by the fact that, for years, Iran’s annual total support for Palestinian groups in Gaza, not just including military assistance, was valued at an estimated $100 million . There were reports in 2019 that authorities in Tehran had bumped that up to $30 million a month , which, if true, would have been a massive increase in funding, in exchange for intelligence regarding Israeli missile capabilities . Those reports came months before the Tamir seeker section was recovered in Gaza in November of that year. There are of course other cost considerations to take into account. Each rocket that an Iron Dome battery successfully intercepts prevents potential loss of life and property damage within Israel. The 2014 Gaza War led to nearly $40 million in insurance claims over damage from rockets and mortar rounds and around $1 billion in estimated indirect economic losses . With all this in mind, it is hard to argue against Iron Dome on cost grounds. It has been a highly effective and life-saving system, so far. Iron Dome’s capabilities and its costs notwithstanding, it’s important to note that no missile or rocket defense system is perfect . Though they offer added layers of defense, they can only also present clear incentives to opponents to simply field more weapons to try to overwhelm them. This reality applies to trying to protect against threats ranging from lower-end unguided rockets to intercontinental ballistic missiles . I think it is safe to say we are seeing this strategy play out in Israel right now, at least to some degree. No matter what, at least based on the current cycle of rocket attacks and Israeli retaliation, it seems very possible that the total number of rockets fired at Israel from Gaza in this new conflict will approach or exceed the figure from the war in 2014, and do so in a far more compressed timeframe. With that in mind, it seems equally likely that this current fighting will provide an array of new data, which will be of interest to Israel and its opponents, as well as other purchasers and prospective purchasers of the system, on the overall utility of Iron Dome against continuous larger-scale attacks.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 18, 2021",The Army Is Testing Arming Its Light Tactical Vehicles With Drones (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is experimenting with launching the Area-I small Agile-Launch Tactically Integrated Unmanned System drone, or ALTIUS, from an ultralight tactical vehicle. The drone has already been launched from Army MQ-1C unmanned aircraft and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters , as well as from an Air Force XQ-58A Valkyrie stealthy unmanned aircraft, but this is the first time that we’ve seen it used by the U.S. military in this type of vehicle-borne capacity. A photo posted to Twitter today by the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team shows the familiar shape of a brightly painted ALTIUS launched from one of two Pneumatically Integrated Launch Systems (PILS) attached to what appears to be a DAGOR ultra-light tactical vehicle. According to Area-I, which was acquired by Anduril Industries in April, the ALTIUS-600 has also been launched in the past from C-130, AC-130J, P-3, and civilian aircraft, as well as from undisclosed ground vehicles, although few details are available. A UH-60M Black Hawk launches an ALTIUS-600 drone during a test last year., U.S. ARMY One image provided by Area-I shows a twin-tube launcher assembly mounted on a commercial-style pickup truck that looks very similar to the one the Army is now testing on the DAGOR. A low-resolution image showing a pickup truck-mounted twin-tube launch system for the ALTIUS-600., Area-I The ALTIUS-600 model weighs between 20-27 pounds, depending on payload, has a range of 276 miles, and endurance of at least four hours. As well as the PILS, the drone can be launched from the Common Launch Tube (CLT) and the Reconfigurable Integrated-weapons Platform (RIwP). A wide variety of payloads can be carried, covering the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and signals intelligence (SIGINT) missions, as well as warheads for offensive missions, and even a counter-drone weapon, the MoRFIUS , or Mobile Radio Frequency-Integrated UAS Suppressor, developed by Lockheed Martin. While not explicitly advertised by the manufacturer, it’s also clear that electronic warfare would be a key mission for the drone, using a stand-in jammer payload, for example. The exact context of this Army experiment is unclear, but the Army tweet indicates that it was conducted as part of the Edge 21 exercise. Edge 21, which stands for Experimental Demonstration Gateway Exercise, is currently taking place at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. It’s an aviation-focused series of maneuvers that aims to help pave the way for the new rotorcraft planned under the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. The exercise also features a “penetration phase [that] focuses on neutralizing long-range systems and contesting enemy maneuver forces from operational and strategic distances,” according to Defense News . #EDGE21 the ultimate soldier touch point. @82ndABNDiv @devcom_avmc pic.twitter.com/yfR58KstoI — Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team (@FVLCFT) May 13, 2021 Interestingly, the DAGOR, or Deployable Advanced Ground Off-road, which is produced by the Government & Defense division of Polaris, was a losing entry in the Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) program , which sought to provide the Army with a new, lightweight, all-terrain troop carrier. However, the 82nd Airborne Division had at least some DAGORs as of 2017 and one of these vehicles from that batch, or another previous evaluation of the type, might have been used in this ALTIUS test. The original tweet tagged the official Twitter account of the 82nd Airborne and the division is known to be participating in Edge 21. Paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division practice maneuvering a DAGOR down a hill at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in 2017., U.S. Army/Spc. John Lytle In the past, we have suggested that the ALTIUS-600 could be a potential candidate for the Army’s new family of air-launched multi-purpose unmanned aircraft with swarming capabilities, which you can read more about here . Now it seems that it may also find a role in a vehicle-launched form as well. That could bring the Army closer to fielding the kind of autonomous drone swarm that’s being investigated under the cross-service Low-Cost Cruise Missile (LCCM) research and development program. So far this has focused on the Raytheon Coyote Block 3 version , together with a launcher, a jam-resistant datalink, and a software package to allow collaborative operations. In one test at the end of last year, a swarm of LCCM vehicles was launched and then “dynamically reacted to a prioritized threat environment while conducting collaborative target identification and allocation along with synchronized attacks.” The ALTIUS-600., U.S. ARMY By employing vehicle-launched small drones in significant numbers, the Army could expand its capabilities for missions including ISR and electronic warfare, as well as launch loitering “ suicide drones ” to attack targets in networked autonomous swarms . So far, these kinds of proposals have looked mainly at air-launched drones, under the Air Launch Effects (ALE) effort, but there is no reason why the same kinds of collaborative technologies, and even drone hardware, could also be adapted to ground launch. After all, the ALTIUS-600 is designed for both ground and air launch and Area-I itself has talked about turning this particular drone into a loitering munition . A graphic showing how various types of Air Launch Effects fired from various platforms could be employed on a future battlefield., U.S. ARMY Meanwhile, the addition of the launch tubes on a DAGOR, or similar vehicle, is interesting in itself since it offers capabilities beyond launching drones like the ALTIUS. The CLT, for example, is becoming an increasingly popular method of launching small payloads across the U.S. military and can accommodate others stores, such as Raytheon’s AGM-176 Griffin missile. A guided missile of this kind could have an application for “neutralizing long-range systems and contesting enemy maneuver forces,” as described in the game plan for Edge 21. However, we still don’t know what kind of payloads were used by the ALTIUS-600 in these maneuvers and whether they were used in an offensive capacity or not. Whether or not the Army is interested in this configuration of tactical vehicle and lightweight drone specifically, the combination of the DAGOR and ALTIUS-600 points to very realistic future capabilities. Moreover, using an ultra-light air-droppable and potentially internally transportable vehicle to carry this kind of drone could give smaller units entirely new capabilities, both in terms of ISR and situational awareness and extend-range strike. That would not only be of interest to the Army but potentially also to the Marines and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), both of which are increasingly interested in the capabilities offered by loitering munitions. In this way, a small team of infantry would potentially be able to deploy precision-guided loitering munitions to provide an effect disproportionate to their size, allowing attacks against lightly armored targets or even heavier armored vehicles, at standoff distances. In urban environments especially, having access to vehicle-launched drones to provide persistent overwatch would also be an enormous advantage, for regular operations and special forces work alike. Without a doubt, the appearance of the ALTIUS-600 on the DAGOR vehicle is an interesting development for the Army and for drone warfare. We will be sure to follow developments and report back when any new details emerge. Update, May 14: Following the publication of this article, Area-I, the manufacturer of the ALTIUS-600 got in touch with us to provide a few more details. Firstly, the launch system used in the Edge 21 test was the company’s own Pneumatically Integrated Launch System, otherwise known as PILS, not a Common Launch Tube (CLT) as originally described in the article. PILS has been successfully demonstrated across multiple platforms for a year at least, Area-I tells us. The firm also provided us with a higher-resolution photo of PILS in use at Project Convergence last year. This was an Army exercise intended to demonstrate the kinds of weapons and technologies likely to be used on the battlefield in the 2030s and beyond.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to discussions of government secrecy, much of the conversation tends to revolve around the Department of Defense (DOD) or the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). After all, the U.S. military develops many of the United States’ most sensitive weapon systems used to defend America and project its power globally, and the IC gathers and analyzes sensitive information on foreign threats and external national security matters. Each year, the budget requests from the U.S. military are packed with classified and Special Access Programs , or SAPs, sporting vague code names, many of which never see the light of day. When we talk of the “black world,” most often that conversation centers around these programs and technologies suspected to be housed deep within the classified ends of the Pentagon and its various service branches. Often left out of this conversation is the fact that there is a wholly separate cabinet-level department of the U.S. government that is arguably even more opaque in terms of secrecy and oversight than the Department of Defense. Over the last few years, allegations of secret, exotic technologies have reinvigorated claims that the DOD may be concealing scientific breakthroughs from the American public. However, if the U.S. government, or some faction within it, hypothetically came across a groundbreaking development in energy production or applied physics, a very strong case could be made that such a revolution would likely be housed deep within the Department of Energy (DOE) rather than DOD. The DOE is tasked with maintaining America’s nuclear weapons stockpile, among many other things. , DOE Laying The Atomic Groundwork The Department of Energy was officially formed in 1977, although its roots were planted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. The Atomic Energy Act established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), an agency designed to manage and control the United States’ nuclear technology under a civilian regime, rather than one overseen directly by the military itself. This is a gray area of sorts, however, as there are and have always been numerous positions at both the DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) filled by uniformed military officers. For example, NNSA’s Deputy Administrator for Naval Reactors, who also heads up the joint Navy-DOE Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program , is and has always been an admiral. Ultimately, one of the main points of the AEC was to bring all of the United States’ nuclear technologies firmly together under one roof. From the beginning, the AEC focused almost exclusively on designing and manufacturing nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors for naval use . With the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the AEC also began exclusively regulating the growing commercial nuclear power industry. Like the DOE of today, AEC was focused on much more than simply the weaponization of nuclear technologies. Many atomic scientists intended nuclear explosives to be used for much more than simply weapons. As early as the 1950s, scientists at what are today Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories held classified discussions “to discuss the possibilities of using energy unleashed by nuclear explosions to produce power, dig excavations, and produce isotopes.” The AEC continued looking into these industrial uses of atomic technologies throughout the 1960s and early 1970s as part of its Plowshare Program . President Harry Truman signing the Atomic Energy Act of 1946., Wikimedia Commons Motivated in large part by the oil crisis of the early 1970s, the United States government under President Jimmy Carter passed The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977. With that, the DOE as we know it today was formed by bringing together many different energy and science programs and administrations under one roof. This new department would oversee “ long-term, high-risk research and development of energy technology, federal power marketing, energy conservation, the nuclear weapons program, energy regulatory programs, and a central energy data collection and analysis program.” One of the main tasks of DOE today is to develop, test, and maintain the United States’ nuclear weapons stockpile. While the DOD develops, operates, and maintains the systems that deliver those nuclear weapons, the DOE is the department actually tasked with the development and acquisition of nuclear warhead technologies. DOE handles all functions not related to warhead delivery : storing and securing nuclear warheads that are not deployed onboard DOD systems, securing the materials that are used in nuclear weapons, and dismantling older nuclear weapons which have been removed from the national stockpile. To facilitate cooperation between the two, the Nuclear Weapons Council was established in 1986 . This council consists of senior level officials from both the DOE and the DOD who coordinate on interagency activities related to the maintenance of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. An organizational chart from the 2018 DOD manual “DOD Procedures for Joint DOD-Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) Nuclear Weapon Life-Cycle Activities.”, DOD OIG In addition to controlling and producing America’s nuclear power and weapons technologies, today’s DOE fosters research and innovation into clean energy solutions, energy efficiency, climate change mitigation, and alternative fuel technologies for the transportation sector. As its name implies, DOE has a hand in all of America’s short- and long-term energy needs. That’s far from all that the DOE oversees, however, as it also conducts a significant amount of secret and classified research and manufacturing. Secrecy And Classification In The Department Of Energy In many cases, DOE has its own classification systems and policies, some of which are even classified themselves . The highest level of these DOE security clearances is the Q clearance, equivalent to a Top Secret clearance in the DOD. That doesn’t mean that anyone with a Q clearance can access all classified information overseen by DOE. According to its Personnel Security FAQs page , “for access to some classified information, such as Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or Special Access Programs (SAPS), additional requirements or special conditions may be imposed by the information owner even if the person is otherwise eligible to be granted a security clearance or access authorization.” DOE Security Clearance Chart listing various clearances for different levels of information: Confidential (C), Secret (S), Top Secret (TS), Restricted Data (RD), Formerly Restricted Data (FRD), and National Security Information (NSI), special nuclear material (SNM), Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information (CNWDI). , DOE Groups, such as the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), through its Project on Government Secrecy , are actively pursuing further declassification of DOE records and have managed to get the DOE to declassify many records related to American nuclear technology . Despite these efforts, the DOE still remains one of the most secretive institutions of the U.S. government. Steven Aftergood, director of FAS’s Project on Government Secrecy, told The War Zone that these extreme levels of secrecy were baked right into the DOE from the beginning, explaining: One of the unique features of government secrecy at the Department of Energy is that it is shaped in part by law – the Atomic Energy Act – and not just by executive order. So it can be even slower and more difficult to change or to update than at some other agencies. Not only that, DOE secrecy policy on nuclear weapons is intertwined to a great extent with the policy of the Department of Defense. When the two agencies differ on whether to declassify and disclose information, either one can veto the decision. We’ve seen this happen repeatedly. So, for example, the size of the US nuclear arsenal was declassified most recently in 2017 . We asked for the number of weapons to be updated in 2018 and 2019, and DOE was willing to do so, but the Department of Defense blocked the disclosure . Protecting this highly sensitive information is obviously a top priority for the DOE, and for that reason, the agency operates its own independent intelligence and counterintelligence arms, which are part of its relatively extensive and uniquely equipped apparatus of security forces . The DOE’s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (OICI) was founded along with the Department in 1977, and aims to “identify and mitigate threats to U.S. national security and the DOE Enterprise and inform national security decision making through scientific and technical expertise.” Members of NNSA’s Special Response Force train to protect a Safeguards Transporter (SGT) tractor-trailer used to transport nuclear weapons and related cargoes. This picture offers a rare look at the inside of the armored doors on the cab., GAO The OICI answers to the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Energy. A declassified and highly redacted copy of the DOE’s 2001 Classification Guide for Intelligence Information outlines the scope of the Office of Intelligence, specifically, within OICI. The document states that as a member of the Intelligence Community (IC), the DOE shall: Participate with the Department of State in overtly collecting information with respect to foreign energy matters; Produce and disseminate foreign intelligence necessary for the [Department of Energy] Secretary to fulfill his/her responsibilities; Participate in formulating intelligence collection and analysis requirements where the special expert capability of the Department can contribute; and Provide expert technical, analytical, and research capabilities to other agencies within the IC. In 1999, Congress created another semi-autonomous DOE outfit known as the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to oversee military applications of nuclear sciences. NNSA’s duties include maintaining and protecting the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, attempting to counter nuclear proliferation, and responding to nuclear emergencies. NNSA is part of DOE, but operates with significant autonomy given its role and the sensitive nature of its work. There had even been an initial proposal to establish it as a completely independent entity. In yet another example of the many gray areas in terms of civilian vs. military control of the DOE, the first person to head up NNSA was John Alexander Gordon, a uniformed Air Force officer (who was also CIA Deputy Director at the time). According to the FY 2021 Department of Energy budget request , NNSA requested over $26 billion in 2021 for defense activities, while $1 billion was requested for undisclosed “Other Defense Activities.” In 2017, the Congressional Research Service reported that roughly 3% of National Defense funding went to the Department of Energy and other federal agencies for “Atomic Energy Defense Activities,” which is one of NNSA’s primary tasks. One of the other main objectives of NNSA is overseeing and operating some of the most secure facilities in the United States, including several national laboratories, the Nevada National Security Site , the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas, which produces nuclear weapons, and the Y-12 National Security Complex near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which produces all of the United States’ enriched uranium. Y-12 is also home to the production facility for the mysterious Fogbank , a material so sensitive to U.S. nuclear weapon technology that its manufacturing process, composition, use, and even the material itself remain classified. In fact, Fogbank is wrapped in so much secrecy that the DOE once “forgot” how to manufacture it due to a lack of actual records about how to make it and dwindling institutional knowledge as a result of read-in employees aging out of the workforce. The Y-12 facility near Oak Ridge, Tennessee., Wikimedia Commons Among the other facilities the NNSA oversees is the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), formerly known as the Nevada Test Site. The site, which boasts extreme security measures including its own security forces, stretches across some 1,400 square miles of desert and includes a nuclear weapons assembly plant, an experimental flight test facility, and explosive testing sites. The Air Force’s Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), which includes the notorious Area 51, surrounds the NNSS on three sides. Public Domain The Nevada National Security Site contains many DOE facilities for nuclear research including subcritical experiments and special nuclear material staging. The NNSS is also home to underground test facilities, and is among the United States’ most highly classified, restricted access areas. The NNSS offers limited tours, but these are conducted under the utmost security at pre-arranged times. During the Cold War, the Nevada Test Site, now NNSS, was home to hundreds of above-ground nuclear weapons tests which spread radioactive fallout across large swaths of the American West and Midwest. The DOE also maintains many “tombs” throughout the desert, where it stores the radioactive remains of nuclear experiments, spent nuclear fuel or enrichment products, and other remnants of America’s nuclear activities that are too dangerous to be disposed of anywhere else. In another example of highly compartmentalized knowledge being lost due to workforce losses, a dismantling program had to be specially designed for the B53 nuclear bomb due to the fact that the scientists who knew its inner workings were either retired or dead. That program concluded in 2013 when the last one of these 10,000-pound bombs was successfully dismantled . More recently, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published the 2021 report “DOD and DOE Face Challenges Mitigating Risks to U.S. Deterrence Efforts” about the Nuclear Triad, which presently consists of Ohio class ballistic missile submarines , Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles , and B-2 and B-52 bomber aircraft . The GAO report found that DOE frequently “loses” valuable knowledge about its highly explosive weapon systems due to its knowledge base growing old: As we reported in June 2019, there are about 100 different nuclear weapon components that contain explosive materials, some of which are highly specialized and limited in supply. For example, only a single container of one specialized material remains. DOE officials and contractor representatives said that the agency is working to replenish the supply of such materials, but the agency faces challenges because some specialized explosive materials were created decades ago, and the knowledge base to successfully produce them is now gone. Moreover, even if DOE can replicate the “lost recipes”  for specialized explosive materials, it faces the challenge of finding suppliers willing and able to provide small quantities of specialized raw materials that meet the exacting standards required for use in nuclear weapons. Clearly, the extent to which knowledge and operations within DOE are protected can make it difficult to understand or even be aware of the full scope of its activities. To help us contextualize the high levels of secrecy and classification at the Department of Energy, The War Zone spoke with nuclear historian Dr. Alex Wellerstein, Director of Science and Technology Studies at the Stevens Institute in New Jersey. Wellerstein’s latest book , Restricted Data: The History of Nuclear Secrecy in the United States , “traces the complex evolution of the US nuclear secrecy regime from the first whisper of the atomic bomb through the mounting tensions of the Cold War and into the early twenty-first century.” Wellerstein told The War Zone that the levels of secrecy at the DOE are not common knowledge, saying: I think most people are surprised to learn that there are basically two classification systems in the United States. There’s national defense information which is all the secrets and top secrets, everything to do with the military and the state department and all of that stuff, then there’s nuclear stuff. It has a different statutory basis, the Atomic Energy Act, it’s handled differently and conceived of differently by the Restricted Data clause , it has its own clearances, and is meant to be a parallel classification system. The fact that only nuclear weapons have this, that no other weapons technology has its own category – not even biological weapons or chemical weapons, they’re national defense information – is highly reflective of its origins in the Cold War. When the first nuclear technologies were developed and the AEC was formed, the U.S. government saw a need for higher levels of secrecy in order to protect these terrifying new weapons. That’s not to say that those higher levels of secrecy were approved of by the entire government or even the AEC. “It’s been a point of contention since the very beginning whether this particular technology is so dangerous or so apt to carry secrets that it needs its own separate classification systems,” Wellerstein says. “The secrecy was created out of fear, out of a belief that nuclear technology could be easily communicated as information. Whether that’s true has been debated since the 1940s.” Many experts have questioned whether these levels of extreme secrecy are beneficial or even needed. Many of the scientists working on the Manhattan Project or in science administration during World War II felt that secrecy would not be an effective way to control nuclear weapons, and that international agreements would ultimately be the only way. “Any competent nation with any sort of technical or industrial base would, if they devoted resources to it, would be able to reinvent them – even if the secrecy was total, which it wasn’t,” Wellerstein says. “I don’t think that secrecy is what keeps new nations from developing nuclear weapons and I don’t think it’s what’s keeping terrorists from getting nuclear weapons. I think its impact is not that large on preventing those kinds of things. Its impact on policy and public knowledge is very high by contrast.” Still, Wellerstein adds, “I’ve talked with government officials who emphasize that nuclear weapons are so disproportionately powerful that maybe it’s worth being disproportionately cautious about the unknown.” Image of “The Gadget” being prepared for detonation at the Trinity test site. It was used for the first atomic weapon explosion on July 16th, 1945. , Public Domain Again, it’s natural that the DOE would not disclose specific parts of its most sensitive and dangerous weapons and associated technologies due to the ramifications of these potentially falling into the wrong hands. Still, by concealing many of its activities under the blanket of national security, NNSA and DOE leave plenty of room for activities or research programs that are never disclosed to the public. The Question Of Oversight Even with the high level of compartmentalization and autonomy surrounding the DOE, as well as America’s nuclear weapons stockpile, the department has its own oversight bureaucracies, as well. After all, if you allow only the DOE to control and produce your nuclear weapons and related research, you also need your own separate oversight systems in place to watch over how that control and production is managed. To that end, the DOE has its own Office of Inspector General (DOE OIG), whose mission is to “help the Department and the American taxpayer” by identifying management shortfalls, assessing vulnerabilities, auditing the agency’s financial activities, and investigating crimes against the Department. The DOE OIG advises and makes key recommendations to the Secretary of Energy. A slide from a presentation given by the DOE OIG at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Regulatory Information Conference in March 2019., DOE OIG Aside from the OIG, the DOE is advised by the independent Federal Energy Regulation Commission , which oversees the transmission and sale of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce, including oil pipelines. The DOE also has an Oversight Board , which monitors the environmental impacts of its operations specifically in New Mexico, including activities at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Sandia National Laboratories /New Mexico (SNL/NM), and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). There are a variety of mechanisms through which the U.S. government exercises oversight of the DOE and NNSA. The U.S. Congress, for one, has two subcommittees devoted to energy-related issues including nuclear weapons and facilities. The Energy Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Subcommittee on Energy of the Senate Committee on Energy and National Resources oversee the creation of legislation regarding a wide range of energy issues beyond nuclear matters alone. The House’s Energy Subcommittee oversees nuclear energy, nuclear facilities, the Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, while also legislating on national energy policy, fossil fuels, and other government activities affecting energy matters. While the Senate’s Subcommittee on Energy has oversight jurisdiction over nuclear fuels research and development, nuclear commercialization projects, nuclear fuel cycle policy, and the DOE National Laboratories, it also oversees energy-related issues such as fossil fuel management, pipeline development, strategic fuel reserves, and sustainable energy research. Steven Aftergood told The War Zone that, while there are Congressional structures in place to provide oversight of the DOE, “ the quality of oversight depends on many factors, including Members’ level of interest, the expertise of committee staff, the cooperation of the agency, and the attention of the press and public interest organizations… With respect to secrecy and classification at DOE, my impression is that congressional oversight is nearly non-existent. But that is true regarding classification policy across the board.” It is certainly true that these committees have a huge portfolio and it isn’t clear how they would effectively oversee a huge swathe of deeply classified programs the DOE is executing at any given time, some of which have many sub-programs and unique facets beyond their topline justification. To bolster DOE oversight, Congress established the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) in 1988 as an independent organization that would provide oversight of the DOE’s nuclear production and testing facilities. Through this board, Congress is theoretically granted oversight of the DOE’s and NNSA’s operations and management, and Congress is responsible for the authorization and appropriation of funds for America’s Nuclear Security Enterprise. The DNFSB was set up as an independent oversight organization, which would offer recommendations to the Secretary of Energy that concerned public health and safety at the DOE’s nuclear weapons complex. Members of the board are appointed by the U.S. Senate. A full record of correspondence between the DOE and the DNFSB can be found on the DOE’s website , including all recommendations the board made between 2012 and today. That doesn’t mean the DNFSB has always had full cooperation from the DOE. As recently as 2018, there were complaints that the DOE was stonewalling the DNFSB and preventing it from carrying out its oversight duties. According to one Senate staffer who helped draft the original DNFSB legislation, the DOE was trying to “isolate and fence off” the board, as part of a “constant effort to chip away at the ability of the board to do oversight.” There have even been calls from within the board to abolish itself entirely, and the NNSA has frequently tried to limit the board’s access to information. A DOE special investigative panel concluded in 1999 that the department is “a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself” and that “accountability at DOE has been spread so thinly and erratically that it is now almost impossible to find.” The panel added that, “Never before has the panel found an agency with the bureaucratic insolence to dispute, delay, and resist implementation of a Presidential directive on security,” and that “Never have the members of the Special Investigative Panel witnessed a bureaucratic culture so thoroughly saturated with cynicism and disregard for authority.” One reason for this dysfunction could be that on the legislative side, the DOE does not get the public or official scrutiny the DOD or the IC gets. “What’s interesting to me about the AEC and the DOE is that unlike a lot of federal agencies, they don’t have natural allies in the political ecosystem,” Dr. Alex Wellerstein told The War Zone . “They don’t have a constituency in the same way that, say, the Dept. of Agriculture does, or how the DOD has the military, for example.” Bruce Hamilton, who at the time was chair of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, said DOE officials routinely flout new regulations which were to limit the amount of information that the DNFSB could obtain directly from nuclear facilities and instead restrict the board from obtaining the same information directly from DOE administration. “We have repeatedly heard from DOE representatives that they really don’t mean what they wrote (in the rule) or at least that they really don’t intend to follow what they wrote,” said Hamilton, adding that this is a “particularly bizarre argument coming out of the nuclear culture that has set the standard for following the written rules to the letter.” Those new measures, outlined in DOE Order 140.1 A , also excluded many of the DOE’s weapons complex facilities from DNFSB’s formal safety recommendations, and changed the definition of “public health and safety” under DNFSB oversight to exclude the safety of workers at nuclear facilities In 2020, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, even went so far as to accuse DOE officials of being “rogue actors” who to “undermine” the security of America’s nuclear activities. The Department of Energy Organization and Management Improvement Act, introduced in the House in September 2020 by then-Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, would, if made law, give the DOE even more control over the NNSA . This means it could operate with even less government oversight than it already has now. Holding The Keys To America’s Most Sensitive Research Aside from developing and maintaining the United States nuclear weapons stockpile, there is a great deal of advanced research being performed at Department of Energy laboratories, including pioneering work on some of the most cutting-edge topics science has to offer. Nearly $5.9 billion was allocated to the DOE’s Office of Science (SC) in 2021 to “deliver scientific discoveries and major scientific tools to transform our understanding of nature and advance the energy, economic and national security of the United States.” DOE A large part of this research is conducted at the 17 United States Department of Energy National Laboratories and Technology Centers, which are spread across the country. Much of the research and technology development conducted at these labs goes straight to the DOD: LANL has conducted space-based directed energy weapon experiments for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA); the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has developed advanced munitions for the Air Force; Sandia has had a hand in producing some of America’s first hypersonic weapon prototypes . A slide from 2021 highlighting the unique capabilities Los Alamos National Laboratory offers the DOD, including technology demonstration., LANL One of the reasons why the DOE-controlled laboratories develop advanced weapons technologies designed for transfer to the DOD is that they, as well as various other facilities today under NNSA, have the capacity for specialized research and development and unique manufacturing work that just cannot be done in many places. If you need to do novel manufacturing on a large scale, and are looking to do so within a system that already has significant security measures in place, the DOE laboratories are the place to go, and it’s been that way for decades. For instance, when the Air Force decided to try using massive floating bombs during the Vietnam War to blow up the Thanh Hoa bridge, there was simply no one else within the national security apparatus besides Y-12 at Oak Ridge that could build large metal structures to the kind of exacting specifications the service needed. Some details of that top-secret mission, known as Operation Carolina Moon, are still classified. Hand-drawn Air Force art depicting the design and basic concept of operation of a floating bomb, built in part at Oak Ridge, which was developed as part of Operation Carolina Moon, which was obtained by Joseph Trevithick via the Freedom of Information Act., USAF via FOIA More recently, the DOE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Defense to confirm and enhance the “the longstanding partnership between DOE and DOD on space-related research and technology development in support of U.S. national space policy goals.” In a press release that accompanied the MOU, then-Deputy Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes called the agreement “historic,” and claimed it “lays out the framework for DOE to harness the world’s greatest science and technology researchers at DOE’s National Labs, and program offices, to augment DOD’s critical national security space mission and will play a crucial role for future space developments across the two departments.” More specifically, the MOU establishes joint working groups and promotes scientific exchange between the two departments in emerging and disruptive research fields such as advanced power and propulsion, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, next-generation communications, and autonomous or remotely piloted vehicles. That MOU came on the heels of one of President Donald Trump’s final Executive Orders that called for the DOE to work together with NASA and the Department of Defense to research and develop miniaturized nuclear reactor technologies for space exploration and powering military bases. An NNSA slide highlighting the multi-agency efforts the MOU will support., NNSA The DOE also currently operates a Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) program , an Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program, and a Nuclear Sciences program , the latter of which seeks to put together “a roadmap of matter that will help unlock the secrets of how the universe is put together.” To that end, in April 2020, the DOE put together a 10-year plan to invest in plasma physics research encompassing both “discovery” plasma sciences, which involves understanding the properties of plasma and non-energy applications of plasmas; and fusion science and technology, which is related to fusion energy generation. “Research in high energy physics not only advances our understanding of the universe, but is also critical to maintaining American leadership in science,” former Under Secretary of Energy for Science Paul Dabbar said in a 2019 DOE press release . “These research efforts, at dozens of universities across the nation, will not only yield fresh insights into such problems as dark matter and dark energy, but also help build and sustain the nation’s science and technology workforce.” A nuclear reactor at Palo Verde in Arizona. , Energy.gov DOE also funds research initiatives in sustainable and alternative energies, AI and machine learning, quantum computing, and even genomics, one of the more controversial areas of its scientific endeavors. According to the “Genomics” section on Energy.gov , the Human Genome Project was initially launched by DOE to better understand the genetic effects of radiation exposure, “but there was clear awareness that success in the project would have much broader consequences for both science and society.” DOE has quite a checkered past when it comes to its biological experimentation. In 1994, then-President Bill Clinton formed an advisory committee to look into DOE’s human radiation experiments, releasing nearly two million pages of formerly classified documents that detailed unwitting human test subjects such as orphans, hospital patients, or mentally disabled children being fed or injected radioactive materials. In the Executive Summary released by the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, it was reported that close to 4,000 human radiation experiments were carried out by the U.S. government between 1944 and 1974. The Committee’s report was conveniently, or coincidentally, released by the White House on Tuesday, October 3, 1995, the same day that the O.J. Simpson murder trial verdict was announced. That report did not stop DOE’s interest in human subject research (HSR). As recently as 2018, it was still actively conducting classified research on human subjects , arguing that “research using human subjects provides important medical and scientific benefits to individuals and to society.” Because many of these projects use code names such as “Moose Drool” and “Little Workers,” it’s unknown what exactly they are studying with these human subjects. DOE via FOIA When it comes to whether there is a chance that advanced energy research or other groundbreaking scientific breakthroughs could possibly be locked away deep behind DOE secrecy, Wellerstein told The War Zone it’s certainly possible, although it’s more likely funding, rather than secrecy, is what keeps these programs in the dark. “It’s possible, although a lot of the peaceful aspects have been declassified over the years starting in the 1950s. Whether that’s all been beneficial or not is a topic for debate since a lot of those things are dual-use, like reactors. But it’s always possible. The most important thing for the development of reactor technology or say, nuclear fusion, is less the classification, but funding.” Wellerstein told The War Zone that there are plenty of avenues by which the DOE might use its budget for classified or non-disclosed activities. According to the FY 2021 DOE budget request , for example, the NNSA was allocated $15.6 billion for “Weapons Activities to maintain the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nuclear stockpile, continue the nuclear modernization program, and modernize and recapitalize NNSA’s nuclear security infrastructure portfolio.” In the volume of the budget request dedicated to descriptions of the NNSA’s spending , there is little clarification as to the specific technologies and capabilities the NNSA is developing: The Weapon Technology and Manufacturing Maturation program is responsible for developing agile, affordable, assured, and responsive technologies and capabilities for nuclear stockpile sustainment and modernization to enable Defense Programs’ mission success and the future success of the NSE [Nuclear Security Enterprise] and will continue these activities in FY 2021. The core areas of work include agile, assured, and affordable technologies; partnership with stakeholders to meet stockpile and customer requirements; qualification and certification; and skilled technical workforce and enhanced capabilities. A W80 nuclear warhead undergoing handling., Public Domain Keepers of America’s Secrets With both the extreme levels of secrecy surrounding much of the Department of Energy’s research and even the scope of DOE’s research, it’s possible, if not probable, that there are more radical and more exotic developments than these hidden behind the doors of DOE laboratories. It would be hard to argue that breakthroughs in advanced physics, nuclear aerospace propulsion, or energy production would live somewhere other than the Department of Energy. While that much may ultimately be impossible to verify, it certainly seems possible that the DOE could conceal such a breakthrough given how compartmentalized and classified much of its work remains and how specialized and advanced its facilities are. And once again, while maintaining a very close relationship with the U.S. military, as the two institutions are tied together strategically very tightly, the DOE really doesn’t get the attention the DOD does and that may be true in terms of oversight, as well. Still, it makes complete sense that DOE would be one of the most secretive departments of the United States government. Nuclear technologies are among the most dangerous and sensitive in the world, and the risk of nuclear weaponry falling into the wrong hands remains near the top of the most pressing threats faced by the modern world. But more so, the nuclear secrets that underpin America’s nuclear deterrent, as well as those that could define it in the future, would be considered among the country’s ‘crown jewels’ when it comes to sensitive technologies. All this seems to provide a uniquely fertile and undisturbed environment in which bringing new, highly powerful, and potentially very destructive technologies from concept to reality could flourish. In fact, one could argue that is historically bred right into the DNA of the agency. Unfortunately, all this is hard to quantify, but then again, that seems to be the point.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 25, 2021",Palestinian Militants Are Now Launching Suicide Drones At Israel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After days of firing massive rocket barrages at Israel from the Gaza Strip, which have overwhelmed Israel’s Iron Dome defense systems , Palestinian militants have begun employing a new weapon: Shehab suicide drones. Hamas’ militant wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, says that these were developed and built locally, but, while they are smaller, they also have some broad similarities to designs of Iranian origin that have been employed extensively by the Houthis in Yemen . Palestinian militants prepare to launch a Shehab drone, at left, and one of the drones seen through an infrared camera, at right, Hamas/IDF The first image of Shehab, which Hamas does not appear to have previously disclosed the existence of, came in a video, shot using some kind of infrared targeting system or some other kind of full-motion video camera on an aircraft, that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released of one of these drones being shot down earlier today. The Al Qassam Brigades subsequently released their own undated video showing militants handling and then launching Shehabs. The use of these unmanned aircraft is now a component of some of the worst fighting between Palestinian militant groups and the IDF in years, which you can read more about here and that is still escalating. Unguided rockets of various types remain the weapon for choice for the Al Qassam Brigades, as well as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which have, together, now fired more than 1,700 rockets at Israel from Gaza in the past three days. This in turn has prompted retaliatory Israeli air and artillery strikes, including numerous targeted killings. One of those targeted operations was carried out earlier today against the home of Samer Abu-Daka, the head of Hamas’ drone units. The IDF had already reported intercepting drones flying from Gaza, as well as striking drone launch units there, in the course of the recent fighting. However, it is unclear if any of those previous instances involved the Shehab. The exact origins of the Shehab, a relatively small pusher-prop design with a tubular central fuselage, a low-mounted rear wing, and a high-mounted canard-type forward wing, are unclear. While Hamas’ claims it is entirely indigenous development, this drone’s general configuration, at least externally, is similar in some respects to the Houthis’ Qasef-series , as well as the Iranian Ababil-T , from which the former is at least derived. Experts and observers have, however, already noted that there the Shehab is not a one-for-one copy of members of the Qasef family or the Ababil-T. For one, Shehab appears to be notably smaller overall. The exact size and shape of its wings are different from the Houthi and Iranian designs and its nose cone is notably blunter, too. There are some clear similarities between the Shehab’s engine and the ones found on Qasef-series drones. At the same time, The Daily Beast ‘s Adam Rawnsley, who has been following Iranian and Iranian inspired drone developments closely for years now, noted on Twitter that a United Nations panel of experts, as well as Conflict Armament Research , an independent organization, have said that those Houthi unmanned aircraft use various engines that are readily available on the commercial market. There are no clear views of the marking on the servo motors that move the control surfaces on the Shehab, or other internal components, which have provided evidence of Iranian ties to other drone designs recovered overseas in the past. Hamas’ drone design also has a visible commercial GPS module, which would almost certainly be used to send it to a specific fixed location using preprogrammed coordinates, but there’s no clear indication, one way or another, if that came by way of Iran. Of course, Shehab’s distinct qualities do not preclude some kind of Iranian involvement or influence in its design. There have also already been indications from Yemen that the regime in Tehran may provide distinct derivatives of its own drones and missiles, or designs for them, to foreign proxies, possibly to provide plausible deniability. It’s also not necessarily surprising that Shehab is smaller than the Qasef or Ababil-T designs, the distances involved in attacking Israel from Gaza are much shorter than those between launch sites in Yemen and targets in Saudi Arabia, for instance. “What we now have in theatres like Gaza and Yemen is a concerted Iranian effort to enable the local production of rather simple systems which seem to be specially designed with that purpose in mind. Add to that local autonomy and sub-standard manufacturing,” Fabian Hinz, an independent analyst who worked as a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in the past, wrote on Twitter. “Other systems (like the Yemeni Quds cruise missile or the 358 SAM) seem to be smuggled to proxies from Iran but haven’t been unvealed [sic] in Iran proper (either to maintain deniabiltiy [sic] or because they are custom-tailored to proxy use and not in service with Iran itself).” “The result of both of these trends is that you have systems that look very Iranian in style but are not identical to anything you see in glossy Iranian IRGC footage,” he continued. “So often, instead of looking for matching nuts and bolts look (as you would do for example to identify an exported American missile) it makes more sense to look for signature design features, components and plausability [sic] instead.” “So is it possible that Hamas is cobbling together crude airframes locally and slapping Iranian-transferred electronics in there? Yep,” Rawnsley also wrote on that social media site . “Is it possible they’re just making Iranian inspired drones? Yep.” Regardless of the exact origins of Shehab, it underscores the continued proliferation of lower-end, but nevertheless threatening small unmanned aircraft, including suicide drones and types designed to drop improvised munitions . These present very distinct challenges for defenders compared to more traditional weapons, such as artillery rockets, which generally follow more predictable higher-angle ballistic trajectories, making it easier to spot, track, and potentially intercept them. As already noted, Israel’s Iron Dome defense systems, which are designed primarily to counter lower-end threats, such as rockets and small drones, have been heavily taxed in the recent fighting with Palestinian militants in Gaza. In addition, the video that the IDF released strongly suggests an aircraft was used to intercept at least one of the Shehabs. Using fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters to bring down these drones highlights a significant cost disparity that has also been visible in and around Yemen, as well, with Royal Saudi Air Force F-15 combat jets , which are already not cheap to operate, regularly employing very expensive air-to-air missiles to knock down much lower-cost Houthi Qasefs. All of this is only further evidence of the very real threat that these unmanned systems present, even to advanced, nation-state military forces, something that has been clear for years now , as The War Zone has highlighted on numerous occasions . That Hamas, which operates in the Gaza Strip under one of the most intensive blockades anywhere in the world, can field this kind of capability, on any level, underscores just how low the barrier to entry is and how the use of suicide drones and other small unmanned aircraft is only set to keep growing, including among non-state actors, as time goes on. With no clear end in sight to this current conflict between Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and Israel, we are likely to see more demonstrations of the size and scope of Hamas’ drone arsenal and just how effective it might be.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 18, 2021","Yes, It’s True, The F-22 Isn’t In The Air Force Chief’s Future Fighter Plans","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following the words of Chief of Staff of the Air Force General Charles Q. Brown Jr., yesterday, the military aviation world has been, it’s fair to say, reeling, with the news that the service is planning to do away with its much-vaunted F-22 Raptor stealth fighter . General Brown spoke of a desire to trim the Air Force tactical aviation fleet back to four types of fighter jets, plus the A-10 attack jet , which simply refuses to die . Some of Brown’s original quotes about the Air Force’s ongoing TacAir study were presented in a way that was not necessarily immediately clear. The TacAir study, meanwhile, is part of a wider Air Force assessment of the optimum balance for its future tactical fighter force and is asking some big and difficult questions. The Air Force has now clarified to The War Zone what exactly Brown meant by his “four plus one” aspiration for the service’s tactical aviation fleet. A pair of U.S. Air Force F-22s in formation with an F-15C. Under General Brown’s plan, both these air superiority fighter types could be on the way out., U.S. Air Force The story was broken by Oriana Pawlyk at Military.com , who quoted Brown as saying: “My intent is to get down to about four. And really, a four plus one, because we’re going to have the A-10 for a while … [the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ], which will be the cornerstone, the F-15EX , and then we’re going to have [the F-16 Fighting Falcon ] for a while as well.” According to the Military.com report, Brown didn’t mention the F-22 by name, nor the F-15E Strike Eagle , for that matter, suggesting that the countdown was already on to divest those two types. While there has been talk of the F-15EX potentially replacing the Air Force’s hard-worked F-15E fleet, the Raptor’s place had generally been considered safe until now, since it offers a portfolio of capabilities that are still unmatched by any other fighter. Brown also didn’t mention the fourth platform, although the implication was that this space would be taken by the forthcoming Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, or at least by the sixth-generation fighter portion of it since that ambitious effort likely aims to field a “system of systems,” rather than a single fighter as per the traditional model. Breaking Defense then reported that the four tactical jets that Brown was referring to were the NGAD, F-15EX, F-16, and F-35, but didn’t add anything about the plans for the F-22. However, that source did add that Brown sees a decision on the F-16’s replacement being made in the next “six, seven, eight years,” and that the Viper might be superseded by “more F-35s or something else.” That “something else” refers to the potential all-new fighter jet that Brown first disclosed back in February. At the time, The War Zone looked at the implications of a potential ‘clean-sheet design’ to replace the F-16 and its possible impact on long-held plans to buy 1,763 copies of the F-35A , originally intended as the F-16’s successor. F-22s from the 94th Fighter Squadron, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, and F-35As from the 58th Fighter Squadron, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, during an integration training mission over the Eglin Training Range, Florida., U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Shane A. Cuomo Finally, Defense One weighed in , reporting that Brown said specifically that NGAD would replace the F-22. An Air Force spokesperson has now confirmed to The War Zone that, yes, the four platforms that the Air Force’s top officer was talking about are the NGAD, F-35, F-15EX, and F-16, “plus the A-10 in the near/mid-term.” The current mainstays of the Air Force tactical aviation fleet: A-10, F-22, F-35, F-15C, F-15E, and F-16., U.S. Air Force When asked whether the Air Force is looking at the possibility of retiring the entire F-22 and/or F-15E fleets as part of the TacAir study, as this suggests, the answer was, however, non-committal: “We expect to determine the right mix of aircraft for the future through the ongoing TacAir study,” we were told. “The F-22 is still undergoing modernization,” Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told Air Force Magazine , stepping back further. “There are no plans to retire it in the near term.” Lockheed Martin concept artwork of a tailless, fast, long-range, and very stealthy manned penetrator, providing just one idea of what the manned element of NGAD might look like.  , Lockheed Martin Put together, however, it seems clear that the Air Force Chief of Staff currently favors trimming down the tactical aviation fleet to those four types, including the retirement of the F-22 (and the F-15E). Before #SaveTheRaptor starts trending on Twitter, it’s important to remember that the TacAir study is just that — a study that looks to assesses the optimum balance for the Air Force’s tactical fighter force and which is being run alongside another initiative, the Pentagon’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE). After all, Brown himself also said that the target was “about four” fighter types, plus the A-10, which is now expected to remain in service into the 2030s, and the Air Force has confirmed that there is no planned F-22 retirement date as of now. Even if the Air Force were to decide that it could do without the F-22, a program to actually divest it would certainly meet concerted opposition — getting such legislation past lawmakers would likely be difficult in a similar manner as successive plans to retire the A-10 fleet or at least a portion of it. It would also be complicated by the fact that the Air Force has made concerted efforts to use Raptors to maximize the effects of fourth-generation jets, like the F-16. Only recently, meanwhile, the Air Force successfully demonstrated the ability to team up five F-35As and a single F-22 that were able to communicate with each other using their proprietary stealthy datalinks via a U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane. An F-16C from Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, and an F-22 Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia. The jets are assigned to the respective Air Force Demonstration Teams for the Viper and the Raptor., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Mary Begy The Raptor retirement plan, if it’s finally adopted, also places a significant burden on the NGAD, which would have to be combat-ready and available in the required numbers such that retiring the F-22 would not have an adverse effect on overall Air Force capabilities. In fact, the idea that the NGAD is being lined up, in some planning, at least, as a Raptor replacement is interesting in itself. The NGAD — or at least, the fighter-like element of it — will have to be able to do all the F-22 can do, and more. At the same time, after its production run was cut short at just 187 examples , the Raptor today is seriously hampered by the small size of the fleet, which in turn impacts the costs of sustaining and operating the jets. The aircraft’s low-observable capabilities remain effective, but the technologies involved are now aging and are also increasingly difficult to maintain . An airman from the 325th Maintenance Squadron Low Observable next to an F-22 at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The squadron looks after the low-observable coatings to ensure the F-22s maintain their precious stealth capabilities., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Alex Echols Despite its young age, the F-22 fleet has persistently abysmal mission capability rates , a key metric used to determine how many aircraft are actually available to fly combat sorties at any time. In particular, structural modifications designed to extend the service life of the F-22 and increase its availability long-term have had an adverse effect on mission capability rates. Earlier this year, structural modifications were completed on 135 F-22s at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. “Hundreds of thousands of hours were dedicated to coating restoration, mitigating corrosion, aircraft modifications, modernization, and repair,” the Air Force confirmed at the time. What is more, the F-22 has always been limited by its range. The addition of external fuel tanks significantly hampers the aircraft’s low-observable profile and performance. While that might not be such a big deal for a North American Aerospace Defense Command mission, warding off Russian long-range bombers and their escorts , it means the F-22’s utility would be much reduced in a conflict against China over the Taiwan Strait , for example. Really any major conflict against a near-peer competitor would mandate tanker aircraft operate within a few hundred miles or so of the F-22’s target area, which may not even be possible without putting those assets at high risk. This is a major problem we have highlighted for years and has increasingly become an issue the USAF is acknowledging itself. With all that in mind, we can expect the NGAD design to be tailored to overcome all of those disadvantages. Increased payload, broadband low-observability, enhanced networking, updated sensors and electronic warfare capabilities, extreme situational awareness, and capacity for expansion for new capabilities, such as directed-energy weapons, are all also likely on the to-do list for NGAD. It is expected that unmanned systems, as well as manned/unmanned teaming concepts, will play a huge role in NGAD, so it is not just a single unified aircraft system, but a family of systems. Inflight software updates enabled by open architecture, and perhaps even rapid prototyping and production of new design iterations, will all help make this a reality. Given the paucity of information about NGAD that’s reached the public domain so far, it’s likely to be some time before we get anything more concrete about the technical and capability aspects of this program. But this will have to change if Brown and the USAF really wish to sell the F-22 retirement scheme in exchange for pursuing NGAD with major financial backing. General Brown in an F-35 Lightning II simulator at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Daniel Robles There is also the question of how the F-35 will fit into these still-emerging plans. Only recently, a senior Air Force officer said that there was no value in including the current fleet of F-35As in tabletop wargames simulating future high-end conflicts, such as one covering an American military response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan . Moreover, the F-35 program, as a whole, is facing a new level of scrutiny , although Brown has said he sees the jet as the “cornerstone” of the Air Force fighter fleet. But what of potential plans to retire the F-22? In the past, Brown has said he wants the TacAir study to be completed in time to help inform decisions for the Air Force’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget request. “In the budget for FY 23, that’s where I see that we’ll really make some key decisions,” he said, earlier this year. While the Air Force may be looking at a future without the Raptor, there is still a long, long way before that becomes a reality. Right now, it’s simply too early to predict what kind of impact the TacAir study might have on the F-22, or any other Air Force fighter program, for that matter.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 11, 2021",USS Sealion Was The Navy’s Unique Helicopter-Accommodating Submarine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. From the very early days of naval aviation, there have been attempts, some more successful than others , to operate fixed-wing aircraft, chiefly floatplanes , from submarines. By the time the helicopter had become an established part of air warfare, soon after World War II, the idea of any kind of aircraft-carrying submarines was essentially dead. But that didn’t stop the U.S. Navy from operating at least one helicopter from a submarine, during a remarkable series of trials aboard the USS Sealion in the mid-1950s. By now, the helicopter had proven its worth in Korea and was increasingly becoming indispensable for maritime operations, too, its key missions including search and rescue, utility transport, and anti-submarine warfare. There was another mission that the helicopter was quickly making its own — amphibious assault. In November 1956, the Suez Crisis fiasco in Egypt saw British commandos flown by helicopter from the decks of aircraft carriers as part of an amphibious invasion force. It was the first time that such an operation was carried out and it would prove hugely influential. A U.S. Marine Corps Sikorsky HRS-1 helicopter landing aboard the submarine USS Sealion . , PUBLIC DOMAIN In the same year in the United States, meanwhile, experiments using helicopters for the amphibious assault mission were also taking place. One of these aimed to examine whether it was possible to deliver a small team of Marines from a submarine at sea to the shore, where they could carry out reconnaissance missions. Inserting an advance party of reconnaissance troops was nothing new in itself, of course, and it was part of the existing submarine mission set. But using a helicopter to get them to their objective was new. The submarine chosen for the exercise was the Balao class USS Sealion . This had originally been commissioned in March 1944 and was famously responsible for being the only submarine to sink a Japanese battleship during World War II, the Kongo , which was sent to the bottom of the sea in the Formosa Strait in November 1944. Decommissioned at the end of the war, Sealion was then adapted as a troop-carrier submarine , losing its torpedo armament and being outfitted with accommodation for up to 123 troops or cargo. Meanwhile, above the deck, a large watertight cylindrical housing could carry additional equipment, such as an LVT , or tracked landing vehicle. This kind of installation was the precursor to the Dry Deck Shelters used on special mission submarines today. By late 1948, Sealion was operating as a submarine transport, SSP-315, with Marines embarked. A change in hull classifications in January 1950 saw Sealion reclassified a transport submarine, becoming ASSP-315, which was changed again to APSS-315 in October 1956. USS Sealion after conversion as a submarine transport, SSP-315. Note the large stowage chamber aft of the conning tower., U.S. NAVY During the mid-1950s, Sealion took part in maneuvers involving the Army, Marines, Underwater Demolition Teams, and Beach Jumper units, at some point losing the watertight deck housing. Presumably, by this point, the utility of being able to disembark a single LVT, or similar, had been discredited, but it did leave a considerable amount of flat deck space immediately behind the conning tower. Surprisingly little information is available on the helicopter trials that took place on the Sealion , although photos indicate they made use of the ‘flight deck’ provided after the removal of the LVT’s container. Several of these photos record that the drills took place in or around May 1956. USS Sealion during exercises with Marine scouts of the 2nd Marine Division in 1956., U.S. NAVY The helicopter used has been reported as a Sikorsky HRS-3 , the Marine Corps version of the popular Sikorsky S-55. Powered by a 700-horsepower Wright R-1300-3 piston engine, this version was able to carry eight to 10 troops. However, at least one image shows an earlier model, the HRS-1, as used in Korea, which utilized the 600-horsepower Wright R-1340-57. With no hangar, there was no way for the submarine to submerge with a helicopter on board and even in rough seas or poor weather, operations would likely have become very difficult, if not impossible. The limited available photos do not seem to reveal any additional support equipment to fuel the helicopter, or even secure it, suggesting these tests were designed just to study the basic feasibility of flying troop-laden helicopters to and from submarines. Since there are no apparent records of helicopters operating from U.S. Navy submarines after this drill, we can probably safely assume that it wasn’t a success. At best, the rotary assault capacity offered would have been far less than even a modest-sized surface warship adapted for helicopter operations. Indeed, in 1958, the Navy began experiments with its first true helicopter carrier, the converted Essex class aircraft carrier USS Boxer (LPH-4). Six UH-34 Seahorse helicopters in front of the landing platform helicopter USS Boxer ., U.S. Navy There was, however, at least one interesting footnote to the story of the helicopter-carrying submarine. On April 26, 1956, a month before an HRS-3 was being trialed aboard Sealion , another Balao class submarine, USS Corporal , was exercising with a Navy Sikorsky HSS-1 Seabat anti-submarine helicopter, part of a trials squadron that was attempting to track the submarine off the southern coast of Florida. When the crew of the HSS-1 realized they were losing oil from the main rotor and were too far from the coast to recover on land. After issuing a mayday call, the Corporal surfaced to provide help, expecting to pick up survivors once the helicopter ditched. After making visual contact, the respective helicopter and submarine commanders agreed to attempt an emergency landing on the Corporal . Improvising all the way, the crews managed to safely recover the helicopter, although it was initially not even clear if the hull was wide enough to support the landing gear. The U.S. Navy HSS-1 Seabat helicopter on the USS Corporal in 1956., U.S. NAVY Between them, USS Sealion and Corporal had proven that it was possible to operate helicopters from submarines, whether planned in advance or in an emergency. But it was destined to be a brief cameo only and, today, the closest most submarines get to a helicopter is at the opposite end of a winch cable during personnel or cargo transfers. As for USS Sealion , the submarine was decommissioned again in 1960 before returning to service the following year, again in a transport role. In 1962, the sub helped enforce the naval blockade against Cuba, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. For the remainder of the decade, Sealion continued to work with Marine Reconnaissance teams, SEALs , and Underwater Demolition Teams, finally being classified as an amphibious transport submarine, LPSS-315, before being decommissioned for the last time in 1970. Carrying demolition equipment, U.S. Navy frogmen leave the submerged USS Sealion during a training exercise at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands in the early 1960s., U.S. NAVY With such an illustrious period of service, from the war in the Pacific to the clandestine special forces missions of the Cold War, it’s perhaps not surprising that Sealion ’s helicopter operations are today little known.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Mar 18, 2021",Taiwanese F-16s Have Fired AIM-120 AMRAAM Missiles Locally For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets operated by Taiwan’s Republic of China Air Force, or ROCAF, have test-fired AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles , or AMRAAMs, for the first time on the island, according to reports. The missiles were apparently launched from a pair of recently upgraded F-16V jets, which had reached initial combat capability last March. In the past, the United States has prevented the ROCAF from conducting live-firing campaigns with the AMRAAM, thought to be due to concerns about China’s possible reaction. However, a report in Taiwan’s Liberty Times today states that Washington granted permission for this test after “continuous incursions into [Taiwan’s] southwestern airspace by Chinese military aircraft and the tense international situation in the South China Sea .” ROCAF F-16s on patrol. The nearest jet, a two-seater, is similar to those used in the recent live-fire trials., REPUBLIC OF CHINA GOVERNMENT The AMRAAM test took place southeast of Taiwan, on the opposite side of the island to the air defense identification zone (ADIZ) that sees most activity by Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft. Four two-seat F-16Vs were reportedly involved in the live-fire mission, launching from Chiayi Air Base early on the morning of May 10. Each jet was said to be armed with two AMRAAMs and two short-range AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. “Planes 1 and 3 each launched an AIM-120 AMRAAM hung on the right wingtip ,” Liberty Times reported, “and they all hit the target drone accurately.” Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense did not provide any comment on the event. While the ROCAF conducts weekly combat readiness exercises including live-fire training with air-to-air, anti-ship , and air-to-ground weapons , an example of the AMRAAM has never been fired by one of the service’s aircraft in Taiwan itself. A ROCAF F-16 armed with live AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, plus AMRAAMs and Sidewinders., CHIANG YING-YING/AP Taiwan’s possession of the AMRAAM in the first place is a somewhat controversial point. In September 2000 the U.S. government agreed to sell Taiwan 200 AIM-120Cs to arm its fleet of F-16A/Bs, although only 120 were ordered. Originally, it was stipulated that the missiles be stored at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam until they were required for combat use. The American stance changed in June 2002, once China began to test R-77 (AA-12 Adder) medium-range air-to-air missiles received from Russia. The first batch of AIM-120C-5 missiles arrived in Taiwan by November 2003. Since then, the purchase of another 218 AIM-120C-7s was approved in 2007. The small stocks of AMRAAMs available to the ROCAF — approximately two for each of the 141 F-16s in service — are, of course, nowhere near enough to employ in any kind of large-scale confrontation with the PLA. In times of crisis, those numbers would be boosted by further orders, while Taiwan has also developed an indigenous medium-range air-to-air missile, the Tien Chien 2 that arms the F-CK-1 Indigenous Defense Fighter. French-supplied Mirage 2000-5 fighters, meanwhile, are armed with MBDA MICA medium-range weapons. A ROCAF F-CK-1 Indigenous Defense Fighter takes off with a Tien Chien 2 missile just visible under the fuselage., YOUTH DAILY NEWS Previous live-fire trials of the AMRAAM have been conducted by the ROCAF but all have been over U.S. territory. The first such mission was in Guam in October 2000, while another followed at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, in early 2001. “The United States has always considered the AIM-120 a sensitive system,” Roy Choo, a defense journalist and lead author of a forthcoming book on the ROCAF, told The War Zone . “While the missile has been deployed by the ROCAF for nearly 17 years, live-fire tests in Taiwan have been prohibited to avoid any leaks of measurement and signature Intelligence (MASINT) to the PLA. Apart from the initial missile firings in the earlier years, the ROCAF F-16 crews train on the utilization of the missile in simulators. The missile live-fires on Monday would have been approved by the US and come at a time of heightened tensions over the Taiwan Strait.” An array of weapons, including AMRAAMs, in front of an F-16 at Chiayi Air Force Base in southwest Taiwan., YOUTH DAILY NEWS Chen Guoming, the senior editor of Global Defense Magazine , told Liberty Times that the significance of the United States authorizing this weapons test lies in the message to Taiwan: providing assurance of U.S. intent to assist Taiwan in its defense against possible military action from China, continued military cooperation, as well as its confidence in Taiwan using advanced weapons independently. Allowing the ROCAF to conduct this test itself, rather than on a weapons range in the United States, is also an indirect acknowledgment of Taiwan’s independent status, Chen argued. A ROCAF F-16 with typical air defense load-out of two wingtip AMRAAMs and two Sidewinder missiles., YOUTH DAILY NEWS Officially, the United States has a “one China” policy that does not recognize Taiwan as independent, but it reserves the right to engage with officials there separately. Furthermore, the U.S. government has increasingly shown its support for Taiwan in more visible ways, including sending warships and aircraft through the Taiwan Strait and approving significant arms sales to the Taiwanese military. The timing of the AMRAAM test is also important for Taiwan’s F-16V upgrade program, too. The Viper was already the most capable fighter asset in the ROCAF inventory and the only one that can carry AIM-120 missiles, a weapon that is vital if the service hopes to keep pace with Beijing’s rapidly developing airpower capabilities . As tensions in the Taiwan Strait continue, it is critical for the ROCAF that its high-end fighters and their missile armament are available to patrol the country’s ADIZ. This area has seen intense activity by PLA aircraft in recent months. On January 24, 15 PLA aircraft entered the area in a major incident that The War Zone reported on in-depth at the time. In late March, meanwhile, no fewer than 20 PLA aircraft entered the ADIZ, among them bombers and airborne early warning platforms, as well as fighters and surveillance aircraft. Aside from the importance of the ROCAF being able to test its most potent air-to-air missiles, and its newly upgraded fighter jets, locally, the AMRAAM test launches also suggest that U.S. military support for Taiwan is continuing under the new Biden administration.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Air raid sirens have been blaring across central Israel after the Al Qassam Brigades, the militant wing of the Palestinian group Hamas , announced that they had fired approximately 130 rockets toward Tel Aviv and other population centers to the north of the Gaza Strip. This was in direct response to a series of Israeli airstrikes on targets in Gaza, most notably one that destroyed the Hanadi Tower, a combined office and apartment building owned by Hamas . This also appears to be the largest rocket attack from Gaza aimed at central Israel ever and is the latest in a series of escalating tit-for-tat actions between Israel and Palestinian militants in recent days. The fighting has already led to the deaths of at least 28 Palestinians, including 10 children, and two Israelis, and has left many more on both sides wounded. This is some of the worst fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in years and follows a spike in tension in recent weeks. The immediate inciting incidents are a combination of a controversial court case playing out in Israel, which could see Palestinians evicted from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of Jerusalem, and issues over access to the Al Aqsa Mosque in that same city during the current holy month of Ramadan. The Al Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, sits on top of the Temple Mount, which is the location of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism, and the entire complex has been a flashpoint for tensions between the two communities for decades. The current situation has already prompted violent clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police. Video footage has shown riot police launching stun grenades into the mosque itself. Ahead of the airstrike today that leveled the Hanadi Tower, the Al Qassam Brigades had publicly threatened a new wave of rocket attacks against Tel Aviv that would be greater than those the group had previously carried out the day before against the Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israel ignored that threat, conducting a so-called “roof knock” strike on the Hanadi Tower, causing only superficial damage initially, but announcing the Israel Defense Forces’ intention to flatten it. The IDF had also otherwise issued calls for civilians to evacuate the area ahead of a major strike. Earlier today, the IDF said that a total of 480 rockets had been fired toward Israel from Gaza in the fighting up to that point, a rate of one rocket every three minutes for a time. The IDF added that Iron Dome systems had been able to intercept approximately 200 of them. There have been reports that the sheer volume of rockets had, at least for a time, overwhelmed Iron Dome batteries in southern Israel, leading to rockets hitting urban areas in Israel. Iron Dome and its Tamir interceptors, which you can read more about here , are specifically designed to counter artillery rockets, as well as artillery shells and mortar rounds, a mission set commonly referred to as C-RAM. There are reports now that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), another Palestinian militant group in Gaza, has threatened more strikes on Tel Aviv if Israel retaliates for the latest rocket barrage, something that seems likely to happen regardless. Israel launched a named operation, dubbed Guardian of the Walls , in response to the rocket attacks on Monday. So far, it has primarily involved a campaign of airstrikes, including on rocket launch sites in Gaza, as well as targeted killings against higher-level militants. The head of the PIJ’s special rocket unit was among those killed in the Israeli strikes. However, unspecified ground and naval forces are also reportedly involved and there are concerns that the IDF may be close to launching a full-scale ground intervention into Gaza. The last time this occurred was in 2014 when Israel carried out Operation Protective Edge , which led to the deaths of more than 2,000 Palestinians, more than half of which were civilians, as well as dozens of Israeli troops and a small number of civilians inside Israel. “The purpose of the operation is to strike Hamas hard, to weaken it and to make it regret its decision [to launch rocket strikes on Israel],” Benny Gantz, Israel’s Defense Minister and Alternate Prime Minister, said earlier today regarding Operation Guardian of the Walls. “Every bomb has an address. We will continue this in both the coming hours and the coming days. It’s hard to estimate how long it will take.” “After assessing the situation, we made decisions,” Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the latest round of rocket attacks. “Hamas and [Palestinian] Islamic Jihad will pay a very heavy price for their aggression tonight — their blood is on their heads.” The exact extent of the damage from the latest barrage of rockets, and how many Israeli casualties there might be, is unclear. The IDF is already carrying out retaliatory airstrikes. By every indication, the situation looks set to continue escalating, at least in the near future. The United States, which does not presently have an ambassador to Israel , as well as various Arab countries in the region , have been attempting to find a way to deescalate things, so far without success. The entire situation is made more complex by a separate political crisis in Israel, where the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is also on trial over charges of corruption, has now failed to form a government following parliamentary elections earlier this year. The fighting in and around Gaza has impacted attempts by his political opponents to form a new coalition . Eid al-Fitr, the Islamic religious holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, which begins tomorrow, could provide one opening to scale back the violence. Ceasefires around Eid in the midst of conflicts are not uncommon. For example, the Taliban in Afghanistan announced a three-day pause in fighting in that country yesterday to mark the occasion. How far the violence will continue to escalate before the parties find an off-ramp to this current conflict remains to be seen.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jet has, for the first time, been loaded up with five AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles , or JASSMs, as part of a proof-of-concept at Eglin Air Force Base , Florida. The jet has apparently not yet flown with the five stealthy cruise missiles attached, but there are plans for the tests to continue, with the aim of more than doubling the Strike Eagle’s previous JASSM load. The Air Force announced details today of Project Strike Rodeo, which could potentially allow small formations of F-15Es to take on some of the kinds of missions previously flown by bombers . At the same time, it is noteworthy that the service is looking to increase JASSM capacity on the B-1B Lancer , too, with plans to add 12 external JASSM-series weapons to the 24 that can be carried in its internal bomb bays . An F-15E Strike Eagle loaded with five JASSMs at Eglin Air Force Base, on May 11, 2021, as part of Project Strike Rodeo., U.S. AIR FORCE The F-15E five-JASSM load-out trial was undertaken by the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), the “Skulls,” part of the 53rd Wing at Eglin Air Force Base. Back in March, this same squadron carried out another F-15E weapons test , assessing the ability of the jet to carry 15 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) of various types, primarily as a means of moving munitions into combat theaters at short notice. Last month, that type of configuration was used in an operational setting , when an F-15E moved 12 500-pound-class JDAMs, plus four Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs), as well as defensive armament, between bases in the Middle East. Project Strike Rodeo has its origins in January this year when the 53rd Wing sketched out a tactical scenario that was based around escorting a bomber loaded with standoff munitions to a release point in a highly-contested environment. This work was conducted during a Weapons and Tactics Conference (WEPTAC), an annual two-week event involving various units from the Combat Air Forces. One of the proposals put forward for this type of mission involved using a formation of fighters instead of a single bomber to employ a JASSM salvo. This would “reduce the size and complexity of the strike package,” as well as “distribute mission risk across the force,” in the words of an Air Force media release. At the same time, this kind of package would be able to self-escort into the firing area, bringing to bear powerful air-to-air capabilities if required. Until now, however, no Air Force fighter can carry more than two JASSMs, so a study began to see if it would be feasible for an F-15E to carry more. In its standard configuration, the Strike Eagle is not able to accommodate JASSMs on its conformal fuel tank (CFT) weapons stations, since the container from which the missile is loaded onto the jet won’t fit under the F-15E without hitting the main landing gear. A rear three-quarter view of the F-15E showing the new JASSM carriage on the rear of the CFTs., U.S. AIR FORCE With that in mind, a new loading tool was devised at Eglin, permitting JASSMs to be loaded on the rear CFT stations. Once the F-15 System Program Office became aware of this work, it provided funds for a load test, which was completed within five months of the idea being conceived. “No one told us to do this,” explained Lieutenant Colonel Mike Benitez, the 53rd Wing director of staff. “We saw the need and the opportunity, so we executed. This infectious attitude drove every unit or office we coordinated with. Everyone wanted to see if we could do it, and no one ever pushed back and asked for a requirement or a formal higher headquarters tasking.” U.S. AIR FORCE “This is a squadron innovation effort with operational and strategic implications,” Benitez added. “Project Strike Rodeo is all about creating options for combatant commanders, which ultimately can be used to create multiple dilemmas for the adversary.” It seems likely that the F-15E has already been tasked with at least one high-profile JASSM strike in the past, as part of the raid that killed the terrorist and ISIS founder Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, which took place in Syria in October 2019. Shortly after that raid, The War Zone surmised that the delivery platforms for the JASSM strike were F-15Es based in Jordan. That hypothesis was largely confirmed when two of the jets landed at RAF Lakenheath, England, with silhouettes of the stealthy JASSMs among the numerous other bomb symbols. In its initial AGM-158A form, the JASSM has a range of around 330 miles and weighs 2,250 pounds. A JASSM test., U.S. AIR FORCE While stealthy cruise missiles might not be an obvious choice for this kind of mission, their long reach ensures that, when required, manned tactical jets can employ them without the need to venture into western Syria to strike targets in an area where Russian, Syrian, and Turkish forces are all present. In other theaters, meanwhile, Air Force F-15Es are training to use the JASSM for potential future contingencies. We recently looked at how Strike Eagle crews were working through the tactics, techniques, and procedures that would be involved in carrying out cruise missile strikes in the strategic Baltic Sea region, home to a major Russian military stronghold , using the AGM-158. You can read more about that exercise, and the relevance of the JASSM in that environment, here . In the Baltic, and elsewhere, the Air Force would rely on the JASSM in particular as a critical weapon for breaking down an enemy’s anti-access/area-denial umbrella . U.S. AIR FORCE Earlier this year, we also saw images of an F-15E carrying a live AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range cruise missile, or JASSM-ER , which has a publicly stated range of at least 575 miles. On that occasion, the F-15E launched the AGM-158B over the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico as part of a test on January 7. The extended-range AGM-158B variant arrived in service in 2014 but was originally limited to the B-1B bomber . Integration of this version on the Strike Eagle came later, with the aircraft only achieving full operational capability with the new missile in 2018. A close-up of the AGM-158B JASSM-ER under the F-15E Strike Eagle during the January 2021 test., U.S. AIR FORCE In the meantime, the JASSM family has now also been expanded to include an anti-ship weapon, the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), while the retirement of the AGM-86C/D Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM), carried by the B-52H, has left the JASSM as one of the Air Force’s most important air-launched conventional standoff weapons. In the future, the Air Force, and the F-15E, are likely to receive an even longer-range version of the JASSM, the AGM-158D JASSM-XR , which is likely to be able to hit targets a distance of 1,000 miles. All in all, the emergence of the JASSM series of weapons has come at a very opportune time in the career of the F-15E, as the jet undergoes some far-reaching upgrades of its own to ensure its capabilities — perhaps until it is eventually succeeded by the new F-15EX, which remains an option , and which would be able to carry at least five JASSMs. With Project Strike Rodeo seemingly set to allow a single F-15E to carry five of these potent weapons into battle, there is yet another reason for the Strike Eagle to retain its unofficial title as the Air Force’s most in-demand strike platform.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 15, 2021","It’s Official: KC-46 Tankers And More F-35s For Israel, But No Advanced F-15s For Now","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel has formally approved plans for its first order of troubled KC-46 Pegasus aerial refueling tankers from Boeing, as well as the third squadron of F-35I “Adir” stealth fighters . Despite reported Israeli interest , there was no mention of any planned purchases of advanced versions of the F-15 Eagle . However, the Israeli government has also given the green light to purchases of “advanced munitions” and a new heavy-lift helicopter, either a variant of the H-47 Chinook or CH-53K King Stallion . The Israeli Ministry of Defense said it had begun working on these procurement programs after they were all approved by the Israeli government on February 22, 2021. The first Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) for the initial two KC-46s was signed over the weekend. An LOA is a government-to-government agreement that identifies the defense equipment and services to be sold by the U.S. government. Digital artwork published today on Twitter by the Israeli Ministry of Defense showed a KC-46 in Israeli markings refueling an advanced version of the F-15. It’s not clear if this imagery originated with the defense ministry or with Boeing, which manufactures both types, but for now, at least, there are no formal Israeli plans to buy new versions of the Eagle. An artist’s impression of an Israeli Air Force KC-46 refueling an advanced version of the F-15, which is not covered by the latest procurement plans., Israeli Ministry of Defense/Twitter All these purchases for the Israeli Air Force (IAF) will be conducted via U.S. military channels, with funding provided by the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) initiative. In 2018, the Trump Administration approved a 10-year memorandum of understanding with Israel that covers $3.3 billion in FMF aid. FMF provides allies with block grants of money for military purchases, with the stipulation that a significant percentage is spent with U.S. companies. The Israeli Ministry of Defense has confirmed that similar procurement processes will be launched to buy the additional F-35Is, new heavy-lift helicopters, and undisclosed armament. The U.S. State Department approved the potential sale of eight KC-46As to Israel almost a year ago, to replace the IAF’s aging Boeing 707-based tankers. The entire package in the eight-aircraft deal had an estimated value of $2.4 billion. Israel reportedly inquired about whether it could take delivery of its first pair of KC-46s from a lot the U.S. Air Force had already contracted Boeing to build. This would allow the IAF to get these aircraft earlier than would otherwise be possible. Boeing faced competition for Israeli orders from the Israel Aerospace Industries’ Bedek Aviation Group which had offered second-hand Boeing 767s converted into tankers. IAI had previously supplied similar 767 tanker conversions to Brazil and Colombia. Reportedly, Boeing blocked these plans to assure its KC-46 would win through, something you can read about in detail here . Another option was the Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), 61 examples of which had been ordered by March 2020, by Australia, France, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. The A330 MRTT will have been operational in a tanker capacity with its launch customer, the Royal Australian Air Force, for a decade this summer. We don’t yet know when Israel will receive its first two KC-46s, but the aircraft is currently still years away from providing its intended mission set. Earlier this month, General Jacqueline Van Ovost, the head of Air Mobility Command, described the Pegasus as a “lemon,” amid ongoing problems that prevent it from performing its primary aerial refueling mission on a day-to-day basis. Full operational capability now won’t happen until late 2023 or 2024 at the earliest, according to officials. With that in mind, the IAF’s tanker choice might require the 707-based fleet to soldier on longer still. Known locally as the “Re’em,” which means “Oryx” in Hebrew, the 707-300s now in use were introduced beginning in 1978. These second-hand aircraft were converted to tanker configuration by IAI, including installation of a refueling boom and its control system. The Re’em plays an important part in support of the IAF’s overseas deployments. The oldest Re’em, serial 140, a veteran of the IAF’s raid on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunisia in 1985, was retired in 2019, leaving nine examples active. An Israeli Air Force Boeing 707 Re’em., Tomás Del Coro/Wikimedia Commons However, it remains possible that Israel will receive a bespoke version of the KC-46, as it did in the past with the F-35I, and others. The IAF could potentially acquire a Pegasus that differs significantly from the U.S. Air Force model and it should be noted that boom-equipped KC-767 tankers have been operating now for many years with both Italy and Japan. The decision to buy a third squadron of F-35Is comes as little surprise, as Israel was also weighing up the options of buying advanced versions of the F-15 as well, including a potential mixed buy. For now, however, the IAF appears to have decided to focus on the F-35I — the local name “Adir” means “Mighty One” —rather than supplementing and/or upgrading its existing fleet of F-15s. To date, Israel has signed contracts for 50 F-35Is, sufficient to populate two squadrons, the latest of which was declared ready for combat last August . The next purchase will likely cover another 25 jets to allow a third squadron to be formed. The F-35I models are broadly equivalent to the F-35A, but incorporate an increasing proportion of Israeli-made technology and weapons, with these local changes being trialed using a unique F-35I testbed that arrived in the country last November. Israel’s specially-built F-35I test jet touched down in the country last November., ISRAELI AIR FORCE/AMIT AGRONOV For now, at least, Boeing’s hopes of selling more F-15s to Israel will have to be put on hold. Speaking to The War Zone last summer, Prat Kumar, Boeing’s Vice President and Program Manager for the F-15, said the company was responding to a request for information from Israel for up to 25 new Advanced F-15s, plus upgrades for 25 existing F-15I aircraft. However, it’s possible that Israel might revisit the F-15 again in the future. While it’s clear that the IAF prizes the F-35I’s stealth qualities for penetrating missions within contested airspace, as well as its unrivaled data-sharing capabilities , there remains a requirement for an aircraft with advanced avionics that can operate alongside the F-35I and carry heavier weapons loads over long distances, essentially serving as a “missile truck.” The next decision will involve the new heavy-lift helicopter for the IAF, with the existing fleet of around two-dozen CH-53 “Yasur” helicopters in need of replacement. The chosen platform will be used for a range of vital missions, including combat search and rescue (CSAR), long-range heavy assault, and deep-penetration insertion and extraction of special operations teams. A CH-53 “Yasur” releases infrared decoys. , Israeli Air Force This is set to be a straight battle between the H-47 Chinook and the CH-53K. In the past, there’s been Israeli interest in the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor , and while this option seemed to have been shelved as of last year, primarily on budget grounds, it may now be back on the agenda, according to reports . As it is, the H-47 and CH-53K already offer the choice between two very different sets of capabilities. The CH-53K, for example, has demonstrated an ability to carry up to 36,000 pounds of cargo, compared to around 21,000 pounds for the latest iterations of the CH-47F. On the other hand, the availability of the more powerful General Electric T408 engines , as used in the CH-53K, could help the H-47 close the gap. The Chinook might also offer a significant cost saving, the U.S. Army having been buying new production CH-47F models for between $30 and $40 million each in recent years, depending on the total size of the order. In contrast, the average unit cost for the CH-53K has increased to more than $120 million. A modified NCH-47D testbed helicopter with the T408 engines during its first flight at Felker Army Airfield in September 2020., U.S. Army Israeli media reports suggest that the undisclosed “advanced munitions” mentioned by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as part of the deal will include as many as 4,000 weapons for IAF fighter jets. Other munitions are also likely to be bought for the Iron Dome air defense system and the Arrow anti-ballistic missile system . Overall, this latest procurement plan will continue to help that Israel maintains its Qualitative Military Edge (QME) in the Middle East region, with more F-35Is on the way and the United Arab Emirates’ deal for the Joint Strike Fighter currently suspended until further notice. As a legally-mandated requirement of the U.S. government, QME not only seeks to keep the Israeli Defense Forces ahead of their regional adversaries but also promotes interoperability with U.S. partners and ensures that U.S.-based defense firms benefit too. While it’s clear that the IAF’s 707-based tanker fleet is in need of replacement, the choice of the KC-46 means it won’t be until late 2023 or 2024 at the earliest that this aerial refueling asset is fully capable of performing its core mission. Moreover, the Foreign Military Financing plan means that U.S. security assistance continues to be fundamental to the IAF’s modernization goals and its overall capabilities. Whatever equipment may follow, this seems certain to remain a pillar of the IAF’s development in the years to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At an abandoned airport in Berlin, a derelict Boeing 707 airliner tells a story of Cold War intrigue, international terrorism, and the changing fortunes of the German capital. But time is now up for the decaying jet, and the excavators have moved in to begin breaking up this historic aircraft. At first glance, you might think the 707, sitting forlornly at the edge of a forest, in a remote corner near the perimeter of the former Berlin Tegel Airport , could be a wreck used for training firefighters, or some kind of museum exhibit, but it’s been inaccessible for several years. Although long since faded by the effects of weather and decay, the blue and yellow colors formerly used by the German airline Lufthansa still adorn the airliner’s hulk. Looking decidedly the worse for wear, the 707 in its final resting place at Tegel Airport., Dirk Grothe Look closely, and you’ll see the German registration D-ABOC, too, as worn by one of Lufthansa’s first 707s, the airline’s first jetliner, which propelled it into post-war modernity beginning in the late 1950s. The registration is a fake, however, and this particular aircraft never flew for Lufthansa — or any other German airline, for that matter. A last glimpse at the flight deck before scrapping., Dirk Grothe The interior was reconfigured with Lufthansa seating., Dirk Grothe One of the 707’s four Rolls-Royce Conway engines., Dirk Grothe Its story began in May 1961, when it was rolled out at Boeing’s Renton, Washington, factory with the manufacturer’s serial number 18071. The airliner, a 707-458 powered by four Rolls-Royce Conway turbojets, had been ordered a year earlier by Israel’s national airline El Al. It made its first flight in June 1961 and entered service with the Israeli flag carrier later that month with the registration 4X-ATB. The airliner’s fortunes changed forever in September 1970, when it suddenly became a center of worldwide attention, in a series of events that would become known as ‘Black September,’ a name that would later be revived by a terrorist group . It also came amid a veritable pandemic of airline hijackings that year. Three years earlier, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a part of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), an umbrella group of militants then fighting to abolish the state of Israel and restore the nation of Palestine, had begun its campaign of hijacking airliners. Its first victim being a different El Al 707 that was diverted to Algiers in July 1968. The last hostages on board that flight were released after 39 days and the incident helped make the revolutionary organization a household name. El Al 707 4X-ATB at Cologne Airport in July 1970, just weeks before its attempted hijacking., Dietrich Eggert/Wikimedia Commons So began an airliner hijacking spree to bring their cause to a wider audience. This PFLP strategy reached its climax on September 6, 1970, when three aircraft from different airlines were hijacked almost simultaneously before a fourth was added to this ignominious collection days later. Of the first three, 4X-ATB had been en route between New York City in the United States and Tel Aviv, Israel, as El Al Flight 219, with 148 passengers and 10 crew aboard, when two terrorists, the Palestinian Leila Khaled and Nicaraguan Patrick Argüello initiated the hijacking. Khaled had already successfully commandeered another airliner, a TWA 707, in August 1969, taking it to Syria, where she was later released without charges. Since then, she had received cosmetic surgery to disguise her now-notorious identity. Leila Khaled, aged 25, in Syria, her release following the hijacking of TWA Flight 840 in August 1969., PUBLIC DOMAIN The El Al 707 had just departed Amsterdam, where it had made a brief stop, allowing the hijackers to board. “At Amsterdam airport, my comrade Patrick and I were stopped by Israeli officers,” she later recalled . “They searched our bags very thoroughly, but they didn’t find anything in there, because the grenades were in my pockets. We had passports from Honduras.” Drinks were being served when Khaled pulled out her two hand grenades and headed toward the cockpit, together with Argüello. The airliner was approaching the British coast and, as the pair began banging on the door to the cockpit, flight attendant alerted the flight crew to the situation. “Sit down, we are not going to be hijacked!” the pilot, Uri Bar-Lev , shouted to his co-pilot. Improvising a way out of the situation, Bar-Lev forced the airliner into a steep dive, resulting in brief zero-G conditions. Passengers vomited, while luggage, drinks, and personal effects were thrown around the cabin. Amid the chaos, the hijackers were thrown off their feet. Khaled was overpowered and pinned to the cabin floor. Argüello, also armed with a gun, lobbed his single grenade down the aisle, but it failed to detonate. He was hit over the head by a passenger with a whiskey bottle and then fatally shot by an Israeli sky marshal. Khaled, who had threatened to remove the pins from her two grenades with her teeth, was also hit over the head and knocked unconscious. One of the aircraft stewards had also been badly injured by a shot fired by Argüello. Nevertheless, this part of the hijacking plan, at least, had ended in failure, and the 707 touched down at London’s Heathrow Airport soon after, where Khaled was detained. Meanwhile, another two airliners that had been successfully hijacked by the PFLP — a TWA 707 and a Swissair DC-8 — had been flown to Dawson’s Field, a deserted military airfield in Jordan now renamed ‘Revolution Airstrip.’ A third, a Pan Am 747, proved too big for the airstrip and was instead flown to Cairo where its passengers disembarked, and it was promptly blown up. Altogether, 315 passengers and crew were now hostages in Jordan. The PFLP made demands for various prisoners to be released, including Khaled, in what was now the world’s biggest hijacking incident. Douglas DC-8 HB-IDD was the Swissair aircraft that was hijacked and flown to Jordan., RuthAS/Wikimnedia Commons To gain more leverage with the British authorities, the PFLP hijacked a British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) VC10 three days later and flew it, too, to Dawson’s Field, together with its 114 passengers and crew.

As for 4X-ATB, this aircraft went back into service with El Al before being leased to another Israeli airline, Arkia, between 1984 and 1986. El Al then sold it back to Boeing in September 1986 and the manufacturer soon decided to donate it to Lufthansa, to mark the delivery of the 200th Boeing (a 737) to the airline the same year as well as three decades of the post-war Lufthansa, for which the 707 had provided vital service. In the meantime, the jet was still in Israel, where it was removed from that country’s civil aircraft register in November 1986, re-registered as N130KR in the United States, and then flown to West Germany. As explained by the Digital Cosmonaut urban exploration website , the transit of the 707 from Israel to West Germany reflected the strange status of that city during the Cold War. The aircraft had been painted in Lufthansa-style colors in Israel and received the erroneous identity D-ABOC, which, as already noted, referenced one of Lufthansa’s first 707s, delivered in the late 1950s, and named Berlin . However, agreements over the divided city meant no West German airlines were permitted to fly into West Berlin, let alone the communist East. Since the 707 technically belonged to Lufthansa, the airline’s titles were covered up and the temporary U.S. registration N130KR was applied.

Not surprisingly, the actual aircraft’s turbulent history was sidelined. As it was, the jetliner’s time on public display was fairly short. It was placed next to Tegel’s main terminal in 1987, but by 1991 was shifted to a less visible position close to the taxiways. From 1998 it languished on the edge of the forest on the north of the airport, before being moved to the east of the facility in 2000, inaccessible to the public.

Various plans to move the airliner to Berlin’s historic Tempelhof Airport , to Munich Airport, or even turning it into a restaurant came to nothing. As it is, the aircraft is now being cut up and the pieces are scheduled to be sold at auction. No doubt, it’s a sad end for an aircraft whose dramatic history deserves to be better remembered.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 13, 2021",The Navy Has Dozens More MH-60R Helicopters Than It Needs Due To LCS Debacle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Problems with the Littoral Combat Ship program and basic lack of communication between Navy bureaucrats have left the service paying millions of dollars to store dozens of Sikorsky MH-60R helicopters it has no immediate need for. The service has tried to offer a silver lining by saying it will now use the excess choppers to help extend the service life of the two fleets overall by spacing out flight hours across more airframes, but it’s not clear how much money it will actually recoup in the process. The Pentagon’s Office of the Inspector General became aware of the glut of helicopters during a review of available U.S. Navy and Marine Corps backup aircraft, part of a general push throughout the U.S. military to assess the readiness of aviation units in particular. The same report, which the watchdog published in January 2019, determined that neither service had adequate numbers of F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets or T-45 Goshawk jet trainers to meet operational and training demands, which is hardly surprising given the mountain of existing reporting on the dismal readiness of units equipped with these aircraft. It also criticized the Marines for a lack of oversight of similar backup stocks of armored and other ground vehicles , which may have resulted in wasted funds. But the case of the MH-60Rs, in particular, the watchdog’s findings are especially notable. They not only highlight the often-painful rigidity of U.S. military bureaucracy, but also underscore the reality of second-order impacts of years-long problems with the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. The LCS program includes two distinct classes of ships, Lockheed Martin’s Freedom -class and Austal USA’s Independence -class. Both types of vessel are capable of carrying an MH-60R helicopter, which is primarily intended to support anti-submarine and general sea control missions. The MH-60R is the latest evolution of the Sikorsky SH-60 Sea Hawk , which is itself a navalized derivative of the UH-60 Black Hawk . An MH-60R fires an AGM-114 Hellfire missile during a training exercise., USN These helicopters can also support boarding operations and special operations forces missions. In recent years, they have also taken on an increasing close-in defense role against potential attacks from small unmanned aircraft and swarms of small boats . They’re also set to gain an electronic warfare role with the integration of the Advanced Offboard Electronic Warfare (AOEW) pod, which you can read about more here . Back in 2007, the Navy still expected to ultimately purchase 55 LCSs of both classes, despite the fact that cost overruns and other issues were already threatening the program at that time. In turn, the service subsequently determined how many MH-60Rs it would need to buy based on the expectation that it would need sufficient helicopters to support that total LCS fleet. In 2012, the Navy MH-60 program office agreed to purchase at least 120 of these helicopters as part of a joint-service contract. Two years later, the Navy cut back plans for the LCS program from 55 ships to just 32. It no longer needed all 120 of the helicopters, but Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) determined it would cost more to cancel the deal than to just buy the remaining choppers anyways. This situation has only gotten worse given the persistent changes to the LCS delivery schedule and plans for the fleet overall. At the time the Pentagon’s inspector general put its report together, the Navy’s target date to get the last of these ships was October 2023, but it’s not clear if that will come to pass . “The need for these helicopters will continue to be delayed if the LCS delivery schedule is delayed beyond October 2023,” the review warned. An MH-60R flies in front of the first-in-its-subclass USS Freedom ., USN Compounding matters, the Navy inexplicably does not have a formal requirement for divisions within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations to inform each other of changes to their programs that could have impacts on related procurement. As such, the Director, Air Warfare, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, “did not receive notification of changes in the Littoral Combat Ship’s (LCS) quantity and schedule delays,” according to the Pentagon’s top watchdog. “If … divisions communicate in a timely manner about a dependent weapon system’s quantity changes and delivery status, program office officials could attempt to decrease procurement quantities and extend the delivery period or delay procurement to avoid paying storage and preservation fees for weapon systems that may not be needed,” the report continued. Unsurprisingly, the Pentagon’s Inspector General’s Office has recommended that the Navy ensure there is sufficient communication in the future to do everything possible to avoid similar over-spending in the future. It’s not clear if this particular case how avoidable the situation was in the end, though. The Navy had agreed to the purchase MH-60Rs based on a 55-ship fleet of LCSs two years before that LCS procurement plan changed. The service did rightly decide against pursuing any additional optional purchases under the same contract. However, by the same measure, the Navy locked itself into a long-lead arrangement for the MH-60Rs, which apparently has severe cancelation penalties, based on LCS program at a time when its future was already in question due to serious delays and cost overruns. In addition, in spite of this reality, at no point in the nearly seven years between when the Navy ordered the first LCS and when it agreed to the deal with Sikorsky did bureaucrats reassess its total helicopter requirements. An MH-60R armed with a 20mm M197 rotary barrel cannon, at right, and a 19-shot rocket pod, at left., USN Regardless, what this all means, though is that as of July 2018, the Navy had a requirement for a total of 206 MH-60Rs for operational and training requirements, as well as 29 backup helicopters that it could rotate into service when other choppers to had to go in for major maintenance or were otherwise out of commission. But the service presently has 270 of the R models, 35 more than it says it needs. As of 2018, the flyaway cost of every new MH-60R the Navy purchased was around $34 million. This means the 35 excess helicopters had cost the service at least nearly $1.2 billion, money that it could have spent on any number of other priorities in the interim. On top of that, while, the Navy says it has found a need for one more MH-60R, but will still have to pay to store all of the remaining 34 aircraft at least through the 2020 Fiscal Year at a total cost of more than $1 million each year in total. The service will have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more annually for routine maintenance and other services to ensure these helicopters retain their operational status. This doesn’t account for any upgrades to their systems they might need to keep them relevant in the meantime, either. A sailor on board the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis works on an MH-60R helicopter., USN To try and recoup some of the costs, the Navy now plans to “rotate these excess … helicopters with operational helicopters every 2 to 3 years to reduce the accumulated flight hours across the fleet,” according to the Inspector General’s report. By doing this, the Navy expects to extend the overall service life of the MH-60R fleet out to 2042, years beyond its initial projections, but it remains to be seen whether the service will actually be flying any of the helicopters that long. The service, as well as the Marine Corps , is investigating new, unmanned platforms that will be able to take over many of the MH-60R’s roles and otherwise fundamentally change the character of shipboard rotary wing operations. The same ships that presently carry the helicopters already increasingly bring along MQ-8B Fire Scout drone helicopters, too, and the Navy is continuing to develop the much more capable MQ-8C . An MQ-8C Fire Scout comes in to land on the Independence -class USS Montogomery during a test., USN The service has made it a requirement for its future guided missile frigates, presently referred to as FFG(X)s , to both the MH-60R and the MQ-8C, which might offer another avenue for finding a use for the extra helicopters. The Navy expects to buy 20 FFG(X)s through the 2030 Fiscal Year, which equates to almost as many LCSs that it cut from previous budgets. Unfortunately, it will take some time for those ships to enter service, which will still leave the Navy without any firm demand for the excess MH-60Rs for years to come. By the time the FFG(X)s begin regular operations, the push toward unmanned rotary wing systems may be even more pronounced, as well, limiting demand for manned helicopters. Depending on how its own requirements evolve, the Navy might be able to divest some or all of the extra helicopters and sell them to allies and partners. The Royal Australian Navy and Royal Danish Air Force have already received the type. Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, is also in the process of delivering additional examples to Saudi Arabia . A Royal Australian Navy MH-60R., Royal Australian Navy If nothing else, the Navy’s over-purchase of MH-60Rs is a prime example of how the problems with the LCS program continue to have a costly rippled effect throughout the service. It will certainly be a teachable moment in how changes in one program can have serious cascading impacts on other related procurement plans. It might also offer valuable lessons in how to squeeze the most value out of any such debacle in the future, too. But any after-the-fact efforts to soften the blow don’t change the fact that the Navy put itself in an inflexible position and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars up front without any guarantee it will ever see a meaningful return on that investment. At a time when the services continually say they are doing the best to find costs savings and maximize value to the taxpayers, dozens of MH-60Rs sitting idle due to the failures of the LCS program shows that the U.S. military as a whole still has a long way to go in improving their spending habits.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",Warning Shots Fired After Iranian Vessels Swarm American Missile Submarine In Strait Of Hormuz (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat fired warning shots earlier today at a swarm of Iranian boats that got worryingly close to a group of American naval vessels escorting the U.S. Navy’s Ohio class guided-missile submarine USS Georgia through the volatile Strait of Hormuz . This is the third incident of Iranian boats harassing U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf region in a little over a month and the second time in two weeks that American forces have responded with warning shots . Top Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that this latest incident involved a total of seven U.S. ships, including Georgia . The Island class patrol boat USCGC Maui was also involved and was the vessel that fired a total of 30 warning shots from a .50 caliber machine gun, in two bursts, at 13 boats belonging to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The US Coast Guard’s Island class patrol boat USCGC Maui ., US Army Kirby said that the Iranian boats had “conducted unsafe and unprofessional maneuvers,” but left the area after the second burst of .50 caliber rounds. Maui ‘s crew had fired one burst when some of the IRGC boats came within 300 yards of the American naval formation and another when they closed to within 150 yards. The Navy’s Cyclone class patrol craft USS Firebolt had also fired warning shots , as seen in the video below, to chase away a group of IRGC boats that got close to American warships in the Persian Gulf on April 26. That followed an incident earlier in April in which IRGC boats, including a one-of-its-kind catamaran type, harassed U.S. naval vessels in the region. This latest harassment comes just days after the Navy, together with the Coast Guard, seized a massive cache of weapons, including small arms and anti-tank guided missiles, believed to be on their way to Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, in the northern end of the Arabian Sea. It’s not clear which direction Georgia and her escorts were sailing in the Strait of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, during the incident today. The U.S. Navy made the highly unusual decision to actively highlight its arrival in the Persian Gulf in December 2020. The service said this was was the first time one of the four Ohio class guided missile submarines, or SSGNs, conversions of Ohio class ballistic missile submarines, or SSBNs, had entered this body of water in eight years. That deployment was clearly a message to Tehran, coming at a time of extremely high tensions between the U.S. and Iranian governments ahead of the first anniversary of the U.S. military’s killing of IRGC General Qassem Soleimani. In January, Iranian authorities released a video reportedly shot from a Sea King helicopter that appeared to show Georgia sailing at periscope depth, effectively announcing its presence, near where Iran’s military was conducting a major exercise. The Ohio class SSGNs are some of the Navy’s most in-demand submarines, best known for their ability to carry a massive load of up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles . Beyond that, however, they are really extremely capable multi-mission platforms able to deploy special operations forces, as well as aerial drones and unmanned underwater vehicles, all while serving as discreet underwater command and control and intelligence fusion centers. You can read more about them in detail in this past War Zone feature . However, on the surface, submarines, especially large types, such as the Ohio SSGNs, are very vulnerable. They have limited force protection capabilities themselves and do not have the maneuverability of surface ships. With this in mind, the swarming of Georgia in the Strait of Hormuz underscores the inherent risks of that transit, in either direction, to U.S. and other foreign warships , as well as commercial vessels . Iran routinely threatens to blockade this strategic chokepoint, through which the majority of the world’s oil exports, among other goods, flow. This incident also comes as U.S. President Joe Biden is seeking rapprochement with Iran , including indirect negotiations regarding the U.S. government’s return to a controversial multi-national deal regarding Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, after years of hard-line policies on President Donald Trump. Beyond Iran’s continued hostile activities, Biden is facing various hurdles, including domestic political pressure and foreign criticism , especially from officials in Israel , as he pursues those diplomatic objectives. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE, 4:15 PM EST: Fox News has also now reported that the USS Georgia was entering the Persian Gulf from the Gulf of Oman by the way of the Strait of Hormuz during the incident. UPDATE, 4:40 PM EST: The U.S. Navy has now released the following two pictures from the incident, along with additional information. The official press release says that the group of U.S. warships included the Navy’s Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Monterey , as well as three Cyclone class patrol craft – the USS Hurricane , USS Squall , and USS Thunderbolt – along with another Coast Guard Island class patrol boat, the USCGC Wrangell . IRGC boats near the USS Georgia and its escorts in the Strait of Hormuz on May 10, 2021., USN USCGC Maui during the incident, with IRGC boats seen in the background., USN “The U.S. naval vessels were exercising transit passage in the Strait of Hormuz in accordance with customary international law,” the Navy said in a press release. “The U.S. naval vessels were escorting Georgia , as the submarine was transiting on the surface.” “Two of the 13 IRGCN [IRGC Navy] vessels broke away from the larger group, transited to the opposite side of the U.S. formation and approached Maui and Squall from behind at a high rate of speed (in excess of 32 knots) with their weapons uncovered and manned,” the release continued. “The remaining 11 FIAC [fast in-shore attack craft] maintained position which places the formation of the U.S. ships in between the two IRGCN groups.” The Navy says that U.S. personnel “issued multiple warning[s] to both groups of IRCGN vessels.” This included USCGC Maui and USS Squall issuing, together, “repeated bridge-to-bridge verbal warnings, five acoustic device warnings, and five short blasts of the ship’s horn, the internationally recognized danger signal outlined in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs).” The press release further confirms two rounds of warning shots when the craft came within 300 and 150 yards, respectively. “After U.S. naval ships repeated verbal and acoustic warning, sounded five blasts of the ship’s horn, and fired warning shots, the two FIAC altered course and increased their distance from the U.S. forces,” the press release added. “During the interaction, the IRGCN vessels came within 150 yards of Maui at high speed, an unnecessarily close range that put the ships and their crews in immediate danger,” according to the Navy. The two IRGCN vessels maneuvered in an unsafe and unprofessional manner and failed to exercise due regard for the safety of U.S. forces as required under international law. Their actions when coupled with the actions of the larger group of FIAC increased the risk of miscalculation and collision and were not in accordance with the internationally recognized COLREGS’ ‘rules of the road’ or internationally recognized maritime customs.” “The U.S. crews operated with distinct professionalism and superior seamanship,” the service added. “Our Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows while promoting the rules-based international order throughout the region.” UPDATE, 5:30 PM EST: The Navy has now released the following video footage from the incident. UPDATE, 5/11/2021: Iran has, unsurprisingly, rejected the U.S. military’s version of events and has released its own video footage from the incident purporting to show IRGC vessels on a “routine patrol” near USS Georgia and its escorts. In a statement, the IRGC accused the U.S. government of pushing “false narratives and unprofessional behavior” and said it should “abide by international regulations.” The organization also called on American warships to cease “provocative and aimless shooting” in response to the firing of warning shots. “Sadly, harassment by the IRGC Navy is not a new phenomenon. It is something that all of our commanding officers and the crews of our vessels are trained to for,” top Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby had also said during a press conference on May 10. “This activity is the kind of activity that could lead to somebody getting hurt and could lead to a real miscalculation there in the region, and that doesn’t serve anybody’s interests.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Navies Nuclear Guided Missile Submarines (SSGNs) Ohio Class (SSGN variant) Patrol Boats Sea Submarines U.S. Coast Guard"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2021",The End Of Iraq’s F-16 Fleet Is A Real Possibility As Lockheed Contractors Prepare To Leave,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The saga of the Iraqi Air Force ’s troubled Lockheed Martin F-16IQ Viper fighter jet fleet has taken another turn for the worse, with the announcement that manufacturer Lockheed Martin is to withdraw its maintenance teams supporting the jets from the country. The move has been taken amid continuing concerns for the safety of foreign contractors working on behalf of Iraq and the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq, where Iranian-backed militias are still waging a campaign of violence . The New York Times reported the latest development and published a statement from Joseph LaMarca Jr., Lockheed Martin’s vice president for communications. “In coordination with the U.S. government and with employee safety as our top priority,” LaMarca explained, “Lockheed Martin is relocating our Iraq-based F-16 team.” An Iraqi Air Force F-16 preflights his jet at Balad Air Base, Iraq, last December., U.S. Army Reserve/Spc. Jorge Reyes There were no details provided by the company about how many technicians will leave the country and whether or not there is any contingency plan to keep the F-16s active, although Reuters reports that a remote team will be set up to provide virtual support to the Iraqi Air Force. An unnamed Iraqi security official told the newspaper that there were 70 Lockheed Martin employees at Balad, around 50 of which would return to the United States, while the remainder would move to Erbil Air Base in the Kurdistan region. The news follows soon after the release of the latest report to the U.S. Congress from the Lead Inspector General for Operation Inherent Resolve, covering the first quarter of 2021. This provides details of Iraqi F-16 operations, including a total of 299 sorties in this period, 295 of which were for training. The limited number of operational sorties used primarily GBU-12 guided bombs and occasionally Mk 82 unguided bombs. While Iraqi F-16s and attack helicopters were reported conducting “dynamic strikes against high-value targets while also responding to support [Iraqi Security Forces] units in combat,” no more than four combat sorties actually took place in the last quarter. “With continued U.S. contractor support,” the report noted, “Iraq’s F-16 program aims to reach eight training sorties per day.” As The War Zone has explored in the past , these aircraft are, on paper, the Iraqi Air Force’s most capable combat assets , but have suffered from serious readiness problems in the past. Earlier this year, the Iraqi Air Force succeeded in getting 23 F-16s airborne over Baghdad for a military parade to commemorate 100 years of the Iraqi Army. Previous accounts had suggested that less than 20 percent of Iraq’s remaining 34 F-16s were fully airworthy. The latest New York Times report states that “few” of these jets are now still operational. Regardless, this same story concludes that, without Lockheed Martin’s assistance in Iraq, the remaining F-16s are likely to be grounded. Returning them to airworthiness would likely be difficult, if not impossible, without renewed assistance from the United States or potentially another country with established F-16 support infrastructure. Even if that could be arranged, it would also require U.S. approval. Either way, there remains the possibility that Baghdad instead chooses to invest its limited resources elsewhere in its military, perhaps in its Czech-made L-159 attack jets, currently flying but non-operational, or its AC-208 Armed Caravans that can deliver AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. However, the subsonic Su-25 Frogfoot attack jets have been grounded for the first quarter of 2021 due to a lack of spares. An Iraqi AC-208 Armed Caravan aircraft takes off from Balad Air Base prior to performing a close air support mission., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Luke Kitterman The new report also points to the particular security concerns surrounding Balad Air Base, home of the Iraqi Air Force F-16 fleet, which is located around 40 miles north of Baghdad in the so-called Sunni Triangle, one of the areas that were overrun by ISIS when it made significant gains in 2014. Delivery of the jets to Iraq was delayed as Iraqi security forces took on ISIS, but after the aircraft arrived, they began to be used to fight the insurgents as part of the Operation Inherent Resolve coalition, striking targets both in Iraq and in Syria . More recently, however, militias have stepped up their activities again in northern Iraq. As well as targeting local security forces, these attacks have been directed against individuals associated with oil fields and other energy infrastructure, humanitarian organizations, and U.S. interests. An Iraqi F-16 maintainer at work., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Keith James Two other Iraqi airbases with a U.S. military presence came under ballistic missile attack from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) last year. Al Asad and Erbil were both hit by IRGC missiles after the U.S. assassination of General Qasem Soleimani, then-commander of Iran’s Quds Force, in a drone strike in Baghdad in January last year. In all, 110 U.S. service members were injured in those attacks and Lockheed Martin personnel were briefly withdrawn from Balad in response. However, rocket attacks against Balad have continued , with Iran-backed militias also deemed to be the culprits. On May 3, a rocket attack hit the compound of U.S. military contractor, Sallyport, at Balad Air Base, killing and injuring some Iraqi contractors, although their U.S. counterparts were apparently unscathed. The New York Times report indicates that Iraqi officials tried to persuade the U.S. contingent to stay at Balad, while simultaneously putting pressure on the militias to stop their attacks, but the United States rejected this. Now, according to Iraqi officials, a return of U.S. contractors is only possible if adequate protection can be insured. So far, at least, the Iraqi security forces have not proved able to achieve this. An Iraqi Air Force F-16 approaches the boom of a U.S. Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker during a training mission above Iraq in May 2019., U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Russ Scalf The timing of all this is also unfortunate for Baghdad, where pro-Iran militias are applying pressure on the government to negotiate a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. While Lockheed Martin employees are not explicitly part of this equation, it’s no secret pro-Iranian groups want them gone. Meanwhile, the head of U.S. Central Command General Kenneth McKenzie told members of the House Armed Services Committee last month that he didn’t expect to see a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in the near future. Iraq acquired its F-16IQ jets — equivalent to the F-16C/D Block 52 — under a 2011 Foreign Military Sales deal, but there have been repeated questions about their airworthiness and even their use in combat. As for their capability, it’s also worth noting that they fall below most equivalent Block 52 jets, being provided with less sophisticated armament to secure export approval. A report published online last December by the Iraq Oil Report , which specializes in news from and about Iraq, stated that the Iraqi F-16 fleet was no longer flying missions as part of the international coalition. Soon after, the Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) offered a statement confirming the Iraqi F16 pilots had “demonstrated their readiness in the Defeat Daesh mission,” using the colloquial name for ISIS. Iraqi Air Force F-16s perform an elephant walk at Balad Air Base, last December., U.S. Army Reserve/Spc. Jorge Reyes However, the fact that the F-16s have been challenging to keep in the air has most recently been acknowledged by the Iraqi prime minister himself. “The lack of experts to maintain aircraft according to the agreement signed with the American companies when buying them is a problem,” Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi told Iraqi television channels recently. The temporary loss of Lockheed Martin technicians last year led to a downturn in F-16 availability, and this has been compounded by mismanagement and alleged corruption , including air force commanders allegedly fabricating logbooks to exaggerate the number of training flights taking place, and the reported illicit sale of jet fuel. An Iraqi maintainer sprays an F-16 with water after a mission in an undisclosed location, in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, June 2018., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Keith James While the security situation in the country has been the most obvious cause of disruption, there is an argument to be made that the advanced F-16 was not the right choice for the Iraqi Air Force, or this type of counterinsurgency warfare, anyway. These are issues you can read more about in this previous article of ours. Since the last U.S. combat troops withdrew from Iraq in 2011, the country has been on a slow and frequently painful path to military self-sufficiency. If Lockheed Martin can’t be persuaded to return to the country to support its F-16s or another arrangement doesn’t come to pass, these jets may end up as little more than a footnote in the reestablishment of the Iraqi Armed Forces.

As the U.S. special operations community, as a whole, works to better prepare itself for higher-end conflicts against potential near-peer adversaries, the Army says it will train and equip company-sized units of Special Forces personnel , better known as Green Berets , focused on taking down “hard targets.” This plan notably comes months after the Pentagon included a request for funds in its most recent budget request to build the secretive Joint Special Operations Command a specialized training facility where its operators could practice attacking “complex, hardened facility targets.” The Army’s 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne), or 1st SFC (A), which is part of Army Special Operations Command, announced its intention to create these “Hard Target Defeat Companies,” using existing Special Forces companies, in an unclassified white paper titled “A Vision For 2021 and Beyond,” which it released earlier this year. 1st SFC (A) was established in 2014 to oversee all of the Army’s Special Forces Groups, as well as various psychological operations and other supporting units. “1st SFC (A) develops and provides Hard Target Defeat Companies that are … uniquely organized to counter near-peer adversary campaigns,” the white paper explains. “They operate with regional partners to defeat hard targets in sensitive and constricted environments.” These Hard Target Defeat (HTD) Companies are set to supplant existing Army Special Forces units organized as standing Crisis Response Forces (CRF), according to journalist and author Wesley Morgan . Also known as a Commander’s In-extremis Force (CIF), these Green Beret elements were designed to “provide options to rescue people under threat , to recover sensitive materials such as weapons of mass destruction components , to provide humanitarian relief , or to address other short notice requirements,” according to an Army Special Operations Command white paper from 2017. Army Special Forces personnel in Germany perform a crisis response demonstration in a mock urban environment. , USMC In February, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had raised the possibility of disestablishing various crisis response units, which he said were underutilized and a drain on important resources, in a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee. SOFREP then reported in March that there was a plan in the works to shut down the CRFs, but that the Army Special Forces community would still retain some type of similar capability. This now appears to be the planned HTD Companies. The exact expected mission set of these refocused Special Forces units is not entirely clear. The 1st SFC (A) white paper does not provide a basic definition of what “hard target” means in the context of these companies or a list of basic examples of what might be included in this target set. “I’m told it’s still being decided what these will look like & may vary based on what a ‘hard target’ is in EUCOM [U.S. European Command] vs PACOM [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command] etc—but will still be direct-action companies,” Morgan wrote on Twitter on Dec. 1. Update: Special Forces CRF companies are out, “Hard-Target Defeat” companies are in. I’m told it’s still being decided what these will look like & may vary based on what a “hard target” is in EUCOM vs PACOM etc—but will still be direct-action companies. https://t.co/2dE9abnWPp https://t.co/DtLh94ibNd pic.twitter.com/jMsst6x8Zg — Wesley Morgan (@wesleysmorgan) December 1, 2020 1st SFC (A)’s white paper does include a fictional vignette that offers one example of how an HTD company might contribute to future higher-end operations. Set in the fictional West African country of Naruvu, the scenario begins with civil affairs soldiers noticing a Chinese infrastructure project while on their way to meet with a local official. This, in turn, triggers further efforts to ascertain the true nature of Chinese interests in a deep-water port in the country. Army special operations forces are then tapped to support an inter-agency effort to convince the Naruvian government to block the Chinese plans. Though this story is entire made up, it does reflect very real concerns that the U.S. government, as well as others , have about the potential dual-purpose nature of Chinese government and commercial investment, especially when it comes to infrastructure development , in countries around the world. An HTD company makes an appearance in the conclusion of the vignette, which is as follows: One week later, Naruvian security forces discovered an illegal weapons cache which it traced back to a subsidiary of the [Chinese] construction company. To further investigate the matter, they partnered with 3rd SFG (A)’s [3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne)] Hard Target Defeat Company (HTD) to surveil the construction company’s headquarters. Enabled by the HTD, Naruvian security forces accessed the building and, while searching it, recovered blueprints for the proposed port facility. Naruvu sent the recovered blueprints to DIA analysts who identified plans for concrete footings specifically designed for CSA-9 [HQ-9] surface-to-air and DF-25 shore-to-ship missiles. These missiles, if emplaced in Naruvu, would challenge America’s air and sea lanes across the Atlantic. Armed with this information, the US Ambassador explained if China emplaced those weapons at the port, Naruvu would become a strategic target and potential war zone between great powers. China’s true intent illuminated, the Naruvian government seized the Chinese-purchased land. The HTD’s activities in this fictional scenario fall under the general definition of “ special reconnaissance ,” a special operations forces mission set generally defined as operations to covertly gather intelligence in denied or otherwise sensitive areas. In this case, the target can be considered “hard” given its sensitive nature as an ostensibly civilian facility operated by one country in a third country, neither of which the United States is at war with. “Hard targets” could also certainly include hardened targets, such as critical command and control nodes , facilities housing weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and other high-value sites that may well be housed inside well-protected bunker complexes, primarily below ground . A number of major potential U.S. adversaries, including North Korea and Iran , as well as near-peer competitors, such as Russia and China , are increasingly turning to deeply-buried infrastructure to help protect critical assets from stand-off attacks, something is of particular interest here at The War Zone . This reality, as well as the potential use of special operations forces on the ground to infiltrate these kinds of sites during a future conflict, was underscored in U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) portion of the Pentagon’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request covering military construction. SOCOM is seeking around $14.4 million to build a dedicated hardened “training target structure” for use by the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). You can read more about this proposed project and its implications in this past War Zone story . A member of the Army’s 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) gains access to a mock facility using a portable circular saw during an exercise., US Army It’s also worth remembering that, in 2016, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) notably became the primary entity within the U.S. military for counter-WMD activities, subsequently establishing the Counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction-Fusion Center (CWMD-FC), which The War Zone was first to report on . Prior to this, U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) had been responsible for the CWMD mission. With all this in mind, in an actual higher-end conflict, Green Beret HTD companies could definitely be tasked to infiltrate “hard” sites of various kinds to gather important information, as in the Naruvian vignette. They could also conduct direct-action raids to disrupt or destroy key capabilities in support of broader operations. In today’s age of increasingly computerized and networked warfare, direct-action could involve kinetic actions, such as physically blowing up a target, or non-kinetic activities, such as inserting malicious code into an enemy’s computer network. It’s also important to note that hard targets may also be mobile, such as vehicle convoys, or even trains, carrying key individuals, or high-value weapons, such as road-mobile ballistic missile transporter-erector-launchers . Green Berets tasked with these kinds of missions would definitely benefit from more regular training in the tactics, techniques, and procedures necessary to carry them out. In addition, given the expanding anti-access and area-denial capabilities that more capable potential adversaries, such as Russia or China, have at their disposal, it would be important for the Army Special Forces elements to coordinate with units, including special operations units from other branches , to be best postured to actually make it to the target area successfully in the first place. These kinds of missions would fit well with more general distributed warfare concepts the U.S. military, as a whole , is exploring now that are geared toward keeping an opponent unbalanced and unable to effectively respond to a diverse array of threats across a large area. As the Naruvian scenario outlines, these kinds of special operations missions could also be employed, especially together with Allies and partners, outside of traditional conflicts to support specific geopolitical objectives. It will be interesting to see how the Army implements the HTD company concept, but from how it has already been described, it appears to be a very realistic plan to help tailor Special Forces units to be able to best apply their special skill sets to current and future higher-end fights.

Well, another one is in the bag! It hasn’t really settled in that I am about to write “2020” on checks. Growing up, that date always seemed so far away, something reserved for science fiction, not reality. But here we are! A new decade full of possibilities and a great time to reflect on all the good in our lives, as well as the areas we could do better, too. One of those things I am most thankful for is all of you. I get it, we hear that a lot from companies and talking heads, it may seem like a boilerplate thing, yet it really isn’t. I do what I love for a living. There isn’t a day that I wake up, no matter what is on the docket, that I don’t think about how fortunate I am to have such an incredible place to discuss the topics I am so passionate about, and I am only one part of that equation. This place is what it is because of so many people who take the time to help make it special. The hours that Joe Trevithick puts in and the dedication he shows for the subject never ceases to amaze me. He also deals with my crazy hours, demand for very particular product, and the bizarre rabbit holes we head down on a daily basis, but you probably already know that. I couldn’t do it without him. He deserves so much credit. This year saw new voices join our choir. Brett Tingley has evolved into an incredible deep research feature writer on topics that are nearly un-researchable . I am stunned with his growth and the thoroughness of his awesome work. I can’t wait for what comes next from him. Chris “Ox” Harmer has written some amazing stories and given us the unique perspective that only a veteran Navy helicopter pilot with thousands of hours can. Tim McMillan has been a true joy to work with and to watch go about his work. He is the best old-school investigator I know. If he can’t find the person or thing, nobody can.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 20, 2018",Check Out This Eerie Image Of A Navy Special Ops Seahawk Raiding A Ship In The Dead Of Night,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 85, or HSC-85, also known as the “Firehawks,” helped members of a specialized U.S. Coast Guard counter-terrorism unit train to rappel down and quickly board a ship where terrorists might be in control and holding hostages last month. The crews of HSC-85, the Navy’s only helicopter squadron dedicated to providing special operations forces support, are very familiar with the tactics, techniques, and procedures required for these kinds of Helicopter Visit Board Search and Seizure operations. The Navy now wants to shutter HSC-85 as part of its 2021 Fiscal Year budget proposal to help free up funds for other priorities. The MH-60S Seahawk from HSC-85, which is part of the Navy Reserve, joined elements of the Coast Guard’s Maritime Safety Response Team West (MSRT West) and the Navy’s Aerial Target Launch Ship 9701 (ATLS 9701) for the exercise off the coast of San Diego, California on Feb. 11, 2020. Another MH-60S from the “Black Knights” of Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 4 (HSC-4) also took part in the training. Members of MRST West also rappeled onto the deck of ATLS 9701 from an MH-60S from HSC-4 during the night, as seen here, and during the day during the exercise in February 2020., USN The two MH-60S helicopters flew members of MSRT West out to ATLS 9701 on simulated Helicopter Visit Board Search and Seizure (HVBSS) missions during the day and at night. The helicopters also extracted some of the Coast Guardsmen by winching them back up into the helicopter afterward. The MH-60S from HSC-85 hovers low over the deck of Aerial Target Launch Ship 9701 during one of the day time mock HVBSS missions that took place during the February 2020 exercise., USN USN Members of MSRT West fast-rope from the MH-60S from HSC-4 during the February 2020 exercise., USN The Coast Guard established MSRT West, together with MSRT East based on the east coast, in 2006 as dedicated counter-terrorism teams capable of performing direction action missions against terrorists who might be occupying a ship or facility on shore. The MSRTs are among the most elite of the Coast Guard’s Deployable Operations Group and their personnel routinely train with members of U.S. military special operations units, such as the Navy SEALs, and tactical teams from federal law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The MH-60S from HSC-4 winches up Coast Guard personnel from ATLS 9701’s deck., USN USN Navy personnel pull members of the Coast Guard’s MSRT West into the cabin of the MH-60S from HSC-4 during the exercise. The other MH-60S from HSC-85 is seen flying overwatch in the background., USN The MSRTs’ mission set includes being prepared to conduct higher risk HVBSS missions, so training with units such as HSC-85 is also something that occurs regularly. Though Hollywood military and action movies make it look simple, fast-roping from a helicopter, especially onto a ship bobbing up and down, is something that definitely requires routine practice. Helicopter crews also need to be proficient in being able to safely get into the right position and maintain a steady hover, potentially in a very confined space, while the personnel on board are rappelling down to the ground or ship’s deck below. This can be a tricky proposition under the best circumstances and even more so at night and if hostiles below are shooting back. You can read about all the planning that goes into these kinds of operations in this past War Zone piece . The Navy and Marines, often use the 264-and-a-half-feet-long ATLS 9701, the only ship of its kind in service, for HVBSS training because it has a flat open main deck. The U.S. military, as well as the Coast Guard, also often uses chartered vessels for fast-rope training. The nearly 860-ton-displacement ATLS 9701 is also approved for various other specialized training roles, such as carrying targets for snipers riding in helicopters and providing space for personnel to train to breach a ship’s hatches or shipping container doors, or to otherwise conduct operations in the confined spaces of a ship. As its name suggests, VT Halter Marine originally built the ship, which is capable of operating in an unmanned mode, for the Navy to support other exercises, as well as research and development and operational test and evaluation activities, by serving as a launchpad for unmanned target drones . A Navy briefing slide describing some of ATLS 9701’s capabilities., USN ATLS 9701 looks to set to continue to be a useful training platform for the Coast Guard’s MSRTs and other specialized units for years to come. However, the future of HSC-85 is anything but certain. In its latest budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, the Navy announced plans to inactivate the squadron, which would eliminate the service’s last dedicated special operations support helicopter unit. HSC-85, which was officially established in 1970, took on the special operations support mission, as well as the Firehawks name, in 2011. This came five years after the Navy shuttered Helicopter Combat Support Squadrons (Special) 5, or HCS-5. That squadron had also been known as the Firehawks. In 2006, the Helicopter Combat Support Squadrons (Special) 4, or HCS-4, also known as the Redwolves, had closed its doors, with Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 84 (HSC-84) taking over its special operations support mission. HCS-4 and HCS-5, which were also Navy Reserve squadrons, had evolved from the famous Vietnam War-era Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) 3, or HA(L)-3, the “Seawolves,” which provided support for SEALs and other specialized units in the Mekong Delta region. The Navy had begun looking to cut HSC-84 and HSC-85 in 2013. Three years later, the service succeeded in inactivating HSC-84, but pressure from Congress help preserve HSC-85. The service is now making arguments for getting rid of the remaining squadron again. US special operators rappel from an HH-60H Seahawk assigned to HSC-84 during Exercise Emerald Warrior 2014., USAF “While HSC-85 is a dedicated SOF [special operations] support unit with highly trained aviators and some unique equipment, General Purpose Force HSC squadrons are trained and equipped to provide similar capability – particularly in maritime environments,” a briefing book accompanying the Navy’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request explained. “Further, the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force maintain aviation SOF support capability that is more robust and better resourced, and those units enjoy a close support relationship with USSOCOM [U.S. Special Operations Command].” The helicopters assigned to the Army’s Special Operations and Air Force Special Operations Command’s CV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors are definitely much more capable than the MH-60S in the special operations support role. The Seahawks are notably not capable of refueling in flight, which significantly limits their operational range. HSC-85’s status as a Navy Reserve unit also means that its helicopters are low on the priority list to receive other important modifications and upgrades. You can read much more about these issues in detail in this past War Zone piece . Congress still has to approve the Navy’s plan to shutter HSC-85. The fact that HSC-4’s took part in this recent Helicopter Visit Board Search and Seizure exercise does support the service’s argument that other helicopter sea combat squadrons can provide similar support for special operations and other specialized units, such as the Coast Guard’s Maritime Safety Response Teams, going forward.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 26, 2021",Watch This Night Stalker AH-6 Little Bird Execute A Maritime Rope Ladder Extraction,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone has written extensively about how the aviators of the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment are experts in flying through especially challenging environments, including hazard-filled urban areas , and at very low levels in the dark, in order to insert special operators where ever they might need to go. This even includes dispensing them right on moving trains . A recent official video showing one of the Night Stalker’s AH-6 Little Birds using a rope ladder to extract an individual from the water reminds us that they’re just as capable of getting American personnel out at the end of a mission or in an emergency as getting them in. The U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command (ARSOAC), which oversees the 160th among other units, released the video on YouTube on Nov. 3, 2019. The caption does not say where or when the video was shot or offer any additional context, but it was probably part of a training course, a larger exercise, or some other form of capability demonstration or test. Based on their helmet and other gear, the individual clinging onto the ladder appears to be playing the role of a downed aviator. Using rope ladders to extract as well as insert personnel from helicopters certainly isn’t new. American helicopter units have used such systems extensively since the Vietnam War, especially to get troops, including small teams of special operators , in and out constrained areas where they could not safely land to pick them. This also allowed the helicopters to avoid more obvious landing sites, which might have been booby-trapped already and where they would be especially vulnerable, regardless. During that conflict, the U.S. military also developed various other alternative insertion and extraction options, including rappelling and the Stabilized Body (STABO) rig, which evolved into the Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction (SPIE) concept that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . An Air Force UH-1P Huey helicopter assigned to the 20th Special Operations Squadron with a rope ladder installed sits awaiting a mission during the Vietnam War., USAF An Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk crew trains to use a rope ladder to extract personnel from the water in 2015., USAF What’s interesting in the case of this particular video is the use of an armed AH-6 Little Bird instead of an MH-6, which the 160th employs as small personnel transports. Unlike the MH-6s, the AH-6s do not have external planks for personnel to ride externally to and from an objective. The video shows the helicopter in this particular instance flying away with the individual it just pulled out of the water simply holding on to the ladder as they hang below. Having the individual below hang on definitely isn’t ideal for any sort of long-duration flight, especially if they are injured. However, it would provide an immediate option for removing them from imminent danger and flying them even a short distance to a landing zone that might be safer or otherwise more accessible to more suitable rescue assets. Another helicopter, like one with a rescue hoist and/or open cabin space, fixed-wing aircraft, or vehicles on the ground, could then bring them to their final destination. The idea of using attack helicopters as improvised rescue platforms when there are no other immediate options isn’t unheard of, either. A particularly notable example occurred in January 2007 , when four U.K. Royal Marines strapped themselves, two each, to the sides of British Army AH-64 Apache, to try to save the life of one of their comrades who had gotten seriously wounded in an attack on a Taliban position in Afghanistan. They flew to the scene of the fighting riding on the fairings on either side of the cockpit, jumped off after landing, and then secured the injured individual to the outside of one of the gunships in the same position. Sadly, Royal Marines Lance Corporal Mathew Ford died in transit. https://youtube.com/watch?v=epyJl6btNq8 Six months later, the U.S. Army employed the same general tactic in Iraq to successfully rescue a wounded soldier, also using an AH-64 Apache. In that case, the crew of the gunship put the injured individual in the co-pilot’s seat, and the co-pilot rode strapped to the outside of the helicopter. Army Apache pilots had already rescued two downed pilots in that country in a similar fashion back in 2004 , as well. Then-U.S. Army Captain Ryan Welch demonstrating the rig employed during the rescue mission in Iraq in 2004., US Army There are also instances of U.S. Marine AH-1 Super Cobras performing similar rescues with the individuals riding on the side of the forward fuselage seated on an open ammunition bay door. This is a tactic that also dates back to the introduction of the AH-1 during the Vietnam War . A number of foreign attack helicopters have procedures for executing similar emergency operations and Russia’s Mi-24 Hind series actually has a small passenger cabin that can be used for a similar purpose, if need be. A Marine Corps AH-1W Super Cobra extracts personnel in Afghanistan by having them ride on an open ammunition bay door., Public domain It’s not clear how regularly the 160th’s AH-6 crews train to perform this kind of mission, but it makes good sense to have this as a sort of backup personnel recovery capability. Depending on the exact size and weight of the rope ladder, it’s possible that the 160th’s armed Little Birds regularly carry that piece of equipment just in case they’re the only aircraft available and in range to attempt such an extraction. If you’re an American special operator or downed pilot and you need to get out of a rough spot, hanging on to a rope ladder dangling from an AH-6 Little Bird might not be your first choice for a to safety, but it would still be a welcome option if there’s no way for a more traditional rescue party to get to you quickly. UPDATE — A reader has reached out to let us know that the flexible ladder the AH-6 crew employed in this case is not technically a rope ladder, but is a caving ladder , which uses steel cable and aluminum rungs.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2021",About Those Custom Rifles Navy SEALs Were Seen Carrying On A Recent Training Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday we published some incredible shots of Navy SEALs and SWCCs operating with the Army’s Night Stalkers off the coast near Dam Neck, Virginia. You can see those images here . It didn’t take long for our mailbox to fill up with inquires as to what rifles the SEALs, who are reportedly from SEAL Team Six, a unit that has an unparalleled small arms armory, were carrying on their training mission aboard the highly modified MH-6 Little Birds and MH-60 Black Hawks . So, we did some research, and here is what we found out—they are indeed unique, at least when it comes to the U.S. military and AR-15/M4/M16 pattern rifles. From what we can tell via the imagery taken by aviation photographer Raven Harris , the rifle uppers are from the highly respected AR-15 manufacturer Noveske located in Grants Pass, Oregon. Noveske has a reputation that borders on mythic in the firearms community and it isn’t a surprise that SEAL Team Six’s notoriously capable armorers would reach out to them to satisfy some of the team’s needs. Between 2007 and 2020, the US Navy awarded multiple contracts to Noveske worth a combined total of nearly $4.9 million, according to records available through the Federal Procurement Database System. These deals came through various different offices within the service, including the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division in Indiana, which has crafted various specialized small arms for Naval Special Warfare Command over the years. Cropped images showing the rifles in question during the recent exercise off the Virginia coast: Raven Harris Raven Harris Raven Harris Raven Harris Raven Harris The rifle’s full upper assembly, which includes the barrel, gas block and tube, handguard/rail system, upper receiver, charging handle, forward assist, dust cover, and bolt carrier group, appears to be near-identical to Noveske’s 10.5″ Gen III Shorty Upper, which you can check out on their website here . The specs are high-end and include a machined billet upper receiver and one of Noveske’s highly regarded stainless steel barrels, which have a reputation for extreme accuracy. Noveske’s 10.5″ Gen III Shorty Upper, Noveske Check out the full details below: Length – 10.5” Stainless Steel or Cold Hammer Forged 5.56 with 1/7 Twist or Stainless Steel 300BLK with 1/7 twist Gas Block – Lo-Pro, .750, pinned to barrel Barrel Extension w/extended feed ramps Upper Receiver Model – Gen III precision machined billet receiver from 7075-T6 w/extended feed ramps featuring anti-rotation interface with handguard Finish – Hardcoat type III anodizing, with Cerakote ceramic coating (Black) for ultimate finish and performance Charging Handle – Noveske Marked Geissele Super Badass Charging Handle Shot peened & MP tested bolt Auto carrier w/staked carrier key Handguard (options) NSR-9” (M-LOK) Free floating handguard w/1913 top rail both with Hardcoat type III anodizing and Cerakote ceramic coating (Black) The 10.5″ barrel length is common for the SEALs, and especially SEAL Team Six, which operates in a counter-terror role with missions occurring in urban terrain , aboard vessels, and even in underground structures . Requirements from the Naval Special Warfare community are what produced the Mk 18 , also known as the Close Quarters Battle Receiver (CQBR), with its 10.3″ barrel. Other U.S. special operations forces units, as well as other elements within the Navy and the Coast Guard, subsequently adopted those guns, as well. Caught some real muzzle blast in this picture of members of the U.S. Coast Guard's Maritime Security Response Team West training with their Mk 18s. pic.twitter.com/NhNpKCqtmZ — Joseph Trevithick (@FranticGoat) January 1, 2020 The HK 416s that SEAL Team Six used on the Bin Laden Raid , which made the guns famous, used 10.4″ barrels. Unlike those weapons, which use a piston arrangement to cycle the action, the Noveske setup uses direct impingement (DI) system, just like Eugene Stoner’s original design and the M16, CAR-15, and M4 that came after it. You can read more about the debate of piston vs DI for AR-15 style rifles here . SEAL Team 6/DEVGRU kit. MP7 and HK416 in matching camo. The real gem is the 'Pirate Gun,' the sawed-off M79 40mm break-open grenade launcher made famous by 'Mark Owen's' book No Easy Day. pic.twitter.com/IzwEwun4ZX — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) October 6, 2020 Where things diverge a bit is the lower receiver. It appears that these weapons do not feature Noveske’s billet design , but instead feature a more traditional forged receiver. They could still be from Noveske, but they do not make up the common matching billet upper-lower receiver sets we see on the commercial market. Regardless, there is no reason why a billet upper and forged lower cannot be combined. It’s also possible that the SEAL armorers attached the Noveske upper to their own custom-tuned, fully built-out lowers, which would include a custom trigger and fire control group. Regardless, the lower receivers appear to be set up with ambidextrous bolt assists/ releases and flared/enhanced trigger guards . The latter of which is a common feature that more easily accommodates users wearing gloves. The lower is finished off with a Magpul SL-K Carbine Stock and Lancer Systems clear 30-round magazines, some of which are blue Train-Safe types designed for Simunitions and similar non-lethal simulated training ammunition, are loaded into the mag wells. Attached to the end of the Noveske stainless steel barrel is a Dead Air Silencer’s Sandman . The laser pointer/illuminator system on the forward upper handguard rail is the L3Harris AN/PEQ-15 Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL). Atop the flattop receiver is what looks like an Aimpoint Micro T2 red dot optic mounted on a Scalarworks Leap mount . Other operators are seen with EOTech XPS holographic sights . Beyond that, there are subtle differences among the group of rifles, with things like vertical foregrips and INFORCE WML weapons lights being attached to some of the SEALs’ weapons. One even has a different stock, some don’t have the enhanced bolt assist/release, the primary grips appear to vary, including HK416 and Hogue over-molded styles . These variations are likely due to the operator’s personal choice, but overall, the operators’ primary weapons are relatively uniform across the groups of SEALs seen in the photos. So, what does one of these SEAL-approved rifles cost? Well, if you were to piece together one at list prices it would run about $5,500 all said and done. Not cheap, but for those who really use this stuff in the highest threat environments and most extreme circumstances imaginable, it’s a bargain.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 28, 2021",Top Russian Submarine Design Bureau Hit By Cyber Attack With Chinese Characteristics,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau was the target of a cyber attack involving an image file with malicious software embedded inside it via a specific tool that has become a hallmark of multiple entities linked to the Chinese government . The file could have been used to create a backdoor into the networks at Rubin, a prolific designer of submarines and other underwater platforms. Its portfolio includes the ultra-quiet Borei class ballistic missile submarine, the unique Belgorod and Losharik special missions submarines, and the Poseidon nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ultra-long-range ‘doomsday’ torpedo, among other work. Cybersecurity firm Cybereason first reported on the attack on April 30, 2021, but it’s unclear when it was actually carried out. Metadata that the company provided along with its analysis says that the Rich Text Format (RTF) image in question was created in 2007, but the report says that this is almost certainly false and meant to help obfuscate its origins. Other portions of the metadata indicate that it was first accessed earlier in April, but that may just be when Cybereason first opened it up to assess it. It’s also not clear if the attack was successful in any way. A monument at the Rubin Design Bureau centered on a model of a Typhoon class ballistic missile submarine, the largest submarine ever built, by submerged displacement, to date. Above that, in the same scale, is a model of the Delfin , the Russian Navy’s first combat-capable submarine, which entered service in 1903. Rubin designed both submarines., Apetrov09703 via Wikimedia “The initial infection vector is a spear-phishing email addressed to the “respectful general director Igor Vladimirovich [Vilnit]” at the Rubin Design Bureau , a submarine design center from the ‘ Gidropribor ‘ concern in St. Petersburg, a national research center that designs underwater weapons like submarines,” Cybereason’s report says. “The email attachment is a malicious RTF document weaponized with a RoyalRoad payload, with content describing a general view of an autonomous underwater vehicle.” A “spear-phishing” attack involves tricking an individual into opening a file, received via Email or some other source, that contains malicious software (malware). That malware then infects the target’s computer, and potentially other parts of any networks it is linked to, either carrying out certain malign tasks directly or providing a vector through which additional attacks can be carried out. A screenshot of the Email to Rubin’s Director-General, Igor Vladimirovich Vilnit, to which the infected RTF image was attached., via Cybereason In this case, according to Cybereason, the attackers used a program called RoyalRoad to embed a separate file, winlog.wll, into the RTF image. That subfile would then have loaded a piece of malware, called Portdoor, onto the target computer when the TRF was opened. Cybereason said that Portdoor was “a previously undocumented backdoor” and had “the ability to do reconnaissance, target profiling, delivery of additional payloads, privilege escalation, process manipulation static detection antivirus evasion, one-byte XOR encryption, AES-encrypted data exfiltration and more.” In short, it could have identified files of interest on the target computer, and potentially on networks it was linked to, and then paved the way for further attacks to either steal that information or carry out other malicious tasks. The individuals who launched the cyber attack on Rubin are not identified in this report, which only says that the “previously undocumented backdoor [was] assessed to have been developed by a threat actor likely operating on behalf of Chinese state-sponsored interests. Beyond that, the RoyalRoad RTF “weaponizer” is a tool that has become very closely associated with Chinese government-linked entities, known by names like Goblin Panda , Rancor Group , TA428 , Tick , and Tonto Team , according to Cybereason and other sources . The Chinese government is certainly well-known for engaging in industrial espionage, including via cyberattacks, against foreign companies to steal information about military and non-military projects, as well as systems that could have both military and civilian applications . However, public reports about such incidents more typically involve Western companies or major firms in East Asia , rather than those in Russia. The attack on Rubin is particularly notable given China’s efforts to expand the overall size and capabilities of its submarine fleets , especially with the introduction of new, quieter, nuclear-powered ballistic and guided missile submarines . Though Russia’s own defense acquisition and modernization efforts are often limited by budgetary issues and other factors , the country still has a significant knowledge base when it comes to the development of advanced submarines, thanks to Rubin, as well as the Malakhit Design Bureau. That latter firm developed the Yasen and Yasen-M class super-quiet guided-missile submarines. The Russian Navy just recently received its first Yasen-M , the Kazan , and you can read more about both types here . Rubin’s website says that it, alone, has been responsible for the development of 85 percent of Soviet and Russian Navy submarines since 1901. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UEzgQ26W4hE As already noted, Rubin has also been responsible for the development of a number of novel and otherwise highly specialized underwater systems, another area that China is increasingly interested in, as well. The Russian company’s design work in this field includes the Poseidon torpedo , seen in the video below, and the Harpsichord large unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), also intended for deployment from manned submarines. It has also been developing another relatively large UUV, known as Cephalopod , which could potentially operate as a fully autonomous armed mini-submarine. Interestingly, the image in the spear-phishing Email sent to Rubin’s director was a graphic of a design that appears to be at least closely related to Cephalopod. A copy of the image into which the malware had been embedded, which was then sent to Rubin’s Director-General Vilnit. The system shown is similar, if not identical to an unmanned underwater vehicle Rubin has been developing called Cephalopod., via Cybereason An image that has been circulating online since at least 2017, showing various Russian unmanned platforms. A rendering of an unmanned underwater vehicle identified as Cephalopod is seen at the bottom right., Public Domain It’s not clear where the attackers might have initially obtained that image or if they faked it themselves. “Whoever drew it knew a lot about AUVs and Rubin designs. So the image itself appears legit,” H.I. Sutton, an expert on all things that operate underneath the waves, wrote regarding this entire report on his website, Covert Shores . Either way, whoever was behind the cyber attack could have used the graphic to further try to fool Vilnit into thinking it was an internal message and get him to open it. It’s also interesting to remember that a report emerged last year that Beijing and Moscow were cooperating on the development of a new non-nuclear submarine design. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) already operates two Russian-made Kilo class diesel-electric attack submarines, as well as 10 more so-called Improved Kilos with enhanced performance and sonar capabilities, both of which are also Rubin designs. At the same time, there have been suggestions that this partnership could benefit Russia more than China since the latter appears now to be leading the two in the development of air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems used in very quiet diesel-electric designs . A Russian Navy Kilo class submarine. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy also operates submarines of this type., Russian Ministry of Defense Regardless, there are many instances where China has cooperated with foreign firms, including those in Russia, on the development, as well as production, of certain military systems, only for Chinese concerns to subsequently begin making unlicensed clones and derivatives . The Kremlin itself has publicly said that it has engaged with its counterparts in Beijing in the past on this matter, generally, as a potential impediment to future Russian arms sales to China. “Unauthorized copying of our equipment abroad is a huge problem. There have been 500 such cases over the past 17 years,” Yevgeny Livadny, the Chief of Intellectual Property Projects at Rostec, Russia’s main state-owned industrial conglomerate, said in December 2019 . “China alone has copied aircraft engines, Sukhoi planes, deck jets , air defense systems, portable air defense missiles, and analogs of the Pantsir medium-range surface-to-air systems.” No matter what, if the cyber attack on Rubin was indeed Chinese state-sponsored, it would certainly seem to indicate that officials in Beijing feel that there is much to be gleaned from that design bureau’s work to further its own underwater ambitions. How this incident might impact further Russian-Chinese cooperation on submarines, or any other major industrial projects, defense-related or not, remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 22, 2021","Honeywell Fined Millions Over Exporting Sensitive Info On F-22, F-35, And More To China (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government and defense contractor Honeywell have reached a settlement over alleged violations of portions of the Arms Export Control Act, or AECA, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations , or ITAR. The matter at hand had to do with Honeywell’s alleged unauthorized export of dozens of technical drawings relating to components of various aircraft, missiles, and tanks, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter , the B-1B bomber , the Tomahawk cruise missile , and the M1A1 Abrams , to multiple countries, including China. American officials contend that some of the disclosures harmed national security, something that Honeywell denies. The U.S. State Department announced the deal , in which Honeywell agreed to pay $13 million in civil penalties, among other things. Of that amount, the payment of $5 million was immediately suspended on the condition that the company put it toward “remedial compliance measures.” In addition, the U.S. government chose not to pursue more serious action based on Honeywell “voluntarily” disclosing the exports that violated the AECA and ITAR, which the State Department also continues to describe as alleged as a result of the settlement. An F-22 Raptor, in front, flies alongside an F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. Technical drawings of components found in these two aircraft were among those that Honeywell allegedly made authorized exports of to China. , USAF “The settlement demonstrates the Department’s role in strengthening U.S. industry by protecting U.S.-origin defense articles, including technical data, from unauthorized exports,” according to a press release from the State Department. “The settlement also highlights the importance of obtaining appropriate authorization from the Department for exporting controlled articles.” “Honeywell voluntarily disclosed to the Department the alleged violations that are resolved under this settlement. Honeywell also acknowledged the serious nature of the alleged violations, cooperated with the Department’s review, and instituted a number of compliance program improvements during the course of the Department’s review,” according to that statement. “For these reasons, the Department has determined that it is not appropriate to administratively debar Honeywell at this time.” The charging document in the case, now made public through the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, says that “Honeywell ultimately identified 71 ITAR-controlled drawings that between July 2011 and October 2015 it had exported without authorization,” in a disclosure it voluntarily made in 2016. Two years later, the firm acknowledged a second set of unapproved exports “that were similar to the violations disclosed in the first voluntary disclosure,” according to the State Department. A B-1B bomber., Tyler Rogoway A Tomahawk cruise missile captured moments before hitting the hulk of an F-4 Phantom II fighter jet during a test., Public Domain All of these alleged exports had to do with drawings that “contained engineering prints showing layouts, dimensions, and geometries for manufacturing castings and finished parts for multiple aircraft, military electronics, and gas turbine engines” used on various aircraft and ground vehicles. The documents were shared via DEXcenter, “a file exchange platform” that the Honeywell employees in question typically use to “transfer drawings to suppliers.” That document includes the following list of impacted platforms, with a caveat that this was only some of the examples, rather than a full accounting: F-35 Joint Strike Fighter B-1B Lancer Long-Range Strategic Bomber F-22 Fighter Aircraft C-130 Military Transport Aircraft A-7H Corsair Aircraft A-10 Aircraft Apache Longbow Helicopter M1A1 Abrams Tank Tactical Tomahawk Missile T55 Turboshaft Engine It’s worth pointing out that the A-7H was a variant of the A-7E developed specifically for Greece’s Hellenic Air Force and that the Corsair II series, as a whole, has been out of U.S. military service now for decades. The Greeks formally retired the last of their A-7s in 2014. A Greek A-7H Corsair II in a special “Tiger” paint scheme., A7 Tiger via Wikimedia Variants of the T55 turboshaft engine have been used on platforms over the years, most notably the CH-47 Chinook series of helicopters. The Boeing Sikorsky SB>1 Defiant advanced compound helicopter now under test by the U.S. Army also uses versions of the T55. A US Army soldier works on a T55 engine on a CH-47F Chinook helicopter., US Army Honeywell is alleged to have made unauthorized exports of drawings related to components “that are used in platforms including in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, M1A1 Abrams Tank, Tactical Tomahawk Missile, B-1B Lancer Long-Range Strategic Bomber, and F-22 Fighter Aircraft platforms as well as the T55 and CTS800 turboshaft engines to the PRC [People’s Republic of China],” specifically, according to the State Department. “The U.S. Government reviewed copies of the 71 drawings and determined that exports to and retransfers in the PRC of drawings for certain parts and components for the engine platforms for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, B-1B Lancer Long-Range Strategic Bomber, and the F-22 Fighter Aircraft harmed U.S. national security.” US Marine Corps M1A1 Abrams tanks., USMC The CTS800 engine, not mentioned in the earlier list, was originally designed to power the RAH-66A Comanche stealth helicopter. Today, it is found in the Leonardo AW159 Wildcat helicopter, used by the U.K. Royal Navy , among others, and the Turkish T129 ATAK attack helicopter, among others. Additional alleged unauthorized exports of drawings were made to Canada, Mexico, Ireland, and Taiwan. However, the U.S. government did not assess any of these incidents to have directly impacted national security, according to the charging document. Honeywell has disputed the national security implications of the transfers, which it first disclosed to the U.S. government in 2018. “The issues Honeywell reported involved technology that was assessed as having no impact on national security and is commercially available throughout the world,” the company said in a statement. “No detailed manufacturing or engineering expertise was shared.” It is also worth noting that the provisions of the AECA and ITAR are extremely stringent. They even place serious penalties on the foreign export of seemingly innocuous items, such as certain unclassified technical manuals that can otherwise be freely bought and sold by U.S. citizens. At the same time, even if details about the core technology in question are freely available internationally, it seems hard to see how exporting drawings that could relate to the use of said technology on sensitive platforms, such as the F-35, F-22, B-1, or Tomahawk cruise missile, would not be at least concerning. The Chinese government has a long history of conducting industrial espionage with the aim of acquiring various military and commercial technology, especially aviation-related systems, with a particular focus on aircraft engines. In 2018, U.S. and Belgian authorities notably worked together to apprehend a Chinese spy accusing of stealing aerospace information from various American firms, including General Electric. The country’s intelligence services have already obtained other more sensitive information about various modern American weapon systems, including the F-35 and F-22 , as well. “In my discussions — in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, ‘We welcome the competition. We’re not looking for conflict,'” President Joe Biden said last week, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping, in an address to a joint session of Congress on April 28, 2021. “But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America’s interests across the board.  America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state — to state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.” It’s certainly possible, now that this settlement is public, that more information about the specifics of what was allegedly exported and the operational security issue at play may now emerge. Whatever the case, the alleged violations are certainly disconcerting given the lengths Chinese authorities are known to go to secure similar information illicitly. UPDATE, 5/4/21: After the publishing of this story, Honeywell reached out, saying the initial company statement that had been sent out contained errors and to provide an updated statement, which is as follows: Honeywell is fully committed to compliance with all applicable export control laws, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Several years ago, we voluntarily informed the U.S. Department of State’s Defense Trade Controls Compliance (DTCC) unit in two Voluntary Disclosures where Honeywell designs were inadvertently shared during normal business discussions. The issues Honeywell reported involved technology that was assessed as having an impact on national security, though is commercially available throughout the world. No detailed manufacturing or engineering expertise was shared. Under an agreement reached with the State Department to resolve these issues, Honeywell will pay a fine, engage an external compliance officer to oversee the Consent Agreement for a minimum of 18 months, and will conduct an external audit of our compliance program. Since Honeywell voluntarily self-reported these disclosures, we have taken several actions to ensure there are no repeat incidents. These actions included enhancing export security, investing in additional compliance personnel, and increasing compliance training.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An example of the Kratos UTAP-22 Mako unmanned aircraft, as used in the recent flight test of an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain,” is now engaged on further flight trials for the Skyborg program , but with a radically reworked appearance suggesting it’s now carrying additional sensors, perhaps including an infrared search and track system . Accompanying photos of the revamped drone were released by the Pentagon, which announced that the flight in question “was the closest a manned fighter has flown to an unmanned aircraft under autonomous control in the history of the Department of Defense.” Two photos posted recently to the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service website show the modified UTAP-22 being accompanied by an F-16C fighter jet assigned to the Air Force’s 96th Test Wing, which operates out of Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and is the lead test entity for Skyborg. The milestone mission was conducted over the Gulf of Mexico, on May 5. The considerable over-water ranges in the Gulf of Mexico are already regularly used for missions involving ground-launched Kratos BQM-167A Skeeter target drones , upon which the UTAP-22 is based. Major Nathan McCaskey, an F-16 test pilot with the 96th Test Wing, observes the modified UTAP-22 aircraft over the Gulf of Mexico, on May 5., U.S. Air Force Compared to other examples of the UTAP-22 that we’ve seen before, the drone involved in the May 5 test appears to feature a significantly reshaped air intake for its underslung jet engine. Although the quality of the image is not ideal, it certainly appears that the intake has been made longer and deeper to accommodate a sensor above it. Based on the limited information that can be gathered from these images, the rear of the drone appears more or less unchanged. A much-enlarged image of the UTAP-22, with a black arrow indicating the apparently revised air intake, and a red arrow pointing to what appears to be an IRST housing., U.S. AIR FORCE As for the new fairing that appears to project forward between the UTAP-22’s fuselage and the F-16-like intake, this certainly looks similar to infrared search and track (IRST) sensors of the type that are now increasingly being carried on U.S. fighters in pod-mounted form. Last year, we reported on how these pods were being tested on both Air Force F-15C and Navy F/A-18E/F fighter jets . Above all, these kinds of sensors provide the pilot with the ability to identify, track and target aircraft, including stealthy platforms that cannot be easily “seen” on radar. Porting this kind of technology onto an unmanned loyal wingman-type drone would make logical sense. Distributing these sensors on loyal wingmen or autonomous drones and networking and fusing their info via datalink can help increase the quality of opposing aircraft tracks they produce via triangulation. An IRST sensor, unlike a radar, also has the advantage of operating passively, meaning a hostile aircraft wouldn’t necessarily be aware that it was being tracked or of a threat aircraft’s presence via its own radar emissions. If that sensor is carried by a stealthy, smaller platform, such as a UTAP-22, the chances of its being detected would be reduced still further. Indeed, it would be possible to envisage loyal wingmen drones using its IRST sensors to provide targeting to manned fighters whose own radar was being degraded by enemy jamming or by an otherwise deteriorated electromagnetic environment or not operating at all as to not give away the aircraft’s presence, relying on telemetry from the expendable drones instead. This is what the standard UTAP-22 configuration looks like, with its straight-shot ventral air intake and engine arrangement. This new configuration basically attaches a large serpentine duct to that with an area for a forward-facing sensor, likely an IRST, between the intake lip and the fuselage., Kratos By extending the air inlet into more of a serpentine layout, it allows for another sensor to be mounted in a streamlined fashion on the centerline of the aircraft. This means that the nose could still carry another sensor, like a radar or electronic warfare package, simultaneously. In addition, the serpentine duct also may cut down significantly on the UTAP-22’s radar cross-section from the critical frontal hemisphere perspective. According to the provided caption, the UTAP-22 “was modified to operate under its own computerized control as part of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Autonomous Attritable Aircraft Experiment [AAAx].” That statement indicates the May 5 mission was a continuation of the test on April 29 in which a UTAP-22 carrying the Skyborg Autonomy Core System (ACS) from Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, AAAx being the name for the Skyborg flight test campaign. It also follows recent tests of the UTAP-22 flown with the Air Force’s KC-135 Stratotanker , intended to pave the way for the veteran aerial refueling tanker to serve as a communications node and potentially to control its own loyal wingman drones . A UTAP-22 carrying the Skyborg Autonomy Core System (ACS) launches from Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, during the previous, April 29, test flight. In retrospect, you can see the new configuration in this photo, as well., U.S. AIR FORCE An underside view of the UTAP-22 seen during launch with its enlarged intake and ventral sensor arrangement., U.S. AIR FORCE Aside from whatever modifications and/or sensors we can see here, the test continues to expands upon manned-unmanned proximity flight, with a new degree of proximity between the airframes involved. The UTAP-22 has been tested in the loyal wingman role since 2015, including flying together with a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B attack jet that year. Also in 2015, Lockheed Martin, in cooperation with the CalSpan Corporation, demonstrated the ability of a two-seat Block 50 F-16D jet to safely fly in formation with a modified unmanned F-16 testbed, known as the Variable stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft, or VISTA, in a test known Have Raider . In addition, we’ve seen other manned-unmanned formation flight milestones in the past few years or so, including a major test event late last year that demonstrated the ability of a specially configured XQ-58A Valkyrie drone to serve as a communications and data gateway between F-22 and F-35A stealth fighters. Last year also saw Boeing and the Navy use an EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft to oversee two other EA-18Gs flying missions semi-autonomously. That test demonstrated technology that could allow the Growlers, as well as F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , to work closely together with unmanned aircraft in the future. Skyborg aims to develop a “system of systems” that will be able to operate not only networked loyal wingman-type drones, which are intended to operate alongside and in support of manned fighters, but also fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles , or UCAVs. Kratos is one of the companies that are on contract to begin delivering new drones to support Skyborg, and Boeing and General Atomics are also involved. Intriguingly, a concept art cutaway released as part of an earlier Skyborg video showed what appeared to be some kind of sensor, seemingly meant to depict an IRST system, in the nose of the drone. Whether that is what we can see here on the UTAP-22 isn’t perfectly clear, but it is very likely. We also know that the Air Force has always focused heavily on Skyborg using open-architecture and modular systems to enable the rapid insertion of new functionality and capabilities as time goes on by parties that might not have even been involved in its original development. Meanwhile, General Atomics has also begun flight tests of its stealthy Avenger unmanned aircraft carrying a Lockheed Martin Legion IRST pod under its wing. While we don’t yet know what drone General Atomics will be supplying under its Skyborg airframe contract, the company has publicly talked about using the Avenger as surrogates for Skyborg-related work in the past. On the other hand, it’s also unclear what prompted the flight test of the IRST pod on the Avenger in the first place and to what degree, if any, it was related to Skyborg. General Atomics Avenger drone carrying a Lockheed Martin Legion pod during a flight test., GA-ASI F/A-18F Super Hornet with IRST21., Lockheed Martin This is not the first time we have seen a specially adapted UTAP-22 drone. In the past, a differently adapted UTAP-22 appeared under the wing of an F-15C. That configuration included small wingtip pods that appeared to accommodate missile approach warning systems (MAWS) sensors that are used to provide threat awareness and countermeasure cueing on combat aircraft. There was also a large golden dome-like feature on top of the drone’s forward fuselage. At the time, there was speculation that this, too, could be a type of infrared sensor, since it had a striking resemblance to the Falcon Eyes sensor used on the United Arab Emirates Block 60 F-16E/F Desert Falcons. A UTAP-22 seen under the wing of an F-15C., @TUCSON.PLANE.SPOTTER @TUCSON.PLANE.SPOTTER The U.S. military has years of work involving semi-autonomous and autonomous UCAVs working cooperatively, with each other, and with manned aircraft. As such, this manned-unmanned proximity flight builds upon plenty of past experience. Still, the concepts involved unmanned and unmanned aircraft flying — and fighting — together continue to be proven, at least publically. In fact, as The War Zone has examined in the past, it raises the question of why these kinds of capabilities, as far as is known, remain restricted to test environments. The UTAP-22 has already shown that it’s a suitable platform to accommodate different configurations, including both internal and external modular payloads; it’s also notable that this is the first loyal wingman-type drone to be offered for sale to international customers. Whatever the UTAP-22 involved in these recent tests has been fitted with, it seems very unlikely that this will be the last iteration of the drone, in terms of the different kinds of sensors that it will carry, but it does mark a big, albeit undisclosed milestone in the type’s configuration and potential capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 10, 2021",Navy SEALs And Army Night Stalkers Captured In Amazing Photos During Virginia Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ( 160th SOAR ), better known as the Night Stalkers, were flying in full force near Dam Neck, Virginia last week, hauling around Navy SEALs and Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCCs), along with their boats and other gear, during a huge training exercise. It is somewhat rare to see the Night Stalker’s heavily modified Little Birds , Chinooks, and Black Hawks operating together in one public place, especially in broad daylight, but that was the case in this instance. There was even a mass airdrop of supplies and assault boats from C-17s over the water. Yet one picture stands out above the rest—one of an MH-47 Chinook sling loading a stealthy Combat Craft Assault (CCA ) boat while one of its crew, most likely a SWCC, fast ropes down into it in mid-air. These incredible images, which, according to some sources, show SEAL Team Six at work along with their Night Stalker and SWCC chauffeurs, comes to us from aviation photographer Raven Harris . Dam Neck is home to SEAL Team Six , also known formally as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU). It is also less than 20 miles southeast of Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, which is home to a number of other SEAL and Naval Special Warfare units. MH-6 loaded with Navy SEALs wearing the tell-tale Calico Jack patch. , Raven Harris Overall, the images offer an awesome and rare view into this elite ‘tier one’ special operations world. The largely bearded and tattooed SEAL operators are seen hanging off MH-6 Little Birds and MH-60 Black Hawks fully kitted out with custom M4-style rifles that appear to be fitted with Simunitions kits , which converts them to be able to fire paintball-like ammunition for direct force-on-force training. One thing that is uniquely constant is the Jolly Roger ‘pirate’ patch warn by the SEALs. This type of iconography is prevalent in the special operations community, and especially the SEAL teams. Raven Harris shares with us how he captured these awesome images: I was really excited to obtain these photos after receiving some local information that helicopters had been flying up and down the beach near Dam Neck Annex in Virginia Beach, Virginia the day before with operators aboard. As an aviation enthusiast, the action sounded like it was worth the drive to Virginia Beach and sitting to watch with my Canon 90D and Tamron 150-600mm lens. It wasn’t long sitting there before you could hear rotors turning and then seeing the pack of Little Birds and Blackhawks departing out of Dam Neck for flights down the beach or across the Chesapeake Bay. Overhead, two C-17s from Charleston, South Carolina circled waiting to airdrop boats out the back. Once everything hit the water it was hard to resolve any details from the heat and humidity coming off the miles of water between them and myself. Later in the evening, a Chinook departed the annex with a watercraft slung below. This, I thought, was very impressive to see, and I was ecstatic that I was there on the beach getting to see this, much less capturing photographs. The Chinook perfectly placed itself and the slung boat right in front of me about a mile away and directly to my 12 o’clock with perfect lighting. What happened next, I didn’t expect to see. A fast rope dropped from the bottom of the Chinook into the watercraft slung below. Operators started to fast-rope down into the boat. I was very humbled to watch these aviators flying and the operators doing their jobs. All the operators made it into the craft and the Chinook sat the craft down into the water and the sling line detached. Then off the operators went.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As first reported by The War Zone , the U.S. Navy is now lining up the acquisition of additional F-16 aggressor jets to supplement the F/A-18E/F Super Hornets that are now headed to one of its dedicated adversary squadrons, VFC-12 , the “Fighting Omars,” based at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. The F-16s are required since there’s a shortage of the earlier Block I Super Hornets available for the high-end adversary mission. The move was confirmed recently by Seapower Magazine , who quoted Vice Admiral John Mustin, chief of Navy Reserve, in his statement to the defense subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee on May 4. Mustin outlined plans to boost the Navy’s high-end adversary force with second-hand F-16s drawn from Air Force and Air National Guard stocks. A formation with one jet from each of the Navy’s reserve squadrons that belong to the Tactical Support Wing. The ‘legacy’ Hornets of VFC-12 and VFA-204 both require replacement., COMMANDER, NAVAL AIR FORCE RESERVE/PUBLIC DOMAIN The plan to add more Vipers on top of those F-16A/Bs already operated by Topgun instructors at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, is just one part of a revamp of the adversary fleet that Mustin recommended. He also called for upgrades to these jets, including infrared search and track systems and further evolution of the ‘Red Net’ tactical and situational awareness datalink that you can read more about here . It also follows the trend established by the U.S. Air Force when that service announced it was to enhance its aggressor capabilities by using early examples of the F-35A and younger F-16C/Ds to equip the 65th Aggressor Squadron . The possibility of acquiring more Navy F-16 aggressors emerged last year and was addressed in this piece of ours detailing the Navy’s plans to replace the ‘legacy’ Hornets within VFC-12 for early examples of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. That transition is scheduled to be completed by October this year and it will also bring some new color schemes representative of aircraft flown by certain threat nations. In the process, VFC-12 will become the first Navy aggressor unit to fly the Super Hornet as part of the Navy’s ongoing process of retiring the ‘legacy’ Hornet , although Topgun also operates a handful of F/A-18E/F, toos. Many of the ‘legacy’ Hornets have extremely high flight hours, making them increasingly costly to operate, with a stated cost per flight hour for the type pegged at $44,000. The new jets will also bring some notable enhancements to meet increasing demands for more robust ‘bandit’ threat training. A 2014 Naval Air Reserve Force briefing showing how the ‘legacy’ squadrons would be at half strength by 2022 at the latest and their jets would be “all dead by 2028.”, U.S. NAVY VIA FOIA But that leaves another high-end adversary squadron, VFA-204 , the “River Rattlers,” still flying ‘legacy’ Hornets out of Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, Louisiana. Between them, VFC-12 and VFA-204 now fly 27 F/A-18A+ and C/D model Hornets and with VFC-12 poised to swap its jets for Super Hornets, VFA-204 would likely receive the second-hand F-16s. Otherwise, only the U.S. Naval Test Pilot’s School (TPS), and the Naval Fighter Weapons School, better known as Topgun , are still flying the Navy ‘legacy’ Hornets. An F/A-18C of VFA-204., TYLER ROGOWAY Outside the high-end adversary community, the Navy also flies 31 F-5N/F Tiger II jets for replicating low-to-mid level threats. These serve with VFC-13 at Fallon and VFC-111 at Naval Air Station Key West, Florida and the force will be expanded by adding another 11 F-5E/F aircraft acquired from Switzerland, starting next year. As for the F-16, the Navy has flown these aggressor platforms before, taking 26 examples of the purpose-built F-16N version purchased in the mid-1980s. The full fascinating story of these ‘hotrod’ jets was told in this previous feature by a former pilot and Topgun instructor, but the F-16N was controversially retired in the mid-1990s. A U.S. Navy F-16N., U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Ultimately, the Navy did acquire more F-16s, less than a decade after the F-16N was retired, taking 14 of the F-16A/Bs that had been built for Pakistan before being embargoed. These were delivered to the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) in 2002-03 and operated on behalf of the Topgun program. Topgun maintains its own training program to convert experienced Naval Aviators from the service’s other tactical jets to the F-16. This could potentially be expanded if more of the type are added to the Navy’s stable. As well as the Air Force’s 18th Aggressor Squadron (AGRS) at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska and the 64th AGRS at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, the F-16 is now in the hands of private contractors offering ‘red air’ services to the U.S. military, and above all in support of the Air Force’s mammoth Adversary Air Support Contract . These ex-Israeli F-16s belong to the Top Aces firm, whose Viper plans you can read more about here and here . With VFC-12 moving over to the Super Hornet, adding F-16s to VFA-204 would mean Navy fleet pilots can go head-to-head with a dissimilar high-end type, bringing another level of realism to the training and better preparing them for the kinds of threats they could face on deployment. Should VFA-204 get the F-16s, it would lose its secondary tasking of acting as a reserve force in times of crisis, which makes it, as of now, “the Navy Reserve’s only remaining Strike Fighter Squadron available for contingency deployment.” As part of that, VFA-204 periodically conducts carrier qualifications, clearly impossible with F-16s. Two Top Aces Vipers after arriving at the company’s F-16 Center of Excellence at Mesa Airport in Arizona earlier this year. , TOP ACES Vice Admiral Mustin also disclosed that, in Fiscal Year 2020, the Navy’s appetite for adversary support was such that active-duty strike fighter squadrons had to take up the slack to the tune of 13,129 flight hours — more than half of the service’s total in-house ‘red air’ demand. That is clearly far from ideal, using front-line platforms’ precious flying hours for a mission that provides little organic training to those flying it, and demonstrates why re-equipping existing Navy aggressor units is so critical. Mustin didn’t provide a timeline for when the Navy wants to introduce new F-16s, but it’s clear that divesting the last ‘legacy’ Hornets is a priority right now. With suitable Super Hornets in short supply and a seemingly insatiable need for aggressors to push fleet pilots to the limit, the highly proven F-16 looks like it could be an ideal solution to upgrade the Navy’s high-end adversary fleet.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2021",Global Hawk Drones To Be Retired In Favor Of Secretive Penetrating Spy Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking to get rid of all of its remaining Block 30 RQ-4 Global Hawk drones in the next year or two. The service says that it plans to replace those unmanned aircraft with a mixture of alternatives, including “penetrating” platforms and “5th- and 6th-generation capabilities .” Those terms generally refer to stealthy platforms able to get past hostile air defense works to conduct operations in denied areas. This comes amid an increasing number of reports that a new, secret stealth spy drone, commonly referred to as the RQ-180 , which also looks set to act as a communications and data-sharing gateway , is close to entering operational service, if it hasn’t already. Air Force General Charles Brown, the service’s Chief of Staff, offered these details in a hearing before the House Appropriations Committee on May 7, 2021. Additional information was contained in written remarks that the Department of the Air Force, to include Space Force, prepared for both that Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee. A US Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk drone., USAF “Legacy ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] platforms, once considered irreplaceable to operations, are often unable to survive or deliver needed capabilities on competition-relevant timelines,” the written remarks say. “These legacy platforms must be phased out, with resources used to invest in modern and relevant systems. Working together, we must take calculated risk now in order to reduce the greater future risk.” ""The Air Force will continue to pursue the FY21 NDAA RQ-4 Block 30 divestment waiver in order to repurpose the RQ-4 Block 30 funds for penetrating ISR capability,"" stated @GenCQBrownJr in testimony to the House Appropriations Committee. — Valerie Insinna (@ValerieInsinna) May 7, 2021 “For instance, the RQ-4 Block 30 Global Hawk was crucial to the ISR requirements of yesterday and today. However, this platform cannot compete in a contested environment,” that statement continues. “The Air Force will continue to pursue the FY21 NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act] RQ-4 Block 30 divestment waiver in order to repurpose the RQ-4 Block 30 funds for penetrating ISR capability. Overall, intelligence collection will transition to a family of systems that includes non-traditional assets, sensors in all domains, commercial platforms, and a hybrid force of 5th- and 6th-generation capabilities.” This is not the first time the Air Force has attempted to retire some or all of its RQ-4 fleet, efforts that Congress has blocked in the past. The NDAA for the 2021 Fiscal Year said the service could obtain a waiver to begin divesting some of those drones if certain conditions were met , such as assurances there would not resulting ISR capacity or capability gaps, and appropriate justifications were provided to lawmakers. The Air Force had asked in its Fiscal Year 2021 budget for approval to retire all 21 of its remaining Block 20 and Block 30 Global Hawks. It’s not clear from the information presented to the House Appropriations Committee whether the Air Force is looking to get a waiver to begin divesting Block 30 RQ-4s before the current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, or if it’s hoping to start retiring those drones in Fiscal Year 2022, which begins on Oct. 1. Separately, the plan now, as it was last year , also appears to be to retain the more modern Block 40 RQ-4s, at least for the immediate future. How any of this might also reflect plans to scale back the Air Force’s U-2S Dragon Lady manned spy planes, another platform the service has proposed retiring on multiple occasions in recent years, is unclear. Discussions about the futures of the RQ-4 and US-2S within the Air Force have often been directly linked to each other. The Fiscal Year 2021 NDAA’s Global Hawk divestment waiver requirements also apply equally to any future decisions regarding the U-2S fleet. A Global Hawk drone taxies on the ground at Beale Air Force Base in California as a two-seat TU-2S Dragon Lady trainer comes in to land in the background., USAF None of this is necessarily surprising. The reality that the vast majority of the Air Force’s existing aerial ISR fleets would fare poorly in any kind of future contested environment against a near-peer adversary, such as Russia or China, if they were even committed to flying there in the first place due to the risks, is no secret. The service has admitted as much itself publicly on more than one occasion and first declared its intention to pursue a new “system of systems” approach to meet various future ISR requirements , as well other operational support needs , years ago now. At the same time, the Air Force’s comments here about “penetrating ISR capability” and “5th- and 6th-generation capabilities” strongly point to work on the RQ-180, the report on which first appeared in Aviation Week the better part of a decade ago. In October 2019, another report from Aviation Week detailed evidence that this drone was close to entering operation service at that time, if it hadn’t already. In November 2020, a picture of what may have been one of these unmanned aircraft, or a related test article, flying over the Mojave Desert appeared online . Just last month, The War Zone published an in-depth feature covering a large body of evidence that all points to the RQ-180 being at the very center of a coming revolution in how the Air Force conducts penetrating aerial operations, as a whole, not just with regards to ISR. By every indication, this drone, or a derivative thereof, looks set to be a critical node in passing information to and from current and future stealthy aircraft, including the Air Force’s F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters , the existing B-2 Spirit and future B-21 Raider stealth bombers , and whatever platforms might be under development now as part of the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. The Air Force’s RQ-170 stealth drones , which are understood to be more tactically oriented compared to the strategic-focused RQ-180, will also continue to be part of this overall ecosystem. The RQ-180 would also link those platforms to other stealthy and non-stealth aircraft inside and outside of the Air Force, as well as nodes at sea and on the ground, including the service’s own expanding network of Common Mission Control Centers (CMCC). You can read more about the entire distributed networking framework that is already emerging publicly within the Air Force, as well as elsewhere across the U.S. military, and that the RQ-180 would be an important force-multiplier for, here . An artist’s conception of how the so-called RQ-180 might look based on information that is available now., Hangar B Productions Of course, as the Air Force has stated itself, its future ISR capabilities will involve a mix of platforms and capabilities, not just the RQ-180. Still, it’s hard to see how the service could retire a significant portion of its RQ-4 fleet in the next year or two in favor of a new “penetrating” platform, and convince Congress there is no risk of capacity or capability gaps, without something already at least close to being operational. It will be very interesting to see what might emerge now about advanced ISR capabilities the Air Force is developing, or may already be employed in the classified realm, if legislators sign off on the service’s plan to be getting rid of the Block 30 Global Hawks.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 16, 2021","Russia Just Accepted Its New Super-Quiet, Cruise Missile-Packed Submarine Into Service","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than seven years after its last nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine, or SSGN, entered service, the Russian Navy has commissioned its next such vessel, the Kazan , the lead ship of a new subclass. The event marks an important advance in the overhaul of Russia’s mainly Cold War-era nuclear submarine fleet, which had previously introduced only one SSGN of all-new design, the Severodvinsk , since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The new type is based on the design of the Severodvinsk , the sole Project 885 Yasen vessel. The Kazan , first of the Project 885M Yasen-M subclass, was officially commissioned into service today at the Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk, on the White Sea in northwest Russia. Construction work on the submarine had started back in 2009 and, after much delay, it had finally been launched in March 2017. The Kazan during its state evaluation program, completed at the end of December. , Russian Ministry of Defense Quoting a statement from the United Shipbuilding Corporation, the Sevmash shipyard’s parent organization, Russia’s Interfax news agency previously reported that the Kazan completed its state trials last December 28, clearing the way for it to enter service. “Sevmash has now completed all work to address the criticisms and prepare the submarine for handover to the navy,” the statement added. As part of those pre-commissioning trials, last November, the Kazan carried out a test launch of one of its Oniks supersonic cruise missiles , according to Interfax . Before that, the submarine also launched an example of the Kalibr subsonic cruise missile , the same report said. Those missile types are available in different anti-ship, land attack, and anti-submarine versions, with optional nuclear warheads, and are delivered from vertical launch system (VLS) tubes. In the future, the Yasen-M boats are also likely to deploy the shadowy hypersonic 3M22 Zircon missile , too. Until now, the Russian Navy had taken delivery of only a single example of the previous Project 885 Yasen class, from which the Yasen-M is derived. Entering service with the Northern Fleet in December 2013, the Severodvinsk is characterized by its significant cruise missile carriage — up to 40 Kalibr missiles, plus other weapons — as well as having an especially low acoustic signature . Compared to its predecessor, the Severodvinsk, the Yasen-M is smaller, with its overall length reduced by up to around 40 feet, resulting in the previous large flank-mounted sonar array being deleted from the forward end. Like the Severodvinsk , the new design also utilizes a single-hull construction, akin to Western designs, and a break from the Soviet/Russian tradition of double-hull construction. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UEzgQ26W4hE According to H. I. Sutton , an author and an expert on submarine warfare, the smaller size of the Yasen-M is intended to reduce construction costs. “Because of general improvements in technology the newer boats are unlikely to be any less capable than the original design, except perhaps in terms of passive sonar due to the reduced flank arrays.” The Yasen-M reportedly also includes a new reactor that features an updated cooling system that is said to further reduce the noise the submarine generates. With that in mind, despite the decrease in size, the Yasen-M is likely to be a significant development for the Russian Navy, providing a means to potentially build more submarines, more cheaply, even if they have slightly reduced capabilities in other regards. By all accounts Yasen-M Kazan (K-561) will join the Russian Navy tomorrow. Eleven years, nine months, and 13 days after its keel was laid. Not impressive. Novosibirsk (K-573) is at 7 yr, 9 mo, and 11 days. pic.twitter.com/LxAUczY4Eh — Russian Defense Policy (@russiandefpolic) May 6, 2021 In the past , The War Zone has explained how a combination of Yasen or Yasen-M class and the 1,500-mile range Kalibr cruise missiles could present a particular threat to a wide range of potential targets across Scandanavia and northern Europe, as well as Iceland , deploying at short notice from Northern Fleet bases. Operating in the North Atlantic , these SSGNs could also hold targets to risk on the U.S. East Coast , as well as within an area that was previously considered a “safe haven” for U.S. Navy ships and submarines. The way these submarines launch their missiles is also different from their predecessors, which had angled launch silos . The Yasen classes are based around modular-type launch VLS cylinders that can accommodate different missile types as required. This also opens up the possibility of launching missiles without even leaving port, something that the Severodvinsk has done on at least one occasion . The Yasen class nuclear-powered attack submarine Severodvinsk. , Russian Ministry of Defense And, of course, these vessels are hard to find. A War Zone source disclosed that, back in 2019, a large number of U.S. Navy submarines, warships, and maritime patrol aircraft spent weeks in an unsuccessful effort to locate the Severodvinsk in the North Atlantic. “The Yasen may represent the pinnacle of Russian SSN design, benefiting not only from all the information from the Walker Spy Ring but the considerable technological advances that have occurred since the end of the Cold War,” explained Peter Hennessy and James Jinks in their book The Silent Deep . Among others, the fact the Yasen design is so quiet and difficult to detect and track has spurred the U.S. Navy to begin looking at developing a new Seawolf -like advanced attack submarine . Crew on the hull of Kazan while in harbor. Note the hatches for torpedo loading (on the left of the picture) and torpedo launch (on the right)., Russian Ministry of Defense The Severodvinsk joined the fleet after President Vladimir Putin had announced in 2011 plans to overhaul all branches of the military by adding around $360 billion to the defense budget. That project began to be derailed amid a serious economic crisis in Russia, including the collapse in the value of the rouble in 2015. At that point, the average age of the submarines within the Northern Fleet was 22 years. Since then, for the Russian Navy, in particular, large-scale programs have been scaled back or even axed entirely . Faced with this new economic reality, the scope of the SSGN renewal plan has been revised accordingly. As of 2015, four Yasen boats were reportedly under construction with Sevmash, with plans for another three to join them by 2023. Now it seems unlikely there will be any more Yasens and instead, the focus is on the Yasen-M , at least eight of which are planned. A second Yasen-M , Novosibirsk , was reportedly engaged in sea trials in June 2020. While they may have been conceived as successors to the Oscar class SSGNs , the Yasens are far more versatile than simple cruise missile slingers, able to operate as general-purpose attack boats as well as intelligence gatherers and potentially as a special missions platform. The Kazan underway on the surface., Russian Ministry of Defense Of course, the new SSGN type is just one part of the wider modernization of the Russian Navy nuclear-powered submarine force, a process that has been moving at a glacial pace so far. However, by the end of the year, the service is expected to take into service the first revised Borei-A class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, the Knyaz Oleg , originally due to enter service back in 2017, plus the second Yasen-M class boat, the Novosibirsk . It has been a long time coming, but the much-needed overhaul of the Russian Navy’s mainly Cold War-era nuclear-powered submarine fleet is finally starting to show progress on all fronts.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 10, 2020",The Marine Corps Just Said Goodbye To Its Last Legacy C-130 Hercules Transport Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Modernization of the U.S. Marine Corps aerial refueler and transport fleet has reached a milestone with the retirement of the service’s last ‘legacy’ Hercules, a KC-130T. The Marines flew the ‘legacy’ Hercules as their primary multi-mission transport for six decades but, with this latest move, have now standardized on the new-generation KC-130J . The last of the Marine KC-130Ts, aircraft 105, had been in service with Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 452 (VMGR-452), the “Yankees,” a Marine Corps Reserve unit. It was handed over to the U.S. Navy’s Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 55 (VR-55) on April 14 in a ceremony. The event was announced yesterday by Naval Air Systems Command and the Navy will continue to operate the type. A KC-130T from VMGR-234 arrives at Mihail Kogalniceanu Airfield, Romania, as part of an Air Combat Element of a Security Cooperation Marine Air-Ground Task Force deployed to Eastern Europe., U.S. MARINE CORPS/CPL. R. LOGAN KYLE The KC-130T variant, a derivative of the Air Force’s C-130H, had originally been introduced to Marine Corps service in the early 1980s; the C-130T variant also found fame as the celebrated “Fat Albert” used as a support asset by the Navy Blue Angels demonstration team until its retirement in 2019. During their Marine careers, these aircraft were operated exclusively by reserve squadrons, such as VMGR-452, based at Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York. The plan had already been for this squadron to give up its last KC-130T in Fiscal Year 2021, once it had received sufficient numbers of the new KC-130J model. Among the very last taskings for the KC-130Ts of VMGR-452 was participation in the Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) course 2-21, at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona, last March. This is a seven-week training event focused on advanced tactical training. “I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to experience her legacy and proud to see her go out while she’s still at the top of her game,” said Major Gary Windt, a VGMR-452 aircraft commander, of the KC-130T. “In my experience, her reliability, especially while operating autonomously, is unmatched.” When the latest Marine Corps Aviation Plan was released in 2019, the service still had 12 KC-130Ts assigned to VMGR-452, as well as three active-duty squadrons with 15 KC-130Js each, and one reserve squadron with seven KC-130Js. For the future, the plan defined a primary mission aircraft inventory (PMAI) of 15 KC-130Js for each active-component VMGR, and for the reserve squadrons. The Marines used the KC-130T to its fullest potential, flying missions that included combat assault transport, air delivery, refueling of fixed-wing , rotary-wing, and tiltrotor aircraft, ground refueling, battlefield illumination, and operations from expeditionary airfields. VMGR-452, in particular, took its KC-130Ts to war in Operations Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. The KC-130T was typically flown by a crew of six: pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, and a Tactical Systems Operator, or TSO, on the flight deck, and a flight mechanic and a loadmaster in the cargo compartment. In the improved J-model, the flight engineer, TSO, and flight mechanic roles have all been removed in favor of far more automation in the all-glass cockpit, which is usually occupied by the pilot, co-pilot, and senior crew master. A flight engineer and pilot from VMGR-452 conduct pre-flight inspections in a KC-130T before heading out for an in-flight refueling mission during the Northern Edge exercise over the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Lakisha A. Croley Another major difference compared to the KC-130J was the powerplant, with the KC-130T originally being fitted with Allison T56-A-16 turboprops driving four-bladed metal propellers. The KC-130J comes with more powerful Rolls-Royce AE 2100D3 turboprops and six-bladed composite propellers. A KC-130T of VMGR-452 landing at Naval Air Station North Island, California, in 2009., Jerry Gunner/Wikimedia Commons Marine KC-130Ts actually came in two distinct versions, differentiated by fuselage length. As well as 24 baseline KC-130Ts, there were two KC-130T-30 models with a 15-foot fuselage ‘stretch.’ This increased troop carriage from 92 to 138, or an equivalent load of cargo. The two Dash 30s were operated by VMGR-452 before their refueling equipment was removed and they were transferred to the Navy in the early 2010s. While the Marines began to receive the much-improved KC-130J in 2001, the KC-130T remained a prized asset and work continued to upgrade the aircraft. Cockpits compatible with night-vision goggles were added in the mid-1990s. Since then, the Marine fleet has been upgraded with an electronic propeller control system, engine instrument display system, TACAN, and radar systems modifications. Marines load an Air Traffic Control Navigation and Interrogation System into a KC-130T during a Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course (WTI) at Yuma, Arizona, in 2015., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Jodson B. Graves, 2d MAW Combat Camera Sadly, however, a shadow is cast over the KC-130T’s final years of Marine Corps service by the loss of callsign Yanky 72, a VMGR-452 aircraft that crashed on July 10, 2017, while transporting special operations forces from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, to Naval Air Facility El Centro, California. The aircraft broke apart in mid-air and came down over Mississippi, killing the seven special operators as well as nine aircrew. In the wake of the crash, all Marine Corps and Navy KC-130Ts were grounded before an investigation pointed to faulty maintenance practices that meant a corroded propeller blade was not properly repaired in 2011. In the mishap six years later, that propeller subsequently failed and impacted the fuselage, and another engine, with catastrophic results. VMGR-452 began its transition to the KC-130J when it received its first example in May 2020, already operated by one reserve and three active-duty Marine squadrons. As well as its improved performance, the J-model also provides the Marines with additional functions beyond what was possible with the KC-130T. These include close air support and reconnaissance with the Harvest HAWK system , a roll-on/roll-off armament package, as well as airborne command and control, and electronic warfare. The first KC-130J for VMGR-452 arrives at Stewart Air National Guard Base, Newburgh, New York, on May 28, 2020., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jonathan Lane The KC-130J is also being used increasingly with the M142 High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) as part of ‘shoot and scoot’ precision rocket artillery ‘raids,’ where a Hercules lands at a forward location and offloads the launcher vehicle, which then carries out a fire support mission. Last August, meanwhile, a VMGR-452 KC-130T conducted its first aerial refueling mission with an MV-22 Osprey tiltrotor as part of tests with its new eight-bladed NP2000 composite propellers — the same type that has also been retrofitted to some Air National Guard C-130Hs . However, the propeller upgrade will benefit the Navy, rather than the Marines, as it continues to operate the KC-130T. The first NP2000-configured KC-130T was then transferred to the Navy’s VR-62 squadron. However, the Navy is already looking to replace the KC-130T as it, too, standardizes on the KC-130J. Vice Admiral John Mustin, chief of Navy Reserve, recently told the House Appropriations Committee that replacing the legacy Hercules with the J-model was “the Navy Reserve’s top equipment priority.” Currently, the Navy operates a fleet of around 30 KC-130T and C-130T aircraft, the latter with the aerial refueling capability deleted. If these C/KC-130T aircraft eventually become available on the secondary market, they could be very attractive for U.S. allies and partners, especially those already operating C-130Hs. A KC-130T equipped with NP2000 propellers refuels an MV-22 Osprey during a test flight on August 24 last year., U.S. Navy In March this year, the Marines received their 60th KC-130J, which was delivered to VMGR-252 at MCAS Cherry Point. This leaves another 26 aircraft to be delivered over the next five years, completing an order book for 86 examples. The latest KC-130J deliveries also feature additional improvements, including enhanced navigation systems, an upgraded cockpit, and the Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure ( DON LAIRCM ) self-protection system. The era of the ‘legacy’ Hercules with the Marine Corps may now be over, but the future of the KC-130J with the service appears to be brighter than ever.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 30, 2021",B-52 Simulated A Hypersonic Weapon Strike During Massive Alaskan War Games,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has yet to conduct a successful live-fire test of its new AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, but says that it has now simulated the entire “kill chain” for employing one of these hypersonic missiles. With no actual weapon fired, the networks used to send the targeting information may be the more significant capability demonstrated here. This was all conducted during the biennial Northern Edge exercise, which began earlier this week in and around Alaska. Northern Edge exercises are routinely used to test and evaluate new systems and capabilities from across the U.S. military, with a special focus on advanced networking and communications concepts. The mock ARRW launch took place on May 5, 2021, two days after Northern Edge 2021 kicked off. A B-52H Stratofortress bomber from the 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron, based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, served as the launch platform, though no weapon was actually released. The designated target was 600 nautical miles from the bomber at the time of the simulated AGM-183A launch. The Air Force said that the test had been carried out “in the highly contested and realistic threat environment that Northern Edge provides.” A B-52H bomber with an AGM-183A captive carry test article under its wing during an earlier test., USAF It’s unclear what other assets may have been directly involved in this particular part of the exercise, but the Air Force said that targeting information “from sensors” had been passed to the bomber via a command and control network centered at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska. Various other air, naval, and ground elements from the U.S. Army , Navy, and Marine Corps are also taking part in Northern Edge, along with aircraft and personnel from multiple Air Force units. “The team did an outstanding job effecting this event both in planning and execution,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Matt Guasco, head of the 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron, said of the test. “This is a win for the USAF and greater DOD as a whole but make no mistake, we are just getting started.” This simulated employment of an ARRW missile comes around a month after the failure of the first scheduled live-fire flight test of one of these weapons off the coast of southern California in April. It remains unclear exactly what happened during that abortive test, but the prototype AGM-183A never left the wing of the B-52H carrying it. That failure also came after the Air Force had already pushed the date of that test back multiple times , having originally planned to carry it out before the end of 2020. The service has carried out a number of successful captive carry flight tests wherein instrumented ARRW test articles remain attached to the aircraft carrying them the entire time. As designed, the complete ARRW weapon system consists of a large rocket booster with a payload section on top containing a single unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. After the missile reaches an optimal speed and altitude, the wedge-shaped boost-glide vehicle is released and then zooms back down along an atmospheric flight trajectory toward its target at hypersonic speed, defined as anything above Mach 5. Boost-glide vehicles are also designed to be able to make very unpredictable movements during their flight compared to traditional ballistic missiles, even those with advanced maneuvering reentry vehicles. This, together with their high speed, makes them very well-suited to penetrating through dense enemy air and missile defenses to strike time-sensitive or otherwise high-value targets on very short notice. That, in turn, makes it very difficult for an opponent to react at all, let alone try to defend themselves, even by seeking cover or just trying to leave the target area. The Air Force has previously said that ARRW will be able to hit targets 1,000 miles away in 12 minutes or less . concept art of ARRW pre-HBGV release. , USAF This simulated AGM-183A launch at Northern Edge also follows controversial statements that Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, made as a guest on an edition of the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute’s Aerospace Advantage podcast in March. Ray publicly criticized the Army’s hypersonic weapons plans, especially with regards to potential future operations in the Pacific region, which touched off a series of events that eventually led to a meeting between the top uniformed officers from both services to smooth things over. “I just think it’s a stupid idea to go and invest that kind of money that recreates something that the service has mastered and that we’re doing already right now,” referring to the various kinds of long-range bomber missions that the Air Force routinely carries out. His position was that it would be easier to integrate hypersonic weapons, such as the AGM-183A, into those existing concepts of operations, and that the resulting capability would be more flexible and otherwise useful, compared to the Army’s plans for utilizing its future ground-based Long Range Hypersonic Weapon . It is worth noting the Army, which is developing the LRHW in cooperation with the Navy, has successfully launched prototypes of that weapon more than once , including one test that involved actually striking a mock target . Some have already questioned how significant this simulated shot of an AGM-183A might actually be in terms of the development of the weapon itself. Still, if there is a debate about just how much of a “success” this was for the ARRW program, specifically, the data-sharing capabilities that were on display as part of this mock launch do seem to be very significant. “We were really exercising the data links that we needed in order to complete that kill chain loop, and then get the feedback to the players in the airspace that the simulated hypersonic missile was fired and effective,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Joe Little, deputy commander of the 53rd Test Management Group, said in his own statement. The 53rd Test Management Group is part of the 53rd Wing based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron is also assigned to 53rd Wing, despite being based at Barksdale. The Air Force said that the targeting information that the B-52H received during this test had been relayed to the aircraft via the All-Domain Operations Capability-Experimental (ADOC-E) at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The Air Force has described the ADOC-E as an “operational-level ‘blue’ training audience designed to experiment with synchronizing joint functions in forward locations.” This “allows the synchronization of joint functions in forward, contested environment when traditional C2 structure effectiveness is degraded or denied,” the service added in its press release regarding the simulated AGM-183A launch. It’s not entirely clear how the ADOC-E functions or exactly how dispersed its nodes might be, but it is clearly a new kind of distributed command and control and data fusion ecosystem that the Air Force is experimenting with together with other branches of the U.S. military. A separate unclassified administrative document related to Northern Edge 2021 makes clear that additional ADOC-E functions are being carried out at forward locations that have been established for this exercise according to the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment (ACE) concept of operations, as well as the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) concept. You can read more about ACE and EABO, which are part of a growing push for more distributed operations across the U.S. military, as a whole, here and here . A portion of the unclassified Northern Edge 2021 administrative document. The highlighted portions are from the original., DOD There are at least three outstations across Alaska, one at Allen Army Airfield, which serves the Army’s Fort Greely , along with one in King Salmon and one in Cold Bay. Cold Bay is notably in the Aleutians, a strategic island chain that stretches out from mainland Alaska toward Russia, forming a boundary between the Bering Sea , to the north, and the Pacific Ocean, to the south. The importance of the Aleutians, as well as Alaska as a whole, has only increased in recent years as the U.S. military, as a whole, looks to expand its ability to respond to major contingencies and fight large-scale conflicts in the Pacific and Arctic regions . “ADOC-E users may require access to additional SIPR [ Secret Internet Protocol Router ] networks like the Pacific Air Operations Center (PAOC) and the Multi-National Information System (MNIS),” the Northern Edge document says. Various other networks and related systems are also mentioned, including Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2), which offers SIPR, as well as Non-classified Internet Protocol (NIPR) and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS) access. There is also discussion about the use of the Leidos-developed Command and Control Incident Management Emergency Response Application ( C2IMERA ), Raytheon’s Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System ( JADOCS ),  VidyoWorks’ Global Video Service (GVS), Intelligent Software Solutions WebTAS Enterprise , and the Mattermost online chat service . Some of the specific networking capabilities being employed during Northern Edge 2021, including as part of the ADOC-E., DOD The potential flexibility that networks such as ADOC-E offer was on display in this particular demonstration, with the Air Force saying that the B-52H that carried out the mock ARRW strike was 1,000 nautical miles away from the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson at the time it simulated the launch of the weapon. This highlights how targeting information from a diverse array of offboard platforms could be fed to aircraft carrying hypersonic weapons, such as the AGM-183A, which could then prosecute those targets on short notice even if they are hundreds of miles away. This underscores the immense boost in stand-off strike capability that hypersonic weapons, in general, promise to give the U.S. military. It’s also worth noting that ADOC-E is also just one of a host of other command and control and data-fusion networking efforts that are presently ongoing across the U.S. military. This includes Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) initiative, the Army’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System ( IBCS ), and what the Navy presently calls Project Overmatch. These all tie into a Department of Defense-wide effort, referred to as Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2). So, while the Air Force still hasn’t conducted an actual live-fire flight test of the AGM-183A, the demonstration at Northern Edge this week highlights the all-new strike options that hypersonic weapons look set to provide for the U.S. military, as well as the significantly expanded data-sharing networks that will underpin those new capabilities.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 2, 2021",Soviet-Designed An-2 Biplanes Are South Korea’s Secretive Aggressors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the past, we’ve looked in some detail at the role that North Korea’s antiquated An-2 Colt biplanes could likely play in a conflict on the Korean peninsula, one that would embroil forces from the North, the South, and the United States. Among Kim Jong Un’s ramshackle air force , the An-2 has received a fair degree of coverage, boosted no doubt by its veteran biplane looks. On the other side of the DMZ, however, there exists a much more secretive military An-2 force — operated by North Korea’s foe, the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF). First, of the An-2, it’s worth remembering that when this rugged utility aircraft first appeared in 1947 it was already considered an anachronism, thanks to its biplane layout and wings and tail covered partly in fabric. That configuration was chosen by designer Oleg Antonov since it offered the best combination of light weight and low-speed performance; in fact, the aircraft manual has no stall speed. The previous dark green scheme worn by the ROKAF An-2 fleet, photographed in 2005., Jerry Gunner/Wikimedia Commons That capability made the An-2 perfect for applying chemicals over the Soviet Union’s vast collective farms, but also made it ideal for flying low and slow — across the DMZ, for example. After all, should conflict break out on the Korean peninsula, it’s widely expected that huge numbers of North Korean An-2s would swarm into South Korean airspace and deliver special forces troops directed against key targets. As well as delivering shock troops, An-2s can be armed with freefall bombs and rockets and could be expected to fly night-harassment sorties of the kind that plagued U.S. and U.N. forces during the Korean War . A gaggle of An-2 biplanes drops North Korean commandos at low altitude. , NORTH KOREA STATE MEDIA Keenly aware of this potential slow-moving threat, South Korea has also built up a fleet of An-2s which are used as aggressors to train how best to defend against these tricky targets. For ROKAF fighters, in particular, detecting and shooting down a ground-hugging An-2 is by no means easy, so it makes sense to train aerial gunnery skills regularly against the biplanes. The same goes for ground-based air defenses, especially short-range air defense systems (SHORADS) and perhaps naval anti-aircraft systems, too. Indeed, the An-2s are located at Seongmu, only a few minutes flying time away from Cheongju, home to the ROKAF’s fighter tactics brains trust and its F-16 aggressor unit. For added realism, the ROKAF An-2s can also deliver troops representing the ‘red forces’ during anti-infiltration exercises, either delivering them to short stretches of fields or highways or by parachute. The Colt is an ideal paratrooping platform and is still used for jump training, even by some NATO air forces. Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force also makes use of the An-2, the 6th Special Operations Squadron employing the type as part of a diverse fleet for its combat aviation advisory mission, helping teach instructors who, in turn, provide training to foreign air forces. Other An-2s have been operated by the U.S. Army at White Sands Missile Range, while the Marine Corps has made use of leased examples for weapons and tactics training, too. U.S. Army and Latvian special forces practice high-altitude low-opening parachute training from a Latvian Air Force An-2: To make them more realistic in their ‘red air’ role, the ROKAF An-2s are painted to replicate their North Korean counterparts, mimicking the green and brown camouflage pattern on the upper surfaces and pale blue undersides. Before the North Korean fleet switched to these colors, the ROKAF Colts wore the same dark green upper-surface paint scheme. On the other hand, it’s conceivable that the ROKAF might at least train to use the An-2 in just the same way as its adversary to the north. In this way, South Korean special forces could turn the tables on their enemy, adopting similar tactics to infiltrate its airspace. While these kinds of tactics seem more redolent of World War II special operations missions , it is not beyond the realms of credibility that they could be employed in certain scenarios. One of the ROKAF An-2s over Cheongju., Hywel Evans In a worst-case scenario, it might not be a stretch to imagine radial-engine biplanes crossing the border in both directions, carrying special operators deep behind enemy lines. Exactly how many An-2s are in the ROKAF fleet is hard to determine. Many authoritative inventories make no mention of these aircraft. Clearly, their presence is somewhat clandestine, reinforced by the use of civil registrations. These run from HL-1082 through HL-1091, suggesting at least nine could be in use. Two examples are known to have been lost in accidents, after engine failures in May 2009 and June 2015. Another aircraft was involved in an emergency landing in a river in February 2016.

A satellite image of Seongmu Air Base showing seven An-2s., GOOGLE EARTH While the ROKAF An-2s didn’t come from Russian stocks, it’s worth noting that Soviet- or Russian-designed equipment is not altogether uncommon in the South Korean armed forces, despite the country’s enduring military relationship with the United States. With significant debts owed to Seoul by Moscow, Russia transferred Kamov Ka-32 Helix helicopters and Ilyushin Il-103 basic trainers to the ROKAF in the early 2000s. The seven coaxial-rotor Ka-32s, which are locally designated HH-32A, are used for search and rescue, equipped with night-flying equipment, and also have a secondary firefighting role. A total of 23 Il-103s, known as T-103s, were acquired for the Air Force Academy, which shares its Seongmu base with the An-2s, but they have since been replaced by the indigenous Korea Aerospace Industries KT-100. Neither of these types is operated by North Korea. One of the ROKAF’s Russian-made HH-32A search and rescue helicopters., Hywel Evans With its legendary resilience and reliability, there is no reason that the veteran An-2 will depart ROKAF service any time soon. After all, as long as North Korea continues to operate these enigmatic biplanes, we can expect the air force of its southern neighbor to do the same.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 12, 2021",The Definitive Answer On Why F-16s Carry AIM-120 AMRAAMs On Their Wingtip Rails,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We recently posted a story about U.S. Air Force F-16Cs flying a long-range counter-air patrol mission into the South China Sea while fully armed with air-to-air missiles. The unusual weapons configuration, with five AIM-120 AMRAAMs on wingtip rails and underwing stores pylons and one AIM-9 Sidewinder underwing, as well, spurred a flurry of very familiar questions that I have gotten repeatedly for a decade: Why do F-16s carry AIM-120 AMRAAMs on their wingtip rails almost exclusively, instead of AIM-9 Sidewinders? I thought it was time to settle this once and for all with an answer straight from the F-16’s manufacturer, Lockheed Martin. The AIM-9 was carried on the Viper’s wingtip rails for well over the first decade and a half of F-16 operations. After the AIM-120, introduced in the early 1990s, proliferated throughout the USAF’s F-16 fleet, the Sidewinders largely moved onto the outer underwing stations. Even today, with the advanced AIM-9X and its high-off-boresight targeting ability , the Sidewinder is still largely mounted under the Viper’s wings. Some have even mentioned this may impact the missile’s ability to lock up targets far off the jet’s centerline, but that doesn’t seem to be a major concern for the USAF. Misawa-based F-16s seen fully armed with air-to-air missiles after returning from their South China Sea patrol., IORI There have been various explanations given in forums and on social media for the near-omnipresence of the AIM-120s on the Viper’s wingtip rails, even during training where air-to-air combat isn’t the focus. These have included issues with the missiles themselves, as well as the idea that the AIM-120s act similar to winglets, offering the F-16 better efficiency when they are mounted. Another common explanation is that this configuration cuts down on wing flutter. Prior to the AIM-120’s entry into service, the Viper’s wingtip rail was almost exclusively the domain of the AIM-9. Even with the introduction of the AIM-7 Sparrow to the F-16 ADF, air-to-air configured Vipers were still heavily laden with AIM-9s. , USAF photo via F-16.net Wing flutter is defined as “a dynamic instability of a flight vehicle associated with the interaction of aerodynamic, elastic, and inertial forces (aeroelastic phenomena).” Flutter has airframe fatigue and even performance impacts in particular areas of the flight envelope and can be minor to catastrophic in nature. If you have ever seen an armed F-16 taxi by you in person, the AIM-120s on the wingtips certainly bounce around, almost to a comical degree. South Carolina Air National Guard F-16C gets ready to launch on an alert mission armed with two AIM-120s and two AIM-9Xs., U.S. Air National Guard photo by Senior Airman Megan Floyd With all this in mind, I asked Lockheed Martin directly about this for a definitive answer. Here is their response: The F-16 is able to carry different missiles on multiple stations at the same time, such as the AIM-120 and AIM-9. Because of that capability, the AIM-120 is positioned on the wingtip to reduce wing flutter, while still ensuring mission performance. So, the wing flutter explanation is indeed the right one. This would explain why most F-16s fly with AIM-120 captive training rounds, which weigh 335 pounds, just like their live counterparts, on their wingtips regardless of the training situation. Some air arms that fly the F-16 are not cleared to purchase the active radar homing AIM-120, such as Iraq and Egypt. So, these aircraft are often seen flying with AIM-9s, which weigh about half as much as an AIM-120, on their wingtip rails, as the semi-active radar homing AIM-7 Sparrow that they are allowed to buy is not capable of being mounted there. An Iraqi Air Force F-16IQ with an AIM-9 on its wingtip rail along with laser-guided bombs underwing., Iraqi Air Force With over 4,600 F-16s delivered to air forces around the globe, roughly half of which are still flying, the F-16 has been studied incredibly closely over the decades and evolved accordingly. This includes insights into wing flutter , including with different stores configurations , and their impact on performance and airframe life. In fact, these studies continue to this very day: Thomas ‘t-b0ne’ Richter ( @b0neyt on Twitter ), who spent his career in the military flying Marine F/A-18s, before transitioning to the Michigan Air National Guard to fly F-16s, gave The War Zone a pilot’s perspective on the issue: The AMRAAM is primarily a beyond-visual-range weapon, and would most likely be off-the-rails before entering the merge and turning with an adversary in a within-visual-range dogfight scenario. In which case, having the moment arm of a bit heavier (than an AIM-9) AIM-120 on the wingtips would affect performance. Still, it was not anything I specifically recall making a big deal about in any tactics briefing. Going further with regard to the flying characteristics when carrying AIM-120s vs AIM-9 on the tips, the Viper is a beast, and in my opinion, if you’re ripping the hell out of it in a BFM encounter, you’re not noticing if the roll rate is so many degrees per second slower or faster, you are trusting your skill, and the jet, to maneuver to the control zone of the hostile for the kill. But it really is more about wing flutter than anything else. Our loadout for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004 was all air-to-ground (laser-guided bombs and JDAM), yet look at our wingtips. Most certainly, the odds of an air-to-air encounter over Iraq were very low. The configuration was largely to keep the flutter in check and the remote air-to-air contingency capability was a bonus. Thomas inspecting his Viper’s AIM-120 prior to launch on a sortie over Iraq. , Thomas ‘t-b0ne’ Richter Live AIM-120s on the wings of Thomas’ jet and another, along with various stores, including GBU-12s, GBU-32, and a TARS reconnaissance pod., Thomas ‘t-b0ne’ Richter Considering the USAF sees its newest F-16s—the last of which was delivered 16 years ago — flying for decades to come in upgraded form , as do many other air arms around the globe, getting the most out of the airframes and their life-extending structural enhancements will be key. Flying with AIM-120s on their wingtips appears to be part of this solution. Beyond the existing fleets of F-16s, the fourth-generation fighters remain in remarkably high demand , with the relatively new South Carolina production line set to remain in good shape for years to come. With the acquisition of the F-15EX and a possible push for a far more affordable, lower-end aircraft than the F-35, it is not outside the realm of possibility that the U.S. Air Force could once again order more F-16s in their new standardized production configuration. Regardless, at least we finally know now for certain why most F-16s spend most of their time in the air with ‘Slammers’ hanging off their wingtips.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 22, 2021",B-1Bs Start To Get Back In The Air After Fleet-Wide Grounding,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers have begun flying again after the fleet was grounded last month. That halt in flying operations, which The War Zone was first to report , was ordered after a huge hole was found in augmenter fuel filter housing on one aircraft following a ground emergency. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), which oversees all of the Air Force’s bomber fleets, made the announcement that some B-1Bs had resumed flight operations on May 6, 2021. The Air Force would not say how many of the bombers are now cleared to fly or what the time frame might be for the entire fleet returning to business as usual. A B-1B bomber., USAF “Individual aircraft will return to flight when they are deemed safe to fly by Air Force officials,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel William Russell, an AFGSC spokesperson, told The War Zone . “Returning B-1s to flight is a top priority within the command.” At present, the Air Force has around 59 of these bombers in service, two of which are set aside for test and evaluation duties. Earlier this year, the Air Force began executing a plan to retire the 17 oldest B-1Bs. As of April, the Air Force had sent three of these aircraft to the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona as part of this process. Ultimately, the Air Force plans to operate a fleet of 45 combat-coded B-1Bs, along with the pair of test jets, until it retires the fleet for good in the 2030s. The Air Force hopes that retiring the 17 oldest examples will help improve the overall readiness of the remaining fleet. This recent grounding was only the latest major issue to befall the B-1Bs in recent years, compounded by the extremely heavy use of these aircraft in combat operations over Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria over the past two decades. The issue with the augmenter fuel filter housings, which are mounted on the sides of each of the B-1B’s four F101-GE-102 engines, after one bomber, serial number 86-0104, experienced a ground emergency at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota on April 8. Airmen move an F101 engine on cart., USAF The massive hole in the housing had caused the aircraft to leak copious amounts of fuel, presenting an obvious safety hazard. In addition, these are housings are critical to the operation of the jet’s afterburners, which cannot be engaged if they are broken in any way. The use of afterburners is essential for B-1B takeoffs and the bombers cannot fly without them. A view of a B-1B flying overhead with its afterburners engaged., USAF Subsequent inspections turned up similar issues in other B-1Bs, prompting Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of AFGSC, to order the grounding on April 20. “During the safety stand-down, maintenance depot personnel disassembled the Augmenter Fuel Filter Housing and performed a series of robust inspections using the latest techniques,” according to the press release AFGSC issued today. “After each unit was determined to be free of defects, it was reassembled, pressure checked, and returned to service.” The Air Force says that maintainers at Ellsworth, as well as Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, have been involved in getting the B-1Bs back in the air. The AFGSC staff, the depot maintenance team at the Air Force Sustainment Center at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s B-1 Program Office and Propulsion Directorate at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, and the Air Staff and the Secretary of the Air Force Office of Acquisitions, Technology and Logistics on their efforts at the Pentagon, have all also been supporting the effort. “We are proud of the tremendous efforts of our maintainers and B-1 partners in identifying, inspecting, and remediating any potential issues with the B-1B fuel filter housing,” Air Force Major General Mark Weatherington, head of 8th Air Force, the numbered Air Force within AFGSC responsible for day-to-day bomber operations, said. “The aircraft are still safe to fly and we are confident that this stand-down has resulted in increased safety within the B-1B fleet.” With any luck, the rest of the B-1B fleet will be conducting regular flight operations soon.

Reuters also said it had reached to the U.S. Navy and U.S. State Department, but that neither had responded by the time its piece was published. There has been talk about possible Chinese infrastructure projects in Kiribati since 2019, when the country, under President Maamau, who had been first elected three years earlier, recognized Beijing as the legitimate government of China and ended its diplomatic relations with Taiwan. This reversed a decision I-Kiribati officials had taken in 2003 , when they changed their previous position, and recognized the government in Taipei. During World War II, the coral atoll’s airstrip was used by the U.S. Army Air Forces as part of an air ferry route between Hawaii and the South Pacific. After the war, civil operators also used it as a trans-Pacific stopover. The United States also made use of the island for space and missile tracking up until the late 1960s. Today, Canton Island Airport is used only for emergencies. A wartime map showing the location of Canto on the South Pacific Ferry Route, southwest of Hawaii., Public Domain The existing runway at Canton Airport, once modernized, could be long enough to support fighter deployments , but the improved section would likely need to be extended out to the full 8,000 feet length to support large-size transports, as well as maritime patrol aircraft or even bombers . A considerable investment would also need to be made to supporting infrastructure to sustain any kind of meaningful, longer-term deployment by military aircraft, including hangars, fueling and maintenance facilities, and accommodations for aircrew and ground personnel. The location of the airstrip would be especially useful for surveillance aircraft flights, including those by long-endurance unmanned aircraft , extending reach toward both Hawaii in one direction, and Australia and New Zealand in the other. Persistent intelligence-gathering, sea control, and long-range maritime targeting would all be of interest for the People’s Liberation Army in this region. A satellite view of the island of Canton with the airstrip in the top left corner., GOOGLE EARTH “The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) said in a paper last year that Chinese facilities on Kiribati would be positioned across major sea lanes between North America, and Australia and New Zealand,” according to Reuters . “The island would be a fixed aircraft carrier,” one anonymous individual, described as an adviser to Pacific governments, told that outlet. With this in mind, it’s worth pointing out that if China’s developments at Canton Airport come to fruition and have an overt military component, they could also include other anti-access and area denial capabilities, such as surface-to-air missiles or shore-based anti-ship cruise missiles. Command and control and communications nodes might be another addition to any such military complex. This would all be similar to what has been seen on China’s man-made outposts in the South China Sea, which also simply underscore the country’s demonstrated ability to turn remote, uninhabited islands into important military facilities. As well as providing a foothold in a strategic location, China’s plans for Kiribati could also impact its access to that nation’s extensive exclusive economic zone, which covers more than 1.35 million square miles and includes some of the most productive fishing grounds in the Pacific. The Chinese government also shut down a space tracking station on South Tarawa, another island in Kiribati, home to the country’s capital and most of its infrastructure, when Beijing broke ties in 2003 over the country’s recognition of Taiwan. That is another site that could be reestablished as Kiribati-Chinese ties continue to grow again. Whether or not any Chinese improvements to Canton Airport, or associated infrastructure, ultimately have an overt military dimension does remain to be seen. Concerns about similar kinds of dual-use capabilities emerging from Chinese construction projects have emerged elsewhere around the world , including in the Caribbean region , another increasing focus of Chinese interest. There have been significant Chinese investments in port facilities and maritime infrastructure in multiple countries in this region, with underlying concerns from the United States, in particular, that they might also have a military application. At the same time, some of the sites in question do not actually appear to have any direct military mission, at least in their current form. The War Zone explored the case of one such facility, a new airfield in Cambodia , last year. This facility appears to be ostensibly intended to serve a nearby luxury resort, despite the assertions from some experts and observers that some of the airstrip’s features were ill-suited commercial aviation activities. That being said, it would not necessarily be difficult for Chinese authorities to retool such an airport for military use, even on a limited basis as an intermediate staging base, and do so in relatively short order. It’s also interesting that Lambourne, the opposition lawmaker, who was also notably Kiribati’s last Ambassador to Taiwan , does not appear to have raised this possibility directly when she brought the information about the Canton Airport plans to Reuters . She instead added that she wanted to know specifically whether or not this planned work was part of China’s controversial Belt-and-Road Initiative . Tessie Lambourne, in red, stands next to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen in Taipei in 2018 after presenting her credentials as Kiribati’s new ambassador., Office of the President of Taiwan The Chinese government unveiled Belt-and-Road in 2013 as a massive global infrastructure improvement effort that would be mutually beneficial to China and international partners. Of course, since then, it has become apparent that this project is at least major a soft-power economic effort to increase Beijing’s general influence abroad. There have also been accusations that it amounts to so-called “ debt-trap diplomacy ,” in which Beijing offers loans for Belt-and-Road projects and then uses the debt as leverage to advance broader geopolitical interests. Taiwanese officials have already accused Beijing of effectively bribing Kiribati to switch its diplomatic recognition in 2019 with promised sales of airliners and ferries. Ahead of President Maamau’s 2020 election victory, China provided over $4.2 million for “livelihood projects,” according to the I-Kiribati government . Chinese President Xi Jinping, at left, walks past an honor guard in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing alongside Kiribati’s President Taneti Maamau in 2020., AP Still, whatever the wider geopolitical relevance of the Chinese plans for Canton, and whether it will host any kind of military presence, it is another indicator of Beijing’s growing influence in the Pacific, which presents challenges to Beijing’s competitors in the region, especially the United States. The U.S. relationship with Kiribati was formalized under a 1979 treaty of friendship, following Kiribati’s independence from the United Kingdom. According to the U.S. Department of State , “The two countries work closely together on a broad range of issues, from strengthening regional security, to promoting education and climate resilience, to protecting fisheries and food and water security.” Kiribati law-enforcement agencies cooperate with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard and those branches also provide air assets for search and rescue operations as well as fisheries protection operations in the country’s exclusive economic zone. The U.S. military has used other airstrips in Kiribati to support various operations in the Pacific, including the transit of aircraft. After all, the airstrip is only around 1,860 miles southwest of Hawaii, with its extensive military installations belonging to the U.S. Air Force , Navy , and Marines . U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Ospreys take off from Cassidy International Airport, Christmas Island, Kiribati, during a trans-Pacific flight to Australia., U.S. Marine Corps/1st Lt. Colin Kennard Increasing Chinese influence on Kiribati could potentially threaten those relationships and any deployment of Chinese military personnel on a permanent or semi-permanent basis might also cause friction. The establishment of a Chinese military base in the East African country of Djibouti, the location of a major U.S. military hub in that region, has already provided some worrisome indications of how things could go. In 2018, the U.S. military accused Chinese personnel in Djibouti of injuring members of the crew of a U.S. C-130 Hercules transport plane by shining a laser at them. So, whatever the wider geopolitical relevance of Beijing’s plans for Canton Airport might, and whether it will host any kind of Chinese military presence in the future, it is certainly another example of China’s efforts to expand its geopolitical reach.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Douglas F3D Skyknight was an early carrier-capable jet fighter that first saw combat in the Korean War, and again over Vietnam. Unusually, in case of a serious emergency, its crew were expected to bail out via an escape chute, rather than using more familiar ejection seats . This unusual procedure was even adapted to deliver special operations forces on at least one occasion during maneuvers in the late 1950s. While rather forgotten today, the Skyknight represented a major advance for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps when it arrived in service in 1950. Big and bulky, the Douglas design, armed with four 20mm cannons, had little in common with the sleek jets that were by then starting to appear. Still, over Korea it established an enviable record as a night-fighter, achieving the world’s first night-time jet-versus-jet kill using radar and becoming the highest-scoring Navy and Marine Corps fighter of that conflict. A U.S. Navy F3D-1 Skyknight from the first operator, Fleet Composite Squadron Three at Naval Air Station Moffett Field, California, where service trials were conducted beginning in late 1950., U.S. Navy The fact it was developed as a night-fighter goes some way to explain why the designers chose this unorthodox crew escape system. The squat, straight-winged Skyknight was built around a two-crew concept, with a pilot plus an airborne intercept operator (AIO), at least in the initial versions, to operate the separate search and tracking radars in the nose. Since this was the era of vacuum-tube technology, a wide fuselage was required to accommodate this equipment, which could detect targets at a range of between 15 and 20 miles. There was another radar in the tail to scan for hostile aircraft approaching from the rear. A Navy aviator bails out from an XF3D-1 at Naval Air Facility El Centro, California, in around 1949, during tests of the escape system., U.S. NAVY Side-by-side seating was better for crew coordination and the ejection seats then available were not considered safe enough to extract two people sitting next to each other, due to the danger of collision or damage from the respective rocket motors. In addition, the rocket-powered seats would have added more weight and complexity to a design, which was powered by two non-afterburning Westinghouse turbojets that were already somewhat lacking in thrust. Instead, a tunnel-like chute led down and aft from the cockpit, behind the seats, from which the crew could slide down in an emergency, popping out from the underside of the jet, between the engines. This system was also supposed to be safe to use at high speeds. A similar arrangement would later be a feature of the Douglas A3D Skywarrior , although that was a Cold War bomber design, so a lack of ejection seats was less unusual. Crewman of a U.S. Marine Corps F3D during a night training mission in 1954. The airborne intercept operator is on the left, with the pilot on the right., NATIONAL ARCHIVES Exactly how the crew would exit the stricken Skyknight is explained by former U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle pilot Paul Woodford on his blog, which you can check out here : “In the event that the crew had to bail out, they would depressurize the cockpit and pivot their seats toward each other. The first crewmember [the AIO] would get out of his seat, face aft, and kick open the escape chute door, which would presumably fall out and away through the chute. Grasping a horizontal bar, the crewmember would swing into the chute feet first, then slide out the belly of the aircraft, followed by the second crewmember.” The following sequence of photos shows ground tests of the F3D crew escape system: The crew members pivot their seats to face each other., VIA PAUL WOODFORD Grabbing a bar above the escape chute, the first crewman kicks the hatch open and swings his legs out., VIA PAUL WOODFORD Sliding down the escape chute., VIA PAUL WOODFORD Followed by a safe landing onto a pile of mattresses below., VIA PAUL WOODFORD This same method of practicing bailout was continued throughout the career of the F3D, which was redesignated F-10 from September 1962 when a new U.S. military-wide aircraft nomenclature system was adopted. Typically, the aircraft would be jacked up and mattresses would be laid out under the belly for this kind of training. “When you get ready to go, there’s a handle that you pull, and a trap door flies open, and a panel on the bottom of the airplane falls off, and the pilot’s seat literally falls apart,” Marine General Jack Dailey told Air & Space magazine. “We used to try to jump on the ECMO [electronic countermeasures officer, who replaced the AIO in later models],” Dailey added. “If he loitered on that mattress, he was going to get stomped on by the pilot.” A rare color inflight view of a U.S. Navy F3D-1 in flight near Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland., U.S. Navy Despite being the recipient of several less than complimentary nicknames — “Willie the Whale,” “Turtle,” “Blue Whale,” “Drut” (the last of those intended to be read backward) — the Skyknight enjoyed a long career with the Navy and Marine Corps as a night-fighter, radar intercept trainer, and electronic jamming platform. The crew escape system does not seem to have been a particular problem and there are no recorded attempts to retrofit ejection seats, even during the jet’s final years of combat service in Vietnam. Confidence in the escape system would have been provided, at least in part, by a series of live crew extractions made by experienced parachutists during tests at Naval Air Facility El Centro in California even before the F3D entered service. In these tests, parachutists successfully bailed out of the jet no fewer than 22 times at speeds of between 139 and 444 miles per hour. Parachutist and part of the parachute seen from a camera mounted under the wing of the XF3D-1 prototype during the El Centro tests., PUBLIC DOMAIN Then, test dummies were substituted for live parachutists as the speeds were increased to 496 miles per hour. The top speed of the F3D was around 530 miles per hour. Again, these trials proved successful. For the crew, it was recommended to open the parachute between five and 20 seconds after bailing out, it being calculated that they would have decelerated in that time and the forces exerted on them when the canopy opened would be reduced accordingly. In other tests, the jet maneuvered as the parachutist bailed out, imparting forces of up to 3.5 G. Again, things went as planned. Such was the versatility of the Skyknight that thought was also given to using its unusual crew-extraction system to deliver Marine reconnaissance troops via the same method. Interviewed by Air & Space magazine, Marine Corps pilot Jerry Dixon recalled an exercise in the Philippines in early 1958 in which his F3D was slated to fly a mission as an adversary aircraft. To make things tougher for the defending forces, a flight of four Skyknights would each carry a Marine commando instead of an AIO, dropping them behind enemy lines in a clandestine night-time insertion. “When we got to the drop zone, the formation leader made the prearranged signal to drop, I tapped my raider on the head, and he was gone like a shot,” recalled Dixon. “You talk about a set of balls to do what those guys did.” Two of the commandos suffered broken bones once they landed in the jungle. U.S. Marine Corps F3D-2Qs near Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California, in 1958., U.S. NAVY The Skyknight’s insertion of special forces continued a tradition established in World War II, during which adapted bombers were typically used to deliver agents, again often via chutes. Similar tactics also continued after that conflict and the Marines, in particular, also trained to drop reconnaissance elements from the cargo compartments of their OV-10 Bronco aircraft. The latter half of the Skyknight’s career was dominated by second-line roles, but many of these involved critical test work, including for advanced radars, missile guidance systems, and other electronic equipment. During the 1950s, adapted aircraft had the new Sparrow I beam-riding air-to-air missile integrated, helping prove out this emerging technology, while another F3D became the first aircraft to complete an automatic carrier landing , in 1957. The Skyknight also provided radar training to fighter pilots destined to fly other, more advanced types, including radar intercept officers (RIOs) for the F4H-1H Phantom II , which was later redesignated the F-4B. A U.S. Navy F3D-2T2 trainer from Fighter Squadron VF-101 at Naval Air Station Key West, Florida, in 1961., U.S. NAVY The very last frontline variant was the F3D-2Q — later redesignated the EF-10B — a radar-jamming aircraft that served with the Marine Corps at Da Nang, South Vietnam, from April 1965, flying passive and active electronic warfare missions over North Vietnam. The last such mission was flown in May 1970. Even after that date, F-10s continued to be used for various research and development work for decades, at least some technically being transferred to the Army and then operated by Raytheon contractors for this purpose. All through this time, the crews of the Skyknight relied on a unique escape system, should they have ever got into serious trouble to the point of needing to make a hasty exit from the cockpit.
