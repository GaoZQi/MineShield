By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s latest Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile test ended in failure after a “ground abort” prior to launch. While the cause is under investigation, the news comes at a time when a debate is raging in Congress and elsewhere about whether to proceed with developing a replacement for the missile, which has been in use since the early 1970s. The unarmed LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was due to be test-launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, on May 5, between 12:15 AM and 6:15 AM Pacific Time. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) has confirmed that it’s “assessing the potential to reschedule the launch.” No comment has yet been made about the nature of the “ground abort,” and we can’t really even say it was a malfunction at this time. It could have been a technical failure of the missile or its launch system, or it could have involved a tracking system loss, a broken communications link, or even a range “fouler,” when an unauthorized asset strays into the missile’s planned path, for all we know. Successful launch of an unarmed Minuteman III from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, in February 2020., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Clayton Wear Test launches of the Minuteman III are a fundamental part of evaluating the ICBM and gathering data to keep the system effective, including validating its readiness and accuracy. Furthermore, aborted tests and outright failures are also not unheard of, with the last mishap coming in 2018, again out of Vandenburg, when an unarmed Minuteman III suffered a failure over the Pacific. In that instance, Air Force personnel utilized the weapon’s self-destruct feature to safely destroy it in flight. “The Air Force adheres to strict protocols while performing operational test launches, only launching when all safety parameters with the test range and missile are met,” AFGSC said in the release about the latest incident. While it’s too early to say how critical the latest failed test launch was, it does come at a time in which the future of the land-based arm of the U.S. nuclear triad is under considerable scrutiny. The Air Force and Pentagon have long called for a replacement for the Minuteman III under the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, or GBSD, planned for initial operational capability by 2029. However, the Biden administration is likely to review the status of GBSD, based on the costs involved, and the possibility of modernizing the Minuteman III for further years of service. The total cost of GBSD could reach $264 billion , excluding warhead development, which might add around $15 billion more.

Eydie Sakura Last September, the Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman a $13.3 billion engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) contract to develop the GBSD and the service approved the company’s missile design, under the EMD baseline review , two months later. Northrop Grumman recently announced the completion of the integrated baseline review for GBSD, which provides the Air Force with details on expected costs and schedules, and any potential risk. In the meantime, Northrop Grumman continues work to sustain the current Minuteman III fleet. In April the company received a $2.3-billion contract to maintain the propulsion system through 2040. An inspection of the solid-propellant rocket motor for the Minuteman III prior to testing., U.S. Air Force/Rick Goodfriend If the Air Force and Pentagon get their wish, Northrop Grumman will complete around 660 of the new GBSD missiles, also known as the LGM-182A, to replace the Minuteman IIIs in silos across Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wyoming, and to provide spares and test missiles. It’s currently unclear exactly how the GBSD will improve on the Minuteman III, but we do know that it will accommodate the Mk 21A reentry vehicle, carrying a W87-1 nuclear warhead, which The War Zone has examined in detail here . A Boeing data slide detailing the key points of the GBSD, prior to that company leaving the bidding process., Boeing There is also the potential for the GBSD to become a more versatile weapon than the current ICBM fleet. For example, various new kinds of capabilities could be integrated, including a nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that the Air Force has studied in the past. However, recent polls suggest the majority of U.S. voters oppose GBSD and instead believe that alternative options — including a service-life extension effort for the Minuteman III — should at least be addressed. At the same time, lawmakers have made efforts to challenge GBSD, including an unsuccessful proposal last summer to redirect $1 billion from the program to a pandemic preparedness fund. Others are demanding a study on the future of the land-based leg of the triad. But while scrapping the ICBM force altogether has found traction among some lawmakers, at least, the reality of relying on ballistic missile submarines and strategic bombers for nuclear deterrence brings its own problems, as we have looked at in the past in regard to putting manned bombers back on nuclear alert. A B-52H Stratofortress starts its engines during a rapid takeoff exercise at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Sean Martin The question of whether the land-based portion of the nuclear triad even makes sense is something The War Zone has tackled before . This is based on the fact that America’s ICBMs today serve as a “nuclear sponge,” designed to absorb enemy warheads and thereby “save” other potential targets. They also offer a static nuclear strike option that can be activated and deployed against targets around the globe quickly. At the same time, the ICBM force is currently targeted, by default, out to sea, as a failsafe against accidental launches that could trigger a nuclear war. Missile combat crew members work in the launch control center of missile alert facility Alpha-01 at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana., U.S. Air Force /Josh Aycock Again, it should be stressed that until we know more about the reasons for today’s “ground abort,” it’s not possible to say whether it will provide ammunition to those seeking to replace the Minuteman III with GBSD. Regardless, the Pentagon has already argued that the Minuteman III is now too old to be realistically upgraded in a cost-effective way, while the Biden administration has, so far, indicated it is committed to retaining the nuclear triad . That said, it is still possible that a modernized ICBM may feature a reduced number of new missiles. While an aborted test launch might not have an immediate impact on the future of the GBSD program, the Minuteman III replacement certainly seems to be at a critical crossroads.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 10, 2021",First Test Flight Of Skyborg’s “Computer Brain” Flown On UTAP-22 Loyal Wingman Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says that it has conducted the first flight test of an initial version of the artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” it is developing under the Skyborg program using a Kratos UTAP-22 Mako unmanned aircraft. Kratos, along with Boeing and General Atomics, are on contract to start delivering new drones soon to support this project. Skyborg is centered on crafting a system of systems that will be able to fly networked “loyal wingman” type drones, as well as fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles , or UCAVs. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio announced the successful completion of the flight test, which it said lasted approximately two hours and 10 minutes, on May 5, 2021. The flight had occurred on April 29, with personnel launching the UTAP-22 carrying the Skyborg Autonomy Core System (ACS) from Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. Tyndall has immediate access to extensive over-water ranges in the Gulf of Mexico and is already a regular launch point for ground-launched Kratos BQM-167A Skeeter target drones , from which the UTAP-22 is derived. A UTAP-22 drone carrying a Skyborg Autonomy Core System launches from Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida on April 29, 2021., USAF The Air Force has described this test as Milestone 1 within what is now calling the Autonomous Attritable Aircraft Experimentation (AAAx) campaign. Attritable refers to drones and other systems that are not, by definition, expendable, but are designed to be low-cost enough to be employed in environments where the risk of them being lost would preclude the use of more expensive and sensitive ‘exquisite’ platforms. “We’re extremely excited for the successful flight of an early version of the ’brain‘ of the Skyborg system. It is the first step in a marathon of progressive growth for Skyborg technology,” Air Force Brigadier General Dale White, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Skyborg, as well as for Fighters and Advanced Aircraft, said in a statement. “These initial flights kickoff the experimentation campaign that will continue to mature the ACS and build trust in the system.” “Through this operational experimentation campaign, AFRL is leaning forward to get early engagement with the warfighter to deliver a suite of full-mission autonomy on a relevant timeline,” Brigadier General Heather Pringle, the Skyborg Technology Executive Officer and head of AFRL, added in her own statement. “AFRL is proud to be developing this force multiplier for the U.S. Air Force with our partners at PEO Fighters and Advanced Aircraft and the 96th Test Wing.” AFLCMC and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), working together, are managing the Skyborg program, which was publicly unveiled in 2019 . The 96th Test Wing, which has been assigned the role of lead test unit for the Skyborg program, is based at Eglin Air Force Base, also in Florida. The Air Force said the main goal of this flight test was to evaluate the Skyborg ACS’s ability to carry out various “foundational behaviors necessary to characterize safe system operation,” according to an official press release. “The ACS demonstrated basic aviation capabilities and responded to navigational commands, while reacting to geo-fences, adhering to aircraft flight envelopes, and demonstrating coordinated maneuvering.  It was monitored from both airborne and ground command and control stations.” In short, this flight was conducted primarily to ensure that the Skyborg ACS was capable of safely controlling the UTAP-22 through a series of relatively basic maneuvers within a defined area. The term “geo-fences” refers to virtually defined boundaries around a certain area, which, depending on the nature of the technology in use, can be set in various ways, including simply by boxing off a zone with GPS coordinates. The geo-fences, in this case, would have been intended to place limits on where the drone was supposed to operate, with the Skyborg system autonomously changing its course to keep inside this specified airspace. The Air Force did not say why the UTAP-22 was used for this particular test. In December 2020, the service announced it had awarded contracts to Kratos, as well as Boeing and General Atomics , to build drones to carry the Skyborg systems, but the assumption had been that the company would supply additional examples of the stealthy XQ-58A Valkyrie to support this work. XQ-58As have already been supporting work related to the Skyborg program, as part of AFRL’s Low-Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) project, as well as testing conducted as part of the Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) networking and advanced technology initiative. Over a dozen companies, in total, are also providing various subsystems to the Air Force in support of Skyborg. An XQ-58A Valkyrie is launched during a test as part Advanced Battle Management System initiative in 2021., USAF However, the UTAP-22 is a proven and affordable platform, and is the only loyal wingman-type drone currently on the international market . It has been extensively tested in this role, the mission set that the Skyborg program is focusing on initially, since at least 2015. That year, a U.S. Navy Mako flew networked together with a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jet. Last year, pictures also emerged on a UTAP-22, with Navy markings, in an air-launched configuration underneath the wing of an Oregon Air National Guard F-15C Eagle fighter jet. In April, the Air Force also disclosed that KC-135R aerial refueling tanker equipped with a new communications suite had received data from a Mako during a recent test. An Oregon Air National Guard F-15C Eagle fighter jet with a UTAP-22 under its left wing., @tucson.plane.spotter The Mako could simply have been the most readily available platform suitable for this initial test. It is not at all uncommon to see the use of surrogates in testing to help prove out these kinds of autonomous capabilities. It’s also worth noting that, as of April, the Air Force was only known to have taken delivery of three XQ-58As , though a dozen more were in various stages of production at that time. Per the contracts awarded last year, Kratos, as well as Boeing and General Atomics, are supposed to deliver their initial batches of drones for Skyborg testing this month. Boeing is supplying a version of the Airpower Teaming System (ATS) drone it developed for Australia, while General Atomics says it has tested its stealthy Avenger in relation to its Skyborg work , though it remains unclear if that company will deliver examples of that design or a derivative thereof to the Air Force. The Skyborg program has stressed from the beginning that the computer brain and associated systems it is developing are intended to be platform-agnostic and readily adaptable to different aircraft. There has even been talk about some of these autonomous capabilities eventually making their way into manned aircraft help reduce the workloads of pilots and other aircrew. The Air Force says that multiple follow-on Skyborg ACS flight tests are already scheduled for the coming months. So, it is possible, if not plausible that this “computer brain” will be flight tested on the other platforms the service is already in the process of acquiring for this program later this year. Whatever the case, this flight test an exciting step forward for the ambitious Skyborg program, which could revolutionize how the Air Force fights in the air. Skyborg is also just one of a host of programs going on within the Air Force, as well as elsewhere within the U.S. military, focused on advanced autonomous technology together with new developments in unmanned platforms, in the air and down below , including types capable of operating in networked swarms . Artificial intelligence and machine learning are also areas of interest that are only growing across the services. With the results of the first successful test of the Skyborg “computer brain” now in hand, it will be very interesting to see what new progress the Air Force will make on this project as the year continues.

Adam Kehoe,"Updated on Jun 27, 2021",Probe Into Handling Of UFO Encounters Launched By Pentagon’s Inspector General,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Department of Defense Inspector General issued an announcement yesterday that it is opening an evaluation into “the extent to which the DoD has taken actions regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP).“ Importantly, the announcement specified an evaluation rather than an investigation, likely framing the inquiry in terms of policy instead of specific allegations of wrongdoing. The notice gave various organizations within the U.S. military, including multiple entities that are also members of the U.S. Intelligence Community, five days to designate a senior individual as a point of contact. The distribution of the list notably includes the commanders of U.S. Central Command, U.S. Northern Command, and U.S. Special Operations Command. The list does not however include other combatant commands , such as U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, which has seen unusual incidents involving unidentified aircraft in recent years. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General could not be reached for comment on why only some commands were included. The Department of Defense Inspector General memo announcing the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena-related evaluation., DOD The distribution list for the Department of Defense Inspector General’s Unidentified Aerial Phenomena-related evaluation announcement memo., DOD The Inspector General’s announcement comes at a time when this issue is receiving high-profile media attention. The War Zone team has covered this topic for several years, including a recent story concerning a bizarre incident involving unidentified aircraft swarming U.S. Navy warships off the Southern California coast. Since our story, filmmaker Jeremy Corbell published leaked photos and videos apparently connected to the event. The photos and video were quickly authenticated by the Department of Defense as being recorded by Navy personnel, but no details regarding their context have been confirmed by the Pentagon. Reporter George Knapp also recently published photos depicting a separate set of alleged UAP events that took place in recent years off the East Coast. Asked by The War Zone about the circumstances surrounding the apparent leak, Department of Defense spokesperson Susan Gough told us that the photos and video were “provided to some web news outlets without following the proper procedures for authorized release of information.” She further stated that the Department of Defense concluded that confirming the cockpit photographs and night-vision video were taken by Navy personnel would “reduce public misperceptions regarding their authenticity.” Gough declined to comment on which outlets were “provided” with the information. It is interesting to note that the Pentagon used very similar language to Gough’s statement when it officially released three controversial UAP videos, seen below, including one with the filename “FLIR” that shows an object that is now commonly referred to as the “ Tic Tac ,” in April 2020. “DOD is releasing the videos in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos,” a statement at the time read. According to Gough, no formal investigation has been opened into the unauthorized release of the photos and videos. She further declined to comment on any questions regarding the context of the video, or the accuracy of media claims that these videos depict advanced craft. Though there are few publicly available details about the Pentagon’s activity regarding UAP, that is expected to change relatively soon. In June of 2020, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence requested a public report on the matter, expected to be released in the coming months. The committee’s request specifically acknowledged a lack of a “unified, comprehensive process within the Federal Government for collecting and analyzing intelligence on unidentified aerial phenomena, despite the potential threat.” The request called for a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence within 180 days, leading many observers to expect the report sometime in June of this year. It is unclear if the Department of Defense Inspector General’s evaluation will impact the timing of that report. The War Zone contacted the chairs of both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Armed Services Committee. They have provided no comment at this time. It should be noted that the underlying facts of recent “UAP” incidents remain extremely limited. Shortly after our initial reporting on the 2019 USS Kidd incident, Task & Purpose reporter Jeff Schogol asked the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral Michael Gilday, about the status of the investigation . According to the CNO, the aircraft remain unidentified. He added, “it’s been reported there have been other sightings by aviators in the air and by other ships not only of the United States, but other nations – and of course other elements within the U.S. joint force.” Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday., OSD This repeated pattern has raised concerns among The War Zone team that these sightings may represent a broader pattern of airspace breaches, carried out by foreign competitors using relatively unsophisticated technology. If this is the case, these breaches would arguably constitute a major intelligence failure.  Further, concerns abound that the confusing and often controversial nature of these sightings may contribute to a delayed or muted response by relevant agencies. The apparent lack of seriousness surrounding this topic, as well as the level of support in terms of resources and expertise may have prompted the IG to examine it. You can read more about what may actually be going on here, in regards to these issues and how the UAP issue is being treated by the government in this recent in-depth feature of ours . In the coming months, the public will hopefully learn more facts about the UAP issue and the Department of Defense’s response, or lack thereof, to it. If new insights are not surfaced in an expected report to the Senate, they may well come from the Department of Defense Inspector General, instead.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 4, 2021",Turkey Now Has A High-Speed Missile-Like Drone That’s Launched From A Larger Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the latest example of Turkey’s burgeoning unmanned capabilities , Turkish Aerospace has unveiled a “kamikaze drone” version of its Simsek unmanned target drone, designed to slam into a target as its warhead detonates. In addition, the attack version of the Simsek can itself be launched from a drone, making it one of a new generation of these kinds of weapons that are optimized for delivery by other unmanned aerial vehicles. The CEO of Turkish Aerospace, Temel Kotil, first disclosed the existence of the kamikaze drone last month in an interview with CNN Turk . “It can carry five kilograms of explosives, and it can fly around 100-200 kilometers [62-124 miles] when launched from a UAV,” he said. “We produce 100 Simsek drones per year.” An Anka drone carries a Simsek under the wing., PUBLIC DOMAIN Powered by a small turbojet engine, the original Simsek target drone was developed beginning in 2009 as a high-speed target to test the capabilities of ground-based and naval air defense systems, as well as air-to-air missiles launched from manned fighter jets . In its original form, the drone can fly at a speed of 400 knots and operate at altitudes of between 1,000 and 15,000 feet. Like many other target drones in its class, the Simsek was designed around a catapult launch system, which can also be installed on ships, as seen in the tweet above. Since last year, however, the drone has also been integrated on Turkish Aerospace’s combat-proven Anka drone , a medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle broadly equivalent to the American MQ-1 Predator . Another potential launch platform is the same company’s Aksungur twin-engine drone. Launching the Simsek kamikaze drone from another UAV, like the Anka or Aksungur, not only extends its range but also increases the survivability of the launch vehicle, which is able to attack targets at a greater standoff range. A Turkish Aerospace Aksungur combat drone drops a 750-pound KGK-SIHA-82, an indigenous winged smart munition., Turkish Aerospace In contrast to what we would normally consider a “ suicide drone ,” or loitering munition like the Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI) Harop , which you can see in action here , the Simsek kamikaze drone has reduced range, up to 124 miles with air launch. Another difference is the fact that the Simsek kamikaze drone, at least in its basic form, does not currently carry optical sensors or a datalink, which would allow it to loiter over the battlefield and either use its own sensors to lock onto a target when it presents itself, or be cued remotely via man-in-the-loop guidance. Loitering munitions also offer the possibility to conduct surveillance without necessarily conducting a strike and many of them can be recovered and reused if they fail to find a target. Instead, the kamikaze drone operates more like a traditional air-to-ground missile, being guided to a pre-selected target. The method of guidance used by the Simsek has not been revealed. However, the target drone version features a line-of-sight datalink that can function up to 31 miles from the ground control station. The target drone can also operate in fully autonomous modes, flying over pre-selected waypoints, at selected speeds and altitudes. With that in mind, using the latter guidance mechanism, it would be relatively simple to attack static targets. More complex guidance systems could be incorporated in the future, too. The Simsek is also faster than most loitering munitions, flying at up to 400 knots. It should also offer improved maneuverability and, according to reports, will be cheaper to manufacture. That reflects the likeliness that the Simsek is intended to be used as a drone-launched low-cost cruise missile, a concept that represents a growing area of interest, including in the United States . The IAI Harop., IAI The Simsek’s warhead, however, weighs just 11 pounds, while other loitering munitions, such as Israel’s Harop, delivers around 50 pounds of explosive , for far greater destructive effect. It may be imagined, however, that the high speed of the Simsek is intended to provide a knockout blow to non-hardened targets, such as air defense radar systems. In fact, air defense systems could well be the primary target for the kamikaze drone. In this way, the drone-launched Simseks could be used to overwhelm hostile air defense networks, both attacking threat systems and confusing them by weight of numbers. Fitted with a passive radar seeker, the Simsek would also be able to attack radar emitters autonomously. This suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) scenario could be even more effective if the Simsek was adapted to carry out electronic warfare jamming or even act as decoys , although it’s unclear what kind of payload capacity the drone has. Already in its target drone form, the manufacturer offers the Simsek with a passive radar cross-section augmenter (also known as a Luneberg lens ), as well as a countermeasures dispenser system. With Turkey already working on the kinds of swarming technologies that would allow drones to operate as a networked team, it’s also conceivable that the Simsek could be adapted for this type of warfare as well. Being able to have drones attack in larger numbers would offer a significant boost in capability and would be ideal for overcoming not only air defense systems but potentially also large-scale attacks against other soft targets, including convoys of light vehicles, parked aircraft, ammunition and fuel dumps, and others. The original aerial target version of the Simsek can be recovered using a parachute after its mission, providing it’s not been shot down, and then reused. However, the apparent emphasis on low cost suggests that the attack version of the drone may be intended to be expendable whether it reaches its target or not. A Simsek target drone., Turkish Aerospace According to Defense News , Turkish Aerospace is currently working on some modifications to the kamikaze Simsek, although an initial version is reportedly ready for operational deployment. Improvements would focus on the payload capacity and “maneuvering capabilities.” So far, there has been no confirmation of orders for the new kamikaze drone from the Turkish Ministry of Defense, but it’s possible the drone could have a wider appeal, too. Turkey is already a major exporter of drones and its products in this field have seen extensive use in conflicts including in Libya , Syria , and in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh . Indeed, Turkish reports suggest the target drone version of the Simsek has already been tested in Azerbaijan, while Kazakhstan has also been identified as a possible customer for this variant. Regardless of what kinds of missions the drone-launched Simsek eventually ends up performing, the key development is clearly the launch of one drone from another, in the same way that the U.S. Air Force recently launched an example of the ALTIUS 600 small, unmanned aircraft system, or SUAS from a XQ-58A Valkyrie stealthy, affordable unmanned aircraft. An ALTIUS 600 drone is launched from a XQ-58A Valkyrie., U.S. AIR FORCE / COURTESY PHOTO While Turkish drones have repeatedly demonstrated that they can launch weapons, including in combat, the launch of a smaller drone, which could in turn eventually carry lightweight sensors, small signals intelligence systems, or jammers , as well as the kinetic warhead now fitted, is significant. All in all, it would not be a surprise to see this new kamikaze drone turn up in a conflict sooner rather than later.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has confirmed that the secretive Joint Special Operations Command , or other U.S. government entities operating in cooperation with it , has been flying a new type of drone in the Middle East that is designed to be extremely quiet and have an innocuous outward appearance. The new details about the Long Endurance Aircraft Program have come to light after one of these unmanned planes, derived from the Pipistrel Sinus powered glider, crashed at Erbil International Airport in Iraq last year. The Long Endurance Aircraft Program (LEAP) drone in question, identified only as AV009, crashed at Erbil on July 24, 2020, according to a heavily redacted copy of the official accident report that The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. The unmanned aircraft suddenly and unexpectedly pitched nose down while coming in to land at the airport after a sortie. The drone hit the ground, bounced back up into the air, and then came back down, eventually coming to rest alongside the runway. The mishap resulted in the front-mounted propeller striking ground and the landing gear collapsing. It also caused significant enough damage to the right wing that fuel leaked onto the ground.

The Air Force said that aircraft, valued at $3.4 million, was a “total loss.” A portion of the accident report regarding the crash of a LEAP aircraft in Iraq last year., USAF via FOIA USAF Air Force Magazine had been first to disclose that a mishap involving what was then described as an unidentified “remotely piloted vehicle,” or RPA, had occurred at an “undisclosed location” overseas on July 24, 2020. That outlet had obtained a spreadsheet of all Class A and B mishaps the Air Force had suffered during the 2020 Fiscal Year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2020. There had been speculation at the time that the crashed drone could have been an RQ-170 Sentinel , though the spreadsheet said that the unmanned aircraft belonged to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). Units assigned to Air Combat Command (ACC) are the only ones publicly known to fly the stealthy RQ-170. The official accident report does not provide a detailed description of the LEAP aircraft, but does say that at least this particular example was government-owned and contractor-operated at the time of the incident. The document also identifies the individual who was operating the drone during the mishap as an employee of Technology Service Corporation (TSC). The Pentagon announced on April 14, 2020, that SOCOM had raised the cost ceiling on an existing contract with TSC to support the LEAP, which “provides aircraft, turrets and spares required for a full multi-intelligence capability at Joint Special Operations Command [JSOC],” to $63 million. In February of this year, that ceiling was again increased , to $75 million, “to accommodate a longer performance period.” A section describing the background of the contractor who was operating the LEAP aircraft at the time of the crash., USAF via FOIA In December 2019, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) had also announced that its Center for Rapid Innovation had completed a series of flight tests at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah in support of what was referred to as the Ultra Long Endurance Aircraft Platform (Ultra LEAP) program. That testing ended with “a two and a half-day continuous flight demonstration” of a “high-performance, cost-effective, sport-class commercial airframe converted to a fully automated system with autonomous takeoff and landing capabilities.” AFRL said at the time that “the system could be ready for operational fielding as soon as 2020.” The Air Force said it had only taken 10 months to go from “concept to first flight” and that the “high level of automation” would simply operator training and logistics support requirements, as well as help keep operating and maintenance costs low. “U.S. Special Operations Command’s long-endurance aircraft program includes Pipistrel Sinus aircraft converted by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory into an unmanned aerial system,” U.S. Navy Commander Tim Hawkins, a SOCOM spokesperson, subsequently confirmed to The War Zone . “SOCOM has been assessing this platform as an option as we work with our military services and industry partners to identify low-cost, high-endurance airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance solutions. This unmanned aerial system is contractor-operated and has a payload that includes a combination of full-motion video and signals intelligence sensors.” The original Pipistrel Sinus design dates back to the mid-1990s and numerous subvariants, including easier-to-store versions marketed as the Virus line , have been produced since then. The company, which has its main headquarters in Slovenia, says that the current Sinus 912 model has a maximum speed of just under 137 miles per hour, has a cruise speed closer to 124 miles per hour, and has a stall speed of just under 40 miles per hour with its flaps deployed. Beyond details about its endurance, there are very limited specifics about the U.S. military’s LEAP derivative and its configuration. An artist’s conception that AFRL released in 2019 shows a substantially different planform with no traditional cockpit and an even longer and more slender wing than is seen on a typical Sinus. It also has no visible landing gear suggesting the LEAP design has retractable undercarriage or other means of recovery, unlike the Sinus. Artwork that the Air Force Research Laboratory released of what it described as the Ultra Long Endurance Aircraft Platform (Ultra LEAP) in 2019., USAF “The Air Force research laboratory (AFRL) has demonstrated the suitability of Pipistrel light aircraft for SOCOM, installing sensors to collect full motion video, lidar [light detection and ranging] and signals intelligence with many units already deployed and operating around the globe,” Pipistrel’s subsidiary in the United States, Pipistrel-USA, disclosed last year. LIDAR provides a laser imaging capability that can also reveal objects that might be buried at certain depths beneath the ground, such as improvised explosive devices or weapons caches. The exact configurations of SOCOM’s LEAP aircraft are unknown. This promotional image shows an unmanned Pipistrel aircraft with a type of sensor turret that typically contains various electro-optical and infrared video cameras. An additional fairing that could carry other sensors, datalinks, or other systems, is seen under the tail. Additional domed antennas, typically associated with satellite communications systems or datalinks, are seen on top of the fuselage. Various other antennas are seen installed elsewhere on this aircraft., Pipistrel-USA Another promotional image showing an aperture for an unspecified sensor underneath the fuselage of an unmanned Pipistrel aircraft., Pipistrel-USA Pipistrel is also now marketing an unmanned derivative of its Surveyor aircraft, which is related to the Sinus design, for military use. The company says this drone can fly at altitudes up to 30,000, remain aloft for up to 30 hours, and cover a total distance up to nearly 2,800 miles, depending on payload, altitude, mission profile, and other factors. A rendering of an unmanned derivative of the Pipistrel Surveyor configured for military use. A podded sensor turret is seen suspended under the left wing., Pipistrel SOCOM would not provide any details about what unit or units are operating these drones or how many it has in inventory. The official accident report identified AFSOC as the “owning MAJCOM [major command]” for the LEAP drone and Hurlburt Field in Florida as the “owning base.” Interestingly, however, it said that the “owning service” for the associated ground control station was an “Other US Govt Agency (Federal, State or Local).” The term “other government agency,” often abbreviated OGA, is typically used by elements of the U.S. military to refer to entities outside of the Department of Defense, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Details about the ownership of the LEAP aircraft and the ground control station involved in the mishap in Iraq last year., USAF via FOIA Reports over the years have provided significant evidence of a very close working relationship between JSOC, and units tasked with supporting its operations, and the CIA, especially when it comes to unmanned aircraft . In addition, it is known that highly secretive SOCOM aviation elements have supported JSOC operations from Erbil in the past. It’s not clear exactly where the LEAP aircraft that crashed last year had been flying before the mishap, though the accident report says that it had completed an orbit lasting between 7 and 10 hours. The operator had asked about retasking the drone to another area before the decision was made to bring it back to Erbil. It’s also unclear if LEAP drones have or may still be operating from any other locations in the Middle East or elsewhere around the world. It’s also not entirely clear how long JSOC has been flying the LEAP drones, or any manned, unmanned, or pilot-optional predecessors based on Pipistrels designs. Despite AFRL’s press release talking about fielding the unmanned aircraft in 2020, the mishap report says that the example that crashed in Iraq had been modified in January 2019, then performed five test and checkout flights at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, and then subsequently deployed to Erbil in March of that year. In May 2020, Pipistrel-USA revealed in an edition of its official company newsletter that contractors had been operating unmanned Surveyor aircraft in support of SOCOM since 2013. This public disclosure was made, in part, in response to uncertainty about SOCOM’s Armed Overwatch program , which is seeking a manned light attack aircraft to replace Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) U-28A Dracos , and SOCOM’s interest in lower-cost alternatives to the MQ-1C Gray Eagle and MQ-9 Reaper . “Budget constraints in the armed overwatch program have opened the way for evaluation of different lower-cost platforms,” Pipistrel-USA’s newsletter read. “On 13th of May as part of the virtual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference where Colonel Melissa Johnson, the program executive officer for fixed wing aircraft acquisition, showed a picture of an operational Pipistrel Surveyor aircraft on a presentation slide adjacent to the Gray Eagle and Reaper aircraft. As part of the presentation, Johnson told the audience of industry attendees that SOCOM is actively seeking new, low-cost alternatives to the MQ-1 and MQ-9 for long endurance surveillance missions. We beleive [sic] this is the first public acknowledgement of the Pipistrel surveyor program existence by SOCOM.” From a budgetary perspective, the LEAP aircraft definitely appears to present a lower-cost alternative to existing unmanned aircraft. In March, the Air Force announced it had awarded General Atomics a contract to build a single MQ-9 for the U.K. Ministry of Defense at a cost of nearly $13 million as part of a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) arrangement. That figure also included various sensors, but it’s not clear if any other ancillary costs might have been factored in. Still, that price point is nearly four times the stated value of the LEAP aircraft that smashed into the runway at Erbil. With all this in mind, it’s also possible, if not plausible that the drone that AFRL described last year as the Ultra LEAP is an improved variant or derivative of prior unmanned Pipistrels that JSOC has been using for years now. Regardless, based on what we know about this program, overall, it’s not hard to see why JSOC, as well as other “OGAs,” would be interested in this drone. A highly efficient unmanned aircraft able to loiter over a particular area for a protracted period of time, but also with a low acoustic signature and a planform less likely to arouse suspicion if it is detected, offers clear benefits, especially for monitoring the activities of specific individuals or small groups and helping to establish so-called “patterns of life.” Pictures and videos of more traditional drones, such as MQ-9 Reapers, routinely appear on social media , showing that it is relatively easy to identify those aircraft, particularly when they have to fly at lower altitudes. “They are very quiet, more that [sic; than] 50% quieter than a normal small aircraft,” Pipistrel says in its own brochure for the unmanned version of the Surveyor. “In the air, they look like an inconspicuous sport/recreational aircraft and they are not treated suspiciously.” “They can be easily dismantled in less than 15 minutes and stored in a dedicated trailer,” that document adds. “Therefore, a hangar is not needed, and a regular vehicle can tow the aircraft in the trailer, no special transport is needed.” This would also make it easy to deploy and operate these drones very discreetly, even from austere locations with limited infrastructure. “They can take-off and land on grass or unprepared surfaces, not just hard runways,” the unmanned Surveyor brochure also notes. This is hardly the first time the U.S. military, as well as the CIA, has investigated similar capabilities. The LEAP aircraft, as it is understood now, sounds very much like a spiritual successor to the Vietnam War-era YO-3A Quiet Star and the RG-8A Condor that flew during the latter stages of the Cold War. These were manned aircraft designed with a particular focus on extremely low acoustic signatures. A US Coast Guard RG-8A Condor., RuthAS via Wikimedia The U.S. Army flew both the YO-3A and the RG-8A, and subsequently passed examples of the latter type to the U.S. Coast Guard. The CIA also reportedly operated some RG-8As, or other derivatives of the base Schweizer 2-37 powered glider design, including over Somalia , as both intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms (ISR) and communications relay nodes. The Coast Guard, as well as the Department of Justice, also flew RU-38A Twin Condor ISR aircraft, another militarized Schweizer design with a low acoustic signature. You can read more about all of these aircraft, as well as the Coast Guard’s abortive attempt to acquire a new Manned Covert Surveillance Aircraft (MCSA), an effort that spanned from the mid-2000s to the early 2010s, in this past War Zone feature . An RU-38A Twin Condor., USCG It’s also worth remembering that, in 2017, a contractor-operated Grob G 520 configured for ISR missions appeared at an airport in Indiana around the time that U.S. special operations exercise was taking place. This aircraft is another slender-wing design optimized for high-altitude operations. Though it’s not clear if it has features specifically to reduce its acoustic signature, the manufacturer says on its website that the latest G 520NG model has a “very low probability of intercept.” This particular plane’s composite structure would also help reduce its radar signature. The U.S. military, as well as the U.S. intelligence community, has also long been interested in unmanned aircraft with very low acoustic signatures and/or designed to be innocuous-looking from the outside. One particularly good recent example is the ultra-quiet, high-efficiency XRQ-72A, which Scaled Composites, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, developed as part of the Great Horned Owl program. The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency (IARPA) led this project, which was first publicly announced in 2011 and that you can read about in much more detail here , in cooperation with AFRL. A rendering of the XRQ-72A, along with other details about the drone., USAF via FOIA The CIA’s Cold War-era Aquiline project is another prime example. Aquiline sought to develop a bird-shaped drone with extremely long-range, potentially powered, in part, by a nuclear battery, for discreet surveillance deep inside denied areas within the Soviet Union. These are just some of the low-acoustic-signature drones that are known about, not to mention developments that are almost certainly occurring in the classified realm. Various companies market many of these designs publicly, in part, around how quiet they are, just as Pipistrel is doing with its militarized unmanned Surveyor. These drones have come in various shapes and sizes, too, beyond types that are the size of small planes, or simply converted from them, such as the LEAP aircraft. These include relatively small catapult and hand-launched designs, such as the Lockheed Martin Stalker, which SOCOM reportedly bought some of in 2006 , and that company’s more recent Fury propeller-driven, flying-wing unmanned aircraft. Unmanned variants and derivatives of the Pipistrel can now be added to the list of such designs that have been used by the U.S. military operationally. Information about these drones is trickling out and, with the public acknowledgement of the loss of one of these discreet drones in Iraq last year, perhaps more details about how they have been employed will now begin to emerge.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jun 10, 2021",F-16s Are Now Getting Washed By Robots,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s 149th Fighter Wing has revealed a unique robotic system now being used to wash down its F-16 fighter jets to keep them free of corrosion and extend their lifespan. The autonomous washing system is now a proof of concept but could be rolled out across the Air Force and potentially extend to many other aircraft types. In the accompanying images, the system, that uses robotic spraying arms, is seen being demonstrated on an F-16C at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland , Texas, late last month. According to the Air Force, the robot can do the job of deep cleaning an F-16 in just one hour, a significant advantage over human technicians. Typically, this can take three to four people two days to complete, the ground crews being armed with hoses, brushes, and buckets of soapy water. An F-16C being washed by the new autonomous system at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, April 28, 2021., U.S. Air National Guard/Senior Airman Ryan Mancuso The new robot was programmed and tested at the 149th Fighter Wing under the AFWERX innovation initiative , a technology incubator the Air Force established in 2017. In this case, the technology for the automated washer has come from robotics specialist Wilder Systems, based in Austin, Texas, which has signed a memorandum of understanding with the 149th. Typically, a fighter jet like the F-16 would receive a wash every 180 days to prevent corrosion and prolong the lifespan of the airframe. Cleaning removes any built-up dirt and grime, which includes grease, oil, and hydraulic fluids, as well as soot from the engines, smoke from firing the gun and launching weapons, and environmental debris like insects. If that kind of debris is not properly removed, it can become corrosive to the aircraft, attacking the metal substructure and parts of the aluminum frame. That can lead to potentially disastrous effects, including structural weakening and even structural failure. Other issues that can be brought on by grime-related corrosion include panels falling off and wheels cracking, making landings a potential hazard. Cleaning an F-16 the traditional way, using buckets of soapy water, at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Krystal M. Jeffers “It is hard work,” Staff Sergeant Kyle Padgett, a crew chief at Shaw Air Force Base , South Carolina, explained of the manual F-16 cleaning process back in 2012. “These jets are very hard to clean because the grease, oil hydraulic fluids, and debris that build up over 180 days are difficult to get off the paint. The landing gear is also hard to clean because there are so many nooks and crannies. It is a very tedious job.” The robotic cleaner may offer a more efficient way of treating the jets, compared to the traditional “wash-rack.” It should also be possible to run the cleaning robot at night, freeing up maintainers to focus on other jobs during the day. https://youtube.com/watch?v=bnk-a9SHmhM The Wilder Systems solution actually leverages technology previously developed for robotic drilling in commercial aircraft manufacturing and converts these components and subsystems into an automated washing system. The main changes have involved the development and addition of robot end-effectors to provide the water and soap spray, waterproofing of the robots themselves, and a robot motion path, which is dependent on the type of aircraft to be cleaned. According to a publicly available briefing from Wilder Systems, successful testing of the F-16 cleaning robot should be followed by “additional fighter-sized aircraft and larger airlift/tanker aircraft.” Beyond that, the company is also looking at the potential of using the same types of robots to conduct aircraft maintenance jobs such as panel drilling, non-destructive inspection (NDI), and de-paint/re-paint processes. The specially painted drop tanks on the 149th Fighter Wing get the robot cleaning treatment., U.S. Air National Guard/Senior Airman Ryan Mancuso However, cleaning up any jet will likely remain a fairly laborious process, despite the technological advance heralded by this new concept. In particular, the process of taping up sensitive equipment and any openings is part of the process and it’s hard to see a robot taking on that work just yet. Nevertheless, should the jet-cleaning fulfill its promise, Wilder Systems says it will not only deliver a higher wash quality, more flexibility, and a safer working environment for personnel but the effects could be felt on the flight line too. The company predicts that introducing the automated system could add up to 150 additional sorties annually and allow for an extra two pilots to be qualified. The robot cleans the underside of a weapons pylon on the F-16., U.S. Air National Guard/Senior Airman Ryan Mancuso Already, the company says, there is interest from other maintenance units beyond Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, and thought is already being given to how the same basic system could be used for applying de-icing and anti-icing fluids, or for chemical, biological, radiological decontamination chemicals. This is not the first time that increased automation promises to improve availability and quality control within the Air Force. The automated racks for F-22 Raptor drop tanks that we have discussed in the past are another great example of this kind of initiative. Using robots in place of human labor also presents an opportunity to help address the ongoing shortage of enlisted personnel in flying units. If there are fewer people available that are dedicated to aircraft maintenance, it makes sense for them to focus on the jobs that still have to be conducted by humans. The days of crew chief using long-handled brushes to clean those hard-to-reach areas of the F-16 — not to mention other aircraft — could be numbered.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",Declassified Docs Offer New Details About A Growing RQ-170 “Wraith” Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The existence of the RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone has been an acknowledged fact for more than 10 years now, and they’ve been flying for even longer, but the U.S. Air Force still offers few official details about their capabilities or their operational exploits . Now, newly declassified documents confirm that testing and evaluation of at least some of these unmanned aircraft continued at the secretive Tonopah Test Range in Nevada for a time after the main unit flying them formally moved to Creech Air Force Base in that same state. These records also provided details about plans to increase the size of the overall RQ-170 force and additional confirmation that these drones have an informal nickname, “Wraith.” The 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, the first unit publicly known to operate the RQ-170, officially moved from Tonopah to Creech on Aug. 30, 2011. This squadron had stood up, after decades of inactivity, to support the Sentinel program on Sept. 1, 2005. The unit had been reassigned to the 432nd Wing at Creech from the 57th Wing, one of the Air Force’s premier test and evaluation units , at Nellis Air Force Base also in Nevada, on May 1, 2007. The only picture of the RQ-170 that the US Air Force has officially released, to date, showing one of the drones on Guam., USAF via FOIA “The 30 RS [Reconnaissance Squadron] … performed remotely piloted aircraft testing and evaluation, with an eye to the development of advanced tactics, techniques and procedures,” a section of the official annual history of the 432nd Wing for 2010 reads. “On 22 November 2010, after the activation of a separate organization to pick up remaining testing duties at Tonopah, the Air Combat Command’s Advanced Programs Division asked the major command’s Basing Division to facilitate the relocation of the 30 RS to Creech as expeditiously as they could.” A section from an annual internal history of the 432nd Wing for 2010 discussing the rebasing of the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron from Tonopah to Creech., USAF via FOIA The War Zone obtained this internal history, as well as a number of other documents related to the RQ-170, via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). A separate Email, dated Nov. 22, 2010, sent from a Colonel within Air Combat Command’s Advanced Programs Division, abbreviated ACC/A8Z, and a civilian official at that command’s Basing Division, or ACC/A5B, among others, identifies the entity that was stood up at Tonopah to take over RQ-170 testing as Operating Location W (OL-W). The name of the official who sent this Email and those of all of the recipients have been redacted. The Email specifically mentioning the establishment of OL-W at Tonopah to support testing of the RQ-170., USAF via FOIA The existence of OL-W at Tonopah was mentioned in an annual history of Air Combat Command for 2010, which the author previously obtained through the FOIA, but with no additional information provided as to its purpose. A list of operating locations assigned to Headquarters, Air Combat Command, including OL-W at Tonopah, as of 2010., USAF via FOIA The internal 432nd Wing history, as seen in the section of that document embedded earlier in this story, does show that the desire to move the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron to Creech was more than two years in the making before it actually happened. The Air Force completed an environmental impact analysis in June 2009 regarding the relocation of the squadron and then-Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley approved the plan the following month. It’s unclear what held up the actual movement from taking place, but operational security concerns could easily have played a part. Tonopah has long offered a secluded location to support the development and testing of advanced and otherwise sensitive aircraft, including covertly acquired foreign types , and even as a base for operational units equipped with top-secret designs, such as the F-117 Nighthawk stealth combat jet. A memorandum from the leadership of the 432nd Wing, dated April 23, 2010, expressly prohibits anyone from talking about the RQ-170s and their capabilities to unauthorized individuals or taking any pictures or video of the drones, under threat of possible disciplinary action or criminal prosecution. That same document also refers to these unmanned aircraft by the nickname Wraith, rather than the official name, Sentinel. A memorandum regarding operation security practices in relation to the RQ-170, which also mentions the informal “Wraith” nickname., USAF via FOIA Even so, Creech sits right along a highway, where it is far more difficult to keep their flight operations entirely concealed . Tonopah would remain far better suited to testing and evaluating the RQ-170, especially examples in new configurations that might include distinctive external features. David Axe first reported the existence of this informal moniker, based on documents this author had previously obtained through the FOIA, back in 2014. This appears to be only the second official confirmation of it being used for the RQ-170. Of course, it’s not uncommon for military aircraft, including in the U.S. military, to have a second nickname in addition to the formal one, such as Viper for the F-16 , rather than Fighting Falcon, or Warthog for the A-10 , instead of Thunderbolt II. The service itself said that “ironically” it was its own bureaucracy that finally got things going. “Concerned with the impact of imminent personnel assignments on the small unit of [redacted] highly specialized officers, enlisted and civilians, the Advanced Programs Division hoped to install the 30th at Creech before the end of January 2011,” the 432nd Wing history explained. As of November 2010, the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron officially had 41 officers, 70 enlisted personnel, and 3 civilians, according to another declassified document. USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA Interesting, parts of the 2009 environmental impact analysis that the Air Force released to The War Zone , seen below, say that a driving factor for the proposed move from Tonopah to Creech was that unit, referred to in that report only as an “Air Force Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Squadron,” was expected to “see an increase in equipment and personnel over the next year,” growing to approximately 175 individuals, 100 of which would be military personnel, while the remaining 75 would be contractors. USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA It’s not clear if the planned “plus-up” came to fruition after the squadron’s relocation in 2011 or if it involved the addition of any new airframes. The number of RQ-170s in Air Force service has been consistently estimated to be between 20 and 30 total aircraft. “The AF-UAS squadron would add additional ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] capability,” the environmental impact analysis added. “The squadron would also support the continuing development of advanced concepts for integrating and employing UASs. Creech AFB is an ideal location for this new mission due to the availability of restricted airspace and the associated ranges.” It is worth pointing out that the first sighting of the RQ-170 had come in Afghanistan in 2007, after which the press had dubbed the drone “the Beast of Kandahar.” In 2009, small numbers of these unmanned aircraft went first to Guam and then to South Korea. You can read more about the latter deployment in detail in this past War Zone piece , also based on documents obtained via the FOIA. Combined with the proposed increase in the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron’s overall size in order to “add additional ISR capability, the plans for the movement to Creech would seem to coincide with an increase in the operational use of the Wraiths overseas. Whatever the total size of the force as, by 2011, the drones were also flying over Iran, where one infamously crashed and was subsequently captured , and over Pakistan, where an RQ-170 kept watch over Osama Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad before and during the raid that led to his death. None of the documents provide any specifics about what kind of testing and concepts of operations development work the Air Force had planned for the Wraiths that stayed at Tonopah at that time. Still, this additional context about the movement of the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron and the establishment of OL-W is an interesting addition to what is already known about the history of the RQ-170 force. OL-W was still active at Tonopah at least as of 2013, the same year that Detachment 1 of the 732nd Operations Group, a part of the 432nd Wing, was stood up at Creech. A unit patch for that detachment includes the phrase “Forging the Sword,” which had previously indicated could refer to the development of new concepts of operation relating to the RQ-170, as well as other advanced unmanned aircraft . That same patch had a lightning bolt and three drops of blood, which could be references to electronic warfare and armed strike mission sets. The logo also had the silhouette of an RQ-170 and raven identical to the one found on the official 30th Reconnaissance Squadron insignia. The “Forging the Sword” patch for the 732nd Operations Group, Detachment 1., Flightlineinsignia.com We also now know that the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron , also officially based at Creech, which stood up the same day the Air Force shuttered 732nd Operations Group, Detachment 1, flies the RQ-170. It seems very possible, if not plausible, given the planned plus-up of the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, that the 44th is an evolution of the test and evaluation elements working on the RQ-170 that remained at Tonopah. With this in mind, it’s worth remembering that the first formal disclosure that the 44th was operating the RQ-170 came in an Air Force press release last year regarding the unit’s participation in a so-called Large Force Test Event (LFTE) focused on exploring concepts of operations for stealthy aircraft, manned and unmanned, penetrating into denied areas. Suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses and electronic warfare tactics were also key components of the exercise. When it comes to the basing of these unmanned aircraft domestically, there could still very well be Wraiths at Tonopah, given that the general nature of drones allows the personnel operating them to be physically separated from where the aircraft are launched and recovered. At the same time, we do know that there are RQ-170s at Creech and that these drones have also operated from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, where they have good access to expansive ranges of the coast, for test and evaluation purposes. As of recently, the drones also are flying out of the Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, home of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division, which developed the RQ-170. Pictures previously provided to The War Zone of an RQ-170 landing at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, in July 2020., Submission Much about the RQ-170s, how the Air Force has employed them in the past, and how it is utilizing them today, especially as work on fielding more advanced stealthy drones continues, remains opaque. At the same time, the new information in these declassified documents has helped fill in more of the puzzle about the early service life of the Wraiths.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 17, 2021",British F-35Bs Will Soon Fly Middle East Combat Missions From HMS Queen Elizabeth,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. British-operated F-35B Lightning stealth jets are scheduled to fly combat missions over the Middle East during the first operational cruise of the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , which starts later this month. The short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) jets, which will be embarked on the Royal Navy flagship alongside examples from the U.S. Marine Corps , are the first British fighters to be embarked on an operational carrier since 2010, during the last days of the British Harrier jump jets . “The F-35B Lightning jets pack a potent punch against Daesh and help prevent them from regaining a foothold in Iraq,” said U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces James Heappey, in a statement released today, together with the accompanying images, showing the first British F-35Bs to go aboard the carrier for the upcoming cruise. “This is a prime example of the U.K. Armed Forces stepping forward with our allies to confront persistent threats around the world. It is Global Britain in action.” The first of eight F-35Bs from No 617 Squadron landed on HMS Queen Elizabeth on May 2 ahead of Exercise Strike Warrior and CSG21., CROWN COPYRIGHT “This deployment represents the embodiment of the UK’s Joint Expeditionary Capability and utilizing the F-35Bs in the fight against Daesh will further demonstrate our commitment to securing their global defeat,” said Chief of Joint Operations, Vice Admiral Sir Ben Key. While the U.K. has previously committed F-35Bs to its counter-ISIS campaign — known as Operation Shader — on that occasion, in the summer of 2019, the jets were flown from the Royal Air Force’s land base at Akrotiri, in Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean. In the meantime, RAF Eurofighter Typhoons have been spearheading the Operation Shader missions over Iraq and Syria, including the recent employment of the Storm Shadow standoff cruise missile . For their next combat deployment, the F-35Bs from the RAF’s famous No 617 Squadron, the “Dambusters,” will be flying from HMS Queen Elizabeth , as the warship begins Carrier Strike Group 21, or CSG21, a cruise that will take it via the Mediterranean to the Indo-Pacific. A Marine Corps F-35B aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth. , USMC The timing of this latest combat deployment of the U.K. F-35B is notable in that the tempo of coalition airstrikes against ISIS targets has reduced significantly since the previous deployment at Akrotiri. Indeed, between late 2019 and early 2020, the RAF almost ceased airstrikes in the region altogether. On the other hand, there has been somewhat of an uptick in activity since the beginning of this year, including the aforementioned Typhoon cruise missile raid and a series of strikes last March that targeted around 100 cave hideouts in a 10-day period. Overall, however, it remains to be seen how much of an impact the carrier-based F-35Bs will be able to have on the conflict, which will depend also on the time that HMS Queen Elizabeth is planned to remain on station in the Mediterranean. There is no confirmation so far as to whether VMFA-211 will take part in these combat missions, although the squadron has already accumulated significant combat experience with the F-35B, since first taking it to war over Afghanistan in 2018. Exactly how many F-35Bs will be embarked on board the carrier has also not been formally announced, but the U.K. Ministry of Defense says it “will be the largest number of F-35Bs ever to [go to sea]” and it has also stated that eight British jets will go aboard the carrier. However many more U.S. jets join them, this implies the total will be more than the 15 British and American jets that were on the carrier for an exercise last September, which you can read more about here . The U.K. Ministry of Defense has, in the past , also said that the fixed-wing air group for CSG21 will be the biggest “since HMS Hermes, ” a significantly smaller carrier , but one that served in the Falklands conflict with an air group of 16 Sea Harriers and 10 RAF Harrier GR3s, plus helicopters. CROWN COPYRIGHT CROWN COPYRIGHT CROWN COPYRIGHT The first British F-35Bs, reportedly four aircraft, departed their base at RAF Marham in eastern England on May 2 to embark on HMS Queen Elizabeth . On the U.S. Marine Corps side, 10 F-35Bs arrived at RAF Lakenheath , home of the U.S. Air Force’s 48th Fighter Wing, in late April. According to eyewitness reports, nine of those jets had departed Lakenheath for the carrier as of May 3 and, should all those jets go aboard, that would provide an impressive 18-strong fixed-wing component. Ahead of CGS21, the Carrier Strike Group, including embarked aircraft, will take part in a two-week series of maneuvers, Exercise Strike Warrior , off the Scottish coast. This will involve more than 20 warships, three submarines, and 150 aircraft from 11 nations. CROWN COPYRIGHT CROWN COPYRIGHT CROWN COPYRIGHT The culmination of Strike Warrior will see the Carrier Strike Group certified ready for deployment, setting the stage for CSG21, which is described by the U.K. Ministry of Defense as “the largest concentration of maritime and air power to leave the U.K. in a generation.” The ministry says the deployment is “committed to confronting persistent threats around the world and [will] make a meaningful contribution to global security.” The 28-week CSG21 deployment will cover around 26,000 nautical miles and take in the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and the Asia-Pacific regions. It includes planned visits to India, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, as well as cooperation with the armed forces from each nation. CROWN COPYRIGHT CROWN COPYRIGHT Alongside HMS Queen Elizabeth , the remaining Royal Navy CSG21 complement will comprise the Type 45 destroyers HMS Diamond and HMS Defender , the Type 23 class frigates HMS Kent and HMS Richmond , the replenishment tanker RFA Tidespring , the stores ship and fleet tanker RFA Fort Victoria , and an undisclosed Royal Navy Astute class nuclear attack submarine. Other warships joining them will be the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS The Sullivans , and the Dutch De Zeven Provinciën class frigate HNLMS Evertsen . F-35Bs are being provided by No 617 Squadron and the U.S. Marines Corps’ Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211, the “ Wake Island Avengers ,” home-based at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona. Meanwhile, helicopters for CSG21 will include multi-purpose Wildcat HMA2s from 815 NAS, anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning and control Merlin HM2s from 820 NAS, and Commando Merlins from 845 NAS.

Andrew D’Ambrogi, the commanding officer of VMFA-211, conducts carrier qualifications in an F-35B aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth , May 2, 2021., 1st Lt. Zachary Bodner/U.S. Marine Corps The Crowsnest Merlin helicopters, in particular, are a key component of CSG21, although this program has seen significant delays and full operational capability for the type will not now be declared until May 2023. As for the Lightning, it was always clear that the Marine Corps would make up a significant proportion of any large-scale carrier deployment, at least in the near term, with only 18 F-35Bs having been delivered to the United Kingdom so far. As well as the carrier strike commitment, these jets are also required for other missions and training, a process that you can read about in detail here . With a continued question mark over the total number of F-35Bs the United Kingdom will finally order, it’s likely that the Marine Corps will remain an important part of future deployments by the two Royal Navy carriers, as well. Regardless of the operator, the fact that such a significant number of F-35Bs will go aboard a carrier for an operational cruise is a significant achievement for the United Kingdom, as it steadily rebuilds a fixed-wing carrier capability that was lost for almost a decade. Indeed, there have been some claims that CSG21 represents a level of capability unmatched anywhere outside the U.S. Navy. The announcement that at least some of these jets will now also fly combat missions over the Middle East confirms that the powers that be have decided that the Carrier Strike Group is ready for real-world operations.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When U.S. Special Operations forces raided Osama Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, now a decade ago, years of special training and experience combined to overcome a host of potentially devastating events, including the crash of a specially equipped Black Hawk helicopter and threats from the Pakistani Air Force , to ultimately achieve the desired end result of the mission. Retired U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Douglas Englen flew with the elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and played a critical role in Operation Neptune’s Spear. He credits skills he learned while taking part in an elite U.S. Marine Corps training course as being critical to the success of the mission. Englen piloted an MH-47G Chinook during the operation, helping to bring in a quick reaction force to the compound after one of two Black Hawks crashed. Having arrived on the scene, his crew joined the effort to help load up Bin Laden’s body and items of potential intelligence interest from the compound, before departing for Afghanistan. An MH-47 spins up for a mission., US Army However, Englen and his fellow crew members then faced a further, potentially lethal, threat. He disclosed last year that as his MH-47 and the remaining helicopters fled the scene, he was faced with a Pakistan Air Force F-16 Viper, which he says attempted to “engage” his MH-47G at least three times. This is from our previous report on the revelations: After loading up Bin Laden’s body and other items of potential intelligence value from the compound, the raiding force began to make its way back to Afghanistan. Englen does not say exactly when during the exfiltration it occurred or where, but he says that one of Pakistan’s American-made F-16 Viper fighter jets was clearly hunting for the remaining helicopters and attempted to “engage” his MH-47G at least three times. “It was as an electronic fight. A missile never left the rail. So I was able to evade him electronically. That’s all I’ll say,” he said. “But, he was searching and hunting for me, and three times came very close to actually launching a missile.” Englen does not say what type of electronic warfare systems he employed to evade the fighter jet. It is known that the MH-47G has some form of radio-frequency countermeasures system , in addition to infrared and laser missile warning receivers and countermeasures. Quade also says that the 160th’s Chinooks had just received new electronic warfare equipment before the raid and that Englen had helped certify those systems and training crews to use them. The Night Stalkers Chinooks are without a doubt the most heavily modified and best-protected versions of that helicopter anywhere in the world. A Pakistani Air Force F-16B Viper., Asuspine/wikicommons In a more recent interview with The Hot Wash YouTube show , which is hosted by another veteran of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), Alex Bertelli, Englen again touched on the historic mission and offers new details on how he and his teammates evaded the prowling Pakistani F-16. He specifically credits the U.S. Marine Corps’ Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) Course, which is hosted by Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), as having played a critical part in ensuring he bought his MH-47G and crew home safely. “The biggest thing is they teach you how to fly […] a helicopter against an adversary, [sic] a jet. So air-to-air combat,” he explained. “Air-to-air combat with a jet and a helicopter, [and] helicopter to helicopter. Those are the techniques that brought myself and the crew home on the evening of May 1, 2011.” Englen flew with the 160th SOAR, also known as the “Nightstalkers,” between 1998 and 2020, and he accrued an astonishing 2,500-plus missions with this elite unit, making him one of its most experienced aviators, ever. Englen was a lead planner for the Bin Laden raid, and he says that losing an aircraft was one of the primary concerns. He calls the WTI course the “ TOPGUN of the Marines,” and explains that the 160th is allowed to attend the three-month course as a guest unit to enable “Nightstalker” crews to learn how to be Tactics Instructors. An MH-47G of the 160th SOAR., U.S. Army/SSgt Reed Knutson In an exclusive exchange with The War Zone, Chief Warrant Officer Englen further explains how he came to attend the WTI course and the associated benefits to the U.S. Army: TWZ: How did you end up at WTI? Is the 160th SOAR a usual participant? DE: I was insisted by my Battalion Commander to attend with an entire crew [two pilots and two crewchiefs] with an MH-47E in order to learn tactics and train 160th Chinook crews. The 160th and WTI has had a long-standing exchange aviator partnership. TWZ: What was different about the training evolution compared to those you had taken part in in the past? Does the U.S. Army have anything similar to WTI? DE: The training evolutions in the past have been short in duration covering similar courseware, but not at the level of long-term dedication (three-month-long courses at WTI). The Army has somewhat similar classroom training courses but doesn’t have the application stage. The Army does standardize the operational flight lead and air mission commander qualifications like WTI. MH-47s during a training sortie., US Army TWZ: What type of defensive air-to-air tactics do they cover? How can a helicopter defend itself against a fighter and other threats? DE: Air-to-air defense tactics are covered both academically and dynamically [hands-on]. We take our helicopter and fly it against other helicopters and jets to practice in teams. Multiple scenarios [head-on, offset, rear, etc] are developed to cover all aspects. Helicopters don’t have much for air defense other than terrain masking and concealment. TWZ: Does the Army have a similar air-to-air syllabus or training evolution? How do the Marines train differently than the Army in regard to helicopter tactics? DE: The Army only covers academic tactics courses. In fact, the Army consistently sends Army personnel to WTI because of the application phase. The Army course trains primarily electronic warfare and missile defense spectrums. Not the detailed flight lead and air mission commander designations/qualifications. MH-47 cockpit., DoD TWZ: This training ended up proving itself extremely useful. How did it translate into real-world operations? DE: WTI teaches that relying on the basics is critical. Then blend in technology to gain a competitive advantage. The basics are what saved my life in many situations. TWZ: Do you think this training should be standard for all military combat helicopter pilots? DE: Absolutely. But, this is very resource-intensive. The Marine Corps has made this a priority, which I think the Army should as well and let the trainers train at the unit level. The scale is much larger for the Army, but would be beneficial if tactics could be training ‘hands-on’. The Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course at MCAS Yuma included the AH-1W in the past, but has now consolidated on the newer AH-1Z., Jamie Hunter The WTI course at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona continues to teach crews from all over the Marine Corps, including heavy-lift helicopters, such as Marine CH-53s , as well as those of attack/escort types such as the AH-1 Cobra , and select visiting units in all areas of tactical employment. The last AH-1W WTI course was completed in 2019, and the Cobra syllabus now concentrates on the newer AH-1Z . “Air-to-air tactics were taught not only at MAWTS-1 in Yuma, Arizona, but also by squadron WTIs,” a retired U.S. Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra Weapons and Tactics Instructor told The War Zone in a separate interview . “Evasive maneuvering was also taught, but mostly to the transport helicopters. We flew against Marine and Navy fixed-wing. Cobras were expected to protect the transports against all threats to include enemy jet fighters.” “I retired in 2002, but remember the Defensive Air Combat Maneuvering [DACM] training. I always enjoyed these flights and especially the debriefing with our adversaries. Cobras were always underestimated and we enjoyed busting the jet guy’s bubble,” said the pilot. “As a young 1st Lieutenant in the mid-1980s, I remember when our AH-1J Cobras received the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile modification. The air-to-air warfare training had just begun,” he added, referring to his old unclassified AH-1W Tactics Manual. An AH-1Z carries a live Sidewinder on its stub-wing tip rail. The importance of rotary-wing counter-air missions has increased recently due to threats from a more diverse set of airborne platforms, including drones. , USMC “There were many training detachments from Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, California that were specifically for Cobra-versus-helicopter DACM and Cobra-versus-fixed-wing fighters, he continued. “In fact, Marine Cobras were the first U.S. attack helicopters to have this capability, perhaps the world’s first? All of our tactics manuals were updated to include air-to-air warfare, but these were initially all F-4 Phantom II tactics and all of the diagrams were F-4s, not Cobras!” “We found that helicopter-versus-helicopter — aircraft with similar capabilities — greatly heightened the variables,” he recalled. “Maintaining energy, maneuvering your section [flight of two], or division [flight of four], to provide mutual support became very important. Helicopter-on-helicopter reminded me of the World War I dogfights but flown much much closer to the ground. While we were armed with a turreted 20mm cannon; its slow rate of fire made it a poor air-to-air weapon. Our 2.75-inch rockets could be used like a shotgun!” Author’s Note: the rate of fire of the AH-1W’s M197 cannon is fixed at 650 rounds per minute. An AH-1W pilot checks the M197 cannon., Jamie Hunter Fully understanding the strengths and weaknesses of opposing aircraft is extremely important in DACM, and these details were very much limited to the classified version of the tactics manual. The AH-1 Cobra’s greatest advantage over a fixed-wing aircraft was the turn capability. “A helicopter can out-turn any fixed-wing aircraft,” the pilot explained. He adds that a big advantage for the rotary-wing crews was the lack of training that fixed-wing crews had versus helicopters in this kind of engagement. “Generally, they greatly underestimated our training and capabilities. Our use of the terrain helped limit the jet’s air-to-air missile capabilities and often gave us the advantage of seeing them first,” he said. “The greatest weapon that a jet could use against us was their bombs! They would try to frag us. Their best option was to make one bombing pass. If they made the mistake of making repeated passes, or trying to engage us in a turning fight, they were in for a surprise.” An AH-1Z carrying an inert AIM-9L Sidewinder. , U.S. Marine Corps/LCpl Eryn Rudolph The AH-1’s best chance of successfully employing its two AIM-9 Sidewinders in a head-to-head pass because a fighter might be able to outrun a tail shot. Fighter pilots tend to be exposed to very limited opportunities to regularly practice techniques against large transport aircraft or helicopters. Both the transport aircraft and the helicopters can employ clever bespoke tactics that can bring sufficient spacing or terrain into play to help evade the enemy. As was partly the case in the Bin Laden raid, electronic countermeasures also play an increasing role in these types of engagements, although traditional flying tactics and techniques can still be used to help achieve the desired effect. For Douglas Englen, a combination of the two appears to have saved his MH-47G and the personnel inside on that dark night over Northern Pakistan, thanks in part to the Marine Corps’ Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course. We can only wonder what would have been if he never received this unique training. What went down in the history books as an incredibly successful mission and a cultural touchstone, could have become known for far less triumphant reasons.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 21, 2021",How A Presidential “Beast” Limo Almost Got Overrun In The Slums Of Mumbai,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The limousines that the U.S. Secret Service uses to drive around the President of the United States, nicknamed Beasts , are some of, if not the most specialized and sensitive cars out there on the road today. Still, under all the armor and other modifications, they are cars – or maybe more accurately trucks – that are designed, operated, and maintained by humans who sometimes make mistakes. So, things happen, including breakdowns. That’s exactly what former Secret Service Agent Bill Gage says happened during President Barack Obama’s visit to India in 2010, where one almost ended up stranded on the road after the brand new Beast overheated deep in the slums of Mumbai and again when an agent accidentally filled one of the gasoline-fueled vehicles with diesel. The Beast rolls past an honor guard during President Barack Obama’s visit to India in 2010., AP Gage, who first joined the Secret Service in 2002 and was a Counter Assault Team (CAT) member, told these two stories about the Beast’s time in India more than a decade ago in a recent episode of The Team House podcast . CATs ride in other vehicles in any Presidential Motorcade and provide an immediate tactical response force should the convoy get ambushed or find itself in any other kind of serious contingency scenario. You can read more about the complete structure of a typical Presidential Motorcade in this past War Zone feature . Gage did not say when exactly either of the two incidents he described took place, but said that they both happened in Mumbai. Obama visited India between Nov. 6 and Nov. 9, 2010, in what was his first trip to the country as President. He traveled to both New Delhi, the country’s capital, and Mumbai, its largest city and a key financial center, during the visit. In Mumbai, among other things, he paid tribute to the victims of a major terrorist attack there in 2008. During these four days in India, he also met with both then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and then-President Pratibha Patil, and addressed the country’s parliament. Obama also traveled to India in 2015, but did not visit Mumbai during that trip. Gage further explained that the issue of the car overheating took place before Obama arrived. “It’s [the Beast] gotta be there before the President arrives,” Gage said. “The threat level was so high on that trip and we flew in a day ahead of Obama on that trip.” He also said that the vehicle that overheated was a “brand new” presidential limousine that had been extensively “field-tested.” Available pictures , some of which are seen earlier in this story, of the limos used during President Obama’s Trip to India in 2010 all appear to show examples of a version of the Beast , which was externally styled after the Cadillac DTS sedan, that first emerged at President George W. Bush’s first inauguration in January 2001. A picture of first-generation Cadillac DTS-styled Beasts in 2005., Paul Carter However, Obama’s first inauguration in January 2009 had been the public debut of a new design , which is externally reminiscent of the Cadillac STS. This sounds like the model that Gage was referring to on the podcast. Just to note, another version, with an outward look similar to the Cadillac CT6, appeared in 2018 . The Secret Service will typically have multiple sets of Beasts ready to go for major events and overseas trips. A single motorcade will also have more than one, with the empty cars serving as decoys, as well as backups in case one is immobilized for any reason. Seven Beasts, a mixture of STS and CT6-styled types, were notably part of a massive motorcade used for President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January. All of the Beasts have been designed and built by General Motors and are understood to use more robust SUV or truck chassis to handle the added weight of the vehicle’s armor and other unique features. The exact specifications of the Beasts are highly classified, but are said to have protection against small arms and other light weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades, as well as mines. They reportedly have a host of other defensive and general safety features, including an onboard fire suppression system, run-flat tires, and an interior hermetically sealed against nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) threats. Other specialized capabilities, including night vision driving systems, a secure communications suite, and more, round out the features of these cars, which you can read more about here . “I know what some of the capabilities are. I’m not gonna get into it on the podcast,” Gage said. “Some are really high classified that I don’t even know about.” Regardless of the exact model of Beast and its capabilities, Gage explained that all of the elements of the motorcade had arrived in Mumbai a day ahead of Obama. The plan was to stage the vehicles at a U.S. State Department facility in the city for the next day’s travel. Beast limos and other US Secret Service vehicles onboard a US Air Force cargo plane ahead of President Donald Trump’s tour of Asia in 2017., USSS “So, we land, and, for whatever reason, we had to drive through the slums of Mumbai,” he recalled. “It was hot as a m-fer, man, that day in India.” The temperatures in Mumbai were in the low 90s between Nov. 6 and Nov. 9, 2010, according to Weather Underground , in line with average temperatures there for that time of year. “Well, dammit, the thing overheated on this Indian road through the slums. It overheats, like steam is coming out of the engine,” Gage continued. “Nobody’s in it, we’re driving an empty motorcade to get to this storage facility, this embassy offsite, and the driver comes on and he’s like ‘guys, I gotta stop, this thing is like redlining it’s so hot.'” So they do and “thousands of Indians are coming around and this is a classified piece of U.S. government property,” he said “The [CAT] team leader, he was like ‘guys, let’s take up positions around the limo so this thing can get cooled off.'” “Thousands of Indians are coming out of these slums, man, and we’re like ‘what are we gonna do?’ We can’t shoot these people,” he added. “We can’t just start wasting Indian civilians because they want to touch this limousine, but it ended up cooling down enough and we were able to get to this offsite.” A member of the US Secret Service, at right, with a member of India’s security services, at left, during President Barack Obama’s visit to the country in 2010., AP In the end, Gage said that the limo was stopped on the road for between 10 and 15 minutes. It’s not hard to see how even this short amount of time stopped could have been a major security issue. Of course, had President Obama been in the motorcade at the time, the Secret Service would certainly have moved him into a backup Beast, but this would eliminated a decoy vehicle in the process. As Gage noted, the sensitive nature of the car means that there would still have been a particular need to ensure nothing happened to the stranded vehicle. Later in the trip, disaster nearly struck again just four hours before the motorcade was due to take Obama to an event, according to Gage. They had stopped at an Indian gas station to fuel up beforehand and the Beast’s driver had inadvertently begun filling the car’s tank with diesel, despite it having a gasoline-fueled engine. Diesel doesn’t work properly in engines designed to run off that fuel and can cause significant damage to the internals. “I remember turning to him [the driver], his first name started with W, and I was filling up the CAT truck with unleaded, and I remember looking at him, and I was like, ‘hey, W, that’s diesel, man,’ and the panic on his face,” Gage remembered of the incident. “He said every cuss word.” “We had to get an Indian tow truck and Obama was supposed to go live, man, in like four hours to this major event,” he continued. Gage explained that the Secret Service’s Transportation Section has an entire staff of highly trained mechanics with certifications straight from General Motors. However, he added that, while a contingent of them will travel where ever the presidential motorcade goes, they rarely get called upon to do anything. “The look on these guys’ faces,” he said. “We were like, ‘listen, man, we filled this thing up with like five or six gallons of diesel,’ and they were just like so excited.” “These mechanics, unbelievable, in like four hours took this whole engine apart, drained all the fuel, cleaned the fuel pump,” Gage continued. “Brand new fuel pump, brand new fuel filter, got this thing up and running, it was amazing … in the heat of Mumbai, India.” Thankfully, in both of these instances, according to Gage, the Secret Service was able to get the Beast back up and running without any major impact on the rest of the trip, as one would expect from these highly trained professionals. This is also hardly the only time a Beast has found itself in a similar predicament during a U.S. President’s visit overseas. A Beast carrying President George W. Bush broke down in Rome, Italy, in 2007. As is seen in the video below, the President was quickly moved into one of the alternate Beasts in the motorcade. In 2011, during Obama’s visit to Ireland that year, one of these limos got stuck on a ramp while leaving at the U.S. Embassy in Dublin. Another Beast ended up on the back of a tow truck in Israel in 2013 while Obama was visiting that country, reportedly after another case of someone filling it with diesel instead of gasoline. Still, Gage’s recollections about the Mumbai trip offer a fascinating window into the more mundane trials and tribulations of the presidential motorcade.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 5, 2021",Trucks Get Parked Over Air Force Nuclear Missile Silos During Tests… Just In Case,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s latest Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system test at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, included a semi-truck parked over the silo, an added precaution to absolutely rule out an accidental launch. This seemingly crude measure is a routine part of these ICBM tests, codenamed Giant Pace, which evaluates the reliability of the land-based leg of the U.S. nuclear triad. One of the most recent such tests, which are referred to as SELMs, standing for Simulated Electronic Launch-Minuteman III, was Giant Pace 21-1. This took place at Minot’s Golf 8 launch facility on April 7. These take place every two years and run through the whole process for readying an LGM-30G Minuteman III missile to fire, except for the actual launch. After the launch command is issued, the key in the launch control center is turned, and the door to the missile silo slides open. At that point, the exercise ends. https://youtube.com/watch?v=u-SqmpzarKQ “During the SELM, we test everything but the actual flight of the missile,” said 1st Lieutenant Bobby Sarpong, a 741st Missile Squadron missile combat crew commander, in an Air Force release. “All the configurations are changed to capture information that lets us know the systems are working properly and would fire the missile in a real-world key turn.” “The SELM is a significant event because it shows that everything, all the manpower, planning, and execution of the processes, plus all the components of the missile site, work as they should up to the point of the launch of a missile,” said MSgt Donald Nelson, the Noncommissioned Officer in Charge of the SELM. Unsurprisingly, there’s a whole string of measures to ensure the safety of the SELM process, above all to prevent an accidental launch. A Minuteman III silo blast door after being propelled open from a missile launch facility and slamming into a 12-foot-high berm during a SLEM near Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Collin Schmidt To start with, more than 1,500 hours are spent on each SLEM over a seven-month period, from initial planning and preparation through to the test itself. Operational panels are replaced by test panels and the control and launch facilities that will host the test isolated from the others, forming what’s known as a “mini squadron.” In this way, real commands can be used in the exercise, without affecting the operational parts of the missile site. Personnel taking part in the SELM test at Minot Air Force Base on April 7, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Josh W. Strickland Thanks to this isolation, the commands sent will only reach the test launch facilities. Meanwhile, cables running to the missile’s ignition ordnance are disconnected and safing pins prevent the missiles’ first-stage motors from firing. As well as testing the cables, communication devices, and mechanical instruments used to launch a missile, the SLEM also verifies the reliability of the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) that provides a survivable launch capability for the Minuteman III from onboard the U.S. Navy’s E-6B Mercury Airborne Command Post . At the missile silo, a sand barrier is constructed to ensure that the silo’s blast door comes to a safe stop after being blown open. Blowing open the 100-ton door is a major event in itself, something that occurs only once in each of the biennial exercises. The sand barrier at Launch Facility Hotel-08, at F. E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming., U.S. Air Force/2nd Lt. James Tyhurst And then there’s the truck. Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, wrote on Twitter that this vehicle is parked atop the silo as an additional security precaution. Looking at photos of previous SELMs, the truck seems to be a regular fixture of these exercises. In case an ICBM was inadvertently launched it would presumably be demolished as soon as it impacted the vehicle, causing local destruction, but potentially preventing World War III or the mass death of innocents, regardless. There is also at least one instance of something similar being done in an emergency context as an added precaution against an accidental launch of a Minuteman III from its silo. In October 1984, Air Force officials parked an armored car on top of a Minuteman III silo at F. E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming after a computer malfunction lit up a warning light indicating that the missile was about to launch itself. “Security police did respond with a vehicle that was parked on the missile silo,” Major Fred Harrop, a Strategic Air Command spokesperson, told The Washington Post in 1987 after details of the incident emerged. An airman works inside the Minuteman III silo. , USAF “This is an available precaution until the source of the erroneous light could be determined,” he continued. “There is absolutely no way a Minuteman 3 missile could be accidentally launched… There was never any possibility of an inadvertent launch as redundant safety measures exist to prevent such an occurrence.” However, “Harrop could not explain why the Air Force took the precaution of driving a truck on top of the silo if there was no chance of a launch,” The Washington Post said in its 1987 story.

Note the dirt and sandbags in place to prevent the blast doors from harming nearby personnel., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Daryl Knee Placing the truck over the silo could also help ensure nothing falls into, which could have disastrous consequences , as much as to prevent a missile from leaving . Beyond these worst-case-scenario practical applications, the simple routine of having a truck located over the silo surely serves to reassure the minds of those dealing with a live nuclear-armed ICBM, as well as providing a highly visible signal of the safety aspects at stake during the simulated launch process. It should be noted that actual launch tests of the Minuteman III take place routinely, as well. These test launches are conducted from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, primarily to provide performance data and using missiles without any live nuclear warheads. Operational units do not carry out any live-fire launches during training. Regardless of the debate around the planned replacement of the Minuteman III, and the viability of Air Force ICBMs as a part of the nuclear deterrence strategy, it’s clear that tests of the existing system need to be as realistic as possible to confirm its functionality. The counterpoint to that realism is the level of safeguarding required to ensure nothing goes disastrously wrong, and it seems a truck parked over the top of the silo is an enduring feature of those safety measures.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 15, 2020",F-22 And F-35 Datalinks Finally Talk Freely With Each Other Thanks To A U-2 Flying Translator,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Five F-35A Joint Strike Fighters and a single F-22 Raptor “talked” with each other using their proprietary stealthy datalinks via a U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane carrying a specialized communications gateway payload, during a recent demonstration. This marks the first time that the Air Force’s two stealth fighters were able to exchange data freely in flight, something that has been years in the making . The U-2 was also able to simultaneously share information with assets on the ground and at sea, as well as with non-stealthy combat aircraft, all in near-real-time. That info was used to initiate strikes from ground-based artillery and naval assets as part of the high-stakes capability demonstration. This demonstration event was known as Project Hydra. The company’s Skunk Works advanced projects division worked together with the Air Force and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to carry out the tests. Elements of the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy were also involved. A U-2S Dragon Lady seen carrying a communications gateway payload during the Northern Edge 2017 exercise., USAF “Project Hydra marks the first time that bi-directional communications were established between 5th Generation aircraft in-flight while also sharing operational and sensor data down to ground operators for real-time capability,” Jeff Babione, Vice President and General Manager of Skunk Works, said in a statement. “This next-level connectivity reduces the data-to-decision timeline from minutes to seconds, which is critical in fighting today’s adversaries and advanced threats.” During this particular test, the F-35As and the F-22 carried out an unspecified set of tasks while communicating with each other using their Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), respectively. This included sending “target tracks … by and through the U-2 into the fighter avionics and pilot displays,” according to Lockheed Martin. A US Air Force F-22 Raptor, in the foreground, flies together one of the service’s F-35As., USAF All three variants of the Joint Strike Fighter use MADL, which is also slated to be used on the future B-21 Raider stealth bomber , while IFDL is unique to the Raptor. MADL and IFDL use distinct waveforms that are not directly compatible. So, during this demonstration, the U-2S, carrying what Skunk Works described as an “Open Systems Gateway,” or OSG, and as the “Hydra payload,” acted as the ‘translator’ between the two data links. At the core of the Hydra OSG is an “Open Mission Systems (OMS) compliant Enterprise Mission Computer 2 (EMC2).” The EMC2, colloquially known as the “Einstein Box,” is an advanced open-architecture mission computer designed to rapidly integrate new and improved functionality . The EMC2 computer., Lockheed Martin The MADL and IFDL systems are both designed to be low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) systems that enable F-35 variants and the F-22 to communicate while still remaining as stealthy as possible and their highly directional broadcasting concepts make them extremely difficult to jam. F-35s can send information to F-22s directly via Link 16 , a far more widely adopted waveform. However, doing so would increase the likelihood of an enemy being able to spot and track the aircraft via those emissions, which are omnidirectional and not very LPI/LPD in nature. This communications method would be of limited utility for connecting the two types of aircraft, anyways, since the Raptors cannot send information back out via Link 16. All told, MADL and IFDL being able to “talk” to one another, even via a gateway, is an extremely important capability and one that the Air Force has been pursuing for years now . A briefing slide discussing some of the general capabilities of IFDL and MADL., DARPA The Hydra OSG does also have the ability to transmit information across Link 16, a capability that was also a component of this recent demonstration. This would allow the F-22 and F-35’s data to become available to 4th generation fighter assets, such as the F-16C/D Viper , the F-15E Strike Eagle , or the Air Force’s new F-15EX Eagle II , for enhanced battlespace awareness. In addition, the Hydra OSG used a Tactical Targeting Network Terminal (TTNT) data link, also known as the Tactical Targeting Network Technology, a system first employed on the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft and that is set to be integrated into that service’s Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , to send information to nodes on the ground and at sea. Notably, the TTNT link enabled the U-2S’s communications payload to link into an Airborne Sensor Adaptation Kit (A-Kit) that was part of the U.S. Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS). Northrop Grumman is the lead contractor for IBCS, but Lockheed Martin is also involved in that program and developed the Airborne Sensor A-Kit. IBCS, which you can read about in more detail here , is a distributed architecture that the Army is in the process of fielding, initially for connecting air and missile defense assets, but which take a more general networking function for that service as time goes on. Project Hydra in fact featured a demonstration of the potential broader role for IBCS with the U-2S passing along sensor data from the F-35As to the IBCS Tactical System Integration Laboratory (TSIL) at Fort Bliss in Texas via this system. An infographic offering a very general overview of ICBS., Northrop Grumman From there, that information was used to carry out “a simulated Army fires exercise,” Lockheed Martin said. This is not the first time the Air Force and the Army have demonstrated how F-35As could cue ground-based artillery and missile units to targets deeper inside enemy territory. Unspecified “naval fires,” a term typically used to describe missiles fired from surface warships or submarines, using data sent via the gateway on the U-2S, were also carried out as part of the demonstration. “By leveraging both line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) datalink capabilities of the U-2, data can now be shared directly to tactical users and globally to command and control (C2) nodes like the Common Mission Control Center (CMCC),” Lockheed Martin’s press release added. “During this demonstration, both the CMCC and Shadow Operations Center at Nellis Air Force Base were able to view the sensor and platform data to enable situational awareness for operational command and control of highly capable air assets.” The Air Force has an expanding network of CMCCs, which are advanced command and control and data fusion centers. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are major components of the program, with the general goals being to speed up the flow of information and otherwise improve the overall efficiency of these centers, while also reducing the workload on individual personnel. The service has also stressed in the past that the CMCCs are particularly geared toward supporting operations “ in contested environments .” Basically, the idea is giving key decision-makers a God’s eye view of the battlespace and where the enemy is and where allied assets are, even stealthy ones, at all times. A view inside the CMCC at Beale Air Force Base in California., USAF The Shadow Operations Center-Nellis (ShOC-N), which is operated by the 805th Combat Training Squadron, is a “focal point for experimentation, rapid development, and test support for Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) technical solutions and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for the Multi-Domain Operations Center (MDOC) of the future,” according to the Air Force . JADC2 is the current term for a U.S. military-wide concept focused on integrated networking and associated capabilities, especially ones leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning . The Air Force, Army, and Navy components of that larger effort are known as the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) program, Project Convergence , and Project Overmatch , respectively. The Project Hydra press release specifically said that “this demonstration is another key step forward in Lockheed Martin’s support” for ABMS and Project Convergence, but did not mention Project Overmatch. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, the U-2S, and EMC2 have been deeply involved in open mission systems architecture work related to the CMCC and now the ABMS program, since at least 2014 . That year, a Dragon Lady equipped with a pre-EMC2 open-architecture computer conducted a test together with a prototype CMCC. In 2015, as part of a demonstration called Project Iguana , a U-2S was actually outfitted with IFDL data link from an F-22, among other systems, and helped pass information between one of those jets and Navy F/A-18s , as well as nodes on the ground, including a CMCC. Then in 2017 came the public debut of a U-2S carrying the Einstein Box during that year’s iteration of the annual Northern Edge exercise in Alaska, during which the plane served as a communications gateway. A U-2S equipped with communications gateway package at Skunk Works’ facilities at the US Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, in 2015. A special gold-colored antenna associated with that system is seen protruding from a white-colored section installed in the aircraft’s “Q-bay” payload bay., Lockheed Martin The U-2S’s participation in Northern Edge that year was part of a demonstration also referred to as Project Hunter and involved the plane acting as a gateway for F-22s to receive information sent from non-stealthy fourth-generation F-16C/D Vipers using Link 16. The Dragon Lady also demonstrated its ability to serve as a relay node to send new targeting information to weapons already in flight, enabling the retasking of an AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) after launch during the event. Then, in 2019, during a test known as Project Riot , the U-2S acted as a communications node, passing data about a simulated ballistic missile launch that an F-35A had detected to a CMCC. That information then got forwarded to other missile defense assets. The ability of the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) found on all F-35 variants to spot and track a ballistic missile launch had been previously demonstrated . A graphic Lockheed Martin released in 2019 as part of a public announcement about the Project Riot test., Lockheed Martin In the past year or so, Skunk Works, in cooperation with the Air Force, has also shown how the EMC2 computer can be utilized to provide advanced and novel capabilities with applications beyond communications and data sharing. In addition, Lockheed Martin, together with Northrop Grumman, Honeywell has been involved in a number of projects in recent separate from the U-2S to develop systems to allow communication between the IDFL and MADL data links. The most recent of these efforts is called gatewayONE and is part of the Air Force’s current ABMS ecosystem. The complete gatewayONE system incorporates technology derived from Northrop Grumman’s Freedom series of software-defined radios and the EMC2. “Freedom multifunction, software-defined radios are the heart of the F-22 integrated avionics suite and F-35 communications, navigation, and identification system,” according to Northrop Grumman . That company has been touting the potential of the Freedom 550, specifically, as a translator between IFDL and MADL since at least 2014 , when it demonstrated the ability to convert information from both of those into the Link 16 waveform. In addition, a December 2019 paper from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think tank in the United Kingdom, said that the latest configuration of the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) suite at that time also included a Freedom 550 radio “module.” The Air Force presently uses a fleet of manned E-11As , which are modified Bombardier Global Express business jets, and EQ-4B Global Hawk drones to carry the BACN system. In December 2020, the Air Force conducted a test of the gatewayONE payload , carried aloft inside a stealthy XQ-58A Valkyrie drone . Unfortunately, the service was not able to fully demonstrate the payload’s ability to translate between the F-22 and the F-35A that were also involved in the experiment due to technical difficulties. It’s unclear how related the gatewayONE system may be to the Hydra OSG payload, if at all, beyond that both of them utilize the EMC2 computer. From right to left, an XQ-58A, an F-35A, and an F-22, all fly together during a test involving the gatewayONE payload in 2020., USAF So, what Project Hydra, along with all of these other previous developments, really reflects is a maturing, increasingly expansive and robust battlefield networking ecosystem that goes far beyond just getting IFDL and MADL to talk to each other and using payloads on the U-2S to do it. At the same time, it is an architecture that, in its final form, should demand high-flying gateway nodes to ensure the exchange of all kinds of data over a wide area. This will be especially important when it comes to supporting stealthy aircraft, including swarms of drones, operating deep into heavily defended battlespaces. The Dragon Lady is, unfortunately, too vulnerable to operate in these kinds of denied environments and The War Zone recently outlined in great detail how these increasing networking requirements mean that it is all but certain that a secretive high-flying stealthy drone, commonly referred to as the RQ-180, or a variant thereof, exists or is being developed to fill this key role. A depiction of what the RQ-180 might look like based on publicly available information., Hangar B Productions The systems that Lockheed Martin has demonstrated in Project Hydra, as well as the various earlier experiments, are all notably centered more around open-architecture mission computers, rather than the planes carrying them. Lockheed Martin has stressed that the payload involved in this particular event is platform-agnostic rather than being specifically designed to work with the U-2S and only that plane. So, it not hard to see how these capabilities could be installed, at least in part, with relative ease on other platforms beyond the U-2S. As already noted, the Air Force has already been using the stealthy XQ-58A in tests of the similar gatewayONE system. While Project Hydra certainly marked an important milestone in being able to get the stealthy datalinks on F-35s and F-22s talking to each other, the program’s success also highlights progress on multiple fronts towards realizing a revolutionary future vision of data-sharing across the Air Force, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, during future conflicts.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 27, 2024",Top Aces’ Aggressor A-4s Are Now The World’s Most Advanced Skyhawks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Canada’s Top Aces advanced training provider, part of a growing field of private contractors offering “red air” adversary support , is equipping its fleet of A-4N Skyhawk jets with active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars and infrared search and track (IRST) systems. Photos at the top of this story and below show what is understood to be the first of these jets to be so modified and offer the best look at the planned configuration for these upgraded Skyhawks. Based in northern Germany, these aircraft are scheduled to begin training missions in their new configuration by next January. Details of the advanced aggressor A-4N were provided when the company announced that Berlin had renewed its contract for high-speed adversary air training services. Top Aces has provided these for the German Armed Forces for the last six years, using non-upgraded Skyhawks. Prior to 2015, the same jets were operated in this role by BAE Systems. Top Aces says it will also now invest over $81 million to meet the revised training demands. Former Israeli Air Force A-4N C-FGZT is thought to be the first of the Top Aces Skyhawks to receive the AESA radar and other modifications., Sven Neumann “As Germany’s trusted partner, we’re delighted to continue training its combat forces well into the future,” said Rolf Brandt, Senior Program Manager — German Operations at Top Aces. Brandt added that the contract renewal will add 20 news jobs at its German location. While the German contract covers training for air, land, and sea forces, as well as target towing, the addition of AESA and IRST to the jets reflects the requirement of the Luftwaffe, or German Air Force, to train against aggressor jets that better replicate the latest kinds of threat aircraft, many of which also have these capabilities. As The War Zone has reported in the past , AESA radars offer a significant boost in capabilities over similarly sized mechanically scanned arrays, including extended detection and tracking ranges, improved target discrimination and identification, and the ability to pick up low-flying targets with reduced radar signatures, such as cruise missiles. Without the need to physically move around a mechanically steered radar dish, AESA radars can rapidly scan huge volumes of airspace. At least one Top Aces A-4N has already been upgraded with the AESA radar and is now at the company’s German operating location at Wittmundhafen Air Base, which is within reach of extensive training areas over the North Sea, where the jets regularly spar with Luftwaffe fighters and other allied jets. The company declined to reveal the type of radar that’s been fitted in the jet, but there has been speculation that it’s either an Israeli EL/M-2052 or the Italian Leonardo Vixen 500E . As well as a different nose cone, the upgraded jet also features an additional GPS antenna on the dorsal ‘hump.’ Top Aces A-4Ns at their Wittmundhafen homebase. , Top Aces It is worth noting that BAe Hawk jet trainers operated by another red air contractor, Air USA, whose fleet we have discussed in the past , have also been upgraded with the EL/M-2052 AESA radar. Top Aces also already has a significant Israeli connection, having acquired its A-4Ns from Israeli Air Force stocks, followed more recently by ex-Israeli F-16A/B fighter jets, the first of their kind to be delivered to a private red air contractor. You can read more about the Top Aces F-16s, which are intended to help meet the huge U.S. Air Force appetite for contractor adversary services in this previous feature of ours. The Canadian firm is also understood to receive sustainment support for its Skyhawk fleet from an Israel-based company . However, the AESA radar is just one part of the upgraded Skyhawk package that will be used for training the German military, and potentially others, too. As well as being a requirement of the U.S. Air Force adversary air support contract , the U.S. Navy is also increasingly looking for AESA technology for the adversary aircraft it will train against in the future. A non-upgraded Top Aces A-4N at Wittmundhaven., Top Aces Since 2017, Top Aces has been developing its own Advanced Aggressor Mission System (AAMS), which is intended to be compatible with both its A-4s and F-16s. AAMS brings together the capabilities of the AESA radar and IRST system, with the result that the suitably equipped jets can “simulate the most advanced capabilities of modern-day opponents in air-to-air combat,” according to a news release from the company. It’s not been revealed how the IRST will be installed, but some kind of pod-based solution seems most likely. Should individual customers require other, or different sensors for aggressor training, AAMS is designed to support these as well. The AAMS has completed flight testing on the A-4N and has now been certified, meaning it can now be used for adversary training in Germany. While the local armed forces remain the highest-profile customer, Top Aces’ Chief Operating Officer, Didier Toussaint, told The War Zone that the company is offering its services to other clients both in Europe and North America, too. “We continue to look at the expansion of the rapidly-growing European market and will deploy the best fleet and capabilities in response to individual client requirements,” Toussaint said. As far as we know, the Top Aces A-4Ns are the first Skyhawks anywhere in the world to receive AESA radar and/or IRST sensors. In terms of situational awareness, they should provide a good match for many current frontline fighters. They will also be superior in at least some respects to the last Skyhawks still in actual military service, Argentina’s A-4AR Fightinghawk, and Brazil’s A-4KU . Argentine Air Force A-4AR Fightinghawk., Chris Lofting The A-4AR has a variant of the Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar , also used in early F-16s, while a handful of upgraded A-4KU jets are equipped with the Elta EL/M-2032. Both these are multi-mode pulse-doppler radars, but their mechanically-scanned technology is at least generation behind that found in AESA types. Other Skyhawks, minus AESA and IRST, are also operated by Draken International , another red air contractor, which flies them with AN/APG-66 radar. Another one of these companies, ATAC , has used A-4s in the past that were leased from Sky Resources . Top Aces did not disclose how many of its A-4Ns will be upgraded with AAMS, and that the number will be determined “in response to client requirements.” Currently, Top Aces has seven A-4Ns in Germany. Should it need more, Skyhawks are still available from Israeli stocks, with more than 60 examples being offered for sale as of last year, some of which were still in Israeli Air Force service as advanced trainers as recently as 2015. A Top Aces A-4N rolls out for a mission., Top Aces It’s also possible that some of the Top Aces F-16s — 29 of which have been acquired — or some of its 25 subsonic Alpha Jets could end up working in Europe, to support the growing demand for high-end red air assets there. For the German Luftwaffe, which is acquiring more advanced Eurofighters fitted with their own extremely powerful AESA radar , and potentially also F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft, and yet more Eurofighters , the requirement for a capable aggressor type to push its frontline pilots is clear. An A-4N in the colors of Discovery Air, as Top Aces was previously known, during dissimilar air combat training with a German Eurofighter., Bundeswehr/Stefan Petersen The company has also said it wants to expand its footprint in the United Kingdom, where an ambitious aggressor and readiness training program, known as Air Support to Defence Operational Training ( ASDOT ), was shelved in 2019. This would have covered a whole range of U.K. military training requirements, from air-to-air adversary to airspace battle management and live gunnery. All these requirements will now have to be met in different ways. The Skyhawk is far from new , indeed it first took to the air in 1954, but it has developed a reputation for reliability and efficiency. Furthermore, it is agile and presents a tricky visual target . The fact it can accommodate cutting-edge technologies suggests the Skyhawk still has a long career as an aggressor ahead of it.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2021",Remembering The Time Grumman Helped Craft A Modern Fighter For China,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Today, with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s ranks getting filled with indigenous J-10 multirole fighters , as well as increasing numbers of J-20 stealth fighters , the older Shenyang J-8 Finback fighter jet is increasingly a relic of a bygone era for the service. While the domestically-produced J-8 was built in multiple versions, the Chinese had already supplemented it with Russian-made Su-27 Flankers as soon as they could. However, for a time, the story of the mighty Finback looked set to be very different, thanks to the involvement of the U.S. defense giant Grumman. The story of Grumman’s involvement in the Chinese J-8 fighter program dates back to the normalization of Sino-U.S. relations back in 1979. That year, the U.S. government recognized Beijing, and not Taipei, as the legitimate Chinese capital, and a new period of diplomatic and trade relationships was established. This new reality also impacted the global arms market and China began purchasing weapons from U.S. firms, with official State Department approval. It’s for this reason that, even today, the People’s Liberation Army still operates a number of Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk utility helicopters, for example. A prototype J-8II marked up as the F-8II for export., U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE With Beijing now able to buy U.S. arms and benefit from its technological expertise, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) had the chance to change the fortunes of its J-8 fighter. The jet’s development had been extremely protracted, consistently hampered by the effects of Mao’s Cultural Revolution. The Shenyang J-8 had begun life back in the early 1960s as a project for a long-range, high-altitude interceptor. Conceptually it would be a scaled-up, twin-engine development of the J-7, which was the Chinese version of the prolific Soviet-designed MiG-21 Fishbed . Although design work began as early as 1964, and a prototype first flew in 1969, it wasn’t until the mid-1980s that the production-optimized J-8I was actually ready to be delivered to the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). By then, the aircraft was seriously outdated and only 100 were completed. One of the first-generation J-8s preserved in an aviation museum outside Beijing., Max Smith/Wikimedia Commons Work on the second-generation J-8II, also known as the J-8B, began in 1980 and was a major redesign of the original aircraft. The J-8II featured side-mounted engine intakes instead of the MiG-21-style nose intake on the J-8I, allowing for a large radar to be fitted in the forward fuselage. There are suggestions that some of the design features were inspired by the Soviet-made MiG-23 Flogger , a handful of which were acquired by China from Egypt for evaluation, at least one of which might have ended up preserved on the former Soviet aircraft carrier Minsk . The J-8II was first flown in June 1984 and, while offering an advantage over the fairly basic J-8I, it was still hampered by the limitations of available Chinese avionics, which lagged behind those found in Western and Soviet fighters. As such, the PLAAF was reluctant to place orders. It was during J-8II flight testing that Beijing began to look to the United States for assistance in making its fighter a more modern proposition. A formal military assistance program, overseen by the U.S. Air Force and nicknamed Peace Pearl, was subsequently initiated. The Air Force has long used two-word nicknames starting with the first word “Peace” for foreign military assistance projects, typically involving the facilitation of the delivery of American-made aircraft. In August 1987, the U.S. Air Force’s Aeronautical Systems Division placed a contract with Grumman to provide avionics upgrades for a number of J-8II fighters, between 50 and 55, depending on the source, worth a reported $502 million. The package was based around the same Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar found on early F-16s . Also included were U.S.-made inertial navigation systems, head-up displays (HUD) , multi-function cockpit displays, computers, and ejection seats. Accompanied by around 40 Chinese military officers, two of the jets were transported to the United States for tests in early 1989, where they were planned to be flown by U.S. pilots. At this time, the manufacture of the 50th jet was expected to be completed in 1995. The Westinghouse AN/APG-66 pulse-Doppler radar., Daderot/Wikimedia Commons While the avionics were to be supplied by the United States, weapons were the responsibility of the Italian defense industry, in the form of the Alenia Aspide , a beyond-visual-range missile, based on the AIM-7E Sparrow , with semi-active radar homing. A batch of Aspide missiles was delivered to China in the mid-1980s, where the design was further developed for surface-launched and air-launched applications. Prototype installations were planned for two J-8lls (presumably those that were shipped to the United States for trials), which were to have been delivered to Edwards Air Force Base, or perhaps nearby Mojave Air and Space Port , in California, sometime in 1989. At least one photo, seen at the top of this page, shows one of the J-8IIs in an anechoic chamber in the United States. These chambers , which deaden ambient electromagnetic radiation, are routinely used when integrating new radars and other electronic equipment onto aircraft, ensuring that the various emissions don’t interact negatively with other onboard systems. The first prototype J-8II. , U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE There are also reports of engine tests and ground tests at Grumman’s famous plant at Bethpage, New York, but no confirmed record exists of any test flights of the upgraded aircraft in the United States. An export version of the Peace Pearl upgraded J-8II was also developed, as the Shenyang F-8II, which was put on display at the 1989 Paris Air Show. Compared to the version of the jet being built for the PLAAF, these would have differed in having non-American avionics and weapons. The example exhibited in Paris was loaded with inert Chinese ordnance, as well. However, once tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in June 1989, Chinese cooperation with companies in the United States, and in many other nations, came to an abrupt end, with arms embargoes and sanctions rapidly placed on China by the U.S. government and the European Union. The U.S. arms embargo was enacted into law, effectively prohibiting the sale of all military items — lethal and nonlethal — on the U.S. Munitions List to China. Official confirmation of the cancelation of the Peace Pearl program came in May 1990 and the two unfinished airframes in the United States were returned to China. Ultimately, only around 60 examples of the J-8II were completed, between 1992 and 1995 — all without U.S. equipment. The People’s Liberation Army Navy J-8II involved in a collision with a U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II intelligence-gathering aircraft over Hainan Island in April 2001., U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE For successive, improved versions of the Finback during the mid-to-late 1990s, China instead turned to Russia and Israel for assistance in developing advanced avionics suites. Another key focus was on improved radars that could be used with more modern air-to-air missiles, adding a beyond-visual-range capability to the jets. The main missile in question was the indigenous PL-11 , which used a seeker based on that of the aforementioned Aspide. There are also rumors that the Type 1471 pulse-Doppler radar was based on the Israeli Elta EL/M-2034, while the PL-8 missile is clearly derived conceptually from the Israeli Python 3 . There was also an export-optimized F-8IIM offered with the Russian Phazotron Zhuk radar and Russian armament. A poor-quality but rare image of the F-8IIM., San Diego Air and Space Museum Archive The final and most advanced Finback fighter variant, the J-8F, took to the air in 2000, finally adding a modern glass cockpit with a HUD, as well as a new and more powerful radar. Once the production of fighter models had ceased, Shenyang continued to produce small numbers of specialist versions for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) and tactical reconnaissance. Today, a handful of PLAAF units still fly late-model J-8s, as well as a single People’s Liberation Army Navy regiment. The last of the Finback fighter versions was the J-8F, with Type 1492 pulse-Doppler radar compatible with the advanced PL-12 air-to-air missile., L. G. Liao/Wikimedia Commons Overall, however, the biggest winner of the collapse of Peace Pearl was the Soviet Union, and later Russia, which stepped in to become China’s top arms supplier. Chinese negotiations to purchase fighters from Moscow began in 1990, with Beijing selecting the Su-27 to become the PLAAF’s first truly modern fighter. China was the first export Flanker customer and secured a license-production deal, and has since produced a plethora of improved indigenous versions . The impressive strides made by China’s aerospace industry in the years since mean the Peace Pearl program is now little remembered. But it’s fascinating to imagine what might have been, had the PLAAF received a technological kickstart of this kind from the United States back in the 1980s. Just the thought of a Shenyang-Grumman fighter is mind-boggling to comprehend today.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to phantom aircraft that are the product of ‘bleeding-edge’ technologies and supposedly exist only in the shadows, the so-called RQ-180 is unrivaled in our time. The existence of this high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) stealth drone has all but been officially disclosed. Specters of its existence and growing maturity seem to materialize around every turn, and as of November 2020, the public may have gotten its first glimpse of this aircraft that has existed behind a veil of secrecy and innuendo for over a decade. This is the first in a three-part series—the product of a ghost hunt of sorts that has lasted well over two years—that tells the story—as best as we can piece it together—of what is likely the most important military aircraft of a generation. What is an “RQ-180?” First off, we have no idea what the exotic flying machine in question’s actual designation is. The name comes from Aviation Week’s original reporting on an aircraft that some of us had speculated existed for some time. The RQ-180 designation is simply a notional expansion of the designation of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works’ RQ-170 Sentinel . The two platforms are in some way complementary to one another, but the RQ-170 is definitely the older, lower-tier, lower-flying, more tactically-oriented, and less advanced of the two concepts. Both are flying wing designs. They are or certainly will be capable of integrating together, at least to some degree, but beyond that, they are not directly related. With that said, we need to start at the basics—what is this aircraft supposed to do and why does it exist? This is an impossible question for us to answer definitively at this time, and details are bound to change, in some cases significantly, but drawing on a large number of clues, open-source information, historical precedent, capability gaps, emerging technologies, ongoing procurement and development initiatives, the picture, at least as we see it , becomes somewhat clear. Notional RQ-180 concept rendering., Hangar B Productions As we understand how something like this would fit into a larger revolutionary air combat and networking ecosystem the Pentagon is quietly building out, the RQ-180 could be defined as a networking and reconnaissance platform that is capable of penetrating and persisting deep into enemy airspace. We are talking about a large, twin-engine, flying wing aircraft with slender laminar-flow optimized wings. Its overall design is largely motivated by highly advanced, broadband, all-aspect, very low-observable (stealth) requirements. It is meant to fly at very high altitudes in contested airspace, at or in excess of 70,000 feet, for very long periods of time without ever being detected. It’s important to note that while the reconnaissance side of its mission set gets all the attention, we believe the RQ-180’s potential ability to work as a high-flying networking node and information gateway is likely even more important, as we have touched on over the years . Let’s break these two mission sets down in regards to what this platform could bring to the table and why its capabilities would be so critically important. A high-flying, long-endurance, and survivable information gateway Just because you can build and deploy aircraft like B-21 Raiders , F-22 Raptors , F-35 Lightnings , and advanced unmanned combat air vehicles —low-observable (stealthy) combat aircraft that can work to knock down the enemy’s air defenses or sneak past them entirely to deliver devastating blows to critical targets—it doesn’t mean you can leverage these forces to their maximum potential. The F-117 Nighthawk , the world’s first operational stealth aircraft, provided next to no real-time situational awareness to its pilot. Literally, they were cocooned inside its stealth bubble , cut off from the war-torn environment exploding around them. Highly detailed computer-based mission planning, which was absolutely state-of-the-art at the time of its introduction, leveraged the latest intelligence and the careful execution of that plan was just as important to the F-117’s survivability as its stealthy design. This planning also included critically-timed pre-planned coordination with other assets, like electronic warfare aircraft , which F-117s crews had no control over during their missions. Once an F-117 pilot passed into contested airspace, it was just them and their mission plan, which by then was based on hours or even days-old information. Even two-way voice communications were all but non-existent once the jet was ‘cleaned up’ to maximize its low-observable cloak. The F-117, America’s first operational stealth aircraft, was largely alone over the battlefield, deprived of critical information regarding what was happening around it. , USAF It is important to remember that stealth aircraft are not actually invisible to radar, but can avoid detection as long as they remain at a certain distance from a particular threat. That distance is dependent on an aircraft’s stealthy design, its aspect in relation to a said threat system, and that threat system’s unique capabilities. This equation changes with the frequency that the threat emitter is operating on and the stealth aircraft’s ability to minimize its returns against those particular radar emissions. Thankfully, for most stealthy aircraft, the range difference between intermittent detection and the threat’s ability to successfully engage is vastly different. Today, electronic warfare capabilities, including onboard stealth aircraft as well as external to them , play a big part in their survivability. Regardless, fast forward to the present and the most valuable weapon one can have on an incredibly fast-moving modern battlefield is information and lots of it. Real-time awareness of threats that can pose a danger even hundreds of miles away can mean the difference between life and death. Information equals survivability and lethality Information in the form of battlefield situational awareness is now also key to the survivability of combat aircraft, and especially stealthy aircraft that will be operating in the highest risk areas. They need to know everything relevant that is happening around them so they can alter their game plan on the fly, which could include killing direct threats as they emerge or assisting other aircraft in rapidly finding and killing them before they pose a major risk to other assets in the battlespace. But there is a larger picture. The sharing of critical information across huge areas in such a way that it does not give away the positions of those connected to the network and being able to fuse huge amounts of data from disparate platforms and send it all over the globe are the keys to winning the future fight. This is extremely challenging to do with stealth aircraft whose radio frequency emissions can give away their presence just as easily as if their stealthy cloaks were suddenly ripped away. Past datalink systems that are omnidirectional in nature and were not developed for low-observable (stealthy) operations just won’t do. As such, new waveforms and datalink architectures have been developed that are highly directional in nature and use the latest in antenna technologies combined with low-probability of intercept (LPI) transmission methods to make them nearly undetectable and largely unjammable. Link 16, depicted in a very basic form above, is the most prolific datalink system, but it is not designed for low observability. While stealthy aircraft can receive Link 16 data if it is available, they have trouble broadcasting on it without potentially giving away their position. Other waveforms and networking architecture have been designed specifically for low-observable aircraft., BAE Systems The F-35’s Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) is the system that is being adopted not just for its originating aircraft, but also for the B-21, and likely other new stealthy aircraft belonging to a family of systems that will make air combat of the past look quaint in comparison. MADL can connect F-35s, and in the future, disparate stealthy platforms, together in a secure manner within line-of-sight via a mesh-like network. Just like any fighter datalink system that relies on line-of-sight connectivity, MADL is great for formations of aircraft that operate in the vicinity of one another, but it has major limitations. Namely, the battlefield of tomorrow will be expansive with massive amounts of data accrued from sensors in space, on the ground, at sea, and in the air, both on and over the battlefield and hundreds or even thousands of miles away, along its outer edges. While the F-35’s organic electronic intelligence-gathering capabilities are fantastic , and the B-21 will be even more so, they pale in comparison to being able to exploit data from a far larger array of dispersed platforms and intelligence sources, some of which won’t have MADL and won’t be within line-of-sight of stealthy aircraft with the datalink system. The F-35’s MADL system is incredibly capable, but it has its limitations., DARPA More importantly, it isn’t just a way-one connection that is needed. Being able to exchange information in both directions and have a forward operating stealthy platform help cue a weapon on a target when that weapon may be located hundreds or thousands of miles away will be another key to winning tomorrow’s war. For instance, an F-35 may detect a target of opportunity, or maybe even an impediment to its own mission, that is too heavily defended even for it or its available weapons to make a successful attack on it. A hypersonic weapon, located on a destroyer many hundreds of miles away, would not have a problem neutralizing it. The real-time targeting data acquired by the F-35’s sensors will be needed by the ship launching the weapon and even possibly piped to the hypersonic weapon as it makes its high-speed approach to its target. This type of remote launch concept is all based on seamless data sharing across a vast battlespace. Right now, that may be possible by ‘daisy-chaining’ MADL-equipped aircraft together in order to push info they collect securely back towards less contested territory, and data forward, as well. Once outside contested airspace, the MADL data can be passed to a very non-stealthy information gateway platform in the air, at sea, or on the ground, that can then send that information to other players in the battlespace and around the globe via a high-bandwidth satellite datalink. XQ-58 flying alongside and F-22 and F-35 during a networking experiment. The two fighter aircraft use unique and very stealthy datalinks that cannot talk to each other. While the Air Force is experimenting with tactical unmanned information gateways like the XQ-58 that will allow stealthy assets using different datalink systems to talk to each other within line-of-sight, it does not address the glaring beyond-line-of-sight connectivity issues and its capabilities pale in comparison to what an aircraft like a high-flying, long-endurance stealthy networking drone could offer. In fact, drones like the XQ-58 could leverage the advanced networking capability that an aircraft like the RQ-180 could provide to a more critical degree than their manned counterparts.  , USAF Unfortunately, this is a poor solution, at best, that has major limitations, and one that won’t work in a massive contested theater, like, say, the Pacific. It is also absurdly resource-intensive to connect along what is akin to a line-of-sight limited information chain made up of MADL-carrying stealthy aircraft that spans hundreds or even thousands of miles, before that information would be able to be sent to other battlefield assets and command and control centers. The same can be said for information being pushed forward from those rear-echelon sources to the stealthy combat aircraft downrange. And even then, the bandwidth would likely be limited, and above all else, such a chain would be only as strong as its weakest link—lose one relay aircraft and the entire chain could collapse. The “EQ-180” solution So, what’s the answer here? The logical one would be the ‘RQ-180,’ or more like an ‘EQ-180’ variant of it, but we will continue to call it an RQ-180 for simplicity’s sake for the rest of this section. The RQ-180, from its perch at very high altitude and deep over enemy airspace where stealthy tactical assets like fighters and drones would be operating below, would be able to collect that line-of-sight datalink data from systems like the F-35 and B-21’s MADL, and the F-22’s stealthy Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL). IFDL cannot talk directly to MADL, incidentally, but the RQ-180 could fuse the data together before redistributing it back to assets below in their proprietary datalink waveforms. This would give each aircraft a ‘god’s eye view’ of the battlespace with the inclusion of every player’s location, status, and relevant sensor data. This level of data fusion and connectivity drastically increases the fidelity of the info at hand in each aircraft’s cockpit or in each drone’s computerized brain, and thus increases awareness and cooperation, which in turn significantly enhances lethality and survivability. It also makes reliably connecting things like low-flying assets to the greater force a reality as maintaining a line-of-sight datalink with other lower flying assets in high terrain can be very problematic. What’s maybe even more important is that the RQ-180 would also be able to send all that data it collects around the world via high-bandwidth satellite connectivity. So, not only would this create a much more capable ‘active’ network with free-flowing information over a huge swathe of the battlespace, vastly improving upon MADL’s more limited mesh-like network capabilities and other less capable but still stealthy datalink systems, but it can also feed all that info anywhere in the world and receive and redistribute information over the battlefield from anywhere, as well. The concept of operations for a high-flying advanced networking aircraft that is capable of surviving in contested airspace that will enable the USAF’s stealthy air combat fleet has been around, albeit in a fleet manner, for some time. Here you can see a basic idea of how this would work, albeit in a very limited manner. Note it also shows the F-35’s daisy-chain setup. A B-2-like aircraft is also present, acting as a communications gateway, but those bombers do not have this capability today. So, in this graphic, it is likely a stand-in for something else—the concept we are discussing and very likely a critical role for the RQ-180 airframe., Lockheed Martin A similar, although a less advanced example of this general concept is flying today, but its mission is not about linking stealth aircraft together in contested airspace. In fact, it is entirely vulnerable to nearby enemy actions . What we are talking about is the Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN), a communications gateway payload presently carried by the EQ-4B variant of the Global Hawk and the E-11A , which you can read all about in this past feature of ours. Another existing datalink fusion capability is the Roll-On Beyond line-of-sight Enhancement system, or ROBE , which can be installed on some KC-135 tankers and enables an ‘active net’ for Link 16 and Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) used by legacy non-stealthy assets. It can fuse information from aircraft with those disparate datalinks together and rebroadcast a common picture back on their individual waveforms. Once again, this drastically enhances the situational awareness and cooperative potential of aircraft flying in the battlespace. The EQ-4B would be something of a non-survivable progenitor of an advanced networking RQ-180 derivative built for operations in contested airspace. , Northrop Grumman Acting as the ultimate force multiplier, a very low-observable, high-flying drone with a communications gateway package would also allow commanders thousands of miles away to see exactly what is going on with their ‘invisible’ aircraft fleets operating downrange over very dangerous territory. Once again, this would occur via relaying a completely fused ‘picture’ of the battlefield collected through all the assets the RQ-180 is connected to. It would also allow those commanders to make changes to the battleplan in real-time, piping down orders from around the globe via satellite to the RQ-180 and onto the stealthy players below via their own low probability of intercept datalinks. In addition, those stealthy aircraft could also take full advantage of all the real-time intelligence the Pentagon and its allies have to muster, regardless if it is collected by something with a stealthy datalink within line-of-sight of them or not. In other words, an RQ-180 networking aircraft would act as a two-lane information bridge of sorts, reaching far back outside of the battlespace to provide a god’s eye picture of that battlespace and the stealthy aircraft within it to key decision-makers, while also reaching forward, down to those same aircraft with far more information than they could garner on their own or via other aircraft in their own formations. The high perch of the RQ-180 would also provide for greatly increased line-of-sight distances compared to what the combat platforms operating far down below can provide via their own datalink systems. Supporting the swarm Taking it another step further, you can see how this capability could be critical for controlling swarms of stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) from thousands of miles away. We discussed that exact reality half a decade ago , and that requirement has become even more pressing as the era of large fleets of stealthy UCAVs is finally on the horizon . In fact, even swarms of munitions themselves and aircraft launched drones will need to be able to securely communicate basic information outside of their own swarm while deep over enemy territory or while flying at low levels where line-of-sight connections are an issue. An RQ-180 could provide these critical support capabilities and would allow even largely autonomous drones or swarms of munitions to retain some sort of man-in-the-loop basic control, such as approving targets for engagement or even just monitoring their general actions. Concept art showing a Lockheed Martin UCAV based on the RQ-170 design alongside an F-35A. , Lockheed Martin With all this in mind, in the most basic of terms, the RQ-180 could very well provide a highly secure active net over contested airspace, keeping those platforms operating within its line-of-sight connected together and connected to those in command and control facilities far away. As a result, commanders would not just be in the know, but also in control of the battle as it unfolds. The possible existence of an RQ-180 information gateway also lessens the need to install advanced satellite communications terminals on smaller tactical assets, and the concerns over network security and stealthiness that go with that. By distributing the high-bandwidth satellite capabilities to a networking and communications gateway orbiting high above, it will also allow for the production of lower-cost, higher-performance, and more survivable tactical aircraft. On the unmanned swarm side of things, we established in great detail how the idea of creating a single vehicle with every capability, like how modern fighter aircraft are traditionally configured, is a dead way of thinking years ago . That notion has only become that much more clear as the years have gone by. Instead of say two drones in a swarm of a dozen needing to carry a major satcom system, maybe none would require it with an RQ-180 overhead. Simpler satellite links for sending very basic information and commands could be used as a backup on those aircraft, nothing more. The future of air combat will be increasingly unmanned, which will put a massive premium on downrange survivable networking capabilities. , USAF video screencap When attritable stealthy drones are concerned, which are meant to be put in very high-risk situations where they could be lost, keeping high-end datalink hardware off them may be essential to maintain security over America’s best communications technology. The RQ-180 could potentially help with making this a non-issue by taking on the high-end side of the necessary communications architecture to operate these drones. A flying AI data cruncher Just dealing with the immense amount of data all these forward-operating assets will be able to collect will require an advanced central data fusion and filtering capability. This can be done by using artificial intelligence and machine learning to sift through all the information and pare it down to what is most important and send those curated data sets to different ‘customers’ around the globe and back down to its players below. For instance, what an F-35 could need in terms of battlespace information may not be the same as what a reconnaissance drone may need or a swarm of loitering munitions, so automating the distribution and filtering of this information would be key to make the best use of the bandwidth available and to minimize transmissions. This is even more essential in terms of sending all the information these assets collect around the battlefield to command and control and intelligence exploitation centers all over the world. Advances in computing and software technology now mean that this level of processing can occur on the platform itself . This is revolutionary as it means that satellite bandwidth will no longer be a primary limitation when it comes to distributing gobs of critical data around the battlefield and beyond. Simply put, the ability to sift through, filter, process, and redistribute piles of data onboard the RQ-180 aircraft itself would be just as revolutionary as its new high-flying stealthy airframe. Such a capability would increasingly allow for far more information to be crunched and delivered to those who really need it and as quickly as possible. This is not science fiction. The technology is already a reality and flying on tactical platforms today. The strategic nature of the RQ-180 working in the role of a critical networking node operating in denied airspace and the number of connected assets it would have to serve at any given time would likely make similar disclosed capabilities look quaint in comparison. At the same time, there is work being done to use ground stations far from an aircraft’s operating area to help crunch the massive amounts of data it collects, as well as data from other sources it may help relay. So this concept sees the data processing being distributed off-board the aircraft, but by centers that are built to deal with it en masse. This requires a lot of communications bandwidth, at least as far as beyond-line-of-sight connections are concerned, and an aircraft like an RQ-180 could potentially provide that. The U-2 Dragon Lady has taken a central role in helping to develop new concepts like offboard data processing and real-time software updates for combat aircraft in recent years. These are capabilities that an RQ-180 could provide to aircraft operating over the ‘hottest’ parts of the battlefield, something the U-2 cannot do., USAF In addition, the Air Force is also already working at sending live software updates and configuration changes for everything from ground target recognition algorithms to electronic warfare programming in near real-time to its combat aircraft operating anywhere in the world. The RQ-180 would be critical in seeing such a concept become a reality over a hotly contested battlefield where it would be needed most, providing assets under its purview with the latest changes sent down from command and control centers that are reacting to the battlefield in real-time, possibly in part due to the info the RQ-180 relays. Even ordering-up these changes autonomously from the RQ-180’s artificial intelligence-driven computing capabilities is a possibility. In other words, the RQ-180 could work not just as a high-bandwidth networking node and universal translator of sorts to deliver these updates, but also as the brain for helping aircraft with less computing power, such as swarms of attritable drones , cruise missiles, or electronic warfare-enabled decoys , make real-time updates to their software to help them better execute their missions. If you think this sounds far-fetched, it is anything but. Laser connectivity On the secure satellite communications side of the equation, a high-flying craft, with literally nothing flying above it, would be very challenging for an enemy to jam or intercept its communications, even if it were to use radio-frequency (RF) satcom links. What most people don’t realize is there is a near impossible to jam alternative to those RF datalinks that is uniquely suited for an aircraft just like the RQ-180. What we are talking about here is a laser satcom capability, which is not only extremely secure and jam-resistant, but it’s also very fast. Laser satcom terminals have come a long way over the years—for instance, Elon Musk’s Starlink constellation of satellites is set to communicate with each other based on a laser mesh-like network concept. Due to the heights involved with a HALE drone like this, it would be flying above any weather that could degrade its capabilities. In fact, pairing the RQ-180 with a high-bandwidth constellation like Musk’s Starlink, at least partially, for distributing data from across the globe, would provide incredibly resilient satcom capabilities even during a peer state conflict in which more traditional unitary communications satellites will be far more vulnerable to a wide array of enemy attacks . The Air Force is already leveraging Starlink for its future combat networking needs and is working on building out similar mesh-like satellite networks, including those for more focused strategic tasks. A stack of Starlink satellites prior to a recent launch. The black oval areas are the laser communications systems that will link them together in a massive mesh-like network., SPACEX It doesn’t have to be a distributed satcom concept like Starlink, either. More traditional satellite communications platforms would work too. The laser communications concept is the key here. Laser satcom systems are also extremely high-bandwidth, and are able to send huge amounts of data in small amounts of time. The bottom line is that the writing is already on the wall for this technology, the DoD knows it , and it is already being adapted for unmanned aircraft in the unclassified realm . So, considering how well suited this communications application is for an RQ-180 information gateway aircraft, we would expect it to exist, at least eventually, alongside established and emerging secure RF satcom capabilities . This would give the aircraft multiple ways of communicating beyond line-of-sight, which would be key for resiliency, survivability, redundancy, and for overall flexibility of the system. Greater potential While networking aerial assets clandestinely that are operating in contested airspace would be the obvious role for an information gateway-enabled RQ-180, other assets could also be networked along with them. This includes naval and ground elements that may be operating in or very near enemy territory. In fact, it’s key to consider that the nature of the concept as we described it is ‘customer’ and platform-agnostic, as far as what can be connected, although for within line-of-sight operations, the need for low-probability of intercept communications hardware may be limiting. Still, any asset connected to a larger, more common, and even less secure network could theoretically share or exploit information that is parsed and passed through the notional RQ-180. In other words, a ship that may be right below the RQ-180 may not have the right datalink to connect to it within line-of-sight, but it can connect to the larger network the RQ-180 is plugged into via its satcom system and connect or share data with the drone that way. That could be info from a standoff electronic intelligence-gathering plane sending electronic threat intelligence to F-22s that are loitering hundreds of miles away or a ship using data garnered from that same F-22’s sensors to target an SM-6 surface-to-air missile . Likewise, special operators on the ground could potentially use the RQ-180’s capabilities to connect securely with the submarine they deployed from, a drone carrying weapons in the battlespace, or a command element halfway around the globe, depending on the mobile communications hardware that comes available in the future. Such a system like the RQ-180, or a handful of them flying over the battlefield at the same time, as part of their data connection duties, could even provide critical navigational capabilities to its ‘customers’ below that may be cut off from GPS. You can read all about this incredibly pressing issue , here , here , and especially here . In fact, we can assume the RQ-180 will have one of the most robust navigational suites ever installed on a combat aircraft, including possibly long-established capabilities that work outside the need for navigation satellite connectivity in order to move about the battlefield with great precision. As such, they could potentially lend this relative positioning data to their surrogates below so that their own inertial navigation systems can be updated without the help of GPS. Some strategic assets built during the Cold War used star trackers for celestial navigation, which was akin to assured PNT (positioning, navigation, and timing) of the era. With the vulnerability of the GPS ecosystem that the military relies so heavily on, this is once again becoming an issue. The B-2 has a celestial navigation unit mounted near its left-side windscreen. Updated and miniaturized star trackers may find their way onto a new generation of strategic assets, such as the B-21 and the RQ-180, as part of a multi-source, resilient navigation suite., USAF So, with all that being said, a networking gateway RQ-180 would serve as the nexus between platforms operating in a contested battlespace and everything else, including those who are commanding the battle as a whole. In other words, we are not talking about another networking node here, we are talking about a technological linchpin that would allow for long dreamed of future combat networking concepts for operations in contested territory to become a robust reality. High-flying and deep penetrating strategic intelligence-gathering platform This mission is a bit more straightforward and what most think about for a platform like the RQ-180, but its lineage is very important to understand. The problem it addresses isn’t new, but the urgency in solving it surely is. Going back to the Pave Mover program of the late 1970s and 1980s, sensors were developed to track enemy movements on the ground with great precision over large areas and in all weather conditions. This was primarily achieved via ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) radar capabilities that were developed out of that program. Basically, GMTI allows for battle managers to see the enemy’s ground movements in near real-time and then quickly adapt their gameplan to avoid or neuter those enemy forces before they can attack or even pose a threat to friendly forces. Even during peacetime, GMTI has become a critical capability for detecting changes in force posture, documenting patterns of enemy movements, and identifying new potential targets of interest. Some of this intelligence collection and classification is also achieved via a different radar mode— synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This basically provides a satellite-like image of a target area using radar. It also has the ability to see some things optical systems cannot and it can work under nearly any atmospheric conditions, day or night. GMTI target overlay generated by the E-8 JSTARS aircraft., Public Domain On top of these functions, there is also a passive electronic intelligence collection mission that allows for radio frequency-emitting threats to be quickly detected and geolocated via onboard antennas and interferometry-based computing. You can imagine how using all three capabilities combined can be very effective. Basically detecting a target or target group of interest, possibly passively at first via their own RF emissions, then training an advanced radar with GMTI and SAR on it to rapidly build-up a high-quality understanding of what is actually going on far away. Then target coordinates can be quickly generated and weapon systems can be tasked with eliminating those targets. The Pentagon and Capitol imaged via SAR. , Sandia Labs GMTI, SAR, ELINT unleashed These combined capabilities aren’t just important for accelerating an offensive against an enemy force, they can be critical to saving friendly forces in the air, on the sea, and on land from running into an ambush. For fighter and bomber aircraft, the wars of the future will feature agile ground-based air defense systems that can pop up virtually anywhere and can shoot down aircraft over long ranges. As such, being able to watch over a huge area for these unpredictable threats will be essential. For instance, by seeing the movement of a peculiar set of vehicles on the ground via GMTI, then identifying it as a SAM system via SAR or ELINT, you can kill it before it even gets a chance to potentially threaten friendly forces in the air. Really, this intelligence capability is arguably even more critical for forces on the ground, basically allowing them to know what potential enemy movements are occurring in their vicinity or even staging for an assault some distance away. Also, being able to watch for changes in an enemy’s strategic posture via GMTI and SAR can be advantageous. GMTI and SAR were proven to be highly valuable during Operation Desert Storm when the capability made its operational debut in the form of the E-8 Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS)—an aircraft that was the main product of the Pave Mover program. It proved itself again over a decade later during the opening stages of Operation Iraqi Freedom , this time being fielded on a few additional strategic platforms, with the E-8 still being the centerpiece capability. GMTI and SAR radar capabilities have been improved upon greatly ever since and have become radically miniaturized and widely distributed to many more types of aircraft, to varying degrees of capability. The E-8 Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) was born out of the Pave Mover program and proved the value of its radar capabilities and more. But it was never designed to survive in contested airspace or against an enemy with a giant anti-access/area-denial umbrella., USAF Unsurvivable platforms with capabilities that need to survive The only problem is that when it comes to strategic, wide-area radar and electronic surveillance of this nature, the aircraft the U.S. military currently has to do these reconnaissance missions are vulnerable when operating even near contested airspace and they cannot penetrate into it whatsoever. The Air Force discovered this reality the hard way early on, literally 60 years ago, when Gary Powers was shot down in his U-2 Dragon Lady . This reality really hasn’t changed. Today, the U-2’s advanced electronic warfare system can give it some protection from limited enemy attacks, but it simply is not designed to weave its way into enemy airspace and persist there. The reality that a pilot is at risk is another huge factor. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, while eliminating the risk to the pilot, is a sitting duck outright . Both of these aircraft have the ability to collect SAR/GMTI, electronic, and optical intelligence, but from a relatively safe space. Other U.S. aerial standoff surveillance assets, such as the RC-135V/W/U Rivet Joint and Combat Scent aircraft, as well as the aforementioned E-8C JSTARS aircraft, are even more vulnerable and have dozens of souls on board. Now, package the latest low-probability of intercept GMTI and SAR radar capabilities, as well as passive electronic intelligence gathering capabilities, together on a very stealthy long-endurance airframe and perch that airframe way up above any tactical assets, say at 70,000 feet or more, and you have a huge line-of-sight to detect pop-up threats or otherwise just keep watch on the enemy’s movements over very long periods of time. The same can be said for image intelligence gathering using optical sensors, albeit to a lesser degree. While being able to peer into denied territory from the safety of international airspace is one thing, being able to do so right over enemy territory for dozens of hours a time would require less powerful optics, provide for enhanced resolution, and would allow for high-definition video streaming capabilities. Above all else, it would produce absolutely amazing intelligence. The current strategic GMTI/SAR ecosystem (U-2, RQ-4, E-8) is increasingly vulnerable to operations in a peer state conflict. , DARPA Slide So, the requirement is clear. You need something that can not only penetrate enemy airspace at high altitude, but also persist there for long periods in order to collect multiple types of high-quality intelligence. When combined, those intelligence products can offer an unprecedented level of fidelity. You can not only fly deep inside contested airspace to detect the enemy, but you can watch their movements over time without them ever knowing you are there. Think of it metaphorically as shooting an outdoor birthday party from 200 feet away and letting everyone know you are there doing so compared to recording it with an HD camcorder right amongst the participants without them ever knowing. We are talking about a quantum leap in the quality of intelligence being collected, not just a new platform to collect it. This type of capability was certainly a major factor as to why the Air Force decided not to buy another converted private or commercial jet aircraft to carry its new GMTI/SAR radar system that would replace the rapidly aging E-8C JSTARS. That platform would be near useless in a peer-state conflict today. The enemy’s anti-access bubble is simply so large that such an asset wouldn’t just be vulnerable, its capabilities would be irrelevant as the target area locations would exceed its line of sight and radar’s reach by a huge margin. The same is true for the younger RQ-4 Global Hawk program, which really just hit its stride. The Air Force has now said it wants to drastically truncate that program , making loose references to something better that doesn’t even officially exist—although we know that isn’t the case. Under recent plans, just a handful of the newest Global Hawks, the latest Block 40 models, would be retained, with dozens of the earlier examples being retired. Even the Block 30 examples were built to supersede earlier block aircraft that were either retired, given to NASA, or converted into flying EQ-4 gateways, as we mentioned earlier. Block 40 Global  Hawk., USAF Even the U-2 has been on the chopping block in recent years and could be again in the not-so-distant future. Once again, its replacement? Outright it seems like a murky hole of information. It’s pretty clear that the answer, at least partially, is that the USAF has something much more relevant, the RQ-180, and it is maturing into an operational state. This aircraft will be a key intelligence collection node using its own sensors, but it is also likely to also be the centerpiece of an ecosystem that will revolutionize the GMTI/SAR mission by distributing it across many platforms operating in contested areas of a battlefield. The center of a revolutionary GMTI/SAR/ELINT hub In reality, it isn’t like a notional RQ-180 would be the only replacement for E-8C JSTARS, most of the Global Hawks, and even possibly the U-2s, although one could easily argue that retaining a manned asset like the U-2 for a number of tasks in which an asset on the level of the RQ-180 is not needed would still be very important. By having the networking functionality being also part of the RQ-180 program, it can do what these other standoff assets can’t—support the distribution of aerial battlefield intelligence collection duties during a peer-state conflict. This distributed ecosystem is emerging as one clear aspect of the Air Force’s future radar intelligence-gathering strategy that is intended to work as a replacement for JSTARS and much more. Instead of one lumbering plane providing GMTI from far away, you can use all types of assets equipped with ever more modular active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars , including UCAVs and other drones, as well as stealthy fighters and bombers, or even in some cases legacy fighters with new radars and podded systems , to collect this data as needed from all over the battlefield. The Air Force is finally saying they will bet big on survivable UCAVs to replace the service’s MQ-9 Reapers later in the 2020s. This is in addition to other projects that could remain classified. These advanced unmanned aircraft will be capable of producing GMTI/SAR products on their own and feeding them across a network and on to command and control elements far away that will use the info to make critical decisions. An RQ-180 would not only add heavily to this mound of radar data but would also assist in conveying it from other sources to those who can exploit it. , Northrop Grumman This diverse array of assets operating over and beyond the front lines still needs to be able to transmit all the potentially actionable radar data they gather so that it can be leveraged by commanders in near-real-time. Once again, that’s where the RQ-180 comes in beyond its own utility as an intelligence collection platform. It could collect this data from these various platforms within its huge line-of-sight radius while operating over contested airspace and then filter and fuse it before sending it all around the globe for exploitation. As such, you can see how the two capabilities—networking and reconnaissance—are tied directly together for the RQ-180 concept. Just as an example, let’s say an RQ-180 is up over enemy territory, as well as a swarm of a dozen UCAVs, a flight of four F-35As, four F-22s, an RQ-170, and a pair of B-21s. Some of these assets can be tasked to use their own advanced radars to provide SAR mapping or GMTI of particular areas of interest, while the RQ-180 also collects this type of information on a far wider swathe of the battlespace. This type of coverage can be prearranged by sectors or based on other real-time intelligence that points to needing a closer look at a particular area or to help guide incoming missiles to their potentially moving targets. It can even be provided in a secondary capacity as part of an aircraft’s primary mission. For instance, a B-21 could map its target area for its own use, but also send off that SAR information it has already collected for further dissemination. After hits its target, an RQ-170 could fly in , take a SAR map of the target as well, and send it up to the RQ-180 acting as a relay that then passes it on to an operations center far away for bomb damage assessment. Even the RQ-180’s own wide-area mapping could help identify targets of interest for these other platforms to investigate. In doing so they could pipe their data over low-probability of intercept datalink to the RQ-180 so that it can be fused or even parsed and sent around the theater and the globe for rapid exploitation. You can also imagine how a flight of stealthy drones equipped with modular radars could make quick work of scanning a particular area cooperatively in very high detail. While they may be able to do this, they may not have the secure satcom link or processing ability necessary to send all that info quickly to whoever needs it. That would be the RQ-180’s job. In other words, yes, a reconnaissance-equipped RQ-180 should be able to collect GMTI and SAR and ELINT, and even possibly some image intelligence, if properly configured, like no other platform can, right over the enemy’s backyard. But its networking capabilities should also enable the distribution of more of that type of data collection to other assets all over the battlefield, resulting in far more widespread and more resilient radar intelligence-gathering capabilities than just what another vulnerable radar plane or Global Hawk, or even an RQ-180 alone could provide alone. So, we are talking about a revolution in how this battlefield intelligence is gathered, not just a new airplane that can gather the same type of intelligence, but in a stealthy manner. Onboard the E-8C JSTARS. The E-8Cs pioneered a mission set and filled the role well for decades, but they are some of the oldest 707 airframes around and their concept of operations is not well suited to the realities of tomorrow’s battlefield., USAF Evolution is key and the network is king Does all this mean that each RQ-180 airframe would need to be equipped for reconnaissances and to act as a full-on networking gateway at all times? Probably not. The complete networking package could be a modular system that can be fitted depending on the missions, or two types of Q-180s could exist, or are at least are planned to exist, much like what we have seen with the evolution of the Global Hawk—a networking version and a reconnaissance version. But no matter what, the aircraft needs secure satcom capabilities to do its basic reconnaissance mission regardless of its configuration, at least in most scenarios we see it being used. So, evolving a reconnaissance-centric RQ-180 into a flying information gateway variant, or to do at least some of that job while also performing its organic reconnaissance functions, isn’t just an extremely logical evolution, it seems to satisfy what is becoming among the Air Force’s most urgent priorities . In fact, even by the Air Force’s own standards , the advanced networking mission may now even be more important than the penetrating strategic reconnaissance mission as it would enable so many other aircraft that are flying directly over the battlefield to provide similar reconnaissance data in near-real-time. It would also do this while potentially drastically enhancing all those aircraft and other assets’ awareness and survivability, not to mention their connectedness to command and control centers and to other platforms on the battlefield and around the globe. Evolutionarily speaking, one could imagine how the first RQ-180 would prove the basic strategic penetrating reconnaissance functions, then enhancements would build on its ability to use its inherent advanced communications suite to pipe-out similar reconnaissance data that it receives from other aircraft operating within line-of-sight over contested territory. This would largely require just a passive “receive-optimized” type of arrangement and would not require the RQ-180 to provide data fusion and rebroadcasting services for the aircraft that connect to it. In other words, it would be just about conveying battlefield intelligence, not about creating an active network with two-way communications for stealthy assets over the battlefield. Then a full-blown and dedicated ‘EQ-180’ networking gateway could be developed that would accomplish all the aforementioned networking tasks, but may not have the organic reconnaissance capabilities of its progenitor. Another factor that is worth noting is that the same powerful and fast-scanning AESA radar arrays that would be the key component to this aircraft’s GMTI/SAR capabilities could also be used for high-bandwidth secure communications and for making electronic attacks on targets of opportunity or of a defensive nature. As such, the aircraft would have a latent electronic attack capability that could also prove hugely beneficial not just to its own survival, but also to the survival of forces under its purview over the battlefield. Communications wise, those same arrays could connect the RQ-180 with non-satellite nodes that are within line-of-sight, such as a ground entry point or one at sea, or even with a non-stealthy platform hundreds of miles away at the edge of contested territory. Finally, one of the wildcards in this whole equation is what capabilities will the B-21 duplicate, and to what degree? Still, even with the B-21’s yet to be understood abilities, which should be tailored to its core strike role, at least early on, the RQ-180 would only enable the B-21, and vice-versa. In fact, by all indications, the two airframes, made by the same manufacturer, Northrop Grumman, are likely very closely related and are designed to work together directly as part of a larger family of systems, including UCAVs, and to interface with other stealthy assets, from the get-go. Tying it all together Of all the indicators that point to the RQ-180 having a core networking mission, as well as a reconnaissance one, two publicly acknowledged Air Force initiatives may actually be some of the strongest. The first of these is the Common Mission Control Center (CMCC) program and the second is the Advanced Battle Management System (AMBS) effort. The Air Force has publicly described its still-expanding network of CMCCs as follows: “With the CMCC opening, it will provide combatant commanders, scalable, tailorable products and services for use in contested environments. Using software, hardware and human machine, the center will be able to manage C2 productivity, shorten the task execution chain, and reduce human-intensive communications.” … “The CMCC presents integrated and fused multi-domain and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance data to decision-makers and will use man-on-the-loop, artificial intelligence and machine learning to reduce human task load while executing its’ mission objective. The CMCC provides products and services and more advanced and inclusive than any legacy Theater Air Control System element.” In short, this is the exact kind of data fusion backend we have outlined already in this piece and that would demand a platform such as the RQ-180 to properly enable it to reach its full potential. The Air Force itself has also specifically said that this architecture is “designed for use in the contested, degraded environment,” which is exactly where the very stealthy RQ-180 is designed to operate. The CMCC project dates back to at least 2014. That year, a prototype version of this command and control architecture was demonstrated alongside other open-architecture mission systems that Lockheed Martin had led the development of in order to improve the U-2’s ability to act as an aerial communications and data relay node. Parallel work on both of these fronts continued for two more years. One test in 2017 showed how a Dragon Lady could pass along new targeting information to retask an AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) after launch, using a surrogate for one of those weapons. This is exactly the type of thing an RQ-180 networking gateway would be tasked with as we outlined earlier in this story. The CMCC at Beale Air Force Base in California., USAF Work on CMCC, as well as the open architecture mission computers able to carry new and improved airborne gateways to go along with it, has continued since then. Related experimentation has also included the demonstration of capabilities well beyond just basic data fusion and information dissemination. One can imagine what must be happening in the classified realm, based on what is being discussed in relation to these efforts publicly. Overall, the CMCC provides exactly the human interface and backend component for rapid exploitation of battlefield information, awareness in contested environments, and command and control that the RQ-180 would need to be paired with to get the best out of both concepts. A revolutionary warfighting ecosystem This is where ABMS comes in, too. Initially, ABMS had stood for Airborne Battle Management System and referred specifically to the proposed replacement of the E-8C JSTARS—which has a battle management function that works alongside its surveillance function—with another manned aircraft derived from a commercial design. When the Air Force canceled those plans, a decision publicly unveiled in 2018 in its budget request for the upcoming 2019 Fiscal Year, the current ABMS initiative emerged to take its place. Today, ABMS is a far-reaching Air Force-wide initiative encompassing dozens of named programs , ranging from artificial intelligence-driven software to hardware to actual flying vehicles , all centered on developing and fielding a distributed array of fully networked capabilities to revolutionize the service’s ability to wage war. CMCC is now also tied into the plans for this larger ecosystem. With all this in mind, it is interesting to remember that, in April 2019, members of the 427th Reconnaissance Squadron, along with personnel from the 9th Operations Group, Detachment 5, and the 605th Test and Evaluation Squadron, Detachment 3, were publicly involved in a ceremony to mark the opening the CMCC at Beale Air Force Base in California. Beale is the main hub of Air Force U-2 and the RQ-4 operations, and would likely be the same for the RQ-180, at the very least managing the in-flight portion of its missions, with the aircraft being based, at least initially, at remote locales. In October 2019, Aviation Week reported that the 427th was involved, at least on some level, in the operation of the RQ-180. Beyond that, Detachment 3 of the 605th Test and Evaluation Squadron is Air Combat Command’s central CMCC test unit and has also been supporting work on various efforts under the ABMS umbrella. That detachment has been linked to the testing and evaluation of the RQ-180, too. Beyond all this, it now seems clear that the Air Force has found a solution to their JSTARS replacement woes, but isn’t yet ready to openly discuss it. This would make perfect sense because the RQ-180’s surveillance and networking capabilities, combined with the CMCC architecture and the overall ABMS ecosystem, would not only satisfy the GMTI/SAR requirement to a significant degree, but it would also do the same for the battle management aspect. That is what CMCC is all about. Once again, this isn’t just ‘new and improved,’ the RQ-180, CMCC, and ABMS are about unlocking a potential revolution in battlefield surveillance, communications, and command and control. The bottom line here is that the CMCC, acting as a command and control element and backend data-fusion center for ABMS and for the battle occurring deep in contested airspace, outright demands an aircraft with the RQ-180 reconnaissance and the advanced networking capabilities to enable it. While the concept should still work in a highly degraded state without it, with it, it would truly come alive. The RQ-180 would act as a high-capacity data pipe and reconnaissance maven that also enables many other less capable tactical platforms that can also be used as reconnaissance nodes in areas where traditional assets cannot survive. In the future, the CMCC/ABMS/RQ-180 combo could be leveraged for controlling swarms of advanced drones and hordes of networked cruise missiles and loitering munitions, as well. In other words, it seems that the RQ-180 is the downrange component that would tie the ABMS and CMCC dream together perfectly, providing unprecedented reconnaissance products and a level of situational awareness and control over battles occurring in the most dangerous places on earth in a manner that would have been deemed science fiction just a decade ago. And we could very well be talking about a number of aircrft configurations, to provide surveillance, communications, and even potentially electronic warfare capabilities, not just one. With all that being said, even if you take what would be its most basic capability set described in this piece, it is quite possible that this shyest of aircraft is the ‘crown jewel’ in the Air Force’s future air combat ecosystem.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 9, 2021",The Marines’ New Unmanned Ship Killing Missile Launcher Truck Breaks Cover,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We now have our first look at an unmanned variant the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle armed with Naval Strike Missile anti-ship cruise missiles that is under development for the U.S. Marine Corps. That service confirmed that a test of this system, an important component of an ongoing and radical restructuring of its forces, had taken place in November 2020 , but no pictures were released at the time of the launch vehicle itself. Raytheon released the picture, which is credited to the U.S. Navy, of what is officially known as the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) on April 28, 2020. The company subsequently confirmed to Naval News that the image was from the test last year. The complete NMESIS system consists of the unmanned Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), also known as the Remotely Operated Ground Unit Expeditionary-Fires (ROGUE-Fires), and a launcher with two ready-to-fire Naval Strike Missiles (NSM) inside their self-contained launch canisters. Commandant of the Marine Corps General David Berger, at right, , USMC Two weeks ago, General David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps, visited with Raytheon about the program. Pictures, one of which is seen above, were posted to his official Twitter account showing the launch unit, but not mounted on a JLTV. “Marines + Ground-Based Anti-Ship Missiles (GBASM) = Deterrence,” the Tweet accompanying the images read. “Our Naval Strike Missile is a vital weapon for denying enemies the use of key maritime terrain,” Kim Ernzen, Vice President of Naval Power at Raytheon Missiles and Defense, said in the press release that went along with the new picture of the NMESIS system. “This test further demonstrates our partnership for advancing the Marine Corps’ modernization priorities of enabling sea control and denial operations.” Raytheon, in partnership with Norway’s Kongsberg, the developer of the NSM, has already been supplying those missiles to the Navy as part of an upgrade to both of its subclasses of Littoral Combat Ship . These stealthy anti-ship cruise missiles, which have a secondary land-attack capability and that you can read about in more detail here , are also set to among the weapons integrated onto the service’s future Constellation class frigates . Kongsberg also offers NSM in a ground-launched configuration. The NMESIS launch unit looks to be at least derived from that system, which is more typically seen mounted on larger tactical trucks , as in the video below. There remain limited details about the underlying ROGUE-Fires vehicle, which looks to use a largely unmodified 4×4 JLTV chassis and retains that vehicle’s hood over the front-mounted engine, but dispenses with the cab and the standard rear body arrangement. in 2015, the JTLV won a competition to become the replacement for the iconic Humvee in the U.S. Army and Marines Corps. These vehicles, which come in various configurations, including armed versions and light utility types, are now starting to replace those older Cold War-era 4x4s elsewhere across the U.S. military. US Marine Corps JLTVs., USMC We don’t know yet the extent of ROGUE-Fires’ unmanned capabilities, such as whether or not it is simply remote-controlled by personnel on the ground or if it can operate in some kind of tethered, semi-autonomous mode where it could follow manned vehicles or dismounted personnel, or how close operators might need to be to the vehicles in either case. It’s similarly unclear whether it has more robust autonomous capabilities or if the Marines plan to add in that kind of functionality in the future. Oshkosh, which makes the JLTV, has already worked with the Marines, in cooperation with the Navy, in the past on driverless versions of other light tactical vehicles and trucks. As a general concept, unmanned launch vehicles, networked together and with other offboard assets , could enable smaller units to bring significant strike capability to bear across a relatively broad area. At the same time, it could enable the launchers and their operators to be positioned in a more distributed manner, and be more readily able to move from one location to another, increasing their flexibility while also reducing their vulnerability to counterattacks. The U.S. Army is presently exploring the possibility of using unmanned launchers for its future Precision Strike Missiles (PrSM) for the same reasons. It’s also important to point out that the Marines have, at least in the past, planned to use ROGUE-Fires vehicle as a launch platform for various kinds of munitions. The first artwork of the system that emerged in 2018 showed it fitted with a version of the launcher found on the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which is capable of firing 227mm guided artillery rockets and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles. The Army plans to use that same launcher to fire the PrSM, too. Separately, the Marine Corps is also looking to field larger, longer-range missiles than NSM, such as the Tomahawk cruise missile , using ground-based launchers. For the Marines, these new ground-based missile capabilities are all part of the underlying concepts of operation driving its Force Design 2030 restructuring initiative, which you can read more about here and here , respectively. The basic idea is to be able to rapidly deploy groups of Marines to establish forward bases across a broad area of operations, such as on islands in the Pacific region , and then be able to just as quickly reposition as the needs of the battlespace change. From these bases, Marines will also be able to help deter hostile or potentially hostile forces from entering certain adjacent “seaspaces,” as was highlighted in the Tweet about GBASMs from General Berger earlier this month. If their sheer presence fails to ward off an opponent, they would then be well-positioned to engage them directly. The Marines are still very much refining those concepts of operation and exactly how they plan to implement them. However the Marine Corps is structured by the end of the decade and how it sees its roles and missions, the service is pushing ahead with plans to make unmanned trucks carrying missile launchers a part of that future.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 26, 2019",Does Spending Nearly $18B On A Few Dozen New ICBM Interceptors Even Make Sense Strategically?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office, or CAPE, has estimated that it will cost $17.7 billion to develop, field, and sustain the Next Generation Interceptor, or NGI. This includes billions to build just 21 NGIs, which will each have a price tag of at least $74 million, and maybe more, depending on the exact breakdown of the program’s funding. This weapon is set to replace the existing Ground-Based Interceptor , or GBI, within the U.S. military’s Ground-based Midcourse Defense missile defense system, or GMD. This system is meant to help protect the United States against limited intercontinental ballistic missile strikes , especially those that could originate from “rogue nations,” such as North Korea or Iran . However, the size and scope of the NGI effort raise questions about whether it, even in the context of the broader U.S. missile defense architecture, makes strategic sense. Bloomberg was the first to report on the CAPE cost estimate for the NGI program. The Missile Defense Agency MDA awarded development contracts to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman , which are working on their designs together with Raytheon and Aerojet Rocketdyne, respectively, in March. Those deals have a combined value of up to $1.6 billion through the 2022 Fiscal Year. A third proposal from Boeing and General Atomics was not selected. A Ground-Based Interceptor., US Army Bloomberg reported that the CAPE review said that the total combined cost of these development phase contracts could rise to $13.1 billion through 2026, when a “critical design review” could lead MDA to downselect to a single winning design. The NGI program would then move on to a production phase that could see the selected contractor building up to 31 interceptors, 10 of which would be set aside for tests, with the remaining 21 hopefully starting to be deployed operationally by 2028. NGI’s production phase could cost around $2.3 billion, according to CAPE, with a long-term support deal for the interceptors adding another $2.3 billion to the overall program total. $13.1 billion is already greater than MDA’s own initial cost estimate for the NGI program, which was $11.3 billion, according to a report that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, released this week . That report also said that the plan was to build eight interceptors for testing, not 10, and that one of the 21 “tactical NGIs” would also be made available for tests. The report from Bloomberg said that the unit cost of each interceptor would be a whopping $498 million. It’s not clear how this figure was arrived at, but it would appear to factor in at least some of the development phase costs along with the estimated funding for the production phase. Simply dividing CAPE’s estimate for the cost of the production phase across 31 interceptors yields an approximate unit cost of just over $74 million. This is still extremely high for an individual missile, but it would be in line with the unit cost of the existing GBI, which, as of 2018, was pegged at around $75 million . However, it’s not clear if the 10 planned test interceptors are included in the production portion of the program plan. If the $2.3 billion figure only applies to the 21 interceptors intended to be deployed operationally, then the approximate unit cost would rise to nearly $110 million apiece. Regardless, these are the most detailed cost figures we have for the NGI program to date. In 2019, MDA announced it would pursue this new interceptor rather than an upgrade of the existing GBIs, as it had planned. An infographic from Lockheed Martin on its NGI design., Lockheed Martin As it stands now, there are 44 GBIs deployed across two sites, one at the U.S. Army’s Fort Greely in Alaska and another at the U.S. Air Force’s Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. These are just a part of the entire GMD system architecture, which ties into a network of ground-, sea-, and space-based sensors and command and control systems. Each GBI carries a single Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV), a “hit-to-kill” kinetic weapon that is designed to destroy its target by smashing into it. As the GMD system’s name implies, the interceptor is intended to be fired at incoming ballistic missiles during the midcourse portion of their flight. This is a complex proposition, to begin with, given that it involves spotting, tracking, targeting, and then attempting to intercept those threats after they “go cold” in the vacuum of space, as you can read about more here . US Navy Admiral Cecil Haney, then head of U.S. Strategic Command, at center wearing glasses, stands behind an EKV at Fort Greely, Alaska, in 2015., US Army The EKV has an, at best, spotty track record in tests, with MDA’s current concept of operation being to fire at least two GBIs at any single incoming threat to increase the probability of a kill. In 2018, Boeing, the existing GMD prime contractor, leading a team that also included Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, won a $6.6 billion contract to develop an improved Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), as well as build more GBIs and an additional launch silo. The year before, President Donald Trump’s administration had proposed increasing the total number of GBIs from 44 to 64 . MDA canceled the RKV program in 2019 amid cost growth and delays due to technical difficulties encountered in its development, and after having already spent $1.2 billion, shifting focus to the NGI effort. The plan to add additional GBIs also appears to have been shelved. A key question, of course, is whether NGI will be able to actually demonstrate an improved capability over the existing GBI. GAO’s recent report on missile defense programs says that the first two tests of this interceptor against actual mock targets aren’t even expected to occur until the 2027 Fiscal Year. Those tests “if successful, would allow NGI production to start,” that annual review added. Many modern intercontinental ballistic missile (IBCM) threats already incorporate decoys and other types of countermeasures and continued work on missile defense programs, such as NGI, can only incentive the development of even more advanced technologies to defeat them. Beyond that, a force of only 21 interceptors, even fielded alongside at least some of the existing GBIs, is, at best, a low-density asset able to respond most effectively to relatively low-volume ICBM attacks. That, in turn, could push potential adversaries, even smaller ones, such as North Korea , to simply build more missiles to overwhelm the system. A slide from a briefing MDA officials gave in 2020 discussing the threat environment that GMD and other missile defenses are facing., MDA MDA itself seems fully cognizant of this reality. It has described NGI as just one component of a new future layered missile defense apparatus for the U.S. homeland that also incorporates an upgraded variant of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor, one of the weapons at the core of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system deployed via U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke Class destroyers and ground-based Aegis Ashore sites , as well as an expanded capability variant or derivative of the U.S. Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, among others. There are also plans to add a vast array of other new missile defense capabilities in the coming years, including new concepts for engaging hostile missiles while they are vulnerable in the initial boost phase of their flight, hypersonic weapon interceptors , directed energy weapons , and a massive space-based sensor and data-sharing architecture to help spot and track threats and cue defense to try to shoot them down. A vision for a “Missile Defense 2.0” architecture that MDA laid out in a briefing in 2020., MDA The plans to use an improved SM-3 Block IIA for homeland ballistic missile defense alongside NGI are particularly interesting given that the former interceptor is also designed for use against threats during the midcourse portion of their flight and has been demonstrated against an ICBM-like target. The Pentagon’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request showed a unit cost of just over $36 million for the SM-3 Block IIA, more than twice as expensive than the earlier, less capable SM-3 Block IB, but also around half as much, or less, of the expected price tag of a single NGI. At the same time, GAO’s latest review of missile defense programs has called into question just how effective SM-3 Block IIA might actually be against ICBMs. “According to MDA, during the November 2020 flight test named FTM-44, the SM-3 Block IIA struck a simple ICBM target ,” the report said. “This was not an operational test, however, and it was executed under highly favorable conditions.” The area that can be covered by an SM-3 Block IIA is also significantly smaller than that of the GBI and, one would expect, than the future NGI. For now, according to the newly disclosed estimates, the Pentagon is looking to commit nearly $18 billion to a successor to GBI. Still, regardless of any improvements that NGI will bring to the table, questions about the effectiveness of the system, especially a strike involving any substantial number of total missiles, are likely to persist. Even with a new, layered missile defense architecture, a peer competitor, such as China, as well as smaller potential adversaries, would have every reason to do whatever they could to significantly expand the size of their ICBM arsenals to oversaturate the system.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just over two years after Stratolaunch’s Roc air-launch mothership aircraft, the world’s largest aircraft, flew for the first time , it has taken to the air again from the Mojave Air And Space Port in California. The future of the plane after its first flight, and that of Stratolaunch as a whole, had been extremely uncertain due to the death of the company’s founder , Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . There had been fears that it could end up like the Hughes H-4 “Spruce Goose” flying boat, another wealthy industrialist’s dream, and never get airborne again. In 2019, however, new owners took over the firm and announced plans to shift the Roc’s primary focus from being a platform to launch payloads into space to one that would support growing demands for hypersonic flight testing. Stratolaunch’s Roc, the world’s largest airplane., Stratolaunch The Roc, which was designed and built for Stratolaunch by Scaled Composites , a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, lifted off from Mojave earlier today. The company had teased that a second flight was coming earlier in the month and had released pictures and video of the plane undergoing high-speed taxi testing on the ground nearly two weeks ago. Bad weather had forced the company scrub plans to carry out this test flight on April 19. Stratolaunch has not yet provided any specific details about its goals for this second flight, which, at the time of writing, appears to be still ongoing. A Cessna Citation business jet is flying with Roc as a chase plane. Regardless, after so much uncertainty, it’s exciting to see this massive and unique plane take to the skies again. As originally designed, the Roc was primarily intended to serve as an airborne launch platform for both expendable space launch rockets and reusable spacecraft, as you can read about more here . This general concept, commonly referred to as two-stage-to-orbit, and which other companies are also pursuing , offers certain advantages, especially in the flexibility of launch timing and location, compared to using traditional space launch rockets fired from static launch sites. As already noted, under its new ownership, Stratolaunch says its main focus is now on offering hypersonic flight test services. This makes good sense given the explosion of work on hypersonic craft , including designs with potential commercial applications , as well as weapons in the United States and elsewhere around the world in recent years . Roc’s ability to carry unusually shaped and outsized payloads makes it very well suited to this role. Stratolaunch, in cooperation with Calspan, is currently in the process of developing its own reusable Talon-A hypersonic test vehicle , as well. This new test flight of the Roc underscores that Stratolaunch remains committed to these plans to utilize the world’s largest plane to help support future advanced aerospace development projects. We will update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE, 3:10 PM EST: Stratolaunch says that the test flight has come to an end and that “all results are as expected,” but has not yet offered any specific details about the sortie and its objectives.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Oct 7, 2020",Russian Cruise Missile Spins Out Of Control Before Crashing Into Sea Near Launching Destroyer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has emerged showing a test launch of a Kalibr cruise missile from a Russian Navy Project 1155 Udaloy class destroyer going spectacularly wrong. The footage shows the weapon, which has been newly introduced to the warship, the Marshal Shaposhnikov, cartwheeling uncontrollably soon after launch. It then crashes into the sea, where it continues to burn, not far from the ship, leaving a boiling whirlpool behind it. While it bears the hallmarks of an official video, it was apparently leaked on the Russian Telegram social media network and was later posted to YouTube. Exactly when it was filmed is unclear, but Marshal Shaposhnikov recently rejoined the Russian Navy’s Pacific Fleet after receiving upgrades as part of a larger overhaul. Having returned to sea for post-refit trials last July, it conducted live-fire Kalibr tests from its newly installed vertical launch system earlier this month. Footage of a successful launch appeared on the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official news channel, Zvezda, on April 27. Both clips show similarities that suggest they could be from the same event. According to Zvezda , the maneuvers during which the missiles were apparently launched involved two groups of Pacific Fleet ships underway in the Sea of Japan, in early April. The live-firing drills, which included the use of both missiles and guns, were described as “a control check during the winter training period.” Originally completed in 1984 as a Project 1155 Udaloy class anti-submarine warfare destroyer, Marshal Shaposhnikov underwent a four-year modernization in Vladivostok that, in addition to the vertical launch system, added new guns and Uran subsonic anti-ship missiles, emerging as a true multi-role warship. Reportedly , more than 20 percent of the superstructure was also dismantled and rebuilt. Other new equipment includes communication systems, elements of the powerplant, and more powerful sonar. Marshal Shaposhnikov leads USS Vandegrift (FFG-48) during a Passing Exercise (PASSEX) in 2003, prior to modernization and reclassification as a frigate., U.S. Navy/ Photographer’s Mate 3rd Class Gary B. Granger The missile malfunction involves one of the Kalibr cruise missiles that were added to the ship as part of its refit. These are deployed from the 3S14 vertical launch system that has 16 cells for Kalibr family missiles, and which can also accommodate the Oniks supersonic anti-ship cruise missile and potentially the hypersonic Tsirkon cruise missile . According to available accounts, the missile variant in question is a 3M14T Kalibr-NK, examples of which have been used in the past by the Russian Navy to attack land targets during the civil war in Syria. Official video showing Kalibr cruise missiles launched from Russian warships in the Mediterranean against targets in Syria in 2017: The 3M14T, which carries the Western designation SS-N-30A, is a subsonic land-attack cruise missile, or LACM, with an estimated range of around 930 to 1,550 miles. It is understood to carry 990 pounds of conventional explosive or, reportedly, an alternative nuclear warhead. The weapon was first used in combat in October 2015, as part of large-scale Russian strikes against anti-Assad regime targets in Syria. On that occasion, the missiles were launched from warships in the Caspian Sea, around 1,100 miles distant, in what some officials saw as a piece of deliberate messaging to the United States and its allies. While misfires of this type, as well as other mishaps , are not unheard of for missiles of all types, and Russia is hardly alone in experiencing them , the incident goes to show the importance of thoroughly testing weapons in this way. This is especially true when they have been newly installed, as is the case with this warship. We should also be thankful that, apparently, no one came to harm in what could have been a much more serious incident.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 16, 2021",The Marines Are Already Ditching Their Young RQ-21 Blackjack Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps says it has begun the process of retiring all of its RQ-21 Blackjack drones as it shifts its attention to other unmanned platforms, including the MQ-9 Reaper and the V-Bat . This decision, which is part of a radical, service-wide force structure redesign initiative, comes despite the RQ-21s being relatively young and programs ongoing right now to expand their sensor capabilities. The Marines announced earlier this week that they had “initiated the divestment of all RQ-21 aircraft” in the first annual update on the service’s progress with the Force Design 2030 effort, which was publicly unveiled last year and you can read more about here . The restructuring plan includes scaling back or outright getting rid of a number of traditional capabilities, such as the elimination of all M1 tank-equipped units , in favor of a remodeled, lighter force with a renewed emphasis on expeditionary and distributed operations . The acquisition of new weapons and other equipment more tailored to these new concepts of operation, such as more capable drones and various longer-range ground-based missiles , is a key component of this initiative. A Marine prepares an RQ-21 Blackjack drone for launch., USMC At present, the Marines have around 21 complete RQ-21 “systems,” which typically consist of five drones, as well as various supporting equipment on the ground. These are primarily spread across three active-duty squadrons and one in the Marine Corps Reserve, with a smaller number also assigned to various training and test and evaluation units. The single-engine drone’s primary mission is intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, with a sensor turret containing electro-optical and infrared video cameras mounted underneath the nose. The Blackjacks are launched using a trailer-mounted catapult and recovered using another trailer-mounted system with a tethered hook that literally snatches them out of the air. They can remain airborne for up to 16 hours and have a maximum range of approximately 50 miles, depending on the exact configuration and flight profile. Insitu, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boeing, conducted the first flight what was originally known as the Integrator, in 2012, and the Marines reached what was described as an “early operational capability” in 2014 when they sent two of the drones to Afghanistan. That deployment, however, highlighted various issues , including quality control problems, which persisted for some time afterward. The Marines only finally phased out the last of their older RQ-7Bv2s, transitioning completely to RQ-21, as had long been planned, in 2018 . The service declared a full operational capability with the Blackjacks the following year. Since then, though, official reports had shown a high demand for these drones, especially in support of operations in Iraq and Syria. In addition, the Marines have been working to expand the capabilities of the RQ-21 with new sensor payloads and other systems. This has included work on the AN/PDY-2 Split Aces , a small radar with imaging and ground moving target indicator (GMTI) functionality, as well as the AN/DSY-4 Spectral Bat signals intelligence suite. There had also been discussion about developing a version of the Intrepid Tiger electronic warfare system that could fit inside one of these drones, as well as the potential to install communications relay systems and beyond-line-of-sight control and data links. Just last week, Logos Technologies announced that the Navy, in support of the Marines, had successfully conducted a flight test of an RQ-21 carrying the company’s Cardcounter ultra-light infrared wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) sensor. This 26-pound system, based on Logos’ BlackKite sensor, has been in development since 2019 in order to give the Blackjack a very powerful wide-area surveillance capability for its size. “BlackKite can detect and track in real time every significant target moving within a city-sized area,” according to a press release from Logos Technologies. “In addition, thanks to the WAMI system’s multi-modal edge processor—which can store six or more hours of mission data—users on the ground can also access recorded imagery for on-the-fly forensic analysis.” “No military in the world has anything like the Logos WAMI sensor on their tactical unmanned aircraft,” Doug Rombough, the company’s Vice President for Business Development, said in a statement. “This WAMI system views and records the entire area and can stream multiple real-time and recorded video ‘chip-outs’ down to handheld devices.” Especially with all this in mind, until this week, it had been unclear what the Marine Corps plans for the RQ-21s might be under the Force Design 2030 plan. There had certainly been some indications that this divestiture was coming, though. “Similarly – and understandably, in a force that was designed with different assumptions regarding threat and environment – there are some capabilities that I assess we are over-invested in,” General David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps, wrote in an overview of Force Design 2030 that was publicly released in March 2020. “A partial list includes heavily armored ground combat systems (tanks), towed cannon artillery, and short-range, low endurance unmanned aerial systems (UAS) incapable of employing lethal effects.” The Marines RQ-21s are not configured to carry weapons of any kind. Of course, various types of very small precision-guided munitions do exist and have been demonstrated on similarly-sized unmanned aircraft, such as the MQ-5 Hunter and the RQ-7 Shadow . “We need to transition from our current UAS platforms to capabilities that can operate from ship, from shore, and able to employ both collection and lethal payloads,” Berger had added in the Force Design 2030 document last year. “These future capabilities must be expeditionary and fully compatible with Navy platforms and command and control networks.” The Marines had conducted a first-of-its-kind exercise last year in which MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors moved RQ-21s, launch and recovery systems, and other associated equipment from a ship to shore. This was clearly meant to demonstrate how the system could be employed in an expeditionary context. It’s very possible that the outcome of that event helped inform the final decision to get rid of the Blackjacks. A Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey tiltrotor carries a trailer-mounted catapult used to launch the RQ-21 drone during an exercise in 2020., USMC Even before the debut of the Force Design 2030 plan, the service had been looking to reduce the operational footprint of the Blackjacks and improve their utility during expeditionary operations through the development of a kit that would give them vertical takeoff and landing capability . No such kit has been fielded to date. The Marines had already begun exploring more robust drone capabilities, including incorporating contractor-owned and operated MQ-9s into operations in Afghanistan, followed by the service starting to acquire its own small Reaper fleet . There was also an effort to develop a similarly-sized, but far more capable drone under the Marine Air Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System Expeditionary program, or MUX , an effort that has since stalled out. However, the MQ-9 requires more infrastructure than the RQ-21, as did the notional MUX designs. MartinUAV’s V-Bat drone , which the Marines been testing and evaluating since at least 2017, would seem to be a more direct contender, both in size and capabilities, for a platform to take the place of the Blackjacks. The V-Bat is an unusual-looking design that lands and takes off vertically and sits upright on its tail while on the ground. This allows it to operate from extremely confined areas—MartinUAV has demonstrated the ability of the drone to operate from the bed of a pickup truck, for instance—without the need for special launch and recovery equipment. It also boasts the same maximum range as the RQ-21 and has a modular payload bay that can accommodate various sensors and other systems, such as electronic warfare packages and communications relays, in addition to its nose-mounted turret with electro-optical and infrared video cameras. It’s very possible that the V-Bat could leverage work the Marines have already done on new sensor payloads for the RQ-21s. It’s also worth noting that contractor-owned and operated V-Bats have already supported U.S. Navy counter-drug operations since at least 2016 and, in 2019, the U.S. Army picked it as one of two types to test as a possible replacement for its RQ-7s, too. V-Bat is still in the running against three other designs to supplant the Army’s Shadows as part of the current Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) program. It seems plausible, if not probable that the Marines are exploring multiple options for an RQ-21 replacement, as well. Whatever shape the Marine Corps’ unmanned aircraft fleets take on in the near future, the RQ-21’s career with the service looks set to be relatively short in the end.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 4, 2021",Here’s What The Army’s Long-Awaited Super Air Defense Network Can Actually Do,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Army’s potentially revolutionary integrated air defense networking and command and control system carries the somewhat vague moniker Integrated Battle Command System, or IBCS. It aims to connect disparate sensors and missiles, but also potentially cannons, lasers, electronic warfare capabilities, and more (commonly referred to as effectors), across a battlespace to counter enemy aircraft and missiles. IBCS has had a long and somewhat tortured development , but now, after a highly successful test last August, it seems to be coming into its own and could finally move from a research and development effort to a production program in the near future. Its operational deployment would drastically increase America’s ability to defend its forces from all types of aerial attacks, and it would provide a fertile open-architecture command and control and networking environment that can incorporate fast upgrades and future additions of more sensors and effectors that are all tied together in a seamless and highly-automated fashion. We hear a lot about networks, computer systems that are weapons onto themselves, data-links, and sensor fusion these days. Often the real capabilities a system offers, or doesn’t, gets lost in an avalanche of acronyms and jargon. It all sounds more like magic and a good PowerPoint presentation than reality. Such systems are far harder to comprehend and even define than say a new fighter jet program, early warning satellite, or armored vehicle. This does a major disservice to something like the IBCS that stands to dramatically change the way the Army, and the joint force it is so deeply connected to, fights. As such, we wanted to cut through the muck and get to the essence of this system, including getting a clear view of its capabilities now and what it could be capable of in the future. With this goal in mind, we went in-depth with Northrop Grumman’s Kenn Todorov, Vice President and General Manager, Combat Systems and Mission Readiness. The resulting conversation isn’t just enlightening in regards to IBCS, but also in terms of better understanding the future of highly networked and automated warfighting. Here is that interview: Kenn: In our portfolio and my portfolio here with the company, we have the Integrated Battle Command System [IBCS], and I always… I hesitate when I say Integrated Battle Command System because until very recently, the Army was calling it the Integrated Air and Missile Defense, that was the I, Battle Command System, but now it’s shortened much… It’s easier to say, but for me, it’s not because for years I’ve been saying IAMD Battle Command System, but… IBCS is of course the Army’s program of record. They are our customer, and we’re very much in partnership and cooperation with them. We have been developing the system for nearly a decade now, and it really stems, Tyler, as I think you know, from the Gulf War with numerous fratricides in the battlespace, in the IAMD arena, particularly when the battlespace was just so complex that the warfighter was having difficulty weeding through important information and making decisions in real-time that led to some very unfortunate events. Since those days, we have been, frankly, hard at work, and particularly in the last decade, on a modular, open-architected system that… employs a net-centric integrated fire control network that enables the acquisition, identification, and engagement of air and missile threats of all kinds. And so IBCS is an exciting system, I think we’re very proud to work with our customer in the United States Army as they develop it, as they near a Milestone C decision this fall and enter into full production… Tyler: What capabilities does IBCS have today? Can you run down the list of what it can do and then juxtapose that as far as what in the future you’re hoping to make it capable of? We hear the acronyms and whatnot, and I think it’s kind of like, “Okay, yeah, I get it, you get a common picture. And it says it shoots down multiple things, provides multiple tracks, uses data links,” I think a lot of people’s eyes just glaze over. So, if you can give us the best top-down look at the system and how it works and what it can do, and then what you want it to in the future, that would be really helpful. Kenn: Great. And I understand the question and I also understand the tendency for people like me particularly to talk about it in this high-tech kind of way, but at its core, I think what IBCS does is simplify the battlespace for the warfighter. When you look at the complexity of that space and how it’s grown and the threat has grown in quantities and qualities, but also diversities, and now you’ve got all ranges of threats, literally from the surface up into the exo-atmosphere. IBCS as a system can weed through all that information, and then, based on its modular, open system architecture approach, it can really adapt feeds and data from any of the sensors that might be out there to include airborne sensors like the F-35, but radars, airborne sensors, sensors that are maybe maritime-based, and it takes that into a single integrated air picture. But then the really unique thing about the system is its fire control capabilities in that it’s able to then recommend—there’s always a woman or a man in the loop—but recommend to the warfighter which effector [such as a missile, gun system, laser, microwave system, even electronic warfare] might be best used against a particular threat. Whereas, before, you had sort of stoved-piped systems that were developed in concert with each other, but frankly, without much consideration to linking with disparate systems in the battlespace. IBCS can now, I’m gonna say it’s sensor and shooter agnostic in that it doesn’t care where the information might come from, it just wants to take that, fuse it with the rest of the data that it’s seeing, and create a really sharper picture for the warfighter to weed through some of those difficult circumstances and then make a recommendation on which effector might be best served to go after a particular threat. Courtesy of Northrop Grumman So, if I can give you an example of that, which I think was really remarkable. In the most recent limited user test, which we concluded… I say we concluded, to be clear, it’s the Army’s test, we were participating in it as their prime contractor. But on August the 20th and I’d refer you to the Army for specific details, but there was a cruise missile surrogate airborne and a theater ballistic missile airborne, and IBCS was doing its thing through a myriad of challenges presented to it, like electronic warfare, electronic attack to try to spoof it. It was able to ignore those attacks and pass tracks from different sensors to each other, and then it was able to recommend a specific Patriot battery to shoot a PAC-3 at the threat, and, interestingly, it didn’t leave the launcher… There was a problem with the effector that was going after the threat, and what IBCS did was say, “Okay, got it. There’s a problem there. I’m now gonna recommend this next best shooter to take the shot,” which it did. The warfighter acknowledged and took that shot and they splashed the target beautifully. So, in that situation, you had the system that was helping the warfighter think through the problem, seeing through a myriad of challenges like EW [electronic warfare] and low mass terrain and the cruise missile surrogate flying low while the theater ballistic missile was flying high. Sending solutions to the warfighter on which effector should take the shot once the weapons release authority was granted… Then when there was a problem, which, by the way, wasn’t part of the test, it just happened naturally in the system, the IBCS system recognized that and actually selected a different effector to take the shot, which it did and made the hit. So, maybe a long answer to your question, but that’s trying to simplify really what the goodness of a system like IBCS does, and was really proven, I think, in the Army’s test in the desert… For the future, as I mentioned, IBCS is clearly the Army’s program of record, and that’s a priority for us as a company. But the architectural framework that IBCS is built on this modular, open, software-defined, hardware-enabled framework, that can be applied in a number of different ways. It can be applied to… the Air Force’s ABMS construct , or… I know you’ve heard and written a lot about JBMS… I said JBMS, I meant the JADC2, the Joint All Domain Command and Control, where you’re having to now take what IBCS does and then sort of take that to a cross-domain kind of solution from all domains, to include space and cyber. So, I think the future of a program like this, and the thing we’re thinking very keenly on, how do we apply the architectural framework or the technology that IBCS is built upon. Ignore IBCS because that’s the Army’s program of record, but what the system can do might be applicable to others in the department, to other services, to even our friends and allied partners across the world. As you know, I think Poland is already on contract for IBCS. Other countries as well have expressed interest in it. So, I think, as this capability continues to mature, it’ll be the command and control system of choice, at least in the integrated air missile defense fight and perhaps in other areas as well. IBCS control during a major live-fire test. , Courtesy of Northrop Grumman And the last thing, Tyler, I’ll say… I think the thing I would conclude this with is the ever-changing nature of the threat is such that you need this open architecture system to stay relevant to the future, because if you build things in a stovepipe way and then new threats or new capabilities come along, be they hypersonic, be they, you name them, new UAS systems that are stealthy, etcetera, etcetera, you can imagine these different kinds of threats that show up. Now, if your system is closed and it’s never quite as good as it is the day it leaves the manufacturer’s floor and gets out there, and now there’s a new requirement for it, with IBCS or a system like it, you can continue to add capability through this modular openness. You can continue to add sensors every year or as new capabilities come around, new effectors to deal with those new threats. So, I think when we talk about the future, a system like this is very exciting because it’s extensible to that future. Tyler: When you talk about this being adaptable and open architecture, so there are quite a few different systems that have a similar, let’s just say brochure, but are not necessarily for the same thing. They’re dealing with different threat profiles, different domains of warfare, but they do similar sensor fusion, with some sort of AI built-in or at least high automation to help the warfighter actually make decisions or approve decisions. Do you see IBCS as being something that could be the system that links all systems or do you see it as one system that could plug into a system that links all systems? Kenn: Yeah, that’s a great question… I want to be careful again to distinguish the Army’s program, IBCS, with where maybe your question is going with this. So, it’s not for me to say whether or not the Army is offering this up to other services or if other services are interested in the Army’s program per se. But again, going back to the capabilities resident in the program itself, which can be applied in a number of different ways. I think the potential is there. I don’t see this as the end-all-be-all network for the end of time, but rather as a network that has acquisition, identification, and most importantly, fire control enabled in it that can plug into others for the basis of an architecture or for extending the architecture or for a different part of the domain space. For instance, shorter-range integrated air-missile defense. So, I’m not trying to say that this capability can be a panacea for all of the JADC2 desires out there, but rather, it certainly can, this architecture can be built upon, and I think it’s worthy of exploration about how far it can go. IBCS networking and C2 installation., Courtesy of Northrop Grumman Tyler: On the fire control side and actually on the identification and tracking side, too… There’s obviously ballistic missile defense, hypersonics are now gonna be the next thing, trying to counter that, which is a huge bag of snakes. And then there are the various traditional air-breathing threats that you’re dealing with today. What about the very low-end? What about the quadcopter or small UAS swarm and the very low-end side of the Army’s air defense puzzle, which, honestly, is looking to be the most troublesome in the years to come. Does this system have the ability to deal with that voluminous lower-end threat as well as the higher-end threats? Kenn: The short answer is yes, on the lower-end threats. In fact, it’s very much… I think as we listen to the customer and to the department talk about these challenges, the very challenges you kind of mentioned, we are doing a lot of work here at Northrop Grumman with regard to counter-UAS and how do we then take a kinetic control system like an IBCS, or one like it, and work in conjunction with some of the other kinetic and even some non-kinetic capabilities to deal with the problems that you just succinctly laid out. These quadcopters, these swarms of UASs… Our thinking is that this system is very capable, then, as I mentioned, any effector really, you can integrate with it. But we’re actually taking it a step further and some very specific capabilities we have resident within the company, and in the course of the next 18 months, we are going to be demonstrating some of those on ranges around the country. And we’ve got some… I can’t get into… I don’t think too many specifics today, but certainly something I can follow up with you on. But actually taking a system like an IBCS and linking it with a 30-millimeter cannon or with a high powered microwave capability or with some other kind of a missile capability and demonstrating the very thing that you’re talking about, sort of the low-end tactical fight. The other one that’s very much in the forefront of our mind is the Army’s DE M-SHORAD [Directed Energy Mobile Short-Range Air Defense System], which we’re involved in right now is to put a 50-kilowatt laser on a Stryker vehicle , and that program is in development. And, again, we’re one of two companies that I think are vying for that opportunity. DE M-SHORAD., Northrop Grumman We’re thinking beyond the laser platform itself, but rather, “How does that platform integrate then with the rest of the architecture or the rest of the IMD space?” So, that the data collected, either to or from the Stryker, can be shared with other sensors in the array on the battlespace, and then the old over-used cliche of one plus one can equal something greater than two, kind of incorporating that into the larger air picture. On the higher end, I don’t want to get too much into… I used to work the counter-hypersonics portfolio for the company, and I would say that, I’ll just leave it very quickly and say that, getting to some kind of a space-based capability for sensing and for the hypersonic threat is certainly something that we’re working with customers on, as well, and hearing loud and clear that that has to be front and center in trying to solve the hypersonic challenge. So, I think a system like IBCS certainly can link data and information from any number of sources, and the future potential of something like this is really exciting when we think about it. Tyler: When you say hypersonics, and honestly, we talked about all of this because any peer state’s going to layer a bunch of threats in at once, right? I mean, it’s not going to be a la carte, what we’re going to be facing in the future, as in one thing happening at a time and decisions are made, and an action happens. When you talk about hypersonics and you talked about very low-end threats and whatever’s in the middle that we’re probably more used to, time becomes the issue, right? How can the human being look at all that, figure it out, and actually put a countermeasure in place to stop it and do it thoughtfully? Do you see the system, obviously being monitored by people, but do you think it can operate automatically in a very high volume scenario?… Can you put that thing on automatic, and will shoot until there’s nothing left? Do you see this having that ability if it was needed during a peer state attack? Northrop Grumman Kenn: The platform does have that capability, Tyler, and I think that the tactics and techniques and procedures, I don’t wanna speculate on because that’s not mine to do, but the capability certainly resides, and how it’s put into action would be certainly up to the, as you can imagine, to our customers, so maybe they’d be best to answer that. But one thing I do want to mention that may be a tangent of the question you just asked, is this idea of long-range precision fires… We’re making investments today to broaden the capabilities of an IBCS-like architecture to further enable multi-domain operations, not only from a defensive standpoint, but to have the potential for enhancing capabilities like long-range precision fires on the offensive side, as well. So, I don’t want to leave you with the notion that this platform is strictly defensive because I think all of the goodness that goes into a system like an IBCS or an IBCS-like system is… Is certainly it’s within the technological capability of a system like that to then also be used to calculate long-range precision offensive fires as well, so it’s on offense and defense. We’re hearing a lot more from, I think, the department and our customers about the need to do that, and this system certainly would have that offensive/defensive capability, as well. Tyler: Okay, so I have two questions based on both of those capabilities, offensive and defensive. One is getting to the low observable [stealth] issue. Stealth technology is proliferating, we’re no longer just the only people that have this capability, especially in the cruise missile realm, not just on the higher-end exquisite aircraft realm. Being able to link all those disparate sensors together and look at a common picture… Does that also get you a much better fidelity target track? Considering it is made up of data from multiple sensors, instead of a bunch of federated sensors and systems, that may be data linked together to some degree, but that data is not so well fused? Author’s note: Simple English version of this question is can a networked and data-fused system like IBCS help spot, track, and even possibly engage stealthy aircraft and cruise missiles. Kenn: Yeah, I think you’ve obviously been a designer on the system, Tyler. I think you just nailed it, nailed the, really what’s at the acme of the fusion, without getting too technical, which I won’t try to do with you, because I’ll fail, but also it gets into some of the classified realm, which we certainly don’t want to do. But yes, in essence, you’re right, when you fuse the data from disparate systems, I think you have a lot more fidelity in the track. And that’s some of the, I’ll just say, secret sauce of this system is the ability to fuse that information into a more refined fire control track, which we have, very proud to say seven for seven in-flight tests, including last month where we, in two consecutive weeks, knocked two very sophisticated targets out of the sky with the system, it was a very complex scenario. And again, during the Army’s limited users test that we were a part of. Tyler: So, on the offensive side… The ability to take all that, kind of what we think of as a defensive capability, as you said, and migrate it to being able to punch the enemy, too… Obviously, there are some new interesting things that the Army is working on, penetrating airborne assets like FARA [Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft] and different capabilities that are manned, potentially unmanned, or optionally manned. Do you see a system like this or even this system in the not so distant future, being able to push its data out to those forward nodes that might be airborne downrange instead of on the ground next to some command or control capability, but they’re airborne and be able to rapidly respond to threats when they may represent the most efficient way to deal with those threats based on what’s nearby or what type of capability they possess? Kenn: Yeah, it’s a great question. And I think I would maybe comment on it this way. I think a system like this… And go back to how it’s built, it’s MOSA network-enabled , it can play a critical role in these emerging JADC2 capabilities, offense and defense-wise. And it has the capability to be extensible to integrate with other networks and C2 [command and control] capabilities that are out there. So, back to an earlier question about will this being sort of the be-all-end-all or will it be part of a larger network? I think it’s probably the latter. However, the example I always give and have heard folks talk about, particularly in recent weeks in an Air Force context… Is that you can envision a system like an IBCS that helps to link either pull or push or pass data from a ground node to a ship at sea or to an F-35 or to an over horizon Special Operations Airman that’s deployed somewhere far, far away. I think this system has the ability to do that. And so it can be extensible to other networks and systems and pushed far beyond its own capability for what the Army is going to use it for… If that maybe gets at where your question was going. Northrop Grumman Tyler: So the last question I have is about electronic warfare. And I know there are limitations in how much you can talk about this. But a lot of times when we hear “network, network, network,” there’s so many incredible benefits from it. And that’s absolutely clear and very well articulated by a lot of people… But what a lot of people ask is, what about vulnerabilities in depending so much on an integrated network. And with this [IBCS], you’re talking about really fast decisions, multiple sensors, waveforms, etcetera, etcetera. How do you guys look at the EW picture and the stability of such a system in regards to this, let’s say, threat? Kenn: Well, you’re asking some really, really great questions first of all, which I know are based on how you write and what you write about, you’re pretty well versed in the problem set, which is your job to do, so good on you. The EW issue, the challenge is certainly a real one. I guess I would refer you back to the flight test, I think on the 13th of August, when our customer recognized the same thing you did in your question and said, “Hey, we’re gonna put… We’re gonna really make this hard for the system to figure this out.” And, again, I can’t get into the specifics as you understand, but we made it really challenging and tried to bring down these connected issues that were holding together this network. And the system found a way out of it, it would recognize that it was under some kind of an attack or at least some kind of an incursion to prevent it on its most natural path to pass data, and it found a way to get around it. So, through other connections and networks, which was really, really impressive to see. And the really impressive part is it barely missed a beat. I don’t wanna get… I ask you not to put the specifics in if anything you’re gonna write about, but I will just say that in a matter of seconds… I was in the control room watching everything happen, I knew when the EW activity was going to begin and I could see through the sensors and the screens… It was temporarily made to be disoriented and pretty quickly was able to find another path and another channel to get the data where it needed to go and passed a fire control solution to a shooter, which took a first shot and nailed it. And that was eye-watering to me. PAC-3 Patriot missile. , US Army Now it’s not to say that that’s representative of every EW scenario that might be had out there, no, but I think it was proof that the system has the capability to work its way around problems like that, because those problems will exist clearly, as you said, particularly a conflict, a sophisticated conflict, threats are gonna come from all ways and shapes and sizes, from all angles, and it’s going to be very difficult, so these systems have to find their way out of these problems. And I’m really, really, really proud to say that the team and working with the Army, we found a way out of the one during the test. I refer you back to them for specific details on it, but just to paint a little picture of what I saw.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",F-15E Strike Eagle Smart-Bomb Transports Are Hauling Munitions Around The Middle East,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As The War Zone predicted, it didn’t take too long for the U.S. Air Force’s “bomb truck” F-15E Strike Eagle configuration to appear in an operational theater. Jets featuring the modified munitions carriage, allowing each to haul up to 15 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) of various types simultaneously, recently arrived in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) area of operations. The aim of the revised loadout configuration is not to put more bombs on targets but to bring larger quantities of smart munitions to deployed locations as part of the Agile Combat Employment initiative, or ACE, which seeks to enhance its independence from well-established airfields, which are increasingly held at risk by potential foes. The 494th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (EFS), the “Panthers,” completed the first of these missions for the type when six of its F-15Es relocated to Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, touching down there April 25 after flying from an undisclosed location — likely Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan. The unit is home-based at RAF Lakenheath, England, but had already been deployed to CENTCOM. One of the six F-15E Strike Eagles configured to carry extra bombs prepares to take off from an undisclosed location before flying to Al Dhafra, on April 25., U.S. AIR FORCE “These F-15Es are carrying what is called a ‘tac-ferry’ loadout,” explained Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Culver, 494th EFS Director of Operations. “What that means is we can maneuver using Agile Combat Employment, and be postured to go forward from a main operating base. This is the next step for the Air Force in Agile Combat Employment.” “The Panthers train for this routinely back in [U.S. Air Forces Europe], so we’re always ready to flex,” Culver added. “We have the ability to be unpredictable, and we have additional flexibility with multiple sorties worth of ammunition available. The Panthers are obviously pumped to be part of this.” “We were asked to come out and support combat missions with a very short turnaround, and with the bombs not being built previously here for us,” said Captain Jessica Niswonger, 494th EFS weapon system officer and mission planner. “By carrying more bombs than we’d actually carry to drop, we’re setting up the initial days of combat.” The concept of loading up an F-15E with extra weapons that can rapidly be delivered to forward bases was showcased in a proof-of-concept by the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), the “Skulls,” part of the 53rd Wing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, back in February this year. An F-15E loaded with six inert JDAMs on one side for a test at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida last February 22., U.S. AIR FORCE During that test, an F-15E demonstrated the potential ability to carry 15 JDAMs on a single sortie. However, on that occasion, only six 500-pound-class GBU-38/B JDAMs were attached to the Conformal Fuel Tank (CFT) on one side of the jet, in two rows of three. The top row of precision-guided munitions is new, although these bombs can’t actually be dropped during the mission. In the past, however, F-15Es have carried dumb ordnance on these same stations. Photos from Al Dhafra show the jets now carrying six 500-pound-class JDAMs on each fuselage side, plus four Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs) on the centerline station. The jet also carries the standard defensive armament of two AIM-120 AMRAAM and two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles under the wings. U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE The forward-deployed 494th EFS will begin flying air-tasking orders immediately in support of U.S. Central Command, making use of these additional munitions that are fully assembled and ready to employ, rather than having to wait for them to be transported by airlifted and then ‘built up’ in situ. A C-130 is still required to support an F-15E deployment of this kind, carrying personnel to arm and maintain the jets, but previously two of these transports would have been required for moving the same quantity of airmen and munitions. Reducing that burden would be a significant issue in a peer conflict, in which tactical and strategic airlift would already be at a premium. Of course, the munitions carried by the F-15Es could also be used by other aircraft flying combat missions in the same theater, an especially useful function for the fifth-generation F-22 or F-35 stealth fighters , which typically feature much-reduced offensive weapons loads compared to the Strike Eagle. U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE While we expected the tac-ferry loadout to first appear in the U.S. Central Command theater, it’s clear that the concept has enormous relevance for future deployments in less permissive environments, too. We have frequently reported on the U.S. military’s efforts to develop procedures for operating fighters from remote and dispersed locations, including rapidly establishing new bases . In the kind of conflict that would be fought against China or Russia, established airfields would very likely be destroyed or at least temporarily put out of action at the first opportunity, making these kinds of alternatives all the more important. In these kinds of scenarios, using the F-15Es to haul the weapons around is a good option, especially if they are already heading to a forward operating location. In this way, the munitions would arrive not only swiftly but in a ready-to-use configuration. Using the CFTs, or FAST packs , F-15Es could potentially carry other types of cargo, too, although there are currently no plans to develop this further that we know of. The Air Force’s latest F-15EX Eagle II will offer even better load-hauling capabilities, with a 28 percent larger payload and two more weapons stations. U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE In the meantime, the “bomb truck” F-15E configuration looks set to become a more regular sight wherever the Air Force’s go-to strike fighter is required.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 26, 2021",France Carries Out Unusual Ballistic Missile Test As American Spy Plane Looks On,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. France says it successfully conducted a test launch of an M51 submarine-launched ballistic missile earlier today from a land-based site on the country’s northwestern Bay of Biscay coastline. Online flight tracking software also showed a U.S. Air Force RC-135S Cobra Ball aircraft, which is specifically configured to gather intelligence about ballistic missile tests , flying near where the weapon’s inert payload was expected to impact the Atlantic Ocean north of Bermuda . Warning notices ahead of this test had indicated certain peculiarities, as The War Zone explored earlier this week, which had prompted discussion about whether this might have been a test of a new M51 variant or even a hypersonic weapon. The French Ministry of Armed Forces issued a statement on the launch on April 28, 2021, stressing that the missile was not carrying any live nuclear warheads at the time and that the impact area in the North Atlantic was “several hundred kilometers from any coast.” The statement confirmed that the test was carried out from the DGA Essais de Missiles, the country’s central ballistic missile test facility. It is very possible that the weapon was fired from a submerged platform there, which simulates a launch from a submarine and that has been used in previous M51 tests. France conducted another M51 test across the Atlantic last year, but fired the weapon from the Triomphant class ballistic missile submarine Le Téméraire . An M51 submarine launched ballistic missile during an earlier test., French Navy “This test was carried out … in strict compliance with France’s international commitments,” according to a translation of the French-language statement. “This shot, carried out as part of the M51 program, once again demonstrates the excellence of high technology that French industries are implementing in this field.” The videos below show older M51 tests from the submerged pool at DGA Essais de Missiles. French authorities did not say what version of the M51 was fired in this particular instance. They also did not offer an explanation as to why the impact area, as defined in navigation warnings for mariners issued last week , was significantly offset from the ballistic trajectory otherwise outlined in those notices. The unusual position of the impact area, combined with the use of a land-based test site, rather than one of the French Navy’s four Triomphant class ballistic missile submarines, had also led some to wonder whether a first flight test of France’s V-Max hypersonic weapon demonstrator , which is, by most accounts, an unpowered boost-glide vehicle design, might have been imminent. A key attribute of boost-glide vehicles as compared to more traditional ballistic missiles is their ability to make significant and unpredictable maneuvers while traveling along an atmospheric flight trajectory, which could have accounted for the offset path in this case. Beyond the French government’s confirmation that this was a test was in support of the M51 program, there are no other indications that the missile was carrying any such payload in this instance. The variants of the M51 that France has in service now are a Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) design that can carry up to 10 individual warheads on a single payload bus, also referred to as a post-boost vehicle . These are then released, pointed at different targets, during the weapon’s terminal stage of flight. Deploying the reentry vehicles at an oblique angle could indicate a test of a new capability of some kind. France is in the process of developing a new M51.3 variant, which will have a greater range than existing versions, along with other improvements. At the same time, publicly available information suggests that flight tests of that design could still be years away. The curious flight path could also be the product of more mundane factors. “This could be due to how close to the U.S. East Coast and shipping lanes that a nominal trajectory would take or because there is a specific aspect of their reentry-vehicles maneuverability or post-boost vehicle that they are testing,” Scott LaFoy, Program Manager for National Security & Intelligence at Exiger Federal Solutions and an expert on missiles, space, and nuclear weapons technology, had told The War Zone earlier this week. Whatever the case, the test appears to have been interesting enough for the United States to want to observe it. As was also the case during the M51 test in the Atlantic last year, a U.S. Air Force RC-135S Cobra Ball was tracked flying near the impact area. One of the Air Force’s three RC-135S Cobra Ball aircraft., USAF The Cobra Balls, including the RC-135S with the serial number 62-4128 that was spotted operating near Bermuda, have various sensor systems that allow them to collect imagery of ballistic missile launches, or warheads returning to earth , as well as associated telemetry data and electronic intelligence. There are only three Cobra Balls in service today, making them a very low-density asset that the U.S. Air Force has to deploy judiciously to meet intelligence collection demands around the world . It is also known that RC-135Ss have been used to gather information about missile tests carried out by U.S. allies and partners , as well as potential adversaries, as part of a standing intelligence-gathering operation nicknamed Olympic Titan. One of the French Navy’s Dassault Falcon 50 business jets, which are configured for maritime surveillance and patrol , was also spotted flying off the coast of the U.S. state of North Carolina, some 600 miles to the west of Bermuda, today. While we don’t know for sure if this aircraft was involved in this missile test, another one of these jets was also present during the 2020 M51 launch. This plane would be well-suited to keeping an eye out for any aircraft or ships deliberately intruding or accidentally straying into the impact area. The French Navy’s missile range instrumentation ship Monge , which is configured to gather telemetry and other data about missile tests, including ballistic missile launches, was also spotted leaving Norfolk, Virginia earlier this month. While its unclear where that vessel is right now, it was also involved in the M51 test in the Atlantic last year. Back in France, a French Air Force E-3F Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft was spotted flying an orbit to the north of the DGA Essais de Missiles facility. It would not be surprising that the French military would want to ensure that no unwanted guest flew into the launch area during the test. Only time will tell now whether or not any additional information emerges about the exact reasons for the offset impact area, as well as the use of a land-based test site in this instance versus a Triomphant class ballistic missile submarine.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 28, 2021",France Just Test Fired A Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile In The Atlantic (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The French Triomphant class nuclear ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) Le Téméraire test-fired an M51 submarine-launched ballistic missile in the Atlantic off of Finistère, France in the early hours of June 12th, 2020. Some sort of a test appeared to be in the works just three days ago when Le Téméraire was spotted sailing out of port with huge test instrumentation masts attached that are commonly fitted to submarines prior to developmental ballistic missile launches. Then, last evening, our good friend @aircraftspots began tracking a U.S. Air Force RC-135S Cobra Ball ballistic missile and rocket tracking aircraft flying out over the Caribbean. Not long after, a French Falcon 50 maritime patrol aircraft showed up in the area, indicating a launch was likely imminent. If the launch occurred off France in the Eastern Atlantic, the Cobra Ball was likely involved in tracking the missile’s midcourse and possibly its terminal phase to impact. The Falcon 50 may have been up to make sure the termination area was cleared of sea traffic. It’s also very possible that the impact or flight termination area was in another region altogether and this is just the vantage point the RC-135S wanted to get of the test. In that case, the presence of the French Falcon 50 maritime patrol jet may have been just a coincidence as they are a common sight in that area . Roughly similar to the U.S. and Royal Navies’ UGM-133A Trident II SLBM , albeit with a bit less range, the M51 was just introduced into service in 2010. An enhanced variant, the M51.3 (or version three), is currently in development. It’s possible, if not highly probable, that the missile tested was the M51.3. The Triomphant class submarine used for the test is the last of four SSBNs in the French Navy’s inventory to be thoroughly refitted to receive the M51. Globalsecurity.org describes the M51.3 as such: “The work on the third version (M51.3) were launched in 2014. The M51.3 is designed to maintain the capabilities of the ocean component facing the most severe missile defenses, which will enter service in the middle of the next decade [eg, about 2025] when the M51.1 ends it service life. The M51.3 program is a development of a new third stage of the M51 missile (M51.3) for commissioning after 2020, the current stage having continued from the previous generation M45. It will offer on the operational plan for increased performance.” It would be interesting to know if the Cobra Ball was recording the test on behalf of the French or if it was collecting intelligence on its own. Beyond potentially testing France’s latest and most advanced SLBM, which will represent the backbone of the country’s nuclear deterrent for decades to come, the launch also serves as a reminder to France’s potential foes that it possesses an extremely potent second-strike nuclear capability . Each Triumphant class submarine carries 16 SLBMs, each of which is capable of carrying up to six (possibly even ten) multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). Update: 10:15 AM EST— France’s Minister of the Armed Forces, Florence Parly, has issued a statement about the test launch, in French. The statement says, in part: The missile was tracked throughout its flight phase by radars. The impact zone is located in North Atlantic several hundred kilometers from all sides. This test was carried out without nuclear warhead and in strict compliance with France’s international commitments. This firing validates the operational capacity of the SSBN Le Téméraire ’s global weapon system and once again demonstrates the high-tech excellence that French industries are implementing in this area. The French Navy’s Chief of Staff, Admiral Christophe Prazuck, has also Tweeted out a message congratulating the crew of Le Téméraire , as well as other personnel involved. In addition to the aircraft monitoring the test, France’s Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) says that the French Navy’s missile range instrumentation ship Monge was also involved in tracking the M51’s flight. Monge was spotted docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico, last month.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 14, 2021",U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Enters The Tense Black Sea Highlighting The Service’s Overseas Presence,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Coast Guard cutter has entered the Black Sea for the first time in 12 years, underscoring a resurgence in the significance of the service’s presence around the world in recent years . The Legend class National Security Cutter USCGC Hamilton arrived in that important body of water less than a week after Russia claimed it had started to reverse course on a worrisome military buildup along its border with Ukraine. The flood of Russian forces into the region, starting in March, had prompted fears that a new crisis was imminent. Hamilton transited from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea, by way of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, on April 27. The ship left its homeport of North Charleston, South Carolina earlier this month and made its way across the Atlantic together with a pair of smaller Sentinel class fast response cutters, the USCGC Charles Moulthrope and USCGC Robert Goldman . A view from the USCGC Hamilton in the Mediterranean Sea on April 27, before the ship headed into the Black Sea., USCGC “This patrol comes after Hamilton conducted logistics visits to Naples, Italy, and Rota, Spain,” the public affairs office for U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Africa and U.S. Sixth Fleet said in a press release . “The U.S. Coast Guard is conducting a routine deployment in U.S. Sixth Fleet, working alongside Allies, building maritime domain awareness, and sharing best practices with partner nation navies and coast guards.” Hamilton is the first Coast Guard cutter of any kind to visit the Black Sea since the Cold War-era Hamilton class high-endurance cutter USCGC Dallas sailed into that body of water in 2008. At that time, Dallas had also been the last Coast Guard vessel to enter the Black Sea, back in 1995. It’s not necessarily surprising that Coast Guard ships generally don’t head into the Black Sea, which would be a very high-risk zone if a conflict with Russia were to break out. The Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet includes numerous full-size warships, as well as submarines, all armed with anti-ship cruise missiles, among other weapons. This is not to mention the country’s land-based anti-ship cruise missile batteries and combat aircraft capable of conducting anti-ship strikes based in the region, including in Crimea , which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. Those forces are bolstered by other anti-access and area-denial assets, such as surface-to-air missile batteries, including ones equipped with the long-range S-400 system . That Hamilton is the first Coast Guard ship to enter the Black Sea in more than a decade makes good sense, too. The 4,600-ton-displacement Legend class cutters are presently the Coast Guard’s most capable ships and are armed with a 57mm main gun, as well as Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) with a 20mm Vulcan cannon and various smaller machine guns. There has been discussion in the past about potentially arming these ships in the future with Harpoon anti-ship missiles, a capability that some Cold War-era Hamilton class cutters had for a relatively brief period between the 1980s and 1990s. These ships also have an AN/SLQ-32(V)2 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) electronic warfare suite and Mk 53 launchers loaded with Nulka anti-missile decoys . Mk 137 Super Rapid Bloom Offboard Countermeasures (SBROC) launchers can also launch decoy flares or chaff to confuse enemy radars or the seekers in radar-homing missiles. A member of USCGC Hamilton’s crew stands watch as the ship heads toward the Black Sea from the Mediterranean Sea. Part of the ship’s AN/SLQ-32(V)2 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) electronic warfare system is seen behind them. A Turkish Coast Guard patrol boat is also seen sailing alongside., USCGC The cutters have various radars and other sensors , along with a COMBATSS-21 combat management system, too. COMBATSS-21 is a derivative of the Aegis combat management system that is also found on both subclasses of U.S. Navy’s Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), among other warships , and will be a feature on that service’s future Constellation class frigates , too. Beyond that, the cutters have a rear flight deck and a pair of hangars, allowing them to embark helicopters. There is also a rear well area for the deployment of smaller boats. Hamilton ‘s visit to the Black Sea also comes at a time of heightened tensions in the region following weeks of Russian forces pouring into areas along the country’s borders with Russia, including in Crimea. Last week, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced the imminent withdrawal of at least some of those troops, who had deployed the region ostensibly as part of a snap readiness exercise. Other forces, however, will remain in position near Ukraine and the full extent of the purported drawdown remains to be seen. On April 9, with that buildup still well underway, Turkish authorities had disclosed that two U.S. Navy destroyers were scheduled to head into the Black Sea. The 1936 Montreux Convention mandates that countries that do not have a Black Sea coastline must give advance Ankara notice about the deployment of naval vessels in and out of that body of water. That agreement also puts restrictions on the total combined tonnage of warships belonging to non-Black Sea states that deploy there and how long they can stay. The Dardanelles and Bosphorus are both fully within Turkey’s territorial waters. However, Reuters reported on April 14, citing Turkish officials, that the Navy was no longer planning to send destroyers into the Black Sea. So, Hamilton is also the first American military vessel to travel there since the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Monterey and the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Thomas Hudner left in March. In January, two other Arleigh Burke class destroyers, along with a fleet oiler, had sailed into the Black Sea, triggering Russian anti-ship drills . Hamilton ‘s arrival did not go unnoticed by the Russians, either. “The Black Sea forces and means have begun monitoring the actions of USCGC Hamilton , which entered the Black Sea on April 27,” the Russian National Defense Control Center said in a statement , according to state-run outlet TASS . The Coast Guard cutter will no doubt keeping an eye out for any notable developments in the region while it is there, as well. Beyond all this, the rare deployment of a Coast Guard cutter to the Black Sea underscores a renewed appreciation for the service’s ability to conduct operations far away from America’s borders in recent years. This has included employing a Coast Guard cutter on a so-called Freedom of Navigation Patrol (FONOP), which the U.S. government uses to challenge controversial territorial claims, through the Taiwan Strait in 2019. Coast Guard ships have also been forward-deployed in the Persian Gulf for decades, but there has been more visible integration between them and their Navy counterparts in that region in recent years. Cutters have been notably involved in two altercations in the Persian Gulf with boats belonging to Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) just this month, including one yesterday where the Navy’s Cyclone class patrol craft USS Firebolt fired warning shots to ward off the Iranians. The USCGC Charles Moulthrope and USCGC Robert Goldman , the Sentinel class cutters that crossed the Atlantic with the Hamilton , are actually headed for a deployment to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. The USCGC Hamilton, in front, with the USCGC Charles Moulthrope and USCGC Robert Goldman sailing behind, in the Atlantic Ocean on April 1., USCG The Coast Guard, which has been conducting operations around the world for centuries now, is a branch of the U.S. military and can support military operations if called upon to do so. However, it has a unique legal status that also allows it to conduct law enforcement activities and it is situated within the Department of Homeland Security, rather than the Department of Defense. The value of greater integrating of the Coast Guard’s distinct authorities in Navy operations, as well as those of the Marine Corps, both in response to acute contingencies and on a day-to-day basis , was an important component of a new, overarching tri-service naval strategy unveiled last year. All told, USCGC Hamilton ‘s arrival in the Black Sea is significant both because of the current geopolitical situation in the region and as an example of the importance of the Coast Guard in U.S. national security missions around the world.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2020",Photo Emerges Of Shadowy Intelligence Gathering “Ghost Plane” In Somalia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For years, there has been very limited information available publicly about U.S. counter-terrorism operations in Somalia and the forces, based there and in neighboring countries , carrying them out. The repositioning of the bulk of American military forces out of this East African nation between December 2020 and January 2021, dubbed Operation Octave Quartz, highlighted those activities in a way that had not been previously seen. This has included the release of a significant number of what would have been previously been very rare pictures and video clips of U.S. personnel operating in and around the country. One picture that was recently released, seen at the top of this story, prominently shows what can be considered a “ghost aircraft.” The twin-engine Beechcraft King Air turboprop aircraft with the U.S. civil registration number N27557 was photographed at Baledogle Military Airfield , which is situated some 55 miles northwest of the capital Mogadishu. It was included in a group of images related to the deployment of elements of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) to the base, sometime between the last week of December 2020 and the first week of January 2021, to provide security and other support as American troops pulled out. The Pentagon announced on Jan. 17, 2021, that the repositioning of the majority of U.S. forces out of Somalia was complete . A US Marine from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit provides security from a guard post overlooking the runway at Baledogle Military Airfield in Somalia in January 2021., USMC Baledogle, originally built by the Soviets during the Cold War, has been expanded and transformed over the past decade or so into a major hub for the U.S. military, as well as other foreign actors, such as the United Nations, and elements of Somalia’s own armed forces. It was notably the target of a complex attack by terrorists belonging to Al Shabaab , Al Qaeda’s franchise in the country, between Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, 2019. Since the mid-2000s, Al Shabaab has the primary focus of U.S. operations in Somalia, though the country now also has a nascent ISIS-aligned group . A satellite image of Baledogle Military Airfield in 2013., Google Earth A satellite image of Baledogle in 2017, showing the significant expansion in the facilities there over the years., Google Earth A story from Foreign Policy in 2015 described the facility as a launch point for American unmanned aircraft and training site for Somali special operation forces. However, as is clear from the picture of N27557, as well as satellite imagery, manned fixed-wing aircraft, as well as helicopters, have also long operated from Baledogle. A satellite image of Baledogle from 2017, showing what appears to be a US Air Force Special Operations Command U-28A light fixed-wing aircraft at the base., Google Earth From what is generally known, fixed-wing aircraft flying from Baledogle have primarily been configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, supplementing unmanned aircraft in this role. While we don’t know N27557’s exact configuration, it has many features that are commonly seen on King Airs equipped for ISR operations. One of the most immediately visible features is the large dome on top of the central fuselage, which is typically associated with high-bandwidth satellite communications and data-sharing systems. There are also three platter-type antennas – one in front and one behind the dome, as well one on top of the aircraft’s t-tail – which are also generally connected to ultra-high-frequency satellite communications equipment. There are additional angled blade antennas that typically are linked to ultra or very-high-frequency radios on top of and below the fuselage. As for visible sensors, the aircraft’s configuration is much more spartan. Compared to other ISR-configured King Airs , N27557 lacks an underbelly equipment gondola and does not have a sensor turret carrying various kinds of full-motion video cameras under the rear fuselage. It’s hard to tell for sure, but there does not appear to be anything of major significance mounted externally under the forward fuselage, either, judging the by shadow. The aircraft does have a number of straight blade antennas underneath the fuselage of a type sometimes associated with systems to intercept enemy communications chatter, including from cell phones, or other kinds of signals intelligence. A closeup of some of the antennas underneath N27557’s fuselage. The straight ones are similar to those seen on aircraft known to carry signals intelligence systems., USMC A C-130 aircraft fitted with the Senior Scout signals intelligence package. Some of the antennas seen here fitted to the modified paratrooper door are similar to the ones seen underneath N27557’s fuselage., via Thinkdefence.co.uk More interestingly, it has an odd, angled system underneath the rear fuselage where a sensor turret would commonly be found. While we don’t know for sure what this is, one possibility is that conceals some kind of camera system. ISR-configured aircraft often have cameras installed behind sliding doors that are designed to interfere with the airflow around the aircraft as little as possible when they are opened. There are two visible segments on the “face” of the system underneath N27557, which could be a sliding door arrangement of some kind. A close-up of the system underneath the rear of N27557’s fuselage., USMC As for what kind of camera or cameras might then be installed here, one possibility is a wide-area airborne surveillance (WAAS) system designed to collect imagery across a very large area all at once. WAAS systems are used for conducting persistent surveillance to help establish so-called “patterns of life” that can help in the tracking and targeting of small groups or even specific individuals. Combined with signals intelligence, it can help create a very high-fidelity intelligence “picture” of how terrorists and militants are operating in a specific area. You can read more about how this works in this past War Zone piece . Historically, WAAS systems have been relatively large , but more compact designs are increasingly available and still offer impressive capabilities. Logos Technologies’ RedKite and BlackKite wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) sensors are prime examples and are designed to be installed at a fixed, oblique angle, just like the system underneath N27557’s fuselage. They are also sized to fit even inside relatively small drones, such as the Boeing Insitu RQ-21 Blackjack . The U.S. Marine Corps is in the process of acquiring an improved version of BlackKite, known as Cardcounter, for its Blackjacks . An RQ-21 fitted with the RedKite sensor., Insitu There is also the possibility that this is a mounting point for dispensers for countermeasures, such as decoy flares. However, if this is where flare launchers might be installed, it’s hard to see why they would they wouldn’t be fitted when flying over Somalia. Al Shabaab is known to possess shoulder-fired, heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, also known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS). If the aircraft’s configuration is curious, so is the question of who is operating it. See, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says that there is no plane of any kind associated with the registration number N27557. A company called Gloome Aviation paid a $10 fee to reserve this number for a year, starting on June 18, 2020, according to FAA’s database, but no subsequent paperwork to link it to a specific aircraft appears to have been filed. The FAA database also says that Gloome provided the following physical address when it reserved this N-number: 4001 McCords Ferry Road, Eastover, South Carolina, 29044-8854. This is the exact address, down to the extended ZIP code, of International Paper’s facility in Eastover , South Carolina. When contacted in 2019 regarding a separate matter dealing with Gloome Aviation, Tom Ryan, Director of Corporate Communications at International Paper, told The War Zone “we have zero idea what this is about” and that “there is no relationship here whatsoever” between the two companies. At that time, Gloome had two other N-numbers reserved, N40717 and N74791. At present, it only has N27557 on hold. A letter from Gloome Aviation to the Federal Aviation Administration to renew its reservation of the N-numbers N40717 and N74791 in 2018. Note the stationary with the Eastover, South Carolina address., FAA via FOIA Between 2017 and 2019, N40717 appeared on online flight tracking software multiple times flying what appeared to be ISR missions over Iraq, often using the callsign Rampant 11. Starting around the same time and as recently as January of this year, N74791 has also showed up on flight tracking websites over Iraq, sometimes with the callsign Rampant 12, flying the same sorts of orbits. N40717 and N74791 have also been associated with the callsigns State 34 and State 36, respectively. Interestingly, since 2019, the callsign State 33 has been associated with the flights of four shadowy Lockheed L-100 aircraft, commercial derivatives of the C-130 airlifter, over Iraq, as well as Syria and Jordan. These aircraft, which have the U.S. civil registration numbers N2679C, N2731G, N3796B, and N3867X, are all linked to a company called Tepper Aviation , based out of Bob Sikes Airport in Crestview, Florida. Tepper has long been associated with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It wouldn’t be surprising that the CIA, or contractors working on its behalf, would be conducting its own aerial ISR operations using discreet aircraft like N27557. The Agency is understood to have a very robust presence in the country, working actively together with its Somali counterpart, the National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA). The CIA has reportedly been involved in the training of NISA’s own direct-action counter-terrorism forces, called Gaashaan , or “shield,” and Waran , as well as their operations. In November 2020, reports had emerged that a member of the Agency’s own paramilitary arm, known as the Special Activities Center, had been wounded and later died in a raid on Al Shabaab terrorists. Then-NISA Director General Abdurahman Mohamud Turyare, at center, with Gaashaan and Waran commandos in 2016., NISA The fact that other aircraft linked to Gloome Aviation have been seen in the Middle East using military-type callsigns could also indicate that the activities of these planes, including N27557, might also be linked to top-secret U.S. military aviation elements , which are themselves often associated with the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). There has long been considerable evidence of overlap in the control of aviation assets supporting JSOC and CIA activities, especially when it comes to unmanned aircraft . There are also substantial reported ties between the Agency and military aviation elements that provide more specialized capabilities, such as the Army’s Aviation Technology Office (ATO), previously known as the Flight Concepts Division (FCD), as well as JSOC’s Aviation Tactics Evaluation Group (AVTEG). ATO/FCD, which itself evolved out of a joint Army-CIA aviation unit called Seaspray , is notably understood to have led the development of the heavily modified “ Stealth Hawk ” helicopters that were employed in the raid that led to the death of then-Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan 2011. In addition to this kind of advanced development work, it also provides other kinds of specialized and discreet aviation support using a fleet of non-standard aircraft , including foreign types, such as Russian-made Mi-17 Hip helicopters. JSOC is also known to make use of a publicly acknowledged fleet of civil-registered aircraft with civilian-style paint schemes, including multiple King Airs and larger de Havilland Dash-8 twin-engine turboprops, which are configured for ISR missions, including for missions over Somalia. You can read more about the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) Tactical Airborne Multi-Sensor Platform program, or STAMP, which The War Zone was first to report on, here. One of the STAMP Dash-8s was among the aircraft destroyed in a brazen attack by Al Shabaab terrorists on an air base in Kenya that U.S. forces operate from in January 2020. Regardless of who is operating N27557, with the recent drawdown of U.S. military forces from Somalia proper, at least of the elements that the Pentagon had acknowledged were in the country, there could now be increased emphasis on using the CIA and other covert or clandestine forces to continue executing more direct operations against Al Shabaab, as well as ISIS. The Pentagon has said that cross-border raids, staged from neighboring countries, such as Djibouti or Kenya, will continue to be an option for direct action against these terrorists, as well. All told, whether they are supporting CIA or military activities, or both, shadowy aircraft like N27557 are likely to remain a fixture over Somalia as U.S. counter-terrorism operations in Somalia enter this new phase.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The British Royal Navy today officially unveiled its new River class offshore patrol vessel, wearing a ‘ dazzle camouflage ’ paint scheme of the kind famously employed during the two world wars. The complex geometric pattern has been applied to HMS Tamar , which will sail with it to the Asia-Pacific region this summer. “We’re really proud of our new paint scheme and the historical significance that it comes with,” said Lieutenant Commander Michael Hutchinson, commanding officer of HMS Tamar . HMS Tamar in dry dock in Falmouth, after the dazzle paint scheme was applied., CROWN COPYRIGHT “Different styles of dazzle were used by the Royal Navy on ships in various stations throughout the world and were are pleased to have been given an iconic new look before we deploy in the summer,” Lieutenant Commander Hutchinson added. Meanwhile, Commander David Louis, who heads up the Navy’s Overseas Patrol Squadron, admitted that dazzle “has much less military value in the 21st century although there is still value in littoral environments when viewed against the background of land.” That is of particular significance for the latest Batch 2 River class offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), which are optimized for overseas service: typically including maintaining a permanent presence in the South Atlantic , supporting British Overseas Territories in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean, or operating in the waters of the Mediterranean and West Africa. The bow of HMS Tamar in dry dock., CROWN COPYRIGHT Reportedly, this is the first time that dazzle has been applied to any Royal Navy warship since World War II, although at least some British military vessels have received other types of unorthodox camouflage schemes, again primarily for operations in littoral waters, like the Oberon class submarines HMS Opossum and HMS Otus during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. The Batch 2 River class boats are 296 feet 11 inches long and have a displacement of 2,000 long tons. Powered by two diesel engines, they are armed with a 30mm cannon, as well as smaller machine guns, and have a flight deck large enough to accommodate Merlin and Wildcat helicopters. The Royal Navy now plans to paint all eight River class vessels, which are based in Portsmouth on the south coast, with the dazzle scheme, which uses 53 gallons of paint in four shades of gray, plus black. The artwork below shows how the scheme should be applied to HMS Severn , one of the Batch 1 River class vessels. It is fitting that the Royal Navy is reviving the iconic paint scheme since it was this service that pioneered its use back in World War I. It was devised in 1917 by official War Artist Norman Wilkinson , as a means of reducing losses to attacks by German submarines, or U-boats. Dazzle camouflage works by using highly contrasting color blocks as part of a carefully constructed pattern that breaks up the form of the ship and makes it harder to judge perspective. British aircraft carrier HMS Argus wearing dazzle camouflage in 1918., CROWN COPYRIGHT Viewed through a periscope it became harder for the U-boat skippers to judge the ship’s course and speed in order to launch a torpedo effectively. Furthermore, even the process of identifying a ship became trickier once appropriately dazzle-painted. Dazzle-painted cruiser HMS Trinidad on an Arctic convoy in 1942., CROWN COPYRIGHT The concept met with some success, especially against the backdrop of shoreline, and more than 2,000 British ships received it. Dazzle was used by the U.S. Navy as well, among others, and then again during World War II, despite the arrival of improved rangefinders and radar. Dazzle-painted HMS Tamar seen from astern in dry dock., CROWN COPYRIGHT More recently, the U.S. Navy has applied dazzle patterns to USS Freedom (LCS-1) the first of its Littoral Combat Ships , reflecting the requirement to operate close to the shore. Meanwhile, the Royal Canadian Navy’s Halifax class frigate HMCS Regina and Kingston class coastal defense vessel HMCS Moncton also adopted dazzle schemes in 2019, commemorating the 75th anniversary of the end of the Battle of the Atlantic . You can look at HMCS Regina in all its glory here . HMS Tamar already had a very distinctive appearance, thanks to the ‘red lion rampant’ artwork that was applied to each side. This motif was taken from the ship’s crest and represents its affiliation with the counties of Devon and Cornwall. Now that the dazzle scheme has been finished, the red lions will be reapplied. HMS Tamar before receiving its new paint scheme. Note the red lion motifs on the superstructure., CROWN COPYRIGHT Once in the Asia-Pacific region later this year, HMS Tamar ’s likely roles will include counter-terrorism, counter-piracy, and anti-smuggling operations. So while the dazzle camouflage has mostly been reintroduced to pay homage to the unique mission of these boats — and to acknowledge their famous antecedents — it could potentially also aid in survivability, under some circumstances, in more hostile areas of operation.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",Iran’s Used Its Wacky Catamaran To Cut Off U.S. Coast Guard Ships In The Persian Gulf,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has released video and images showing an encounter between two U.S. Coast Guard cutters and an Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps catamaran in the Persian Gulf earlier this month. In what the U.S. Navy describes as an “unprofessional interaction” by Iran, the Revolutionary Guard Corps boat Shahid Nazeri is seen crossing at high speed in front of the Coast Guard vessels, reportedly coming as close as 70 yards to the American ships, which have to take evasive action to avoid it. The incident, first reported yesterday by the Wall Street Journal , took place on April 2. However, the U.S. Navy released the imagery today, noting in a statement that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) boat had “repeatedly crossed the bows of the U.S. vessels at an unnecessarily close range, requiring U.S. ships to make defensive maneuvers to avoid the risk of a possible collision.” The Harth 55 class boat Shahid Nazeri passes one of the U.S. vessels “at an unnecessarily close range.”, U.S. NAVY The U.S. Navy says that the Harth 55 class Shahid Nazeri was accompanied by three fast attack craft (FAC) or fast inshore attack craft (FIAC) of undisclosed types during this incident. The IRGCN operates a wide array of small boats in these general categories. The Shahid Nazeri is a larger catamaran-type, high-speed design that appears to be armed with a 20mm cannon and has a helipad on top of its rear deck. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wv05J4-gI8o The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) boats involved were the USCGC Wrangell (WPB-1332) and USCGC Monomoy (WPB-1326), two Island class patrol cutters. They were conducting routine maritime security patrols in the southern Persian Gulf, according to the U.S. Navy, which said that these patrols are routinely carried out in international waters. The Harth 55 crossed the bows of both Wrangell and Monomoy at a 70-yard closest point of approach (CPA), according to a U.S. Navy statement. The Iranian boat then “closed aggressively” on Wrangell ’s bow, and the cutter maneuvered out of its path while sounding five short warning blasts from the ship’s horn. As well as sounding the horn, the crews on the two USCG ships also issued “multiple warnings” to the Iranians over open radio channels. The U.S. Navy says the IRGCN vessel responded to the bridge-to-bridge radio queries, but it’s unclear how these conversations went. Regardless, according to the U.S. Navy account, the Harth 55 continued its “unsafe and unprofessional” maneuvers before eventually moving away from the cutters. The entire incident lasted for roughly three hours. The Shahid Nazeri during its commissioning ceremony in September 2016., Hossein Ostovar/Tasnim News “U.S. naval forces continue to remain vigilant and are trained to act in a professional manner, while our commanding officers retain the inherent right to act in self-defense,” the U.S. Navy release concluded. The Harth 55 , left, crosses the bow of the USCGC Monomoy . , U.S. NAVY The appearance of the Shahid Nazeri , which was officially commissioned in 2016, is notable in itself, given how little time the vessel seems to spend at sea. The catamaran did make participate, at least one some level, in a Russian-Iranian naval exercise earlier this year. The ship’s actual capabilities have long seemed very limited , though the IRGC has released pictures in the past showing an AB-206 helicopter armed with an anti-ship missile onboard. An IRGC AB-206 helicopter armed with an anti-ship missile onboard the Shahid Nazeri ., Government of Iran via USN Iran now appears to be in the process of constructing at least one example of a new class of catamarans , reportedly named the Shahid Soleimani class. There are indications that this new design will itself be armed with anti-ship missiles . This is, of course, hardly the first time that USCG vessels, as well as other American warships, have been involved in a maritime altercation with Iranian forces. Almost a year ago, on April 15, 2020, the USCGC Wrangel , together with another Island class patrol cutter, USCGC Maui , was involved in another incident in the same waters. On that occasion, the cutters, together with the expeditionary sea base USS Lewis B. Puller , the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Paul Hamilton , and the Cyclone class patrol craft USS Firebolt and USS Sirocco were harassed by around 11 Iranian speedboat-type craft . You can read more about that incident here . The incident this April followed a very similar pattern to last year’s encounter. On both occasions, IRGCN vessels repeatedly crossed the bows of the U.S. vessels at extremely close range and high speeds. However, last year’s incident saw the Iranian boats coming as close as 10 yards of at least one of the U.S. vessels, according to U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. Despite the use of radio communications, blasts from the ships’ horns, and long-range acoustic noise maker devices, there was no response from the IRGCN on that occasion. An earlier video showing the April 15, 2020 incident in the Persian Gulf: For the U.S. Navy, these kinds of actions on the part of Iran present a significant risk of a potentially catastrophic collision. Although the Island class ships are relatively small, at 110 feet long and with a  displacement of up to 165 tons, it still takes some time to bring them to a stop. Perhaps more worrying is the risk of mistaking these high-speed interactions by armed boats as a genuine attack. It is not known if there were U.S. Navy warships on the scene to provide additional protection to the USCGC Wrangell and USCGC Monomoy , but these boats do have their own, limited, defensive armament in the form of a Mk 38 25mm chain gun and a pair of 50-caliber machine guns. U.S. vessels are also increasingly working in cooperation with air support assets, including U.S. Air Force AC-130W Stinger II gunships and U.S. Army AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, both of which can defend against swarming attacks by Iranian boats. Air Force A-10 attack aircraft have also regularly trained for similar maritime missions in the past. A sequence of captures from the feed from an infrared camera as the AC-130W Stinger II engages a “killer tomato” with its guns during an exercise in the Persian Gulf., U.S. NAVY Aside from the aforementioned April 2020 encounter, and the latest altercation, Iran has long sparred with U.S. military vessels in the Persian Gulf, to the point where such provocations became almost routine. Back in 2017, The War Zone reported about how harassment of American warships by the IRGCN in the Gulf was an extension of the more hardline domestic and foreign policy objectives pursued by the country’s Supreme Leader and other unelected clerics rather than its elected government. Above all, this sought to provide a bulwark against U.S. influence and military presence in the Middle East. A year before that, in January 2016, IRGCN forces captured 10 American sailors and two Riverine Command Boats that had drifted into Iranian territorial waters near Farsi Island, resulting in an international incident. One of the craft had suffered an engine breakdown and lost track of its position. However, these kinds of maritime altercations had largely come to an end by the middle of President Donald Trump’s term in office amid new hardline U.S. policies toward Iran. Of course, there were still other provocations. In 2019, the United States and Iran came worryingly close to blows after Iran shot down a U.S. Navy RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Demonstrator (BAMS-D) over the Gulf of Oman. This was followed by U.S. Marines aboard the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Boxe r bringing down an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz . Iran also continued its practice of conducting hostile boardings of other vessels underway in the Persian Gulf, in the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz , and elsewhere. The IRGC typically employs swarms of small boats, as well as helicopters, to conduct these operations. In one high-profile incident, the IRGC seized control of the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero in July 2019, in response to the United Kingdom detaining an Iranian supertanker off the coast of Gibraltar. There have been other examples , too, while the U.S. government has also blamed Iran for a spate of attacks directed against commercial oil tankers. The British-flagged tanker Stena Impero was captured by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz in July 2019., STENA AB Both the United States and the European Union have since established new maritime security constructs to help ensure the safe passage of commercial shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, specifically. Meanwhile, and more generally, tensions between the United States and Iran ratcheted up again in January last year, including the U.S. government’s assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad and the Iranian ballistic missile strikes aimed at U.S. forces. After President Biden took office earlier this year, a rocket attack on Erbil Airport in northern Iraq in February week killed a contractor working for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria and injured a U.S. military service person, among other casualties. In retaliation, the U.S. military launched strikes against Iranian-backed militias in Syria. That event confirmed that Biden would continue the campaign against Iranian-supported groups. The latest incident involving the two USCG cutters and the Shahid Nazeri came at almost the same time that the U.S. and Iran announced they would begin negotiations toward the U.S. government rejoining a controversial 2015 multinational accord on Iran’s nuclear activities, from which Trump withdrew the United States in 2018. Biden has said in the past that Iran will get no sanctions relief until it returns to full compliance with this agreement, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and which aims to put checks and limits on Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, but there have been reports that the U.S. government may be increasingly flexible on that issue . Despite that breakthrough, tensions between Tehran and Washington apparently seem set to continue. The incident in the Persian Gulf earlier this month is unlikely to be the last of its kind in this long-running standoff. What is less certain is whether this signals a return to such altercations between U.S. and Iranian military vessels becoming commonplace.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 13, 2021",Navy SM-6 Missile Successfully Hit A Target Barge During Big Manned-Unmanned Teaming Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has announced that a team of manned and unmanned assets spotted a mock surface target and then sent targeting information to the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS John Finn , which then hit it with an SM-6 missile , yesterday. That live-fire event was one part of a huge drone-focused experiment that wrapped up today and that also included testing involving swarming capabilities, small drone boats , submarine-launched unmanned underwater vehicles , manned and unmanned platforms working together to conduct anti-submarine operations , and more. Navy Rear Admiral James Aiken, the commander of the experiment, formally known as Unmanned Integrated Battle Problem 21 (UxS IBP 21), along with Rear Admiral Robert Gaucher, the Director of the Maritime Headquarters at U.S. Pacific Fleet, provided the new details during in a call with reporters on April 26, 2021. The exercise had officially kicked off on April 19. USS John Finn , the ship that fired the SM-6 missile during UxS IBP 21., USN A picture showing the launch of the SM-6 from USS John Finn during UxS IBP 21., USN Rear Admiral Gaucher said a total of 29 different unmanned systems had taken part in the event, with approximately 50 percent of them being unmanned surface vessels (USV), around 30 percent being unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), and the remaining 20 percent or so being aerial platforms. The Navy has not provided a comprehensive list of the unmanned assets that participated in UxS IBP 21, but we do know a wide range of designs, from more traditional drones, such as the General Atomics MQ-9B Sea Guardian , to various tiers of USVs and UUVs, and even high-altitude balloons, were involved. From the very beginning, at least publicly, the Navy has been most excited about the live-fire missile shoot component of this experiment. The service “wanted to prove that that worked by actually testing that with a live-fire shot,” according to Gaucher. The USS John Finn , one of four Arleigh Burke class destroyers taking part in the experiment, actually took the shot, though the Navy would not identify any specific systems that helped find the target or help cue the missile to it. Rear Admiral Aiken did say that the target that the SM-6 struck was “relatively small” and was “well-beyond line-of-sight” relative to the John Finn . The target, which was brought to the target area by the San Antonio class landing platform dock USS Anchorage , had been fitted “with a radar reflector, as well as a repeater to allow us to have ES [an electromagnetic signature] on it was well,” Aiken added. Those features could have given the target radar and electromagnetic signatures more in line with a larger surface vessel. Perhaps more interesting, these features enabled the team of manned and unmanned assets, which included space-based sensors , to spot the mock enemy vessel and then provide targeting information to the John Finn without using any active sensors. The target inside USS Anchorage ‘s well deck., USN The target being positioned., USN “It was a really, really complex” kill chain, Rear Admiral Aiken explained. “It was totally passive,” he continued, referring to the sensors employed, and “we used a fusing capability that we’re actually doing some experimentation on.” Passive sensors do not emit any signals of their own, though the communications systems necessary to transmit the information that they collect would. Still, reduced emissions make it more difficult for an opponent to realize that they’re at least being surveilled, if not targeted, and even locating and attacking the emitting assets themselves. This all makes it more difficult for them to respond in a timely and efficient manner to any incoming attack. The Navy, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, have been increasingly looking at ways to mask the electromagnetic signatures of their own ships and other platforms, underscoring how these emissions can be a very serious liability in modern combat. It’s also worth noting that this is yet another demonstration of the utility and flexibility of the SM-6 series of missiles, which is rapidly emerging as one of the Navy’s most capable surface-launched weapons, as you can read about more here . Though designed primarily as an air and missile defense weapon, this missile also has a secondary surface-to-surface capability, as was on display in this experiment. A new, enlarged Block IB variant is now in development that will offer even greater capabilities in existing and new roles, including potentially as a hypersonic weapon interceptor . The U.S. Army is also in the process of adapting the SM-6 into a land-based surface-to-surface weapon. An SM-6 Block I or IA missile., Raytheon However, the missile shoot was only one part of this seven-day exercise. Rear Admirals Aiken and Gaucher both said that unspecified swarms were used to carry out mock attacks on a surface vessel. They did not say whether this involved drones in the air, USVs on the surface, UUVs below the waves, or some combination thereof, or how much of these swarms might have been simulated in some fashion as has occurred in other experiments. We do know that what was identified as a U.S. Marine Corps’ Long-Range Unmanned Surface Vehicle (LRUSV), which has been linked to swarming technology development projects in the past, did take part in UxS IBP 21. The LRUSV program has been described in the past as a multi-part “tiered, scalable weapons system,” at least some elements of which will be “optionally manned and they will carry multiple payloads, which they will be capable of autonomously launching and retrieving.” A recently released update on the Marine Corps progress on its radical force restructuring initiative , known as Force Design 2030, included “Long Range Unmanned Surface Vessel with associated swarming drones” in a list of “Prioritized Investments.” A Marine LRUSV, in the foreground, takes part in UxS IBP 21. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Stockdale is seen in the background., USN Of course, LRUSV is just one of a number of unmanned swarming projects that we know are ongoing within the Department of the Navy, such as the Office of Naval Research’s Super Swarm initiative . One Super Swarm test involved the release of 1,000 small drones from a C-130-type cargo plane. We know that there is similar work being conducted elsewhere across the U.S. military, as a whole , not to mention projects that may still be classified. There were certainly other unmanned technologies present at UxS IBP 21, such as the tiny ADARO drone boat , that seemed well-suited to operating in swarms. Rear Admiral Gaucher also specifically said that an unidentified submarine-launched and recovered an Iver4 UUV from one of its torpedo tubes, highlighting another unmanned capability that the Navy is looking to make increasingly greater use of. The boat in question was likely the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Hampton , the only manned submarine the service identified as being among the UxS IBP 21 participants. The torpedo-shaped Iver4 has a cruising speed of four knots, can dash for short periods at up to five knots, and operate autonomously for up to 36 hours, depending on its configuration. These UUVs, which you can read more about here , can carry with various sensors to perform intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance missions. The Navy also highlighted how an MQ-9B performed various anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions, including dropping sonobuoys and relaying data from them to other ships and command and control nodes ashore. These were capabilities General Atomics, the MQ-9B’s manufacturer, demonstrated last year in earlier tests. In this experiment, Rear Admiral Gaucher noted that the drone was able to help keep monitoring a particular area for underwater threats even after a manned P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane had to return to base, underscoring a specific manned-unmanned teaming concept that the service has been exploring already . A contractor-owned and operated MQ-9B Sea Guardian drone configured for anti-submarine warfare operations, including with a pod to launch sonobuoys, flies over the Independence class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) USS Coronado during UxS IBP 21., USN During the ASW portion of the experiment, one of the Navy’s two Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessels (MDUSV) also searched for underwater threats using a towed sonar array. Helping hunt for submarines, and then persistently tracking them, across broad areas was one of the original roles envisioned for these drone boats , the first of which was developed under a project led by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), before being turned over the Office of Naval Research. Both MDUSVs are now assigned to a developmental unit, Surface Development Squadron One , which is also set to eventually be the home of all three Zumwalt class stealth destroyers . The second of those ships, the USS Michael Monsoor , also took part in UxS IBP 21, sporting a huge, temporary additional satellite communications antenna mounted on its rear deck. “The SATCOM dome is being used during the exercise to test advanced processing and communications capabilities aboard the ship,” the U.S. Navy’s Third Fleet’s public affairs office said last week, confirming The War Zone ‘s initial analysis . All told, the experiment was a “success against what our objectives were,” according to Rear Admiral Gaucher. At the same time, he was the first to acknowledge that the Navy still has a lot of work to do in more deeply integrating unmanned capabilities into its operations in the air, on the surface, and under the water. “Truth in advertising, not everything went perfect,” he said. “We had to adjust in stride.” As it stands now, the Navy is looking at taking the lessons it has learned from this event and applying them to the use of unmanned systems in future exercises. Another large-scale event along the lines of UxS IBP 21 could be coming sometime in the next year or two, as well. Whatever the exact steps the Navy takes going forward, this particular experiment was a major step forward in the service’s plans for an increasingly unmanned future.

Aviation photographer and The War Zone contributor Jamie Hunter recently captured this typically dynamic shot of three Eurofighter Typhoons from a unique joint U.K./Qatari unit. The spectacular three-ship break is the first time we have seen an aerial photo sortie of this kind involving the jets of No 12 Squadron, stationed at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire. No 12 Squadron was set up to provide operational training for pilots and ground crew of the rapidly expanding Qatar Emiri Air Force (QEAF) which, alongside Typhoons, has also ordered Dassault Rafales and Boeing F-15QA multirole fighter jets as part of a wide-ranging overhaul. Ultimately, No 12 Squadron will head to the Middle East to continue its mission, including providing air defense coverage for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, before likely returning to the U.K. A No 12 Squadron Typhoon leads a QEAF Rafale and Mirage 2000., Crown Copyright A former Tornado GR4 unit that saw active duty during the fight against ISIS under Operation Shader, No 12 Squadron was re-established in July 2018 to provide operational training and support to the QEAF as part of that service’s purchase of 24 Typhoons. In 2019 the squadron took its Typhoons to Qatar for the first time to take part in Exercise Epic Skies III , a series of maneuvers that took place at Al Udeid Air Base and which involved technical training and joint flying. Four Typhoons from the unit flew also over the Qatari capital city of Doha as part of Qatar National Day celebrations, flying alongside QEAF Rafales. The squadron returned to Qatar for another edition of the same drill last December, too, this time bringing six jets. The operational U.K./Qatari Typhoon unit will be followed later this year by a training squadron following the same format. Under an agreement formalized earlier this month, a new squadron flying Hawk T2 advanced jet trainers will be established at RAF Leeming, Yorkshire. This will provide advanced training to both U.K. and Qatari pilots, operating the nine Hawk T2s ordered by Qatar. The squadron is expected to stand up in September. The relationship between the U.K. and Qatari air forces is clearly flourishing. The Typhoon is set to become an essential part of the QEAF fighter capabilities, and we’re very happy to get a chance to see the jets being put through their paces in British skies before the unit heads to their permanent home next year.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 28, 2021",Warnings Posted For A Peculiar French Ballistic Missile Test In The Atlantic,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Warnings to mariners to stay clear of certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean, spanning from the coast of France to an area just north of Bermuda , due to upcoming “missile operations,” indicate that the French military will carry out a long-range ballistic missile test sometime in the next month or so. The exact locations of the four off-limits zones have raised questions about whether this launch will be a test of a new variant of France’s M51 submarine-launched ballistic missile , or SLBM, a key component of the country’s nuclear deterrent capabilities, or even a hypersonic weapon. The navigation warnings, which include a box right off the French coast in the Bay Biscay, two more in the North Atlantic, and the one near Bermuda, first appeared online on April 21, 2021, and will be active from April 28 until May 21. The notices use arbitrary letters to refer to the zones, defining them, from east to west, as A, B, D, and C. Long-range missile launches in the Atlantic, in general, are not uncommon, with the United States, as well as its allies, regularly making use of the space that this body of water offers for these kinds of tests. A French M51 submarine-launched ballistic missile about to be loaded onto the Triomphant class ballistic missile submarine Le Vigilant ., French Navy The A, B, and D areas show a path that is very reminiscent of one laid out in an earlier set of navigation warnings last year. Those off-limits areas turned out to be related to a test of an M51 SLBM fired from the Le Téméraire , one of the French Navy’s four Triomphant class ballistic missile submarines, or SSBNs. The Triomphant class boats can each carry up to 16 M51s. However, in this case, there are at least two notable differences between those warning areas and the ones set to go into effect later this week, as Marco Langbroek, a Dutch archaeologist and Space Situational Awareness consultant at Leiden University in the Netherlands, was quick to point out on Twitter and on his blog . The first and perhaps most obvious is that the C area is distinctly offset from the ballistic trajectory laid out by the other three areas. The other important distinction is that the eastern edge of the A area, in this instance, is right up against France’s northwestern coast, and the DGA Essais de Missiles , the country’s main ballistic missile test facility, which could indicate a launch from a site on the ground, rather than somewhere off the shore. A satellite image showing launch sites on France’s Bay of Biscay coastline associated with the DGA Essais de Missiles., Google Earth The offset nature of the C area immediately raised questions online about whether this could indicate a test of a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, rather than just another M51. In 2019, the French Ministry of Armed Forces had announced the award of a contract to ArianeGroup for the development of what was described as a “ hypersonic glider demonstrator ” as part of a program called the Véhicule Manoeuvrant Expérimental, or Experimental Maneuvering Vehicle, also abbreviated V-Max. At that time, the plan was to conduct a test of that vehicle in 2021. “ Many nations are procuring such weapons , and we have all the necessary skills to develop one,” French Minister of Armed Forces Florence Parly said in announcing the contract. “We could not wait.” Hypersonic boost-glide weapons typically use rocket boosters that are similar, if not identical to ones used for more traditional ballistic missiles, to get to the vehicle to a desired altitude and speed. After that, the vehicle is released and glides down toward its target, making highly irregular movements, along an atmospheric flight trajectory, all at hypersonic speed, defined as anything above Mach 5. The vehicle’s maneuvering is much less predictable than is found on more traditional ballistic missiles, even ones with advanced maneuvering re-entry vehicles. This combination of speed and erratic movements make these weapons particularly difficult to spot and track, let alone defend against. All this reduces the time in which an opponent has to react, at all, including attempting to relocate critical assets or otherwise seek cover, making boost-glide vehicles an ideal choice for prosecuting targets surrounded by dense integrated air defense networks. A graphic offering a very rudimentary look at the difference in flight paths between hypersonic boost-glide vehicles and more conventional ballistic missiles., GAO France no longer has any operational land-based ballistic missiles, so a test of the V-Max design could also help explain any use of a launch site on the ground, rather than from a submarine. The U.S. military has tested hypersonic boost-glide vehicles from submarines and land-based test sites . However, as noted, back in 2019, French authorities only said that the very first V-Max test would take place in 2021. It would be very unusual to even plan to conduct an initial flight test of a new boost-glide vehicle design, which are notably complex , across such a long distance. For example, the U.S. Air Force recently attempted to conduct the first live aerial launch of its AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), which carries a hypersonic-glide vehicle. The weapon never even left the wing of the B-52 bomber carrying it in that test, but even if it had, the plan was always for the vehicle to disintegrate entirely after being released at the desired speed and altitude, simply demonstrating the entire system’s ability to successfully complete its initial phase of flight. “It would be very atypical for an initial flight test of a hypersonic test vehicle to be on a full-range SLBM,” Scott LaFoy, Program Manager for National Security & Intelligence at Exiger Federal Solutions and an expert on missiles, space, and nuclear weapons technology, told The War Zone . “2019 interviews with DGA’s Joël Barre indicate that initial V-maX tests would utilize a sounding rocket for its initial stage.” There also appears to be some debate as to whether the V-Max effort has shifted focus, at least in part, from a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle to an air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile in the past two years. “Under the V-max (Experimental Maneuvering Vehicle) program, France plans to modify its air-to-surface ASN4G supersonic missile for hypersonic flight by 2022,” according to a December 2020 report on hypersonic weapon developments from the Congressional Research Service (CRS). “I observe however that the first three areas from the Navigational Warning are of similar size/shape and at similar distance to the launch site as in the June 2020 M51 test, so this could well be another M51 test,” Marco Langbroek, the Dutch archaeologist, also told The War Zone directly. “The off-set position of the target area probably points to the MIRVs being deployed from the post-boost vehicle at a sideways angle to the original launch trajectory.” MIRV stands for Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicle and refers to ballistic missiles that carry multiple warheads on a single payload bus that are then released in the terminal stage of flight to strike individual targets. The M51 SLBM can carry up to 10 reentry vehicles, each loaded with a single nuclear warhead. The improved, longer-range M51.2 variant, which began entering service in 2016 , carries new reentry vehicles with new Tête Nucléaire Océanique (TNO) warheads, each with a reported yield of around 150 kilotons. The earlier M51 and M51.1 versions were loaded with reentry vehicles carrying TN 75 warheads, with reported yields of approximately 110 kilotons, which had also been used in the preceding M45 SLBM design. Releasing the MIRVs at an oblique angle might, but does not necessarily have to mean there has been a change to their design or that of the payload bus. “This could be due to how close to the U.S. East Coast and shipping lanes that a nominal trajectory would take or because there is a specific aspect of their reentry-vehicles maneuverability or post-boost vehicle that they are testing,” LaFoy said. No matter what, it is interesting to note that the final leg of the M51 test last year was much further south. “The only oddity is that the launch appears to be from land, not from a submarine,” according to Langbroek. With that in mind, it’s important to point out that there is a further improved M51 variant presently in development, the M51.3, which will have even greater range than the M51.2, among other improvements. Firing an SLBM from the land could indicate a test of a new variant that is not mature enough to safely fire from an actual submarine. DGA Essais de Missiles does have a land-based submerged test platform, to simulate the launch of SLBMs without using an actual submarine, which it has used in previous M51 tests, as seen in the video below. “Since the launch appears to be from land, it could potentially be a test flight of the new M51.3 SLBM that is in development,” Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told The War Zone. “The missile is an improved version of the current M51.2 deployed on the SSBN fleet and it is potentially possible the upcoming test flight includes an improved payload bus or new reentry bodies.” There had been some discussion about whether the French SLBM test last year might have involved an M51.3 missile, as well. “I don’t think launching from the submerged pool is particularly weird, since they do that every now and again, and I’m not sure if that implies that there is more risk than usual,” according to LaFoy. He also added that, based on the information publicly available now, the M51.3 “may not see flight tests for another year or so.” There is always some amount of risk during missile testing. In 2013, French officials initiated the self-destruct mechanism on an M51 missile after a test launch off the coast of France during which the first stage of the rocket booster malfunctioned. This is part of the reason why countries around the world conduct routine tests of even established types. With regards to strategic deterrence, this is particularly important to ensure that a country’s nuclear weapons can be reliably called upon, if necessary, and to make that clear to any potential adversaries. France is generally very tight-lipped about any developments with regards to its nuclear arsenal, so it will be interesting to see what, if anything, we might learn after this upcoming missile test is carried out, no matter what it necessarily entails.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is an image that is in the DoD’s public portfolio that truly has me stumped. It depicts Air Force personnel working on an elongated black drone-like aircraft that is reminiscent in shape to the SR-71 Blackbird , but far smaller, appearing to be about a dozen feet in length. After passing the image around a bit, it just doesn’t ring a bell with the usual folks, although there were many experimental or low-production systems of this nature built over the decades, so that isn’t a huge surprise. With that being said, I thought it was time to crowdsource an answer, which usually comes with fast and accurate results—a big emphasis on usually. The image has the caption “Technicians conduct a bench test on a diagnostic tow target.” The image was shot in 1980 at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, which is well known for its testing mission and its proximity to the absolutely huge Sandia National Labs complex. USAF The craft appears to have forward-canted ram-air turbine blades on the cones of its nacelle-like bulges on either side of its very small wing area. It also has two outward canted fins on each structure. Its nose is also interesting, appearing somewhat slab-sided, with it attached to the forward fuselage, which appears to be rounded. The craft’s rear structure ends in an abrupt, flat-like manner. It isn’t exactly clear how this aircraft would be towed, either. The only markings we see on the article itself are a 7702-4, possibly meaning this is the fourth example of this design, as well as a typical Air Force crest with somewhat unfamiliar art within its borders. It shows a wing-like symbol rising above an atom, which at first glance, points to some nuclear unit having a major role in the object’s existence. After further research, we found that his crest belongs to the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL) , a precursor to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) today. USAF The AFWL did a lot of work with lasers during this period, including out of Kirtland AFB and in conjunction with the nearby Sandia Optical Range, which later went by the name Starfire Range. Of course, AFWL also worked on a host of other types of programs. So, what do you think? Does this mystery ‘towed target’ look familiar to you? If so, what is its purpose?

Terrible news about the lost Indonesian sub KRI Nanggala has been found and its complement of 54 souls has been lost.

At 838 meters, well below crush depth for the submarine and beyond the reach of submarine rescue systems, a recovery effort wouldn’t have been possible anyway, from what we understand. Chinese Navy super commissioning ceremony The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) had a three-way commissioning ceremony that also highlighted some of its most advanced capabilities. The Type 094 nuclear ballistic missile submarine Cangzheng , the Type 055 destroyer Dalian , and the Type 075 LHD Hainan were all brought into service at Sanya Naval Base on the 72nd Anniversary of the PLAN.

Being able to push them forward on the P-8, which we knew was on the Navy’s wish list, brings another level of relevancy to the multi-mission jets, especially during a high-end conflict. Being able to deploy it in a coast defense role would make approaching within hundreds of miles of allied shores where it could be deployed a very risky proposition for the enemy.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 15, 2021",The Mighty Boeing 747 Supertanker May Have Fought Its Last Fire,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The awesome spectacle of a Jumbo Jet riding through valleys at low-level, before dumping over 17,000 gallons of bright red retardant over a blazing forest could be consigned to history as of now. The unique Boeing 747 Supertanker has been grounded, for the time being at least, after the investment group that owns the single aircraft decided to cease its operations. The story was first reported earlier today by the authoritative Fire Aviation website . That site confirmed that the boss of the Colorado-based Global Supertanker, which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the aircraft, also known as Tanker 944, had contacted officials in different states, as well as within the federal government to tell them that operations had been wound up. The 747 SuperTanker makes a drop in front of advancing flames from a wildfire in Lakeport, California, in August 2018., KENT PORTER/THE PRESS DEMOCRAT VIA AP “This week the investors that own the Global SuperTanker just informed me that they have made the difficult decision to cease operations of the company, effective this week,” wrote Global Supertanker president Dan Reese, in an email dated April 21 that was obtained by Fire Aviation . “This is extremely disappointing as the aircraft has been configured and tuned with a new digital drop system and other upgrades to make it more safe and efficient.” Reese confirmed in that same email that they are in talks with potential buyers interested in acquiring Tanker 944, a modified 747-400 series aircraft, also known as the Spirit of John Muir , and by its civil registration N744ST. However, there’s no guarantee that, if it should be sold, its new owner will continue to use it to fight fires far and wide. It could also be converted to a freighter configuration. Meanwhile, the majority of the workforce at Global Supertanker, which is based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, has been put on furlough pending a decision on the future of the aircraft, which has reportedly not moved since January this year. There are potentially some problems, too, for any operator that might be looking to operate Tanker 944 in its familiar role. Last April, the National Interagency Aviation Committee (NIAC), which provides national leadership in wildland fire aviation, determined that it would not provide another approval for Tanker 944 to use its retardant delivery system. This system is designed to allow the aircraft to drop its entire load in one continuous line, stretching over several miles, or in up to eight separate bursts, with the aircraft flying as low as 300 feet. However, NIAC’s Interagency Air Tanker Subcommittee had demanded that certain changes be made to the system before it could be certified again for use. In particular, the subcommittee pointed to issues relating to coverage level, retention of retardant in the system following a drop, “trail off” of the retardant into areas outside the intended drop zone, and inconsistent flight profiles that affected retardant coverage. These would all had to have been fixed before the end of 2020 before authorizing another approval. “The U.S. officials who set the requirements in order for air tankers to be issued contracts, are very strict in enforcing those standards,” Fire Aviation ’s Bill Gabbert told The War Zone . “One of the reasons they have refused to give the 747 a full certification is that after a retardant drop is completed, the liquid may trail off for a short time, releasing a small amount of additional retardant.” Tanker 944 in action over California in 2018., KENT PORTER/THE PRESS DEMOCRAT VIA AP However, it seems that at least some of these issues may have been addressed when the aircraft last went into scheduled maintenance, which took place last winter in Moses Lake, Washington. Among the changes made was a new digital controller for the retardant delivery system. According to Gabbert, that upgrade may have corrected the problem in meeting required coverage levels. Less clear is whether the retardant retention, trail off, or inconsistent flight profile issues have been fixed. It is noteworthy, however, that the aircraft still has valid Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification until 2024. The 747 Supertanker seen in happier times, at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel in 2016., LLHZ2805/Wikimedia Commons Regardless, anyone who does decide to buy Tanker 944 for firefighting will have themselves an aircraft of superlatives. “The 747 SuperTanker has by far the largest fire-retardant capacity of any firefighting air tanker,” Gabbert confirmed. Even though its retardant capacity has been steadily trimmed down from the originally specified 20,000 gallons to the current 17,500 gallons, there is still no other air tanker that comes close. Typically, a decent-sized aircraft of this type might carry around a sixth of that load. Even the big DC-10 tanker, which you can see in action here , currently carries a little over half the 747’s load. Tanker 944, which has been in service since 2009, is not the first Jumbo Jet air tanker, but it’s the most modern and had been the only one of its kind in operation prior to January. The first Supertanker conversion utilized a first-generation 747-100 airframe and was operated by Evergreen. When that company went bankrupt, Global Supertanker acquired the rights to the retardant system and adapted it for the 747-400. Acquiring the aircraft and converting it to an air tanker reportedly cost more than $10 million. The first-generation Evergreen 747-100 Supertanker., AP When it comes to tackling a major fire, a big air tanker like the 747 is sometimes what’s needed. As well as capacity, a 747-based tanker has the ability to self deploy over very long distances, and it can hit fires farther away, getting to the target more rapidly, than its competitors. This has been testified during major conflagrations in the U.S., but also as far afield as Israel, where Tanker 944 was deployed in 2016 as part of a multinational coalition of firefighting aircraft. The aircraft has also been called into action in Bolivia, Chile, and Mexico, as well. You can read all about the aircraft’s exploits in the Bolivian portion of the Amazon in 2019 in this previous article . Global Supertanker The problem is, operating bespoke, modern tankers like the 747 or DC-10 is expensive, and firefighting budgets have not changed much since the days of tackling blazes in adapted World War II-era piston types. Operating the Supertanker can cost as much as $250,000 a day, according to some accounts . In the meantime, the requirement for aircraft of this type has only increased. In recent years, there has been a trend of wildfires breaking out in areas that were previously untouched by them, bringing new levels of destruction to areas of the American West, as well as parts of Australia and Russia’s Siberia region, among other locales, putting civilians, infrastructure, and military facilities at risk. In the case of California, for instance, water is becoming rarer and forests drier, not just during the height of summer but also now during the spring and fall. Driven by climate change , more and more areas of the state are becoming potential tinderboxes, and these are increasingly not in the wilderness but close to human habitation . “The Supertanker is a very capable resource for slowing the spread of wildfires and can be a valuable addition to a firefighter’s toolbox,” Gabbert concludes. Whether those unique qualities are enough for it to ensure it carries on fighting fires in the future remains to be seen. With thanks to Bill Gabbert at Fire Aviation .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane is set to join the search for the Indonesian Navy’s Cakra class submarine Nanggala today . Australia, India, Malaysia, and Singapore, are all also sending naval assets, including specialized deep-sea rescue systems, to help try to find the submarine and rescue its crew, which went missing during a training exercise earlier this week. There is a fear that time may already be running out, since Indonesian authorities say the Nanggala may only have enough oxygen to last until tomorrow afternoon . Major General Achmad Riad, in charge of the Indonesian Armed Forces Information Center, confirmed in a press conference on April 23, 2021, that the American P-8A was expected to arrive in the region later in the day, local time. He did not say where the aircraft would be operating from specifically. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby had previously said unspecified “airborne assets” would take part in the search efforts looking for the Nanggala “at the invitation of the Indonesian government.” The Indonesian Navy’s Cakra class submarine Nanggala. , USN Riad also told the press that the current focus of the search operations was in an area approximately 25 miles north of Celukan Bawang Beach in Bali, based on the presence of oil slicks and stronger than normal magnetic readings. The latter information indicated the presence of a large metal object in the area, which could be the Nanggala . The torpedo training exercise that the submarine had been participating in when it went missing took place in a zone around 60 miles north of the island of Bali. No information has yet been released about what may have happened to the submarine. The boat, which is just over 195 feet in length and displaces some 1,390 tons when submerged, had a larger than average crew of 53 on board for this particular drill. Why the Nanggala had this expanded crew complement remains unclear. The Navy’s P-8A offers a valuable aerial reconnaissance platform to help with the search that will be able to cover a wide area and remain on station for an extended period of time. The aircraft’s crew will be able to keep a look for any new oil slicks or other debris that could indicate the position of the submarine. Poseidons have deployed to support various search and rescue efforts in Pacific region over the years , including the hunt for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 in 2014 and the search for a lost Japanese F-35A Joint Strike Fighter in 2019. Navy P-8As at Misawa Air Base in Japan during the search for a missing Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF) F-35A Joint Strike Fighter in 2019., USN How well the aircraft might be able to search for the submarine itself is less clear. Major General Riad specifically mentioned that magnetic readings have been a key source of information in the hunt for the Nanggala . The Navy’s Poseidons notably do not have magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD), which are designed to spot discrepancies in the Earth’s naturally-occurring magnetic field. As already noted, these readings can point to the presence of a large metal object underwater, such as a submarine. Instead, Navy P-8As rely on sonobuoys to detect and track targets below the waves. How the Nanggala might be situated underwater in relation to the seafloor or other underwater obstacles, as well as just how deep it might be lying now, could impact a sonobuoy’s ability to detect it. Of course, the Poseidon will be just one of a growing number of air and maritime assets looking for the Nanggala . Australia’s Department of Defense announced just today that Royal Australian Navy’s Anzac class frigate HMAS Ballarat , along with its embarked MH-60R Seahawk helicopter , and the HMAS Sirius , a fleet replenishment vessel, were on their way to the water off Bali. Ballarat has a fixed sonar system and can launch a towed sonar array, and the Seahawk can also deploy a dipping sonar . Both the ship and its helicopter could provide additional general situational awareness to keep an eye out for any new developments on the surface, as well. HMAS Ballarat , with its embarked MH-60R helicopter seen flying in the background, during an exercise in 2020., RAN “These two Australian ships will help expand the search area and extend the duration of search effort,” Royal Australian Navy Rear Admiral Mark Hammond said in a statement. “ Sirius can replenish ships with fuel, water and stores by day and night,” the Australian DOD added in its press release. Other foreign naval vessels are already on the way. Major General Riad said that the Navy P-8A was set to arrive at around the same time as the MV Swift Rescue , a submarine support and rescue ship that has a mixed crew of Singaporean Navy sailors and contractors from Swire Pacific Offshore Operations. Singapore’s MV Swift Rescue ., Singapore MoD This ship can carry and deploy the Deep Search And Rescue Six (DSAR 6), a 31-foot-long deep-submergence rescue vehicle (DSRV) that is designed to dive down depths up to 1,600 feet . It has a crew of two and can accommodate up to 15 other individuals. The MV Swift Rescue can also launch unmanned remotely operated vehicles (ROV) that are also capable of operating at great depths to help search for submarines and other objects of interest down below. They can also help clear debris on a sunken submarine to make it easier for DSRVs or divers to reach it. The video below from Indonesia media outlet Harian Kompas offers a general visual overview of how the DSAR 6 could be used to rescue sailors from a stricken submarine. It was announced earlier this week that the Indian Navy would be sending a salvage ship loaded with one of that service’s own DSRVs to assist with the search. The Royal Malaysian Navy’s MV Mega Bakti , another submarine rescue ship able to deploy ROVs, is also headed to the area to help. An Indian Navy salvage ship with a DSRV seen onboard at the rear. , Indian MoD The Royal Malaysian Navy’s submarine rescue ship MV Mega Bakti ., Royal Malaysian Navy This is all in addition to the 21 vessels from Indonesia’s own navy, along with four Indonesian police boats, which have been deployed to the area to look for any trace of the Nanggala . The submarine Alugoro , Indonesia’s third Nagapasa class submarine, which was only delivered in March , is reportedly part of the search effort . Nagapasa class design is an improved derivative of South Korea’s Jang Bogo class design. Indonesia already has three more of these vessels which could very well eventually replace the aging Cakra class boats, on order. The two Carkas , Type 209/1300 class boats originally built in what was then West Germany in the 1980s, did receive significant upgrades in South Korea between the mid-2000s and the early 2010s. This combined force is now racing against time to find the Nanggala . As already mentioned, Indonesian authorities are concerned that the submarine may only have enough oxygen to last until tomorrow. The area where the boat might be lying is a trench that goes down to a depth of between 2,000 and 3,000 feet, as well. Even specialized DSRVs might not be able to reach it at those depths. This is also deep enough where the water pressure could be starting to crush the hull . “Most rescue systems are really only rated to about 600m (1,970 feet),” Frank Owen, the Secretary of the Submarine Institute of Australia, told The Guardian newspaper in the United Kingdom earlier this week. “They can go deeper than that because they will have a safety margin built into the design, but the pumps and other systems that are associated with that may not have the capacity to operate. So they can survive at that depth, but not necessarily operate.” The hope, of course, is that there is still enough time to find the submarine and that it will be in a position where Indonesia and international partners will be able to save the crew.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 25, 2021",This Tiny Drone Boat Is Being Tested During The Navy’s Big Manned-Unmanned Teaming Experiment,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a possible glimpse of the future of naval warfare, an apparently new type of very small unmanned surface vessel , the ADARO, has been operating with U.S. Navy surface combatants during exercises off the coast of Southern California. The drone boat, which is reminiscent of a waterborne version of a mouse droid from Star Wars , is apparently intended, at least in part, to extend intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) coverage for the fleet when operating in regions close to the coast. These maneuvers, which The War Zone reported on here , are known as the Unmanned Integrated Battle Problem 21, or UxS IBP 21, and they focus on bringing together manned and unmanned participants, including surface vessels and aircraft. Photos released yesterday show the diminutive ADARO cutting through the waves off the bow of the newest Littoral Combat Ship USS Oakland , LCS-24 , while the warship is at anchor. Another view shows the drone operating in the same U.S. Pacific Fleet exercise with the San Antonio class amphibious transport dock USS Anchorage (LPD-23) underway in the background. A ADARO unmanned system interacts with the USS Oakland (LCS 24) in support of U.S. Pacific Fleet’s UxS IBP 21, April 22., U.S. Navy/Lt. Nicholas Ransom According to the provided captions, the unmanned surface vessel (USV) was “interacting” with both these warships. ADARO appears to be an acronym, but no explanation of its meaning is provided. Manufactured by SeaLandAire , the ADARO is a product of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, a government initiative to support small businesses in research and development. The waterborne drone is around three feet long, weighs some 20 pounds, and is driven by a hybrid energy powerplant. The hybrid powerplant can supply electric-only propulsion for quiet, high-speed operations, and use heavy fuel for longer-range movements. The ADARO reportedly can reach a speed of up to 25 knots and has a range of up to 230 miles. The drone can be controlled manually or autonomously and, although it has not been described as a stealth vessel , its minimal profile and tiny size, as well as composite construction, would certainly make it difficult to detect. ADARO is also a modular platform designed to readily accommodate various payloads. The Navy has not specified how it is configured for this particular experiment. Chief of Naval Research, Rear Admiral Lorin Selby, observes the payload bay on an ADARO unmanned vessel at Naval Base San Diego, April 16., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Natalie M. Byers We know that one of the payload options for the drone is an Ultra-Blade L-band electronically steerable array (ESA) satellite communications antenna provided by the Israel-based Get SAT. According to a joint press release from SeaLandAire and Get SAT last year, the Navy is expected to use the Ultra-Blade on ADARO to provide high-capacity, beyond-line-of-sight communications during command and control and ISR missions, including relaying full-motion video. At the same time, the ESA antenna could be used to transmit data gathered by any sensors aboard the ADARO, too. “Reducing risk to force and risk to mission by removing the USV operator from the area of operation, the BLOS [beyond-line-of-sight] ADARO will make a significant impact to mission planning and approvals in high-risk environments,” the two companies stated in last September’s press release . The photos that have been released so far suggest the example being used in this latest experiment has a forward-facing camera, as well as various antennas, on top. According to a USNI News story back in 2017 , the ADARO was originally developed with a view to using it in support of explosive ordnance disposal technicians, Marines, or special operations forces, which already make use of small-scale drones. Indeed, the ADARO seems to be very well suited to scouting for special operations teams, such as reconnoitering beaches or ports. The Navy has previously described its primary mission as ISR, as well. A slide from a 2019 Navy presentation showing the ADARO/MUSCL within the tier of smallest USV types. Its role is listed as ISR., U.S. NAVY “If you look at the special forces guys, they’re looking for something that they can plop in the water quickly to be able to go do reconnaissance or other communications-type things they want to do,” Captain Jon Rucker, the unmanned maritime systems program manager within the Program Executive Office for Littoral Combat Ships, told USNI News at the time. “So this particular craft — just like anything we put in the water first, the company developing it improved the engines, improved the efficiency, got it to be a little more watertight so if it hits a wave it flips over and rights itself — they improved all that,” Rucker added. In the past, the Navy has also drawn a direct link between ADARO and another project called the Modular Unmanned Scouting Craft, Littoral (MUSCL), which was carried out by a team including the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division and Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division . This is how the service had described the concepts of operation behind MUSCL in 2012: MUSCL is a man-portable unmanned surface vehicle platform for riverine combatant craft support. It will be employed as a waterborne “point man” to increase situational awareness during operations on inland waterways. It supports the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command requirements and is capable of carrying different sensors and payloads to provide a variety of capabilities such as intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and threat detection. The Navy’s 2017 Fiscal Year budget proposal describes MUSCL in a similar fashion: The Modular Unmanned Scouting Craft Littoral (MUSCL), is man-portable “X-Class” Unmanned Surface Vehicle providing enhanced surveillance and reconnaissance capability to Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) Riverine forces. MUSCL was itself a “spin-off” of an earlier effort called the Unmanned Reconnaissance Observation Craft, according to an annual review of work the Pentagon’s Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) had conducted in 2008. Recently renamed the Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate (IWTSD), this office has been responsible for the rapid development of various advanced or otherwise novel capabilities , with a particular focus on providing new technology for special operations forces. Multiple experimental MUSCL craft were developed and at least one was actually delivered to Navy riverine forces in 2011. It’s unclear if that particular drone boat was ever employed operationally or if other MUSCL designs were fielded. Experimental unmanned boats developed either as part of the MUSCL program or the preceding Unmanned Reconnaissance Observation Craft project., CTTSO By every indication, the ADARO program appears to be an outgrowth of these earlier projects, and the concepts underpinning them, which has now reached a greater level of maturity. By deploying ADARO during UxS IBP 21, the Navy is providing yet more evidence that that unmanned platforms are fast becoming a key component of these kinds of large-scale maritime combat scenarios. Increasingly, drones, both in the air and on the surface, and even below it, are serving as sensor nodes for spotting, as well as targeting enemy assets. The War Zone has explored only recently the advantages offered by using sensors on unmanned platforms to undertake targeting at standoff ranges, especially in the kinds of more heavily defended areas that the Navy might be expected to fight in, in the future. Once those kinds of assets are organized as drone swarms , their potential is only increased, with the ability to reconnoiter a much larger area, more quickly. An ADARO unmanned system interacts with the amphibious transport dock USS Anchorage (LPD 23)., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Alex Perlman In addition to helping prosecute the kinds of attacks envisaged in UxS IBP 21, or to gather ISR, drones like ADARO could potentially also be used to actively engage enemy assets themselves, especially when deployed in large numbers. They could be outfitted as decoys , either jamming or spoofing enemy defense systems, or perhaps even be fitted with explosive payloads as “ suicide drones .” This is the type of scenario that the Navy is already examining under its Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors (NEMSIS) program, which The War Zone was first to report on and that you can read about more here . This would bring together a team of manned and unmanned platforms that between them could spoof various opponents’ sensors over a wide area by generating phantom fleets of aircraft and ships. Close-up of an ADARO unmanned system during the U.S. Pacific Fleet’s UxS IBP 21 maneuvers., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Alex Perlman The Navy is also already working on programs to equip future unmanned surface vessels and undersea vehicles to launch drone swarms. Think of a Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessels (MDUSV), for instance, patrolling the seas for potentially months at a time, deploying swarms of ADARO-sized drones when required. There is a swarming element in the UxS IBP 21 exercise, too, which is connected to a secretive initiative known as Super Swarm , which is understood to focus on using large numbers of drones to test these kinds of capabilities. What little is known about Super Swarm now is primarily focused on aerial drones, but we also know that it includes work on USVs and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), as well. Otherwise, we don’t know a great deal about the specifics of manned/unmanned projects that will be tested during UxS IBP 21. We do know that, in addition to the Super Swarm component, the exercise will include two parts that look specifically at ISR and manned-unmanned teaming concepts of operation. Clearly, ADARO could have applications for both of those, with a modular payload capability offering potential to carry different sensors, and the fact we know that the drone is “interacting” with manned surface vessels, at least, during the exercise. There will also be some kind of missile launched at a surface target during the maneuvers, using information from a combination of manned and unmanned aircraft and surface vessels . “I would tell you the one I’m most interested in and that I think is probably most challenging is we’re going to use a combination of manned and unmanned assets in order to get after a target and provide a targeting solution,” Navy Rear Admiral James Aiken, the top officer overseeing UxS IBP 21, told reports last week. An ADARO participates in U.S. Pacific Fleet’s UxS IBP 21, April 22., U.S. Navy/Lt. Nicholas Ransom So far, it’s not clear what missile will be employed, what platform will launch it, or what assets will be used to gather the targeting data, but there could be a role for ADARO in this kind of scenario, too. We await with interest to see exactly how ADARO is being utilized in these ongoing war games off Southern California, and how it might be used in the future to collaborate with manned vessels and potentially other platforms too.

Juan Rivera,"Posted on Sep 28, 2021",The Hunt For A Soviet Submarine Desperately Trying To Sneak Through The Strait Of Gibraltar,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the North Atlantic on the evening of January 20, 1967, four U.S. Navy destroyers steamed east in a line abreast at 20 knots, heading for the Strait of Gibraltar . It was a Friday and we had departed the big naval base in Norfolk, Virginia nearly two weeks earlier to participate in a large naval exercise. We were now headed off on a multi-month Mediterranean cruise. It was the height of the Cold War and tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States were extremely high. We were not going there to sightsee. My ship, the USS Steinaker (DD-863) was a Gearing class destroyer, and like the others, it had been built during the closing months of World War II. It was 390 feet long and was powered by two steam turbines producing 60,000 shaft horsepower and driving two 14-foot propellers. Our main purpose was anti-submarine warfare, or ASW. Our top speed was 36.8 knots—destroyers are known as “Greyhounds” for a reason. A few years prior to my arrival aboard Steinaker, the decades-old ship had undergone a major fleet rehabilitation and modernization program, or FRAM, where new weapon systems and a new AN/SQS-23 sonar system had been installed. USS Steinaker. , USN As we headed east, our sonars were all in active mode, all with a peak output power of 50,000 watts. Each sonar was tuned to a slightly different frequency to reduce mutual interference. The entire northeastern Atlantic was probably ringing with bottom bounce echoes and reverberations, and any hostile submarines, along with every whale, porpoise, and sea turtle within 20 miles was probably trying its best to get away from us as we approached. Our sonars were so powerful that at night they sometimes caused plankton to phosphoresce as a pulse swept over them, producing expanding green concentric circles of light radiating outward at the speed of sound from our enormous bow-mounted 30-foot sonar domes. The AN/SQS-23 sonar system had a maximum display setting of 40,000 yards, or 20 nautical miles. That would suggest that it could transmit enough acoustic energy to bounce off a submarine 20 miles away and the echo from its hull would return enough energy to allow detection. In practice our emissions could be detected by an adversary long before any echoes would be strong enough to be detected back aboard our ship.  Normally, the sub would simply move far enough from our path to remain undetected, keeping it safe from attack, but also rendering it ineffective and irrelevant to us. SQS-26 sonar seen in 1961., USN My involvement with the Steinaker began on a miserably cold and rainy October evening when I arrived at the destroyer and submarine piers at Naval Station Virginia, the largest navy base in the world. I showed up straight out of boot camp, and I was about to become the lowest-ranking sailor on the ship—a newly minted Seaman Apprentice. I was what was called an “immediate active duty” reservist. Man, it does not get much worse than that! Getting my feet wet As a civilian, I had been working as an electronics technician for a small company that manufactured pressure transducers for the NASA space program and for a classified U.S. Air Force program, but since I had no Navy training I started my new life on the deck force. These guys are called Boatswain Mates. In port we maintained the exterior of the ship, mostly chipping paint, and repainting. We were also responsible for loading equipment and stores aboard the ship. Underway we stood watch as lookouts and served on the bridge as Helmsmen. We were also responsible for underway refueling and replenishments. In the old days Boatswain Mates handled the sails and rigging. There was a lot to learn and being the Helmsman underway was challenging. Handling a ship with 60,000 horsepower in heavy weather and staying on course required focus, and as I learned I began to enjoy it. Since I did arrive with some useful technical skills, I was eventually assigned to work with the sailors that operated and maintained the ASROC (Anti-Submarine Rocket), which was added during the FRAM upgrade. It was an all-weather, gyro-stabilized, all sea condition, standoff ASW weapon system with a six-mile range. We also had torpedo tubes on the main deck, but the ASROC was our primary ASW weapon system. ASROC launch from the Steinaker sometime in late 1966., Photo courtesy Juan Rivera I took the picture above during an exercise against one of our submarines. The ASROC launcher contained eight sealed launch tubes which could each contain either a Mk 46 acoustic homing torpedo, armed with a 99-pound PBXN high-explosive warhead, or a 10-kiloton W44 nuclear depth charge, both of which would be transported to the target area by RUR-5 rocket. With our sonar we should have been able to keep an enemy submarine far enough away to avoid a torpedo attack while allowing us to silently drop one of these torpedoes on him by parachute. The Mk 46 torpedo had a cylindrical-shaped no-escape zone several thousand yards in diameter and 1,500 feet deep. With a top speed of 45 knots, it would have been deadly against a diesel-electric sub anywhere inside that zone. The sub would probably not hear the small splash as the torpedo descended to the water, detached from its parachute, and then sank silently to its pre-programmed top search depth. Their first indication of trouble might have been when the torpedo went active and began hunting them. Of course, if we opted for the nuclear depth charge it would not matter if the sub heard the splash or not. After a few months working on the ASROC system, I was again transferred, this time to the Operations Division where I began learning to become a Radarman. The BFP On the evening of January 20, 1967, and after about six months of on-the-job experience, I was on watch in the Combat Information Center, referred to as CIC or simply “Combat.” I was manning the surface search radar repeater. In that position, it was my responsibility to track every surface contact within 20 miles and determine its course and speed as well as its closest point of approach, or CPA. If neither vessel changed its course or speed, how close would that other ship get to our ship, and when and where would this occur? Our goal was to never let another ship get within 2,000 yards, or one nautical mile. If the CPA was determined to be less than that minimum, we would calculate an alteration to either our course or speed to increase the CPA to that minimum and pass it to the bridge. Enlisted men cannot tell an officer what to do, but the officer of the deck always accepted our recommendation without question. Of course, altering either course or speed to deal with one ship would alter the CPA of all the other ships in the area. It could get extremely complicated, and we did all the calculations using a grease pencil on our radar scopes or with pencil and graph paper. There were no iPads or digital computers in those days. Approaching the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic was a busy time for us, with the four destroyers and many civilian merchant ships all converging on or departing from the same narrow Strait of Gibraltar. Using a sound-powered headset, I would have been talking to the lookouts as well as the bridge talker, whose job it was to repeat everything I told him to the Officer of the Deck on the bridge and write it on a plexiglass status board. I might also have been working with the electronic countermeasures (ECM) operator. We memorized the characteristics of all major Soviet radars—both sea and land-based. He would have been especially alert for detecting the Soviet SS-2 submarine surface search radar. Lastly, I would have also been keeping an eye out for “sinkers.” A sinker was any radar contact that appeared for one or two sweeps and then disappeared. That could indicate that a submarine had briefly exposed its periscope or ECM antenna for a quick look around. Working that position could be extremely intense and sometimes things were happening so fast that you were literally the only person on the ship that really knew the big picture completely—we called it the BFP [Big Fucking Picture]. Occasionally you had so much information in your head that you simply could not keep up and your mind would just go blank. You had become task saturated, and you had lost the BFP. It was a horrifying feeling, looking down at all those little contacts and grease pencil lines that you had made and realizing that you no longer knew which were which. Underway, Radarmen worked almost continuously. We usually lived on three or four hours of sleep a day, sometimes for weeks at a time. Our sleep was broken into two short naps between watches in the CIC, and, in this case, we had just come off two weeks’ involvement in that big naval exercise. It was brutal. USN If I was not on watch or involved in an underway replenishment, a refueling, or dragooned into some other essential task like polishing brass, I would have been desperately trying to get some sleep. Sometimes, after coming off watch, I was so spun up that I just lay in my rack trying to calm down and sleep, and then it was time to go back on watch again. It is a miserable feeling being both mentally and physically exhausted, knowing that you only have a few hours to recuperate, but being unable to sleep. Other positions in the CIC were a lot less stressful and we rotated off that position after one hour. When things were hectic that was about all anyone could deal with. Other times there might only be one other contact within 20 miles and that would usually be a Soviet electronic intelligence (ELINT) trawler. We were almost always shadowed by at least one. It was a cat and mouse game on both sides. All a Soviet submarine had to do was to check for the US Navy’s AN/SPS-10 surface search radar. Every Navy ship used it continuously. The sub would have been able to detect any US Navy ship within 20 miles in seconds—one reason that we had never detected a Soviet submarine before. The encounter It was just another day at sea, until around 8:00 PM local time, and probably about 50 miles from the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar, when Sonar announced that they had a contact—a possible submarine. We immediately went to condition 1-AS. 1-AS is a modified General Quarters condition where anyone associated with anti-submarine warfare activities would immediately head to their duty stations to replace or supplement the existing watchstanders. All the Sonarmen and Radarmen would head for the CIC. The Helmsmen and other bridge personnel would be replaced with the most experienced crew members. While the ASW Attack Team was effectively at general quarters and ready for war, the rest of the crew might be down on the mess deck watching a movie. We needed to quickly declutter the area. As the ranking officer, our captain had command of our destroyer group. He sent two of the four destroyers towards their destination in Italy. That left my ship, tactical call sign “Tom Boy,” and the USS Wallace L. Lind (DD-703), tactical call sign “Tidal Wave.” I always resented Lind . They had a great tactical call sign, but ours was lame. Why couldn’t we be “Claw Hammer,” or “Wrecking Ball?” I’m sorry, but I’ve been carrying this resentment for over 50 years and I had to get it off my chest! USS Wallace L. Lind (DD-703)., USN Anyway, we may have had the Lind temporarily shut down its active sonar and clear the immediate area while we attempted to classify the contact. Back in 1967 there was no precision navigation, which made this a tricky process. The contact seemed to be moving slowly away from the coast at two knots. But it was possible that we were in a two-knot current and had detected an uncharted pinnacle—an isolated pillar-like elevation rising off the seafloor. Were we in a two-knot current or not? There was no easy way to answer that question in that age and the answer was critically important. I did not know this, but we had a sonar mode that could determine the outline of the object we were tracking by passing directly over it and doing a raster scan. It was called “Aspect Mode.” This was done, and the object it traced out had the distinct shape of a submarine with diving planes. OK… We are tracking a submarine, but who does it belong to? By now, this contact was generating a lot of interest up the chain of command and in short order we were informed that there were no US or NATO submarines in our area. Meanwhile, Sonar had been attempting to contact the sub using an underwater acoustic communication system called “Gertrude.” Gertrude, which I had never heard of until then, was a system that had been in use on most U.S. Navy ships for many years. Presumably, all U.S., and most NATO submarines used this system too. Anyway, this is when I found out that one of my shipmates had a hidden talent. He spoke Russian, but there was no response from the sub in Russian or in English. Not good! The contact was now classified as hostile, and we set about treating it as such. It was still maintaining its course and heading out into the Atlantic at a steady two knots. A lot of radio traffic was passing back and forth from headquarters and within a few hours we knew that this sub was a Russian Foxtrot (its NATO designation). It was a diesel-electric submarine that the Navy had been tracking for some time in the Med. It had managed to slip away and make a submerged transit of the Strait undetected, only to get caught in our sonar web. The Foxtrot had three shafts and three propellers. Its maximum depth was just over 900 feet, and it could stay submerged for at least four days without snorkeling. Submerged, its three main electric motors could produce 5,400 horsepower and drive it through the water at 15 knots, but that would drain the batteries quickly. It also had a separate low-power electric motor called a “creep motor” that would minimize drain on the batteries and help keep the sub very quiet, but the maximum speed using the creep motor was just two knots. The creep motor was rated at only 180 horsepower. The sub displaced 2,515 tons. It was amazing that it could make any headway at all on 180 horsepower. Soviet Foxtrot diesel-electric submarine., USN The Strait of Gibraltar is 36 miles long and seven miles wide at its narrowest. Over 200,000 ships pass through it each year, and many are huge. The water in the Strait consists of a deep layer of salty Mediterranean water flowing west, and a less salty upper layer of Atlantic water flowing east. It sounds simple, like two opposing lanes of traffic on a road, but these two opposing currents produce a chaotic, complex, and ever-changing environment for a submarine. Before attempting a submerged transit of the Strait, the sub would have established their exact position near the eastern entrance by taking bearings to known objects on opposite shores through their periscope and marking up their chart. Their position would be where all the bearing lines crossed. Once submerged to clear surface traffic they would have used dead reckoning to navigate—a process of determining current position from the sub’s heading and estimates of distance traveled based on speed, and time. It is not hard to see that as time passed this method of navigating becomes less and less accurate. Worst of all, they would have suffered from the same navigational limitations that we had—it would have been impossible for them to tell if the submarine was in a current. The sub’s only option would have been to stay deep enough to avoid a collision with a surface vessel and make enough turns to ensure that they were really moving west and were not being pushed backwards by the easterly current. Running at nine or ten knots to insure forward progress against any current, and running on their main motors, they would be draining their batteries quickly, but they had no choice. The captain would have calculated that they would have enough remaining charge to make it out into the Atlantic and clear of shipping where they could surface or snorkel to ventilate the boat and recharge their batteries. Strait of Gibraltar from the air., Florian Sauerland/wikicommons The Foxtrot ’s captain was obviously a very skilled submariner. He had already broken contact with the U.S. Navy in the Med and had begun a submerged transit of the Strait. As he was headed east, there was no way he could have known we were headed directly towards him from the Atlantic, but once out of the Strait and into the Atlantic, he should have heard us coming when we were still at least an hour away. Why didn’t he move to avoid us? Thermoclines It is critically important to both destroyers and submarines that they always know the water conditions that they operate in. At regular intervals, we did a “BT drop.” BT stands for bathythermograph—a device that was dropped from the fantail of the ship on a long steel cable. It recorded depth and water temperature as it was lowered. Submarines would measure temperature versus depth continuously during normal operations. We would both be looking for a layer in the water column where the temperature changed abruptly over a small difference in depth. This is called a thermocline. It can cause active sonar, or any other sounds from the surface, such as a ship’s engines, to bounce off instead of passing through the layer. That acoustic energy would then be trapped between the layer and the sea surface and could travel long distances. A submarine would normally stay above that layer where it could hear danger approaching, and then duck under it to hide. But, if he was hidden under that layer, how did we find him? At this point in my story, I had exhausted my knowledge of underwater acoustics and I could not answer that question. I needed to do more research. Among the large amount of information available on the Internet, I found an abstract of a research study that was done by the Acoustical Society of America. Here is a quote from the very first sentence: “ Measurements were made at sea of the changes in acoustic intensity in passing from a shadow zone through the limiting ray and into the directly ensonified region .” One sentence into this abstract and I already had to stop and look up ensonified! Ensonify (Verb): to fill with sound. That sounded important! but I was also confronted with two more new terms! Shadow Zones, Limiting Rays, and the directly ensonified region The horizontal axis is compressed to fit on the page., Juan Rivera’s Illustration There is something called a limiting ray. Think of it as a mythical being like a unicorn. When sound reaches the layer, it can either pass through the layer or bounce off like a flat stone tossed across a smooth lake. It all depends on the angle. At angles greater than the limiting ray, sound will pass through the layer and into an area called the directly ensonified region. Remember, ensonify means “to fill with sound.” Submarines will want to avoid this area for obvious reasons. At angles less than the limiting ray, sound will reflect off the layer back towards the surface, creating an area bounded by the layer and the limiting ray called the shadow zone. In the shadow zone, little sonar energy will penetrate, and submarines often use this area to hide and attempt to avoid detection. In my illustration above I would need to make it about four feet wide to be accurate, and the angle between the limiting ray and the layer would be only a few degrees. AN/SQS-23 Sonar Operator Performance Standards Guide for Detection and Tracking, April 13, 1979., DTIC online document Theories are important, but actual test data is hard to beat. I was lucky to find a report of a real-world test that was conducted using the same AN/SQS-23 sonar that we had on our ship. It included the graph above. During the test, the submarine’s depth was 600 feet and there was a layer at 300 feet. The theoretical data I found would suggest that the limiting ray was like a light switch—on one side nothing would penetrate the layer and on the other side sound would flood in as if there was no layer at all. The graph above suggests otherwise. Looking at the graph It appears that the transition between the directly ensonified region and the shadow zone (the limiting ray) occurs about 3,000 yards from the ship. But instead of cutting off abruptly, the transition between the directly ensonified region closest to the ship, and the shadow zone, appears to be about one mile wide. In the directly ensonified region, the chance of detection is close to 100 percent. In the shadow zone it quickly drops to 10 percent or less. And in a space of just 500 yards, the chance of detection rose from 30 percent to 85 percent. At 20 knots we would cover that distance in 45 seconds. The graph also shows that some subs are occasionally detected in that shadow zone, so it is not a perfect hiding place for them. I think this explains why we were almost on top of that sub before we detected its presence. As our limiting ray passed over them at 20 knots, the shadow zone that was hiding them was also moving with the ship and it was quickly replaced by the directly ensonified region. Suddenly we had a strong sonar contact. As for the sub, as the song goes, “If it weren’t for bad luck they wouldn’t have no luck at all.” After all the Foxtrot crew had gone through to this point, they probably were not in the best of shape when we detected them. I think they knew we were headed directly towards them long before we arrived, and if they had a fully charged battery they could have sprinted away to safety at 15 knots submerged. But I believe they simply did not have the remaining battery capacity, so they ducked below the layer and hoped for the best. Once detected, the Foxtrot captain had to be asking himself, “how much longer can I stay submerged before my air goes bad and my batteries go completely dead?” Meanwhile, back on the surface, we had organized ourselves and we were preparing for a lengthy engagement. We had all the time in the world. The sub did not. Trapped Our active bow-mounted sonar was our only tracking tool and it had limits. There is always a blind sector directly behind the ship called the baffles, where the hull of the ship and its turbulent wake block the sonar. In those days, when two destroyers were prosecuting a sonar contact, it was critical that as one ship passed over the contact and then lost it in the baffles, the other ship was inbound and was able to regain contact quickly. Close coordination was critical, and a lot of things could go wrong when two warships were maneuvering at high speed near each other at night. We used two VHF voice nets to coordinate—PRITAC and SECTAC (Primary and Secondary Tactical.) Our two bridges would have been in constant contact on PRITAC and the two CICs would have been using SECTAC. These days every ship in the area would probably be on an encrypted mesh network with a satellite link back to headquarters. During this delicate dance, the inbound ship was called “Brother” and the outbound ship, that had lost contact in its baffles, was called “Sister.” Brother is in charge. The two of us maneuvered in separate circles like two meshed gears—one in the clockwise direction and the other moving counter-clockwise. As the inbound ship (Brother) passed over the contact, its CIC would mark the datum over the SECTAC net. Sister would update their datum based on Brother’s exact radar position when datum was called out. Each would then adjust their track to pass over the new datum on the next pass. Communications might go something like this: “Tidal Wave this is Tom Boy. I am Brother. You are Sister. Stand by for datum. Now, Now, NOW!… Contact lost in baffles. You are Brother. I am Sister…” And then, as we swung around to regain contact, the cycle would repeat with Tidal Wave as Brother. A word of explanation is in order here. The datum is the last known location of the contact. It starts out as a point, but rapidly expands into a widening circular Area of Uncertainty, or AoU, based on the passage of time and the maximum speed of the sub. In our case, it probably took at least 30 seconds between the time one ship lost contact in its baffles, and reacquisition by the incoming ship. At a maximum submerged speed of 15 knots, the sub could sprint about 265 yards in 30 seconds, which means that the datum would expand to an AoU of just over 500 yards in diameter, or one quarter of a mile before the next ship could attempt to reacquire the contact. Based on those 1979 test results, the sub might have had a reasonable chance of losing us if he could have made it three miles while we chased a decoy or were confused by a noise maker. I think he came close several times. There were no datalinks, and all this action was coordinated over the two tactical voice nets and sound-powered phones talking between each CIC and their respective bridges. All documentation would have been by hand in paper logs and using a DRT (Dead Reckoning Tracer). Actual DRT trace showing the last few hours of the engagement., Juan Rivera The DRT was an electromechanical system that projected colored spots up and onto a piece of thin tracing paper that was firmly taped to the glass top surface of the DRT cabinet. The projector ran on a pair of X/Y axis jackscrews. It was driven by the gyrocompass and the pitot log, so it followed the path of the ship across the ocean surface. The various colored dots were assigned to track the ship’s position, as well as inputs from radar and sonar data. You manually marked up the paper with a pencil by following the colored dots and annotating the trace with details such as the time or target ID. When you look at the plot, all the circular paths are the two destroyers and the straighter line in the middle of it all is the sub. Notice how crazy things look in the upper right as the submarine became increasingly desperate. Endgame The fleeing Foxtrot was probably reaching the end of its endurance—the air was probably barely breathable, and the batteries were probably almost exhausted. Its crew tried everything it could to lose their two tormentors. They tried going deep, launching a decoy, then backing up their own wake and sprinting off in a new direction. Nothing they tried worked for long. The next morning a Lockheed P-3 Orion ASW aircraft joined us from our naval base at Rota, Spain. The P-3 was a four-engine turboprop, and once on station it could shut down and feather one or two engines to reduce fuel consumption and increase endurance for up to 17 hours. It carried a host of offensive weapons in its bomb bay plus sonobuoys and a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) that looked like a big stinger that protruded from the tail. When using the MAD gear, it flew very low and when it detected an anomaly, it could be set to automatically drop a flare at night or a smoke pot during daylight hours. That was extremely helpful as the bridge crews could use the last flare or smoke pot as the datum and steer for it when making each new pass. A P-3 over Gibraltar. , USN By the night of the 22nd, the sub’s crew must have been completely demoralized, exhausted and miserable. Our sonar pings and our high-speed propellers could all easily be heard throughout the sub, just as it is depicted in every World War II submarine movie. Meanwhile, we had perfected our routine and were prepared to continue indefinitely, or until the sub gave up and surfaced. It was just a matter of time… At this point we had been tracking the sub for 26 hours. Actually “tracking” does not describe what we had been doing to that submarine crew psychologically. Essentially, we had been conducting a continuous 26-hour depth charge attack and making it crystal clear that in a real engagement they would have all been dead after our first pass the previous evening. Finally, at around 10:00 PM that night sonar heard hull popping sounds. The sub’s pressure hull was expanding as it rose towards the surface. They were giving up. We took up station 1,000 yards on either side of its position and waited… After the Foxtrot surfaced, the P-3 lit it up with a 70-million candlepower searchlight and made several photo passes. Their humiliation was complete. At the time, small disposable film cameras were popular. They used a little flash bulb the size of a peanut. Several of my shipmates lined the deck and were flashing away at that small black sub half a mile away in the dark. Those little flash bulbs barely lit up the lifeline a few feet in front of them. That was a funny sight! A Foxtrot surfaced. This image is not taken during the incident being described, but gives an idea of what one looks like when surfaced and some of its crew are getting some much needed fresh air., USN Eventually, we all began to lose interest. The P-3 was low on fuel and headed back to Rota, and we broke off contact and turned towards Gibraltar. Half an hour later, the P-3 returned unexpectedly and told us that they had been instructed to maintain contact until a fresh P-3 arrived to replace them. They asked us for a vector back to the sub. We had lost it on radar quite some time ago and we had no idea where it was. If the sub took off at its maximum snorkeling speed, the area of uncertainty would have grown to about 15 miles in diameter. Oh, well. I think we had made our point. As the song goes, “If you see me comin,’ better step aside. A lotta men didn’t, a lotta men died.” The following morning, we received congratulations from the Commander of the Sixth Fleet and the Commander of Anti-Submarine Forces in the Atlantic. Messages sent to Steinaker on January 22, 1967, Courtesy of Juan Rivera There were a total of 75 Foxtrot subs built between 1958 and 1979. It is hard to tell how many were active in January 1967, but Soviet deck logs show that at least 10 were in the Mediterranean that year. This is B-840, a Project 641 class sub—its deck log says it was forced to surface in the northeastern Atlantic in 1967. That fits, but the rest of the single-sentence log entry does not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 11, 2021",Russia Says It Is Drawing Down Forces Near Ukraine But We Know Not Everyone Is Going Home,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian Defense Ministry Sergei Shoigu has said the worrying troop buildup in areas along Russia’s borders with Ukraine will come to end, starting tomorrow, with the bulk of the forces returning to their home stations. However, it remains to be seen what this drawdown will actually amount to, especially when considering previous Russian pronouncements regarding troop withdrawals . At least some of these forces already set to remain permanently in the Crimea region . Significant stockpiles of heavy weapons, including tanks, self-propelled howitzers , rocket artillery systems, and Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles , will also stay where they are in southwestern Russia, too. This is ostensibly to keep them prepositioned for a major exercise in the fall, but would also keep them in place near Ukraine should a new crisis erupt. Shoigu announced the successful end of what Russian authorities had officially described as a major readiness exercise during a meeting with other officials in Crimea, with the press in attendance, on April 22, 2021. The buildup had begun in March and had prompted concerns, including from the United States and NATO, that a new crisis between Russia and Ukraine was imminent. The two countries have been engaged in something of shadow war since 2014, when the Kremlin took control of Crimea and then began actively supporting nominally local “separatists” in areas of eastern Ukraine known collectively as the Donbass. The separatist groups have direct links , to Russian intelligence agencies and their forces are bolstered by actual Russian military units . Russian BMD-series airborne infantry fighting vehicles and their crews prepare to load onto Il-76 transport aircraft during recent drills in Crimea., Russian MoD capture “I believe that the surprise inspection’s goals have been achieved in full,” Shoigu said . “The troops demonstrated ability to reliably defend the country. Therefore, I have made a decision to complete the inspection measures in the Southern and Western Military Districts.” “The reduction of troops on our border proportionally reduces tension. [Ukraine] is always vigilant, yet welcomes any steps to decrease the military presence & deescalate the situation in Donbas,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had recently challenged his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to meet him face-to-face in eastern Ukraine, writing on Twitter. “Ukraine seeks peace. Grateful to international partners for their support.” The exact size and scope of the Russian buildup near Ukraine remain unclear. The Russian Ministry of Defense said that more than 10,000 troops, 40 warships, and 1,200 “units of equipment,” typically a reference to tanks and other heavy weapons, had taken part in recent exercises specifically in and around Crimea. Footage of these drills that the Russian Ministry of Defense released, along with other videos that emerged online, show a full spectrum of capabilities involving forces on land, in the air, and in the Black Sea. Airborne forces conducted parachute drops, including of BMD-series air-droppable infantry fighting vehicles, while other troops conducted helicopter-borne air assaults, the latter tactic being an important component of how Russian took control of Crimea seven years ago. Naval forces conducted landing exercises that involved various kinds of amphibious warfare vessels, including Serna class landing craft that had come all the way from the Caspian Sea. Various tanks and self-propelled artillery systems also participated in the drills. Su-24 Fencer swing-wing combat jets and Su-30 fighters also took part, with the latter being show armed with Kh-31 anti-ship missiles . Those aircraft, combined with the anti-ship missile capabilities found in the ships and submarines of the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet, as well as the Bal and Bastion-P shore-based anti-ship missile systems in Crimea, underscore the significant capabilities that the Russians can bring to bear to fend off any attempt to storm the Peninsula by sea. Tor-M2 surface-to-air missile systems were also seen in the footage. It’s not clear if any of the longer-range air defenses Russia has deployed to Crimea since 2014, which include S-400 SAM batteries and that form an additional component of the country’s significant anti-access and area denial bubble in the region, directly took part in the exercises. It’s also interesting to note that at least one Orion drone , a rough equivalent to the U.S. MQ-1 Predator that can carry various small munitions and that Russians say they have field tested in Syria , also made an appearance. However, these drills, which are similar to ones that have occurred in the past , are just one facet of the Russian military buildup near Ukraine. Earlier this week, Josep Borrell, the European Union’s (EU) top foreign policy official had said that, since March, it was estimated that over 150,000 Russian troops had been deployed to the country’s southwestern regions, as a whole. EU officials subsequently revised that figure downward to over 100,000. Not all of these units are now heading back to their main bases. Three divisions from Russia’s Airborne Forces, commonly referred to by the acronym VDV, as well as one field army each from the Central and Southern Military Districts, were the only units that the Russian Ministry Defense specifically identified as preparing to leave the region. There does not appear any word yet about what might happen to any of the air or naval assets that have flooded into the region in the past month or so. It has already been announced that the VDV’s 56th Guards Air Assault Brigade will be reformed into a separate regiment based in Crimea proper, as well. Beyond that, Shoigu made clear that the actual equipment belonging to the Central Military District’s 41st Army would remain in a massive camp established at the Pogonovo Training Area, south of the Russian city of Voronezh, which lies less than 120 miles from the Ukrainian border. Satellite imagery, together with video and pictures that have emerged online in the past few weeks, shows that there are significant numbers of tanks, self-propelled howitzers, artillery rocket launchers, and Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles, among other assets, now parked Pogonovo. The stated reason for this is to avoid having to bring all this equipment back for the 2021 iteration of the Zapad exercise, a huge training event that Russia holds every four years across the western portion of the country together with forces from neighboring Belarus . Of course, this also means that troops could be rushed back to the area before then to join this prepositioned stockpile should a new Russia-Ukraine crisis emerge. This latest buildup had already included forces previously deployed to the region for exercises, which had remained there after those drills had wrapped up. That unexpected development was among the factors that had prompted concerns about the true intentions of what the Kremlin only later publicly claimed was a part of a “surprise inspection” of the readiness of various units across the country. It’s also unclear whether Shoigu’s declaration that the recent drills were a success and are now over means that the Russian government’s plans to wall off a significant portion of the northeastern Black Sea, effectively blocking access to critical ports in eastern Ukraine, for the next six months would still go into effect. This would include the Kerch Strait, which links to the Sea of Azov to the rest of the Black Sea and was the site of a major altercation between Russian and Ukrainian forces in 2018. Russia detained 23 Ukrainian sailors and seizing a number of small vessels belonging to Ukraine’s Navy in what became a major international incident that also sparked fears of more open conflict between the two countries. If nothing has changed, these new maritime restrictions, which had been linked to unspecified naval exercises, will begin on April 24 and run through October 31. Russia had also curtailed access to certain airspace in the region in relation to the recent drills in Crimea, but it’s not clear if those restrictions are still in place. “This represents yet another unprovoked escalation in Moscow’s ongoing campaign to undermine and destabilize Ukraine,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price had said in a statement on April 19. “This development is particularly troubling amid credible reports of Russian troop buildup in occupied Crimea and around Ukraine’s borders, now at levels not seen since Russia’s invasion in 2014, and other provocative actions by Russia-led forces at the Line of Contact [in the Donbass].” NATO and the EU also criticized the planned restrictions . On top of all this, fighting has recently spiked in the Donbass and a water crisis in Crimea remains unresolved. It had been posited that one of the driving factors behind Russia’s recent buildup might have been to coerce Ukraine somehow into supplying water to the peninsula, something it has refused to do since 2014, or to simply provoke a conflict in which it could occupy new territory and physically gain access to additional sources of freshwater. All told, there are still significant underlying issues that could easily lead to a new crisis between the two countries. “I hope that no one will think of crossing the red line with Russia. And where this line will be, in every particular case, we will determine it ourselves,” Russian President Vladimir Putin warned , somewhat cryptically, in his annual state-of-the-nation address yesterday. “We want good relations…and really don’t want to burn bridges,” he continued . “But if someone mistakes our good intentions for indifference or weakness and intends to burn down or even blow up these bridges, they should know that Russia’s response will be asymmetrical, swift, and harsh.” The Russian government, and Putin in particular, is facing an unusually strong wave of pressure, both on the international stage and domestically, in no small part over the fate of Alexei Navalny. Navalny, a long-time critic of Putin’s and general anti-corruption activist , who survived an assassination attempt by the Kremlin last year, is now in a potentially life-threatening state in a Russian prison. He was convicted of numerous charges, which he and his lawyers have decried as politically motivated, earlier this year and went on hunger strike over his imprisonment last month. His health has since deteriorated dramatically, drawing criticism and concern from multiple countries, including the United States, which has said the Kremlin will be held accountable if he dies. The U.S. government also recently expelled a number of Russian diplomats in retaliation for Russian government interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and a massive cybersecurity breach that impacted numerous American government agencies. The government of Czechia did the same just days ago after establishing links between a unit of the Russian Military’s Main Directorate intelligence agency, more commonly known as the GRU, and a mysterious explosion at military munitions warehouse in 2014. This same unit has been implicated in numerous assassinations and assassination attempts, including the attempt to kill Navalny in 2020. A crisis with Ukraine, now or in the future, could simply offer a way to distract from all of this, too. With all this in mind, it’s certainly a hopeful development that Russia says it will pull at least some its forces currently positioned along its border with Ukraine. Regardless, Russia’s actual actions show that it is fully prepared to go right back to this near-crisis state, and do so quickly, if and when it feels doing so would be in its interests. All told, only time will tell just how much of a drawdown the Kremlin will actually carry out. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Stephen Walker,"Updated on May 6, 2021",All B-1B Bombers Have Been Grounded (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On April 8, B-1B Lancer serial number 86-0104 experienced a ground emergency relating to an augmenter fuel pump filter housing, after landing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota. Air Force Global Strike Command’s public affairs office has now confirmed that subsequent precautionary one-time inspections carried out on all B-1B aircraft as a result of the discrepancy produced concerning enough results that more invasive inspections were ordered, along with a fleet-wide grounding earlier this week. The inspections will be performed under the guidance of a Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO), and each jet will be returned to service individually upon completion. There is no timeline presently for when the B-1Bs are expected to be flying again. Air Force Global Strike Command’s (AFGSC) public affairs office told us that other bombers — B-52 and B-2 aircraft — will continue to support combatant commands across the globe. USAF The immediate inspection of 86-0104 on April 8 revealed a massive hole in the filter housing. This filter is on the outside of the F101-GE-102 engine, but plays a crucial role. Needless to say, with a hole, it leaks large amounts of fuel. 86-0104 had been seen trailing a large plume of unburned fuel on landing. A pressurized fuel leak is a hazard in itself, but if the filter housing is not functioning properly, the pilots cannot select augmented thrust — better known as afterburners. Without afterburners, the available thrust is significantly reduced. The F101 is rated at 17,390 pounds for maximum military power (dry thrust). Maximum afterburner almost doubles available thrust at 30,780 pounds, and is needed for emergencies and some maneuvers. Above all else, afterburner operation is critical for B-1 takeoffs . B-1s cannot fly at all without properly functioning afterburners. B-1B in afterburner at takeoff., USAF This incident and resulting safety stand down is the latest in a long line of problems the B-1B fleet has faced in recent years. In fact, this isn’t even the first failure and stand down for this exact part. In 2018, the augmenter pump filter housing failed on serial number 86-0109 as well. At length, we’ve documented the various stand-downs, overhauls , and upgrades the B-1 fleet has needed to make it to its eventual replacement by the B-21 . The most impactful stand down in recent years was the result of a failed ejection and subsequent emergency landing in Midland, Texas, which we wrote about here and here . As The War Zone was first to detail , restrictions have been placed on the oft-ailing B-1’s operations, including on the aircraft’s once-prominent low-level flying capabilities, in an effort to preserve the fleet, 17 of which are now being retired as a result of that same initiative. As it sits now, just 45 examples will remain in service until the type’s retirement in the 2030s. U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Chase Ferrell, 7th Component Maintenance Squadron, closely inspects the outer components of a General Electric F101 turbofan engine from a B-1B Lancer., USAF We will update this article as more details emerge. UPDATE, 3:50 PM EST: Air Force Global Strike Command has now provided the following full statement on this grounding and events leading up to it: The Air Force Global Strike Command commander, Gen. Tim Ray, ordered a safety stand-down of the B-1B Lancer fleet April 20. The safety of Airmen is the command’s top priority. During the inspection process following a B-1B ground emergency on April 8 at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, a discrepancy with an Augmenter Fuel Pump Filter Housing was discovered. As a precautionary measure, the commander directed one-time inspections on all B-1B aircraft to resolve this issue. After further analysis, the commander stood down the fleet because it was determined a more invasive inspection was needed to ensure the safety of aircrews. Individual aircraft will return to flight when they are deemed safe to fly by Air Force officials. The Air Force takes all incidents seriously and works diligently to identify and correct potential causes. More details may be released when available. Air Force Global Strike bombers will continue supporting combatant commands across the globe.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2021",Syrian Surface-To-Air Missile Flew Way Off Course Triggering Alarms Before Exploding Over Israel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A rogue Syrian surface-to-air missile detonated over southern Israel earlier today, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed . The incident triggered warning sirens in Israel amid initial fears that the country’s secretive Dimona nuclear reactor could be under attack. In fact, the missile — identified by an Israeli military spokesman as coming from a Cold War-era Soviet-made SA-5 Gammon long-range surface-to-air missile system — was one of several fired by Syrian government forces in response to Israeli strikes in that country, likely directed against an Iranian proxy target. An Israeli Air Force F-15I Ra’am fighter jet, typically tasked with long-range strike missions., AP Clearly, this particular missile missed its intended target and continued toward Israel before detonating in the air. The Israeli military stated that their air defense systems had attempted to carry out an interception of the Syrian missile, but it was unsuccessful. In the past, Israel has even called upon the high-end Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile to intercept similar surface-to-air missiles fired at Israeli jets that had struck targets in southern Syria. A spokesman from the Israel Defense Forces said that what was left of the SA-5 missile landed around 19 miles from the Dimona nuclear facility, which is located approximately 125 miles south of the Syrian border. Debris apparently from this missile came down in the village of Ashalim, located in the Negev desert in southern Israel, around 21 miles south of the city of Be’er Sheva. There were no reports of injuries or damage. Syria’s SANA state news agency confirmed that there had been an Israeli strike in the suburbs of the capital, Damascus, and that Syrian air defenses had responded — the SA-5 was almost certainly launched as part of these salvos, although the precise nature of the Israeli attack is unclear. In the past, Israeli Air Force fighter jets have carried out raids over Syrian territory, or have otherwise launched standoff weapons from outside Syrian airspace, often times over Lebanon. “Air defenses intercepted the rockets and downed most of them,” the news agency said. While it was not made clear what kind of attack was prosecuted by the Israeli side, SANA added that four soldiers were injured in the attack, which caused some material damage. According to Reuters , a Syrian military defector said the Israeli reprisal strikes targeted objectives near the town of Dumayr, around 25 miles northeast of Damascus. Among others, this is home to an airbase that has hosted both Iranian-backed militias and Russian government forces in the past. It has been subject to previous Israeli attacks and has been repeatedly alleged to house weapons depots belonging to the Iran-backed militias in the country. A Syrian military source told the state news agency SANA: “The Israeli enemy launched an aerial aggression with waves of missiles from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan [Heights] targeting some of the sites in the surroundings of Damascus. The army air defenses intercepted the hostile missiles and downed most of them.” The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that an air defense base was hit in Dumayr, killing a Syrian Army officer. Israel responded to the errant missile by conducting further airstrikes in Syria. Targets comprised several air defense sites, including the one responsible for launching the SA-5. The incident, in fact, bears many of the hallmarks of a previous one, in July 2019, when another Syrian SA-5 missile landed in Cyprus, near the capital, Nicosia. On that occasion, which you can read more about here , the missile was launched in response to large-scale Israel airstrikes on various targets in Syria. The SA-5 missile in question apparently passed over Lebanon and across a stretch of the Mediterranean before coming down in Cyprus. It’s notable that the distance from Damascus to Cyprus, approximately 200 miles, is broadly similar to that between Damascus and Ashalim in Israel, which is around 185 miles. The SA-5 missile system — also known by its Russian S-200 designation — has an effective range of around 190 miles. Israel targeting the particular air defense site responsible for engaging, or attempting to engage, its strike packages is an established tactic as well. Back in October 2017, for example, Israeli fighter jets destroyed another Syrian SA-5 site after it launched a missile, unsuccessfully, against an Israeli aircraft on a “routine reconnaissance mission” over Lebanon. You can read about that incident here . In both this latest incident, and the previous one over Cyprus, the SA-5 missile was at the very edge of its envelope when it detonated; self-destruction can be triggered for various reasons, including once the missile reaches a certain altitude. The likelihood of these missiles going rogue is also increased by the tactics of Syrian air defense operators. In the past, Syrian SAMs have been launched ballistically, without even acquiring a target, as part of a largely futile tactic to sow confusion among the attacking force and put them on the defensive. A ballistic launch also has the effect of appearing like Syrian air defenses are actually doing something to fend off Israeli attacks and fits Damascus’s propaganda that it usually does so with a near-perfect success rate, which is far from reality. The track record of the SA-5 in Syrian service has been patchy, to say the least. It was this missile system that accidentally downed a Russian Il-20 Coot electronic intelligence-gathering plane off the Syrian coast in September 2018. On the other hand, some Soviet-era systems have had success in Syrian hands, notably the surface-to-air missile system that shot down an Israeli F-16I fighter jet during an intense period of aerial activity over Syria in February 2018. Israel claims this was due to an error by the aircrew of some kind, not Syria’s air defense prowess. The latest incident comes amid heightened tensions between Israel and Iran, including concerns about Iran’s nuclear program and a mysterious attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear site earlier this month. Officials in Tehran described this as an act of “ nuclear terrorism ” and blamed Israel. It’s still unclear what exactly happened at Natanz, some reports suggesting a cyberattack that cut the power to the facility, others suggesting the use of an explosive charge . In the wake of that attack, Iran has stepped up its pledged to boost its uranium enrichment levels from 20% to 60%, almost at the purity required to produce nuclear weapons. At the same time, Iranian authorities continue to assert that the country’s present nuclear program is entirely civilian in nature. A missile and launcher from the long-range SA-5 Gammon system., DAVID BIRKAS/WIKICOMMONS Aside from the attack on Natanz, it’s becoming increasingly clear that a major proxy war is being fought between Israel and Iran across the region. In recent months, this has included clandestine Israeli attacks on Iranian ships carrying oil , as well as weaponry, to Syria. Israel has also been blamed for the attack earlier this month on the Iranian cargo ship M/V Saviz , which is widely understood to be a covert mothership operated by that country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC. For its part, Iran may have also been involved in a series of attacks on shipping, including against more than one Israeli-owned cargo vessel. Most recently, the Israeli-owned Hyperion Ray , was reportedly the victim of an attack in the Gulf of Oman. Meanwhile, with the Israeli government making it clear on numerous occasions that it sees Tehran’s growing influence in the Middle East as an existential threat, the Israeli military has been carrying out a campaign directed against Iranian-backed groups in Syria itself (as well as in Lebanon and Iraq). There have been reports in recent weeks that Israeli air defenses around both the Dimona reactor and the Red Sea port of Eilat were being bolstered amid fears of potential long-range missile or drone strikes launched by Iranian-backed forces, perhaps even by those operating in Yemen or Syria. Indeed, some early reports about the incident outside Dimona suggested it was the reactor itself that was under attack, but there is no evidence that was the case. Such cause for alarm is not unwarranted, either, with Syria in the past has threatened to respond to Israel Air Force strikes into Syrian territory with their own attacks against Israeli territory, including using Scud ballistic missiles . Since Israel has been squarely blamed for the attack on Natanz, a tit-for-tat Iranian strike aimed against Israeli nuclear infrastructure is also by no means unthinkable. A Syrian-operated Scud ballistic missile on its transporter-erector-launcher., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Overall, the latest errant SAM event over Israel, although alarming, is perhaps best understood as evidence of the continued chasm in capabilities between the Syrian government forces and those of Israel. What is more, the rapid response by Israel in attacking the responsible SA-5 site once again underscores that country’s hardline approach to Syrian foibles, as well as the commitment to doing whatever is necessary to protect its aircrews and citizens.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 20, 2021",Watch This CV-22 Osprey’s Rotor Downwash Absolutely Demolish A Hospital’s Helipad,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A hospital in the United Kingdom is currently unable to receive patients directly via air ambulance helicopters after the powerful downwash from a U.S. Air Force CV-22B Osprey tiltrotor destroyed its helipad. The Osprey had touched down at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge yesterday as part of a training exercise. Spokespersons for the Air Force, Cambridge University Hospitals , which includes Addenbrooke’s, and East Anglian Air Ambulance (EAAA), one of a number of air ambulance services that regularly flies to this particular hospital, all confirmed the incident , which occurred on April 21, 2021, and did not cause any injuries. A video, seen below, has appeared online showing the CV-22B landing vertically, without incident, on the grass next to Addenbrooke’s helipad, which consisted of rubber matting. It was during takeoff that downward force from the aircraft’s rotors sent the matting, along with other debris, flying. “The area was surveyed according to our policies and procedures and some damage did occur,” a spokesperson for the Air Force’s 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Mildenhall, told ITV News . “We are taking steps to rectify as soon as possible.” RAF Mildenhall is also home to the Air Force’s 352nd Special Operations Wing . That Wing includes the 7th Special Operations Squadron, which is equipped with the CV-22B. “While our normal helipad is being repaired air ambulances will temporarily land at nearby Cambridge City Airport and patients are then transferred to the hospital in road ambulances with critical care staff on board, meaning we can continue to see and treat them as normal,” a Cambridge University Hospitals spokesperson also told ITV . “Due to an incident at the Cambridge University Hospitals helipad involving a military aircraft on Wednesday 21 April the helipad [at Addenbrooke’s] is temporarily unavailable to air ambulances,” Dr. Victor Inyang, EAAA’s Medical Director, added in a statement to that outlet. “It will be possible for the EAAA helipad [at Cambridge City Airport] to be used as an alternative landing site during this time and have patients transferred to Addenbrooke’s from there by land ambulance.” Despite the statements from Cambridge University Hospitals and EAAA, the loss of the helipad at Addenbrooke’s could be cause for concern. Medical professionals often refer to the “ golden hour ,” the first 60 minutes after someone experiences a traumatic and potentially life-threatening episode of some kind, during which there is the best chance to save, as well as avoid any serious complications. While there is an ongoing debate about the exact length of this treatment window , not being able to fly air ambulances directly to the hospital can only add time before a critically injured patient begins receiving care in an actual hospital, at least to some degree. “Addenbrooke’s is the major trauma center for the region, therefore quick and efficient transfer of critically ill or injured patients to the hospital is vital,” EAAA Medical Director Dr. Inyang noted. Plane spotters on the ground during the incident were also worried that the flying debris could have damaged the Osprey or hit bystanders on the ground. These are very real concerns, as The War Zone explored in depth as part of our reporting regarding the misuse of U.S. Army National Guard helicopters to fly very low over protesters in Washington, D.C., last year, something you can read about in more detail here . “I saw debris flying up in the air, my biggest fear was the helicopter. The worry was if the debris went above the roter [sic] it could have damaged the aircraft or, even worse, the people,” Elliot Langran, a plane spotter who witnessed the incident, told ITV . “I’ve been all over the place across the world, but I’ve never seen anything like this.” This is, however, not the first time an Osprey has been involved in a similar incident. A U.S. Marine Corps MV-22B Osprey injured 10 people during an event on Memorial Day in 2010 in Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island in New York City, when its downwash sent tree branches and other debris flying into a crowd as it came in to land. The potential risks posed by the immense downward force from the Osprey’s rotors during vertical takeoffs and landings are well established at this point. Marine MV-22s were notably restricted in where they could operate from during disaster relief operations in Nepal following a massive earthquake in that country in 2015 in part due to concerns that their downwash could knock down already structurally weakened buildings. The heat from the downward-facing engine exhausts when Ospreys operate in their vertical takeoff and landing mode also requires that landing areas, both on land and on ships , be strengthened to mitigate wear and tear. This does not appear to have been an immediate factor in this incident, though. Thankfully in this particular incident, no one was injured. Hopefully, Addenbrooke’s Hospital’s helipad will be back in operation soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 19, 2021",Navy Destroyers Sport Large Satcom Domes On Their Flight Decks For Big Drone Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Zumwalt class stealth destroyer USS Michael Monsoor was spotted leaving San Diego yesterday with a large satellite communications dome temporarily installed on its flight deck. The appearance of this system on the ship came just a day after the U.S. Navy kicked off a huge experimental exercise focused on exploring new concepts for how unmanned platforms in the air, on the surface, and under the waves can work together with their manned counterparts. The Michael Monsoor is participating in this event, formally known as Unmanned Integrated Battle Problem 21, or UxS IBP 21, with an emphasis on serving as a key afloat command and control center. Twitter user @CJR1321 grabbed pictures of the Michael Monsoor , also referred to by its hull number DDG-1001, with its new addition, head out of San Diego on April 20, 2021, sharing them with our friends over at @warshipcam , who in turn posted them on Twitter. That Navy also released pictures of its two Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessels (MDUSV) sailing together out of San Diego Bay, with the destroyer in its current configuration visible in the background. The Zumwalt class stealth destroyer USS Michael Monsoor spotted leaving San Diego on April 20, 2021, with a large satellite communications dome on its rear flight deck., @cjr1321 via @Warshipcam The US Navy’s Sea Hunter MDUSV in San Diego on April 20, 2021, with the USS Michael Monsoor seen in the background with its new satcom dome., USN The Michael Monsoor “will use the ship’s unique capabilities to command and control manned and unmanned forces to conduct long-range, multi-domain fires,” Navy Lieutenant Tim Pietrack, a spokesperson for the service, had told USNI News in March as part of a larger discussion of the UxS IBP 21 experiment. UxS IBP 21 officially started on April 19 and is scheduled to run through April 26. You can read more about it, in general, in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting here. The addition of a more robust satellite communication systems onto the Michael Monsoor for this event would make good sense in this context. While we don’t know the exact extent of the networking additions to the destroyer, the dome looks extremely similar, if not identical to those used in the Orbit AL-series of maritime very-small-aperture satellite terminals, or VASTs. A picture of the AL-7208 VSAT dome and the antenna that sits inside. Other Orbit AL-series terminals use this same dome., Orbit “The AL-7208 stabilized VSAT antenna system is a 2.4m (96″) linear & circular Ku & C-Band antenna providing Global Satellite TV & Data services, from Shore to Mid Ocean,” according to Orbit’s website . “Designed for both military & commercial applications, AL-7208 is deployed aboard cargo & cruise ships, tankers, fishing boats, oil & gas rigs, patrol & combat vessels, and various other marine vessels around the world and, supports a wide range of satellites and polarizations. The AL-7208 is an efficient, proven, robust and reliable marine stabilized satellite TV antenna systems guaranteeing worldwide coverage for uninterrupted high quality satellite reception, even under extreme weather conditions.” It is, of course, important to point out that we cannot see inside the dome to know exactly what kind of antenna is installed. It’s also interesting to note that @CJR1321 also spotted the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Spruance , another UxS IBP 21 participant, with a similar large satcom dome in a temporary position on its flight deck. That ship is also one of a growing number of Arleigh Burkes equipped with the Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN) laser directed energy weapon, which is designed to blind electro-optical and infrared optics, including sensors on aircraft, ships, and submarines, including aerial drones, which present real and growing threats to the service’s fleets. It can also be employed against seekers on incoming missiles, throwing them off course. Added network connectivity would mesh well with the already robust sensor fusion and command and control capabilities found on the Michael Monsoor , as well as her two sister ships, the USS Zumwalt and the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson . The current configuration of these ships includes a dual X and Ka-band satellite communications system, linked to a low-profile dome on top of the deckhouse, as well as extremely-high-frequency (EHF) and ultra-high-frequency (UHF) communications systems with their antennas fitted to the side of that same superstructure. Two more Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) antennas are at the very front of the top of the deckhouse. An infographic showing the various existing antennas, among other features, on the DDG-1000s., David Heath/USN It’s not clear what level of satellite communications functionality the Michael Monsoor has at present, though the dome associated with the X-Ka-band system is present on the ship. In July 2020, the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) had announced that it had hired Ball Aerospace to develop a “low-observable [stealthy] SATCOM antenna system that can support multiple links in the S-, C-, X-, Ku-, K-, Ka- and Q-band signals” for these destroyers. It’s unclear if this meant that the Navy had decided not to fit the ships with the planned X-Ka-band antenna at all. Regardless, the addition of the system on the ship’s rear flight deck, as well as the appearance of a similar system on Spruance , make clear that additional satellite communications bandwidth is necessary for this experiment. All of the information from whatever communications systems are presently installed on the Michael Monsoor, along with data from the destroyers’ radars and other sensors, as well as offboard platforms, then feeds into their sci-fi-esque Ship’s Mission Center (SMC). The SMC has an advanced and largely unique combat system, distinct from the better known Aegis system , which has a Linux-based computing backend called the Total Shipboard Computing Environment (TSCE) at its core. It has more in common with larger land-based command centers than traditional Combat Information Centers (CIC) on Navy ships. The SMC, which you can read more about here , is designed to be readily reconfigurable in terms of capabilities in order to allow the relatively rapid integration of new systems and general functionality. That seems to be exactly what we’re seeing here with the addition of this extra satellite communications system on the ship’s stern. A view inside the USS Michael Monsoor ‘s Ship’s Mission Center during a demonstration ahead of the start of UxS IBP 21., USN With all this in mind, UxS IBP 21 looks set to underscore the ability of the Michael Monsoor and her sisters to operate as command and control platforms, a role that could be even more important as the Navy works to field more and more unmanned aircraft, surface, and underwater vehicles as time goes on. The DDG-1000s with their stealthy design and other features are more survivable than their less stealthy counterparts, such as the Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyers, which also makes them particularly well suited to acting as a command and control node for unmanned systems operating in and around contested territory. The Navy has already been working hard in recent years to better define the expected roles and missions of the DDG-1000s. At present, the Zumwalt and the Michael Monsoor are both assigned to a development unit, Surface Development Squadron One , or SURFDEVRON. The Lyndon B. Johnson is set to join them when it is commissioned, though it’s not clear when that will happen. Despite their assignment to this squadron, the Navy insists it plans to deploy all three of these destroyers operationally as time goes on. It’s also worth noting that the service’s pair of MDUSVs are also part of SURFDEVRON, further underscoring interest in pairing the DDG-1000s, as well as other manned surface vessels, with unmanned systems. The Navy’s two MDUSVs in San Diego on April 20, 2021. The USS Michael Monsoor with its satcom dome is seen in the background., USN The development and procurement of the DDG-100s, overall, is a saga that dates back to the 1990s. The service had originally expected to buy 32 of these ships, before a combination of factors led to this being trimmed back to just three. In addition to the aforementioned issues surrounding the less-than-stealthy antennas that now adorn the ships, there have been other controversial decisions made over the years regarding these ships, including ones concerning their radars and armament . The Navy notably has no plans to buy any actual ammunition for their 155mm Advanced Gun System main guns, rending them dead weight , with various discussions now underway about alternative weapon options , including the addition of new hypersonic missiles . There is even the possibility that their radar systems and their proprietary combat system software could be replaced , with versions of the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) of the Aegis combat system . As it sits now, the total program cost, including the purchase of the three ships, has risen to over $26 billion. All told, the UxS IBP 21 experiment looks set to be very important for the Navy when it comes to exploring how the DDG-1000s will be employed in future operations, in addition to the event’s core focus on helping to lay the groundwork for adding more unmanned capabilities to future naval operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 16, 2021",This Is Our First Ever Look At A Top Secret Soviet Space ‘Missile’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television station, TV Zvezda , has given the world the first-ever public look at the Shchit-2, or at least a mockup thereof. This was a Soviet-era missile-like space weapon primarily intended to protect Almaz military space stations from incoming threats. The Shchit-2 was a follow-on project to the Shchit-1 self-defense system, which featured a 23mm cannon and is the only gun to have been fired in space, at least that we know about. The most recent episode of TV Zvezda ‘s “Military Acceptance” program was focused on the Almaz series and associated developments, including both the Shchit-1 and the Shchit-2 . Examples of both systems, among other things, were on display in a restricted area at NPO Mashinostroyenia when TV Zvezda ‘s reporter visited recently. NPO Mashinostroyenia is a Russian state-run space development firm, which evolved from a Soviet entity, known simply as OKB-52, that was responsible for, among other things, the development of the Almaz space stations. A look at the front end of the Shchit-2 space weapon on display at NPO Mashinostroyenia., TV Zvezda capture A televised visit by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to NPO Mashinostroyenia earlier this year had already yielded the best and most complete view of the Shchit-1 system to date. You can read more about that gun, as well as the Almaz program, here . Anatoly Zak, a Russian author who also manages the website RussianSpaceWeb.com , had been among the first to notice that new look at the Shchit-1 system, as well as this public debut of the Shchit-2. The Almaz program was a covert effort to develop military space stations, primarily outfitted to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, hidden within the Saylut civilian space station project. The Almaz effort, which began in the 1960s, was only officially declassified in the early 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union. The Soviets had planned to arm the Almaz stations from the very beginning, fearing attacks by American anti-satellite weapons, including small, but highly maneuverable “ killer satellites ” and more traditional interceptors . An example of the Shchit-1 system actually made it into space attached to the Almaz OPS-2 satellite. The Soviets conducted a live-fire test of that gun remotely on January 24, 1975, the station’s last day in orbit. TV Zvezda ‘s reporter, at right, stands next to NPO Mashinostroyenia head Leonard Smirichevsky, while leaning on a display case containing an example of the Shchit-1 system., TV Zvezda capture The outcome of that test remains classified and the next Almaz space station, OPS-3, launched without any weapons installed. OPS-4, which never made it to space, was supposed to carry the Shchit-2 system. There’s no indication Shchit-2, the general existence of which has been known before know, ever went into space, either, though details about the system remain extremely limited. As to the weapon itself, Leonard Smirichevsky, the current head of NPO Mashinostroyenia, described it to TV Zvezda ‘s reporter as having four major components. The base of the system is a solid-fuel rocket motor, which is then attached to a spin-stabilization system consisting of a rotating wheel with blade-like fins. There there is a hybrid propulsion-warhead section, which we will come back to in a moment, followed by a proboscis-like radar seeker at the front. A view from the rear of the Shchit-2 space weapon., TV Zvezda capture By far, the propulsion-warhead section is the most interesting part. Outwardly, it has what appears to be a circular array of small, grenade-like charges, which one would imagine would unleash a cloud of shrapnel that would particularly dangerous to other objects in the vacuum of space. However, these projectiles are actually solid and are designed to act as hard-kill interceptors, destroying whatever they hit through the sheer force of the impact, according to Anatoly Zak. More interestingly, Smirichevsky made clear to TV Zvezda that this portion of the weapon was also used to propel it in some fashion, though he did not elaborate. A close-up view of the hybrid propulsion-warhead section., TV Zvezda capture “Upon their ignition, the chambers/grenades might have fed hot propulsive gas into a single or  multiple combustion chambers at the center of the contraption, producing either the main thrust and/or steering the vehicle,” Anatoly Zak wrote on RussianSpaceWeb.com . “When the missile reached the proximity of the target, according to its guiding radar, the entire vehicle would explode and the small solid chambers would eject under their own propulsive force in every direction acting as shrapnel.” How Shchit-2, which is said to have had an expected maximum effective range in space of just over 62 miles, was supposed to be launched is also not entirely clear. “The weapon was stored in the coffin-like container, which appeared to a [sic] have a remote control for the activation by the crew aboard the Almaz and a spin-up mechanism, which could be activated at the release of the weapon in orbit,” Zak noted. The reported plan was for the Almaz OPS-4 station to carry two of these missile-like weapons. What could be part of a remote control interface of some kind on the outside of the Shchit-2 canister. , TV Zvezda capture What happened to Shchit-2 after the end of the Almaz program in 1978 is entirely unknown. It’s also not clear why the Russians have decided to offer a look at the system now. It does come amid renewed discussion about on-orbit anti-satellite weapons, including interceptors and directed energy weapons , as well as killer satellites, and the development of these systems, both in Russia and the United States, among other countries . Last year, Chief of Space Operations General John “Jay” Raymond, U.S. Space Force’s top uniformed officer, publicly accused the Russian government of carrying out an on-orbit anti-satellite weapon test wherein one of its very maneuverable and small “inspector” satellites fired an unspecified projectile. The U.S. government has already expressed concern that these orbital inspectors, ostensibly designed to check up on other Russian satellites in space, could have an offensive capability . There is no indication one way or another that the projectile launched from this Russian satellite was in any way related to the Shchit-2 weapon, a design that is now more than four decades old, at the very least. At the same time, it certainly underscores the potentially significant knowledge base in Russia with regards to the development of such systems. Whatever the reasons the Russian government has for disclosing the Shchit-2 design publicly now, and no matter what the current state of on-orbit anti-satellite weapons in Russia might be, it is absolutely fascinating to get our first glimpse of this previous top-secret Soviet space missile.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 4, 2021",The Sound Of This Nighttime Suicide Drone Strike Is Absolutely Terrifying,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video purporting to show one of the Israeli-made Harop loitering munitions, or suicide drones, used by Azerbaijan during last year’s war with neighboring Armenia , provides some idea of their psychological effect, coupled, of course, with the pinpoint destruction that made this something of a signature weapon of the brief but bloody conflict. The footage, which was shot at night, is accompanied by the wail of the drone as it throttles up and descends almost vertically on its target, which was reportedly an Armenian military outpost in an area that was controlled at the time by the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. The short video was posted to Twitter by Caucasus War Report and appears to document the final moments before the Harop strikes its target, at the end of a terminal dive, at over 250 miles per hour. As the caption notes, the sound produced in its final attack maneuver is reminiscent of “ Jericho trumpets ” — the sirens attached to German Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers, which became an infamous terror weapon in their own right in the early years of World War II. Part of a class of weapons that blurs the boundaries between unmanned aircraft and traditional missiles, the Harop is one of a variety of drones acquired by Azerbaijan over the years, including other types of Israeli-made loitering munitions . Azerbaijan’s Border Guard , also a Harop operator , posted the video below online during the fighting with Armenia last year, apparently focusing on the propaganda value of its buzzing sound over the battlefield: Produced by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), and based on the same company’s earlier Harpy suicide drone, the development of which you can read about here , the Harop can be launched from a canister mounted on a truck or ship , or can even be configured for air-launch. Once in the air, the drone’s wings pop out, after which it operates either autonomously or via man-in-the-loop control, the latter allowing a human operator to see what the drone sees. Side view of an IAI Harop drone on static display an air show., Julian Herzog/Wikimedia Commons When manually guided, the onboard camera allows the operator to track and engage moving targets or it can be equipped with a passive radar seeker to locate and attack radar sites. There’s also an option for both guidance types, allowing a radar site to be targeted even if it stops emitting after being detected. In this scenario, the operator can take over guidance using the electro-optical sensor. The Harop features an inbuilt warhead in the form of a 50-pound high-explosive charge. However, if the drone doesn’t find a target, it is designed to return to the launch point, meaning it can be recovered and reused. The drone has impressive endurance, being able to loiter for around six hours or cover approximately 600 miles. It can also be configured to return home autonomously and land once its fuel runs low. Even before the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh last year, the Harop had gained a notable combat record in Azerbaijani hands, being used in previous skirmishes in the disputed region. The Harop seems to have been used for the first time, by any operator, when violence broke out in Nagorno-Karabakh in 2016. The Azerbaijani drones reportedly successfully hit many targets including artillery, air defense systems artillery systems, and, on one occasion, a busload of ethnic Armenian fighters . Ground launch of a Harop drone., IAI In April 2018, video footage emerged of Azerbaijani forces using the Harop in a slickly produced music video honoring the country’s State Border Service. Earlier in August 2018, the suicide drones reappeared at drills along the Caspian Sea, on the opposite side of the country from Nagorno-Karabakh. The loitering munitions were again a major factor in the fighting that broke out in the same region late last September, a conflict that The War Zone reported on at the time. The impact of the Harop on enemy troops during the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh last year also did not go unnoticed by Azerbaijan. The authorities there sought to exploit the potentially demoralizing impact of these explosive-laden drones and the Border Guard released at least two very brief propaganda videos simply featuring the Harop and the sound of its engine along with the message “Karabakh is Azerbaijan!” Those videos can be seen in this previous story on the topic. The potentially game-changing aspects of suicide drones and other weaponized unmanned aerial systems have also been acknowledged by U.S. officials. As Air Force Magazine recently reported , the spread of small unmanned aerial systems, carrying explosive payloads, has been acknowledged as the most “persistent and dangerous” threat to troops in the Middle East by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) boss U.S. Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. General McKenzie was referring to the kinds of commercially available drones that can be weaponized by insurgent groups such as ISIS, but they essentially present a similar kind of threat on the battlefield to the off-the-shelf Harop. Relatively cheap, possessing useful endurance and accuracy, and able to be deployed in significant numbers, they can have an effect thoroughly disproportionate to their diminutive size. “These small- and medium-sized UAS proliferating across the [area of operations] present a new and complex threat to our forces and those of our partners and allies,” General McKenzie told the House Armed Services Committee yesterday. “For the first time since the Korean War, we are operating without complete air superiority.” Now that these kinds of drones have also started killing people , counter-drone technology has become a “top priority” for CENTCOM, in the words of General McKenzie. The video we see here provides a brief, sobering demonstration of what it might be like to experience the wrong side of the Harop on the battlefield. Combined with the drone’s apparent unerring accuracy, it is perhaps little wonder that interest in these types of capabilities spiked sharply in the wake of the last round of fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Apr 23, 2021",The Search Is On For A Missing Indonesian Navy Submarine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Indonesian Navy has launched a search effort to determine the location of the Cakra class submarine Nanggala after communications were broken off unexpectedly, at around 4:30 AM local time. The last known position of the submarine, which had been taking part in a training exercise in the Bali Sea today, was off the coast of Surabaya, around 60 miles north of Bali. The Nanggala , one of two Type 209/1300 class diesel-electric attack submarines completed for Indonesia in West Germany in the early 1980s, had been participating in an anti-submarine warfare torpedo drill when it failed to report back, an Indonesian Navy spokesman confirmed . The submarine, which has a submerged displacement of around 1,390 tons and is a little over 195 feet long, is assigned to the Indonesian Eastern Fleet Command. Cakra is the lead vessel from a class of two Type 209/1300 diesel-electric attack submarines in service with the Indonesian Navy., Indonesian Navy According to some, apparently unconfirmed reports , contact was lost after the Nanggala had been authorized to dive into deeper waters. The waters nearby where the submarine was last reported are said to be around 2,300 feet deep. There are 53 crew members are aboard the submarine, which typically has a complement of 34 personnel, according to the 1993 edition of Combat Fleets of the World . It’s unclear why such a significant number of additional individuals were on board for this exercise. The Cakra class boats are armed with eight 533mm bow tubes that are used to launch AEG SUT heavyweight torpedoes, up to 14 of which can be carried. While the torpedo training drill has been described as a ‘live fire’ exercise, it’s unclear if the torpedoes used were fitted with live warheads. A search effort is now underway to locate it. Several Indonesian Navy vessels have been noted in the vicinity of the area and Indonesian officials have also called upon Australia and Singapore to assist — both the Republic of Singapore Navy and the Royal Australian Navy operate specialist submarine rescue vessels. Among the Indonesian Navy vessels on the scene, according to reports , are the hydrographic ship Rigel , the first-in-class corvette Fatahillah , the first-in-class corvette Bung Tomo , and the Kapitan Pattimura class corvette Teuku Umar . Other accounts state that another two Indonesian submarines, plus aircraft, have been committed to the search, as well as the Spica , the sister vessel to the Rigel . Singapore has sent the rescue ship MV Swift Rescue to help the search, as part of a joint agreement between the two countries covering submarine rescue. The Swift Rescue is a specialized submarine support and rescue vessel (SSRV) operated by the Republic of Singapore Navy. It is equipped with a deep-submergence rescue vehicle (DSRV) to retrieve crew from stricken submarines. The rescue ship MV Swift Rescue at Changi Naval Base, Singapore, in 2019., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Tristin Barth Reuters has reported that an aerial search conducted in the Bali Sea ha revealed an oil spill near the Nanggala ’s last known dive location, but it’s not yet known if this is related to the missing submarine. Both of the Cakra class submarines underwent extensive refits with the Daewoo Shipyard in South Korea, with work on the lead boat, Cakra , being completed in 2005. The upgrades to Nanggala were completed in 2011. The work reportedly included new batteries, an engine overhaul, and a modernized combat system. The Indonesian Navy’s two Cakra class submarines serve alongside the three more modern Nagapasa class diesel-electric attack submarines, based on a South Korean design. The most recent of these, the Alugoro , was the first to be completed in Indonesia and entered service in March.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",The Royal Air Force Just Can’t Get Enough Of The Chinook With 14 New Orders,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Royal Air Force’s enduring commitment to the Boeing CH-47 Chinook has been further cemented, with confirmation that the country has agreed on terms with the U.S. to buy another 14 examples of the heavy-lift helicopter. These will revitalize the force of 60 aircraft now in service with the RAF, some of which date back to the very first deliveries of these helicopters that the service received back in the early 1980s. Although the planned acquisition of more Chinooks had been expected for some time, the British Embassy in Washington recently confirmed to Bloomberg that a formal deal is to buy more of these helicopters is close to being finalized. That outlet reported today that the U.K. government and the Pentagon had agreed on a package worth $2 billion for the 14 Chinooks, together with engines, machine guns, and self-protection equipment. These details were included in a previously undisclosed letter from the Embassy, dated March 25 this year, which the news agency had obtained. A Royal Air Force Chinook flying with two U.S. Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallions during a twilight training sortie out of Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona., CROWN COPYRIGHT The letter describes the Chinooks as new-build H-47(ER) helicopters, referring to an Extended Range variant of the helicopter. It’s not entirely clear what the configuration of the future helicopters for the RAF might be, but Boeing has offered an extended range version with increased fuel capacity to Germany for its protracted heavy-lift rotorcraft requirement in the past. The configuration in question also sounds similar, in some respects, to the Block II MH-47G helicopters , special operations Chinooks based on the current standard Block II CH-47F variant, that the U.S. Special Operations Command is currently procuring. Regardless of the exact configuration, an extended-range Chinook would be ideal for the kinds of special operations missions that a portion of the RAF Chinook fleet is assigned to perform. The service already has a number of Chinook HC5 versions that feature “fat tank” sponsons, something also found on SOCOM’s MH-47Gs, for increased range. At the same time, the U.K. has been forced to “reconsider the expenditure profile of this project,” in the words of the British Embassy letter, indicating that cost savings are being sought. Coupled with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, this means that planned deliveries could be delayed by up to three years. Handover of the last aircraft is now expected before the end of 2030, a British Embassy spokeswoman told Bloomberg . It’s noteworthy that the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale of 16 H-47(ER) aircraft to the U.K. at an estimated cost of $3.5 billion, back in October 2018. The latest U.K. defense policy document , unveiled last month, outlined plans to retire the oldest RAF Chinooks and to invest “alongside the U.S., in newer variants of this operationally proven aircraft, enhancing capability, efficiency, and interoperability.” However, at that stage, no final numbers of costs were provided. An RAF Chinook during Exercise Decisive Maneuver last summer. This involved operating in support of 2 Para and 16 Air Assault Brigade., Crown Copyright While that document, formally titled The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy , outlines increased defense spending for the U.K., it nonetheless makes significant cuts to some programs, including wholesale withdrawal of a number of RAF fleets as well as reductions to others . The U.K. is embarking on a significant overhaul of its rotary fleet, which includes 60 Chinooks, a mix of successively upgraded HC5, HC6A, and HC6 variants, based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, southern England. Primary missions include transporting troops, cargo resupply, and casualty evacuation. These aircraft have been deployed around the world and have been widely used on combat operations, including during a current deployment to Mali in West Africa. As well as new Chinooks to replace older airframes, the defense ministry has announced plans to invest in a new medium-lift helicopter in the mid-2020s. This is intended to replace a range of different types in service with the British Army and Navy, including the long-serving Puma . The British Army is also replacing its AH-64D Apaches with advanced AH-64E models . Confirmation that the U.K. will place sign a contract for more Chinooks is good news for Boeing, as the U.S. Army wavers over its own future purchases. An RAF Chinook conducts routine flying training in the Mountain Flying Training Area located in North Wales. , Crown Copyright For the U.S. Army, already looking at options for the kinds of exotic rotorcraft that will eventually replace the Chinook under the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort, the future of the helicopter is less than clear. Interestingly, the U.K. has also begun to look at FVL, under an agreement signed last summer , but this has apparently not affected its Chinook plans. The U.S. Army has said that it expects the Chinook to remain in some kind of service at least into the 2030s or 2040s but it has dragged its heels on an initiative to re-engine the helicopter with the more powerful General Electric T408 turboshafts that are also used on Sikorsky’s larger CH-53K King Stallion . So far, the new engines have not been incorporated into the wider Block II upgrade program . CH-47Fs from the U.S. Army’s Hotel Company, 1-214th Aviation Regiment, 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, at Katterbach Army Airfield in 2015., U.S. Army As part of its budget plan for Fiscal Years 2021 through 2024, the U.S. Army called for a reduction in its planned Chinook orders, from 68 to 40, to bring savings of $962 million, some of which would be invested in new rotorcraft programs like the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA. That proposal has been rebuffed by the House and Senate appropriations panels in 2021 and 2021. In fact, the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes $296.7 million for CH-47s, an increase of $136 million compared to the U.S. Army request. This will provide 11, rather than the requested six CH-47F aircraft, of which five will be the latest Block II versions. A modified NCH-47D testbed helicopter with the up-rated T408 engines during its first flight at Felker Army Airfield in Virginia, last September., U.S. Army According to Bloomberg , however, the Army may still seek to cut Chinook numbers for its 2022 budget. Just last week, Boeing told Defense News it still expected a first production contract for new CH-47F Block II aircraft in Fiscal Year 2021, allowing for deliveries in 2025. Developmental testing has meanwhile been held up by some problems with the helicopter, including excessive vibration from the new rotor blades. Boeing has been doing all it can to ensure that production continues at a profitable rate at the Pennsylvania facility where Chinooks are built, actively pursuing export opportunities for new versions of the twin-rotor helicopter, including in Israel ( albeit unsuccessfully ) and in the United Arab Emirates, as well as Germany and the U.K. Previous F-model sales have been made to Australia, Canada, India, Singapore, and the Netherlands. Despite the U.S. Army’s repeated efforts to stall the Chinook program and look instead to its successors, and other programs, the design clearly still has many valuable years ahead of it. The U.K. is just the latest operator to place an order for new-build Chinooks and it’s unlikely to be the last.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy will fire a missile at a surface target using information from a combination of manned and unmanned aircraft and surface vessels during a first-of-its-kind experiment that kicked off yesterday. The secretive Super Swarm project, details about which have been slowly trickling out in the past year, will also be part of this larger manned-unmanned event, which the service has dubbed Unmanned Integrated Battle Problem 21, or UxS IBP 21. Navy Rear Admiral James Aiken, who is the top officer overseeing UxS IBP 21, offered some details about the experiment, which runs through April 26, during a roundtable call with reporters today. Aiken, who is presently head of Carrier Strike Group Three, and is set to be promoted and assigned as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces, Southern Command and U.S. 4th Fleet, said that the live-fire missile shoot was one of three major vignettes this manned-unmanned exercise will explore. The other two have to do with more general intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and manned-unmanned teaming concepts of operation. Sea Hunter, the first of the Navy’s two Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessels. Both Sea Hunter and its sister ship Seahawk will be taking part in UxS IBP 21., DARPA The Navy also provided a list of the major manned and unmanned participants in the experiment. On the manned side, on the surface, the Zumwalt class stealth destroyer USS Michael Monsoor will join four Arleigh Burke class destroyers , a Ticonderoga class cruiser , an example of each one of the two subclasses of Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), a San Antonio class landing platform dock amphibious warfare ship, and a Los Angeles class attack submarine. In the air, there will be P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes, E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft, EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jets, and MH-60R/S Seahawk helicopters. A list of assets the Navy says will be participating in Unmanned Integrated Battle Problem 21, or UxS IBP 21., USN The unmanned side will feature both of the Navy’s Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessels (MDUSV), the second of which, Seahawk, was only delivered earlier this month , as well as MQ-8 Fire Scout drone helicopters. General Atomics is providing a Sea Guardian unmanned aircraft, a version of the MQ-9 Reaper intended to perform various naval missions, including anti-submarine warfare, which you can read more about here . An MQ-9 Reaper acting as a surrogate for Sea Guardian drone configured for anti-submarine operations during a test General Atomics conducted in cooperation with the US Navy in 2020., General Atomics The Navy will also evaluate an “Ultra-Long Flight Endurance Unmanned Air Vehicle” from Vanilla Unmanned , primarily in the ISR role, during the experiment. The event will feature an unmanned vessel from Ocean Aero , which can operate on the surface, as well as underwater, too. Rear Admiral Aiken provided very limited details about how any of these platforms would be employed over the course of UxS IBP 21. He did emphasize that this event was heavily focused on exploring various capabilities that unmanned platforms could offer the Navy when used in direct cooperation with its manned assets. “I would tell you the one I’m most interested in and that I think is probably most challenging is we’re going to use a combination of manned and unmanned assets in order to get after a target and provide a targeting solution,” was also something Aiken could share. “What we’re going to do is, at range, we’re going to put a missile on the target.” Due to the level of “classification,” Aiken could not offer any more detailed specifics about this portion of the experiment, such as what missile would be employed, what platform would fire it, and what assets would be involved in gathering the targeting data. He did say that “it will be an offensive missile” and the unspecified target will be “well beyond line of sight.” The Rear Admiral also said that other unspecified munitions would be involved in the other vignettes, but offered no further details. The Navy has a number of air, surface, and submarine-launched anti-ship cruise missiles that would fit this general description, such as variants of the Harpoon , the Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST), the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), and the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). There are other available missiles that could be employed, too. This includes the surface-launched SM-6, which is primarily an anti-aircraft and missile defense weapon , but has a demonstrated anti-surface capability . It is well-established already that unmanned platforms, both in the air and on the surface, can be valuable sensor nodes for spotting, as well as targeting enemy assets. It’s not the first time the Navy, in cooperation with other branches of the U.S. military, has demonstrated a capability like this, either. During the 2018 iteration of the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) Exercise, a U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone, working together with a manned AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, provided data that helped enable shore-based anti-ship missile batteries to engage a maritime target , the ex-USS Racine , a decommissioned Newport -class landing ship tank amphibious vessel. Finding ways to conduct stand-off targeting against hostile assets, particularly those in more heavily defended areas , and at increasingly longer ranges, will only be an area of increasing interest to the Navy as time goes on. These kinds of capabilities, whether provided by manned or unmanned assets, will be especially important as complements to future hypersonic weapons that will offer an ideal way to actually prosecute those types of targets. The Zumwalt class destroyer USS Michael Monsoor , which will be taking part in UxS IBP 21. Earlier this year, the Navy revealed it was actively exploring integrating new hypersonic weapons on all three of its Zumwalt class ships., USN Unmanned air and surface platforms, as well as undersea types, will offer valuable ways to distribute those capabilities going forward, too. A swarm of smaller pilotless aircraft or drone ships or submarines would be able to search a much broader area for threats in a shorter period of time, and at lower cost and risk, than could be achieved using larger, more exquisite assets. Beyond targeting, swarms of small drones could also confuse, distract, or overwhelm enemy air defenses, as well as radars and other sensors on hostile ships, or even carry electronic warfare jammers or explosive payloads to attack them more directly. In a maritime context, while a small drone might not be able to carry a large warhead, it would not take much to destroy radar dishes or other specific systems on a hostile ship, which could lead to a mission kill , sidelining the vessel for an extended period of time. While Aiken could not elaborate on how the Office of Naval Research’s (ONR) Super Swarm project will factor into UxS IBP 21, this is almost certainly part of the unmanned equation that the Navy is looking at with regards both to this experiment and in general. The Navy has released very few details about Super Swarm specifically, but we do know that 1,000 small drones with swarming capabilities were launched from a C-130-type cargo aircraft during one test conducted sometime in the past year or so under this program. The service has also been involved in a number of other drone swarm programs in the past decade, including an effort ONR led known as the Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST) project. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo In March, a contracting notice also revealed details about the Navy’s plans to use future unmanned surface vessels and undersea vehicles to launch drone swarms. That same month, the Pentagon announced that it had wrapped up a drone swarm technology project and had transferred technology developed under that program to various branches of the U.S. military, including the Navy. Drone swarms a key component of the Navy’s shadowy Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors (NEMSIS) effort. ONR has also been in charge of that program, which The War Zone was first to report on and that you can read about more here , which envisions a multi-faceted and heavily networked electronic warfare ecosystem involving manned and unmanned platforms that is centered on being able to cooporatively generate phantom fleets of aircraft and ships to distract and deceive opponents that have sensors placed across a wide area. A briefing slide giving a very basic overview of the Navy’s Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors (NEMSIS) program., USN At its core, of course, UxS IBP 21, as well as similar future events, are intended specifically to help the Navy figure out exactly how various unmanned capabilities will fit into their future operations. The service’s leadership has been very outspoken about the growing importance of unmanned platforms . At the same time, Congress has been less than sure about the Navy’s unmanned ambitions, with lawmakers often expressing concerns that the service has yet to really explain its goals in this regard. Rear Admiral James Aiken acknowledged today that “some tension there” between the Navy and the legislators that control its budget, but that he hopes UxS IBP 21 will be an important step toward resolving any such issues. Will all this in mind, hopefully, we will begin to get more specific details about exactly what the Navy has demonstrated during this particular event in the near future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 12, 2021",Put Bombers Back On Nuclear Alert If ICBM Force Gets Slashed: Strategic Command Boss,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The boss of U.S. Strategic Command, Admiral Charles A. Richard, has told Senators that if the U.S. scraps its intercontinental ballistic missiles , he would recommend that Air Force bombers go back on nuclear alert duty . The disclosure came during a testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee today in which Richard also specifically warned about the risk that adversaries might see nuclear weapons as their “least bad option” in future conflicts. While the Biden administration has indicated that it seeks to retain the nuclear triad — intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and nuclear-capable Air Force bombers — some lawmakers have proposed deleting the ICBM arm of the triad, reducing it to a so-called “dyad.” B-52Hs from the 2nd Bomb Wing line up on the runway at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, last October, before taking off as part of a readiness exercise., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Tessa B. Corrick Under the Investing in Cures Before Missiles (ICBM) Act, for example, Congressional Democrats are seeking to introduce legislation that transfers $1 billion in funding from the Air Force’s future ICBM, the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent , or GBSD, which is expected to cost a total cost of around $264 billion , and instead spend it on developing a new COVID vaccine. The act would commission an independent study to explore options for further extending the life of the current Minuteman III ICBM to 2050, which would include undisclosed “force structure changes.” It is not clear, however, if the veteran ICBMs would ultimately be replaced at a later date, or if the capability would be lost entirely after this date. Other arguments have been made against ICBMs, more generally, too. The Minuteman III silos are nicknamed the “nuclear sponge” for good reason. The 400 missiles are in fixed silos, the primary job of which it is to be saturated with enemy warheads that could be used on other targets. The result is that Russia needs to invest heavily into the means to take out the American ICBM force. Meanwhile, the Pentagon has continued to push for GBSD to replace the Minuteman III, which first became operational in the early 1970s , and which it argues is now too old to be further upgraded in a cost-effective manner. Were the ICBMs to go, and putting aside the bombers, Admiral Richard said his command would rely entirely on SLBMs to provide the day-to-day deterrent. This is effectively the case already, these missiles arming the current 14 Ohio -class nuclear-powered, ballistic missile-carrying submarines (SSBNs) in service — another four of these boats have been adapted for conventionally armed operations . The Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS Nebraska test-fires an unarmed Trident II D5 SLBM off the coast of Southern California., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Ronald Gutridge The argument for the Air Force’s nuclear-capable bombers to resume round-the-clock alert status is not a new one, however. Back in 2017 The War Zone reported on how the Air Force’s top officer General David Goldfein said the service was preparing to possibly put some of its nuclear-capable bombers back on 24-hour alert for the first time in more than 25 years. The then Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein is briefed in front of a B61 nuclear bomb training round in the Air Force Nuclear Weapon Center, at Kirtland Air Force Base, new Mexico, in 2017. , U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Nigel Sandridge As we pointed out at the time, there are a number of arguments to be made against this proposal, including the risk of accidents , allocation of funding and other resources , and the consequent reductions in other parts of America’s nuclear arsenal. Then, of course, there are the reactions of potential opponents, including Russia and China. Both Russia and China would certainly be able to follow suit, to some extent, with their own bomber fleets. Admiral Richard’s new argument for keeping ICBMs also seems to tacitly imply that putting bombers back on 24/7 alert is not the most effective use of resources — or the best deterrent. In his written testimony, Richard also provides another argument against the removal of the ICBMs, in that it would effectively promote China to the status of nuclear peer. While the point regarding China may be arguable and certainly depends upon various different factors, it seems certain the fact that China is fast heading toward a functional triad while the US is considering getting rid of a leg of its own will be a key part of this discussion going forward. Against this backdrop, too, is an already-infamous tweet from Richard’s own command, which suggested that: “We must account for the possibility of conflict leading to conditions which could very rapidly drive an adversary to consider nuclear use as their least bad option.” That sentence was provided as part of STRATCOM’s Posture Statement Preview, while the complete passage provides more detail: Deterrence fundamentals against such threats have not changed. We drive to deny any adversary their aim, or impose a cost greater than what they seek, such that the benefit of restraint outweighs the perceived benefit of their possible action. These deterrence fundamentals apply from gray-zone activities through nuclear use. The spectrum of conflict today, however, is neither linear nor predictable. We must account for the possibility of conflict leading to conditions which could very rapidly drive an adversary to consider nuclear use as their least bad option. As such, the statement tells us more about U.S. posture than any indication of impending nuclear Armageddon, despite the apparent urgency of the tweet. On the other hand, it’s notable that it comes amid growing fears related to the ongoing build-up of Russian forces close to the borders of Ukraine. Russia, in particular, has been identified in the past as a potential candidate to employ an “ escalate-to-deescalate ” strategy in just that type of context. Escalate-to-deescalate supposes that, in certain situations, Moscow would consider using limited nuclear strikes in a regional conflict as a means of rapidly bringing a freeze to the fighting after desired gains before negotiating an end open hostilities. The idea is that the next step, a nuclear response, could be potentially so dangerous that immediate negotiations would commence. For their part, Russian leaders have steadfastly refuted that they have any such plans within their nuclear doctrine. A Russian RS-24 Yars nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)., VITALY KUZMIN Regardless, the recommendation from the STRATCOM boss that bombers could once again stand alert — albeit under high particular circumstances — is a significant one. Since Richard’s remarks on bomber alert are not part of the written testimony, details on what exactly he had in mind as regards practicalities are scarce. After all, there is a significant difference between ground alert, which came to an end in September 1991, and airborne alert , the latter being undertaken by Strategic Air Command B-52 for a period between 1960 and 1968. A B-52F takeoff during the 1960s. Note the AGM-28 Hound Dog missiles loaded on the inboard wing pylons., U.S. Air Force Since Air Force bombers don’t currently sit on permanent readiness armed with nuclear weapons, let alone fly, any effort to go back to a higher degree of alert status would first involve ground readiness. Members of a Strategic Air Command alert crew race for their B-52 Stratofortress aircraft during a base alert exercise circa 1990., National Archives With its current fleet of bombers, it’s not clear what kind of ground alert would be possible, even providing that new infrastructure, additional manpower, and training could be made available to support that initiative. Air Force B-1s are now no longer nuclear capable , while the B-2s , which can carry nuclear weapons, and B-52s , some of which can , are also kept busy on conventional missions, using an ever-increasing range of ordnance , with combat operations and deployments all around the globe . The forthcoming B-21 Raider , although it will carry both nuclear and conventional weapons, will also be much more than just a bomber , meaning additional pressure on the fleet is a portion was assigned ground alert duty. A B-1B Lancer prepares to take off from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, last February., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Josiah Brown The nature of strategic arms control agreements between the United States and Russia also means the U.S. military can only field a certain number of nuclear-capable bombers. And, with a fixed number of nuclear warheads permitted for each delivery platform at any one time, loading nuclear warheads onto an aircraft means reducing them on other delivery systems. This is all before taking into account the other support aircraft that would be needed to execute this kind of round-the-clock mission. As well as tanker capacity , bomber ground alert would also require new taskings for the appropriate command and control aircraft, such as the E-4B Nightwatch and the E-6B Mercury . A KC-135 refuels a B-2 Spirit in January 2017, during a mission that targeted Islamic State training camps in Libya. Tankers are already at a premium to support bomber operations around the world., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Kate Thornton “Really it depends on who, what kind of behavior are we talking about, and whether they’re paying attention to our readiness status,” Goldfein said back in 2017 when asked about whether or not the alert posture would help deter potential enemies. “I’ve challenged… Air Force Global Strike Command to help lead the dialog, help with this discussion about ‘What does conventional conflict look like with a nuclear element?’ and ‘Do we respond as a global force if that were to occur?’ and ‘What are the options?’” While discussions about bomber alert made it to the top of the Air Force chain of command back in 2017, STRATCOM has so far opted against its return. On the other hand, an argument could also be made that doing way with ICBMs and putting more resources into bombers could make sound strategic sense. Bombers are inherently more scalable and flexible than ICBMs, and SLBMs. Their crews are also already trained to get into the air quickly, when they need to use “minimum interval takeoffs.” In contrast to a ballistic missile, whether launched from a relatively vulnerable silo, or a far more survivable submarine, a bombers can make itself known near a target area without unleashing its nuclear payload, providing a very clear deterrent signal . They can also be diverted to other targets if required, at any point before — or even after — weapons delivery. In the mind of the public, however, the critical factor in bomber ground alert is probably the aspect of nuclear safety and security. As we have recounted in the past , the U.S. has had 32 incidents involving nuclear weapons , known as “Broken Arrow” events, since 1950, a number of these involving plane crashes or other aerial mishaps . In 2007, long after alert duty had come to an end, there were serious repercussions after crews accidentally loaded six AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles , each with a live nuclear warhead, onto a B-52H that then flew from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. A B-52H at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, in 2007., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Christopher Boitz As well as the security of the bombers and their deadly cargoes, there’s also the fact that base infrastructure would not only need to revert to a mission last flown in the Cold War, but also be adapted to take into account new threats, be they electronic or cyber attacks , to ensure the warheads are safe at all times. All in all, whatever the strategic arguments for a ground bomber alert, the costs involved in reinstating such a capability would be significant, although not, in all likelihood, anywhere near the $264-billion price tag expected for GBSD. Indeed, were even a fraction of the funds to be redirected away from that program, that could, in turn, buy many more B-21s capable of performing nuclear and conventional missions, and have a survivable long-range cruise missile to do it as well. Some of those funds could also expand and bolster the Columbia- class future nuclear ballistic missile submarine program, which also has major downstream impacts on future conventionally-armed submarine programs. For now, at least, whether the prospect of ground bomber alert makes sense or not within the framework of U.S. nuclear deterrence, is less important. Instead, it is being used as a tool to dissuade lawmakers from seeking to abandon ICBMs and, with the controversy that surrounds that objective, it may not be the last we hear of it.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 26, 2021",Japan-Based USAF F-16s Flew South China Sea Mission Fully Loaded With Live Air-To-Air Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The four U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets that recently flew a mission over the highly contested South China Sea were photographed landing at Yokota Air Base in Japan, en route to their home base at Misawa. The images confirm that these jets were armed for counter-air operations with a heavy load of live air-to-air missiles. The jets’ appearance in the South China Sea last week coincided with the biggest presence of People’s Liberation Army aircraft in Taiwan’s southwest air defense identification zone (ADIZ) in recent times: 25 aircraft in all. The Viper photos, taken by Iori, whose tweets can be found here , detail the jets’ extensive armament. Each jet was armed with five beyond-visual-range AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles and a single short-range AIM-9 Sidewinder — one of the latest AIM-9X missiles on some of the jets, or an older AIM-9M on the others. Under the belly, each aircraft was fitted with an AN/ALQ-184 electronic countermeasures self-protection pod. All of the weapons were live, a relatively uncommon sight, especially over Japan, and indicated that this was much more than a simple long-distance training mission and, instead, a calculated signal to the Chinese military and possibly even a contingency operation. A close-up of the three live AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM missiles under the wings of one of the jets., Iori As evidenced by the AN/ASQ-213 HARM Targeting System , the distinctive pod-mounted sensor found under the right side of the aircraft’s intakes, these jets are the radar-killing Wild Weasel F-16CM versions but, on this occasion at least, they were carrying maximum air-to-air load-outs. That these live missiles were then taken over the sensitive South China Sea suggests a willingness to demonstrate U.S. ability to generate defensive combat air patrols (CAPs) in proximity to Taiwan, as well as other hotspots in the region. The photos were taken on April 17, when all four of the jets that had been involved in the South China Sea flight on April 12 touched down at Yokota Air Base, in eastern Tokyo, at around 3:00 PM local time, presumably for a fuel stop, before departing again around 5:00 PM. They then flew home to Misawa Air Base , their home station, around 400 miles further north. It’s unclear where the jets actually took off from for the April 12 mission, but they may have flown from Kadena Air Base, on the island of Okinawa, located around 300 miles north of Taiwan. This island has a massive U.S. Air Force presence of its own and would have positioned them much closer to the South China Sea. Nevertheless, extensive tanker support was still required, with at least four different Air Force KC-135 Stratotankers identified in the strategic channel area south of Taiwan, based on online flight tracking data . F-16CM serial number 91-0357, which is marked up as the flagship of the 35th Fighter Wing., Iori Once in the South China Sea, the four jets performed an overflight of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71), currently on a scheduled deployment to the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations. At the same time that the F-16s were conducted their armed patrol, the People’s Liberation Army was sending no fewer than 25 aircraft into Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ, comprising 14 J-16 and four J-10 multirole fighters, four H-6K missile-carrying bombers, two KQ-200 anti-submarine warfare aircraft, and one KJ-500 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft. An official Taiwanese graphic showing the flight paths of Chinese aircraft in the southwest ADIZ on April 12., Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense The Chinese force was bigger than that which was encountered in the area last month, which you can read more about here , but featured a similar mixed composition. On that March 26 mission, however, some of the PLA aircraft extended their flightpaths further out into the South China Sea, before hooking around further behind Taiwan and then returning, suggesting a possible attack profile approaching the eastern side of Taiwan. Another of the Misawa F-16CMs on approach to Yokota Air Base. Note the ASQ-213 HARM Targeting System on the intake., Iori On April 12, by contrast, the PLA aircraft headed out into the northeastern reaches of the South China Sea, in more or less a straight line, before turning around heading back to the mainland. This is a more typical tactic and reflects another previous large-scale mission, flown on January 24, an incident that The War Zone reported on in-depth at the time. Large-scale aerial operations by the PLA in the South China Sea in general, and in Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ in particular, are becoming more frequent. Not only are the numbers of aircraft involved significant, but they include potentially more provocative aircraft types, including long-range bombers and airborne early warning platforms. A Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force KJ-200 AEW&C aircraft., Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense While Taiwan responds routinely to these incidents by scrambling its own alert fighters , and readying its air defense missile systems, it’s unusual for a U.S. Air Force presence to be in the area at the time, especially one that has been deployed for that purpose from Misawa, in the north of Japan. Rather than only being a direct response to provocative PLA flights in the area, the presence of the U.S. fighters was clearly timed to coincide with the USS Theodore Roosevelt , a warship that has, reportedly, been subject to dummy attack runs by PLA aircraft in the South China Sea in the past. Nonetheless, it underscores how America can project land-based air combat power far forward into contested areas, including around Taiwan, during a major crisis. The four 13th Fighter Squadron F-16CMs buzz the USS Theodore Roosevelt on April 12., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Carlos W. Hopper U.S. officials have been increasingly vocal about their concerns that Beijing will seek to use force to realize its long-standing aim of reintegrating the breakaway island of Taiwan. “I worry that they’re accelerating their ambitions to supplant the United States and our leadership role in the rules-based international order, which they’ve long said that they want to do that by 2050. I’m worried about them moving that target closer,” U.S. Navy Admiral Phil Davidson, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the top American military command in the Pacific region, told members of Congress earlier this year. “Taiwan is clearly one of their ambitions before then. And I think the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact in the next six years.” As well as AMRAAMs, this F-16CM is armed with a single AIM-9M Sidewinder missile., Iori Just two days before the F-16s arrived in the South China Sea, the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group and the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) also conducted a coordinated exercise in the area, which you can read more about here . Two of the F-16s perform a fly-by of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , as seen from the warship., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Carlos W. Hopper Despite their relative distance from the flash-points of the South China Sea, the F-16s from Misawa still have an important role to play in the strategic balance of the region. And while famed for their Wild Weasel mission immortalized in their ‘WW’ tail codes, these jets are also well equipped for an air-to-air mission. One of the F-16s banks to reveal an armament of five AMRAAMs and a single AIM-9X., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Carlos W. Hopper With potential for turbulence across the Indo-Pacific region, the two F-16 squadrons of the 35th Fighter Wing — the 13th Fighter Squadron (FS) ‘Panthers’ and the 14th FS ‘Samurais’ — have to be ready for any eventuality, wherever it may occur. For Taiwan, the worst-case scenario would be an attack , or amphibious invasion launched from the Chinese mainland. American airpower would be expected to play a huge part in countering such an offensive, although some would argue that the U.S. would not actually step in militarily at all. The F-16s prepare to fly over the USS Theodore Roosevelt , with aircraft from Carrier Air Wing 11  arranged on the deck., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Conner D. Blake But China is not the only threat. With more than 100 million square miles to cover in the Pacific Air Forces area of responsibility (AOR), the Misawa F-16s could find themselves tasked on missions directed toward North Korea , or Russia , as well. They also find themselves periodically engaged in the U.S. Central Command AOR, battling ISIS . All these missions are likely to involve forward deployment, stopovers, and aerial refueling, as on April 12, or the jets might make use of austere bases, like the F-16s and F-35s involved in drills earlier this year on the island of Guam . That exercise, which you read about here, was a major component of a larger emerging initiative that looks to provide dispersed operating locations that can be accessed by Air Force combat aircraft during a crisis. This new strategy is largely driven by the growing threat posed by ballistic missile attacks in the Pacific theater. Misawa Air Base would likely be a target of those missiles. Four Misawa F-16s in formation over the carrier., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Conner D. Blake As the previous boss of the 35th Fighter Wing, Colonel (now Brigadier General) R. Scott Jobe told the author, “Misawa F-16s are small, powerful, extremely agile fighters that can hold their own against any currently-fielded fighter.” It will be interesting to see if U.S. tactical airpower becomes a more common staple around Taiwan and especially over the tense waters of the South China Sea.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 2, 2021",We Talk F-15EX’s New Radar With The Woman Who Runs The Program Behind It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s induction of the F-15EX into its ranks has made a lot of buzz as of late. It’s amazing just how fast the aircraft and the acquisition initiative that supported it became a reality. Just over two and a half years after The War Zone broke the story on the concept’s existence, the first jet wearing USAF markings landed at Eglin AFB in Florida and got named the Eagle II. The aircraft has an array of new features, which you can read all about, as well as what it is like to fly an Advanced Eagle here , but at the heart of the F-15EX is its powerful AN/APG-82 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. Far more sensitive, reliable, and farther reaching than its mechanically scanned forebear, the APG-82 is this new Eagle’s ‘eyes.’ It is also being retrofitted into existing F-15E Strike Eagles in the USAF’s stable. F-15EX. , USAF With all this in mind, The War Zone talked in-depth with the head of Raytheon’s F-15 radar program, Michelle Styczynski , who has been on the Eagle program with the company for two decades. Here is that interview: MS: Just a little bit of background about our F-15 radar programs—they are really within the secure sensor solutions product line. We are within that product line. We do follow the radar, multiple radars, all F-15 derivative, through their lifecycles—development, production, sustainment. We also do have a lot of international work coming in, we have some programs already in-house that we’re working… So we’re really excited about what we can bring internationally with APG-82. I have been in this role for the last year and a couple of months, so I am really excited to be part of this program. I have actually been a part of the F-15 program since I started my career at Raytheon about 18 years ago. So I have a lot of history on the program, and this essentially is the dream job for me… I’ve been really lucky to be super supported by my leadership to take the helm of this area and continue to grow it with our USAF, Boeing, and international partners. So I’m really blessed to be here. I have a lot of passion for the product, but it really comes from my years of experience on F-15 radar and obviously, the wonderful people that I get to work with every single day. Tyler: What does the APG-82 radar bring to the Strike Eagle and its derivatives, like the F-15EX, that the APG-70 does not? The AN/APG-70 multi-mode pulse-Doppler radar is mechanically scanned and was the radar delivered with the F-15E Strike Eagle in the late 1980s. It was remarkably advanced for its time and it has been progressively upgraded over the years and installed on many foreign F-15 Strike Eagle derivates, as well as the F-15E. But now, the AN/APG-82 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar is being installed on new-build Eagles and is being offered for retrofit. The USAF’s F-15Es are receiving the type as part of their mid-life upgrade., Raytheon LM: I think the APG-82 provides a number of tactical advantages that include increased standoff from air-to-air and surface-to-air threats. It also brings greater search coverage, speed of processing targets, and then reduced aircrew workload. Additionally, compared to the APG-70, the APG-82 also provides increased reliability and supportability, which directly correlates to aircraft availability. With the MSA [the previous Mechanically Scanned Array on the Strike Eagle and foreign derivatives, the APG-70], obviously, there was a lot of care that needed to be applied there, and in this situation, you don’t really have that based upon the mechanics of the system. Tyler: A lot less moving parts, correct? MS: Yes, lots less moving parts and so the APG-82 brings better reliability compared to the APG-70. So that definitely helps from a maintainability and sustainability perspective. Tyler: We hear a lot about Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar technology these days and the capabilities that it provides. Are there any areas where the mechanically scanned array still has an advantage over the AESA? If so, what are the trade-offs there? MS: Yeah, I think in my mind right now, the AESA is really where it’s at. I point back to the comments that the chief pilot made on the F-15EX’s first flight—the APG-82 is the most powerful radar and there’s nothing that really compares to it. The AN/APG-82 AESA on a test stand., Raytheon Tyler: What is the APG-82’s lineage in relation to other Raytheon products, including outside of the F-15? Where does that lineage come from? And one oddball part of this—how did ‘VOODOO1,’ your 727 testbed jet, play a role in developing this new radar? MS: Yeah, what a great question. So what Raytheon is really good at is obviously trying to provide cost-reduction alternatives for customers. What you’re getting from the APG-82 is actually born from the APG-79 radar that’s on the F-18 and also the legacy APG-63V3 that sits in the F-15C/D aircraft. Essentially, both of those radars came together to create the APG-82. We leveraged all of those different developments in order to get this latest APG-82V1 radar. APG-63V3 installed on one of the F-15Cs of the 142nd FW. , Tyler Rogoway/Author With regards to the [727] aircraft, that’s our RMT [Raytheon Multi-program Testbed] platform. That airplane has definitely given us a leg up in terms of testing out the different developments that we do. We use that aircraft to essentially take what we do in our lab and put it into the sky before it gets into a fighter test jet. We can test certain things and work out any bugs that we may see, so it helps with cycle time as far as development is concerned, and we also try to cut costs for our customers by doing so. We have definitely done this on our domestic developments and are doing this on our international developments… It is a really big part of how we cut down development cycle time to get the customer faster technology quicker. Tyler: Is there an F-15 cockpit in there? How does the 727 act like an F-15? MS: Yeah, there are different simulators. I don’t have the specifics with regards to that, but I do know that we do have different simulators that… What’s the word? Well, that simulate… I keep using the word simulator over and over again but it simulates the ADCP II (Advanced Display Processor II) from Boeing, there are simulations on a nav that we would get… and so it’s just a giant flying simulator in my mind. But I’m probably not doing it as much justice as I could because that thing has been providing us a significant amount of lift across multiple programs to get things done. Raytheon’s 727 testbed jet N289MT that goes by the callsign VOODOO1., Aero Icarus/Wikicommons Teams are actually looking at capacity across the Raytheon technology portfolio to continue to exploit the legs up that we do get in our development to expand that further in terms of investing for more aircraft… Because that airplane in itself right now has very little capacity with all the work that it’s doing… So it’s definitely being put to use by our customers. Tyler: How does the APG-82 differ from the APG-63V3? MS: The APG-82 was born from the APG-79 and the APG-63. The APG-63V3 is born from the V0 and V1 of that radar, which were the mechanically scanned arrays… The APG-63V3 is an AESA, and it has comparable capability to the APG-82, but at the same time, it really focuses on the air-to-air mission versus both air-to-air and air-to-ground, as we see in the APG-82. There are some physical differences that go along with the two radars, the -63 has a power supply that is very similar to the APG-82, but then it also has four other units that go along with it. The APG-82 only has two other units that go along with it, and so that really helped also from our maintenance and improved aircraft reliability and availability perspective, which equates to reduced radar sustainment costs. In addition, the APG-82 is a four-channel radar and it has the ability to go to six… Tyler: What does that exactly mean, in terms of the channels? MS: Yeah, so with regard to the numbers of channels, the APG-63V3 has a two-channel system with no growth potential because of how long ago it was built. So really, the aircrew would see the significance in the channels by the time it takes to detect and display a target and the ability of the radar to deal with radio frequency interference that’s common in electronic warfare… That is really, I think one of the things that sets the APG-82 apart from the APG-63V3, other than the whole air-to-ground capability. In addition, on the APG-82, it does provides other tactical benefits that I had mentioned earlier, increased number of radar tracks, growth potential with software upgrades and different things like that. So yeah, they’re very similar in terms of the antenna and the power supply, they’re very close to each other, but there are differences in that back-end processing that gives the APG-82 the leg up. Tyler: Will there be any components retrofitted from the old F-15C/D jets to the F-15EX, in terms of the radar? MS: Yeah, with the commonality, with the antenna and the power supply, there are a few options that we’re reviewing with the customer in terms of if they want to go down that road, but right now that’s really in the very infant stages… In terms of if they’re actually going to go pursue that. Tyler: Right, as supposed to getting an all-brand-new radar off the shelf? MS: Yeah, exactly. F-15Cs shown equipped with AESA. , Raytheon Tyler: What goes into retrofitting? So if you have this new radar, the APG-82, and it does all these new things, and let’s say I’m a foreign customer that has the mechanically scanned array in my Strike Eagle, what goes into retrofitting that into an older jet, or even now, as we’re doing it with the USAF’s F-15Es? Is that a pretty complex process or is it sort of a swap-out and swap-in scenario? MS: Yeah, this is probably a better question for Boeing… But in terms of kits, there are different group kits that we’re talking about in terms of group A and group B, that I reference. I think the biggest difference that you may see has to do with the cooling system. The older-vintage radars, I believe were air-cooled, these are liquid-cooled, and so you need to switch out the ECS [Environmental Control System] system in order to do it, which I think is a pretty big change. But again, I would rather defer to Boeing to provide more details on that, just because we provide information that feeds into that, but we are not directly involved with that aspect of it. The AN/APG-82 being retrofitted into an F-15E Strike Eagle. , GAO document Tyler: In the air-to-air realm, we’re talking Eagles, the legendary air superiority fighter… What does the APG-82 give the Eagle pilot that the mechanically scanned array doesn’t? I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but can it more easily detect low-RCS [Radar Cross Section] targets, cruise missiles, and all these things that we’re hearing about now that are a much bigger threat than maybe they were 10 years ago? MS: Yeah, so I’m gonna have to be probably really high level on this one. Tyler: That’s fine. MS: There are a number of advantages with the AESA radar. We have significant capability in beam agility, beam shaping, and overall power. Power is obviously key here. These characteristics allow for significantly greater range in detecting and identifying targets regardless of RCS. The MSA radar is limited by its receiver channels and processing, and then obviously needs to mechanically reposition to see those targets where the AESA antenna does not need to do that. Tyler: Right, so super-fast scanning and updating, all those types of advantages. MS: Yes, exactly. Tyler: The bread and butter for the Strike Eagle is the air-to-ground role… While fighter radars get a lot of talk about air-to-air, the air-to-ground component is key. What is the APG-82 going to bring to the Eagle family when it comes to air-to-ground? Better SAR [Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging] capability? Better detection of moving targets? We obviously have new weapons that can hit those targets, like Storm Breaker . We also have the at-sea side of things. What is it going to bring to the look down to the ground and to the ocean compared to the air side of the mission set? MS: Yeah, and I think from an air-to-ground perspective, obviously, it has very good performance, but I’m very limited in terms of what we can discuss here. I think it’s going to be interesting to see what’s going to happen with the capabilities that we can adapt onto the F-15EX. I’m not sure if you’re aware but the USAF put out a large-scale RFI [Request For Information] to all of industry last year and solicited additional capabilities that the teams could provide to help enhance the F-15EX aircraft for the future… They received a significant amount of response on that, I think for Raytheon alone, we submitted about 50 ideas. The first F-15EX arriving at Eglin AFB in Florida. , USAF They’re working on down-selecting right now to come up with what the future of F-15EX will look like. So it’ll be really interesting to see from a priority standpoint where certain things will fall, and obviously, air-to-ground capabilities are probably going to be a part of that. But I think that is super exciting to just bring up and potentially be a part of in the future, just because obviously the F-15EX has given a good amount of life to the F-15. And what an upgrade could look like with the other sensors that it could be integrated with—definitely will make it unstoppable going into the future. Tyler: If I’m an F-15EX pilot, from what you understand of the system today, what is it going to look like when it’s operational in terms of radar. They have this big display in front of them now. They are going from a little radar scope, that’s what, five by five inches or something? And transitioning to this huge wide-area cockpit display. How does this new radar interact with that display? Is the F-15EX’s big cockpit display really needed to get the most out of a radar with this much capability? MS: From a display perspective, I think obviously, it brings a lot to the table in terms of situational awareness. I think for the APG-82, right now, the display itself would really look similar, but as we continue to add capabilities, obviously there are new items that would be displayed based upon those capabilities. So it will show targets at further ranges, air-to-surface targets will look crisper, allowing aircrew to make better tactical decisions with better tactical decision-making time. Because of the dynamic resource manager that’s within the radar, it helps keep track and display the highest-priority targets so that the aircrew is freed up to complete other cockpit tasks. It looks pretty similar to what we’re used to seeing from a display perspective, but things do get added as we continue to proceed down the suite route. But also, at the same time, what’s important about the APG-82 is that, when we do get these additional capabilities, there’s minimal amount of training that’s required for the aircrew, so they can just lock and load and go. Tyler: “It looks familiar, it feels familiar,” kind of thing, right? MS: Exactly. The latest cockpit in the F-15 Advanced family, of which the F-15EX is a member. The cockpit is far more advanced than the mix of ‘steam’ gauges and multifunction displays in the F-15C/D that the F-15EX will replace.  , Boeing Tyler: You have potentially two people in the cockpit on the EX. On the E you have two for sure. But you have a second seat in the EX as well. Can the new radar do decoupled operations where the front guy or gal is doing air-to-air and the back one is doing air-to-ground with the radar simultaneously? MS: The radar can only do one thing at a time, A/A or A/G. What you can do is take a SAR map of a ground target and “freeze” it then put the radar back into A/A mode. One person can then designate a target on the frozen SAR picture but the radar isn’t performing any A/G function while that is occurring. Tyler: Is the APG-82 planned to be integrated with the EPAWSS [Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System] , the F-15EX’s advanced electronic warfare suite , which is really the backbone in a certain way of this aircraft, and also will be installed on the F-15E? Is there an integration that’s happening just to make them work together? MS: Yeah, so that’s really exciting too, EPAWSS obviously has been quite a big program in the last couple of years, and we have definitely been a part of that, working with both APG-82 and APG-63 and integrating those capabilities together. Right now, they’re being integrated to prevent interference and optimize performance on both systems. But in the future, as a reference to that USAF RFI, I think there’s also a lot of things that we can do to help communication and get data to other aircraft and other sensors just to have more situational awareness in the battlefield space. So I think there’s a lot more potential than we have seen to date on EPAWSS. I’m really excited to see what the future holds for that integration. Tyler: AESA radar technology is known to have a secondary communications ability. So it’ll be able to move lots of data really fast, over long distances, and in a pretty secure manner too? Can you just talk about that? MS: Yeah, obviously being in the sky, we get a lot of information. Now with the focus towards mission system capability, it’ll be really important to tie the radar into that with the information that they get. And so even between aircraft, you can pass information, you have the ability to pass information between the different generations of radars as well. I think we’ve talked about concepts where we can communicate with F-18, F-16, F-22, F-35, just more information in my mind is always better in terms of where you’re at, and we definitely have that ability on the radar. It just matters in terms of where all of that is prioritized in terms of the latest capabilities that the aircrew needs in order to be successful. Tyler: Just to clarify, the radar itself can be used as an antenna to send that information, correct? MS: Yes, it can send information as well, that’s absolutely right. Tyler: On the larger picture of F-15EX’s systems, and the E’s too, for that matter, you have a targeting pod. You have an IRST [Infrared Search and Track] pod now that’s about to be fielded, which is really going to be a big deal . You have a whole new digital electronic warfare suite. The EX’s even have a missile approach warning system. With this in mind, is the radar also going to integrate with those other systems like the IRST pod? Are they going to be able to work together as a team, where the targeting pod IDs aircraft at long distances or targets on the ground that the radar spots? Can you just speak a little bit about the data fusion that’s possible with the radar in the lead here? MS: Yeah, from a high level, I think that I’m always a believer that anything is possible, and so a lot of these concepts that you’re talking about are currently in work and part of these USAF RFI responses that I had mentioned earlier. So what we’ve been trying to be as the F-15 radar provider, is to be flexible and to just have an open dialogue with our customers to try to let them know what is available, what we can do, and then ‘rack and stack’ based upon those needs to help bring those capabilities to the field. And so going into this USAF RFI and in the next couple of months where I think they’re going to do some major ‘rack and stacking’ and we’ll be able to really see what the priorities are and be able to focus on what the future of F-15EX is going to look like. Tyler: Just to expand a little bit on that, you have got this F-15 with the most powerful radar on any fighter. And it’s going to be able to go out there and see stuff at really long distances, outside the range of the platform its on being engaged. Then we have all these quiet and stealthy aircraft that will be out there as well. Do you see a synergy that’s being created with these two generations of fighters? Basically, the F-15EX is being compared to an F-35, but really, from my point of view, they’re best working together and F-15EX gives them an ability to have that big searchlight out there via its powerful radar. Is that the sort of stuff you’re talking about with the Air Force as far as advantages of the radar system in the F-15EX? MS: Yeah, what the Air Force has been doing, it seems in the last couple of years, and what we’ve been focusing on also, is operational analysis, obviously simulation of the battlefield and what things look like and how each one of the sensors can help each other out. And so I think those are definitely things that have been discussed, but those are things that still need to be worked out in terms of how we would go do that and what the mission would look like going into the future. The full Eagle family currently in the ranks of the USAF: F-15C, F-15E, and F-15EX., USAF TR: Being around the program for almost two decades, the F-15 radar program, where do you see the system in like 10 or 20 years? Where could this go? Where is the blue sky? MS: I think the future of APG-82 is bright, there are many different things that we can do from a radar perspective in terms of upgrading the radar that we are looking into, in terms of obsolescence updates that we may need to make, or capability updates that we need to bring to fight the threats that are out there. In addition to that, there’s fusion, data fusion that we can do, there are mission systems that we can also adapt into. I mean I think in every corner that you look, it helps us position us to bring the whole suite of air dominance to F-15… To be on the forefront of that and look out at that, it obviously makes me really proud to have been on the program for the last two decades. But it makes me even more excited to help shape what that future may look like, and we have a really great relationship with Boeing, we have a really great relationship with USAF, and we’re really looking forward to continuing that relationship with them. And also, from an international perspective, as I keep hitting on, the opportunities seem great there, and so it’s going to be really exciting to bring this to our international allies, as well, in the coming years. Tyler: These radars have a latent electronic warfare capability, is that just one general capability you’re looking into leveraging? MS: I don’t know how much I can say there. But there are in my mind, there’s just many different ways to slice the onion in terms of… It really goes down to what is USAF going to highly prioritize and what is Raytheon Intelligence and Space going to be in a position to provide them in terms of what that future looks like? I mean, to me there’s really nothing that can stop us, it is just how do those needs stack up with the time required to go get those things done, and some of those things. Because obviously, if a difficult algorithm needs to be developed and needs a lot of testing, and we need something very quickly, that’s going to take time and money to go get that done. We can definitely do that, it’s just is it highly prioritized on the list and is that really what the pilots need? And I think that’s what they continually struggle with in terms of getting new capability out to the field and being the most prepared if you were to have to use those capabilities. Tyler: I think the aircraft is going to have a 20,000-hour service life, so you’re going to have decades more I think to figure that out, which is the good news there. Is there anything else you would like to add that we didn’t cover? MS: I know we focused a lot on the domestic side, I did want to bring up international, I’m sure you know that one of the programs that we have upcoming here is our relationship in Japan. The F-15 radar program has over 60 years of experience working very closely with our Japanese partners, and APG-82 is the next instantiation of that. And so we are very much looking forward to that partnership with Japan to get them the most powerful AESA as well. So I think that would probably be the only thing else that I would add just because that’s on the horizon now, and that’s really exciting as well. F-15J wearing one of the amazing paint jobs some of the Japanese Eagles get., Cp9asngf /Wikicommons Tyler: We did a piece on that , on their upgrade initiative for some of their F-15s. So that would be going into their J/DJ aircraft, correct? MS: I believe so… Their existing aircraft that they have right now, yeah. Tyler: Right. That would definitely fit with what they’re looking for, from what we’ve seen too. So, any talk of Israel wanting in on the APG-82 action? They always seem to be interested in something new, and they modify their F-15s greatly . Have you been in contact with them about upgrading their aircraft? MS: I know that there’s been interest, but I think from a high level, we’re still working that out. That’s probably further on the horizon.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020","One Small Leap For A Drone Helicopter On Mars, One Giant Step For Mankind","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. NASA has successfully flown its Ingenuity helicopter drone on Mars after it arrived on the Red Planet slung under the belly of the Perseverance Rover vehicle, which touched down in February. Aloft for less than a minute, this is nonetheless the first time that an aircraft has achieved a powered, lift-borne, controlled flight on a planet other than our own. The four-pound, solar-powered helicopter is carrying with it a tiny swatch of fabric taken from one of the wings of the Wright Brothers’ Flyer I , the aircraft that made that is recognized as having completed the first powered, controlled flight within the Earth’s atmosphere, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903. While the Wright brothers confirmed the feasibility of aircraft flights on Earth, it’s hoped the Ingenuity helicopter drone will do the same thing on Mars as part of this ground-breaking technology demonstration. The video below includes the full broadcast of the landmark mission live-streamed by NASA earlier today: The photo below was taken by the navigation camera aboard Ingenuity and shows the milestone event, with the shadow of the craft hovering over the Martian surface, and transmitted back today. Flying completely autonomously, since it takes more than 11 minutes for a radio command signal to travel between Earth and Mars, the helicopter is fitted with two cameras: the black-and-white navigation camera angled toward the ground, plus a high-resolution color camera that scans the horizon. NASA “We can now say that human beings have flown a rotorcraft on another planet,” declared MiMi Aung, the project manager for Ingenuity at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, which built the helicopter. “We’ve been talking for so long about our Wright Brothers moment on Mars, and here it is.” Get to the choppa, @NASA ! pic.twitter.com/eOgBceltEO — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) April 18, 2021 Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa’s associate administrator for science, said: “Now, 117 years after the Wright brothers succeeded in making the first flight on our planet, Nasa’s Ingenuity helicopter has succeeded in performing this amazing feat on another world. While these two iconic moments in aviation history may be separated by time and 173 million miles of space, they now will forever be linked.” If you scroll to around the 42:00 mark in the video at the top of this article, you’ll see Aung tearing up the redundant contingency speech that would have been read in the Space Flight Operations Facility at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had the Ingenuity mission failed. Members of NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter team prepare to receive the data downlink showing whether the helicopter completed its first flight on April 19., NASA Failure was a real possibility since the Ingenuity mission contains no shortage of challenges. While gravity on Mars is around 38% of that of Earth, this is counterbalanced by an atmosphere that’s only one percent as dense as ours — equivalent to flying on Earth at around 50,000 feet above sea level, far above where rotorcraft operate. This means a helicopter’s rotor blades have a much harder time generating lift. To get around this, Ingenuity uses very lightweight construction allied with rotors that turn at around 2,500 revolutions per minute. You wouldn’t believe what I just saw. More images and video to come… #MarsHelicopter https://t.co/PLapgbHeZU pic.twitter.com/mbiOGx4tJZ — NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) April 19, 2021 In the event, mission control watched on as Ingenuity climbed to a height of just under 10 feet, rotated, and then landed again, after almost 40 seconds of flying. NASA’s Ingenuity Mars helicopter seen in a close-up taken by one of the cameras aboard the Perseverance Rover., NASA So far we didn’t get to see too much of that pioneering flight, either, since the bandwidth limitations mean that only a small video clip has been transmitted from Perseverance, located around 200 feet from the helicopter, and this footage took a few hours to process and reach Earth. Additional imagery and footage will be available in the days to come. Up to another five test flights of the Ingenuity are now planned, with the aim of increasing its flying altitude and range, within a 30 Martian-day (31 Earth-day) demonstration window. In another nod to the Wright Brothers, the “airstrip” from where Ingenuity will conduct further flights has been named Wright Brothers Field. This is located in the Jezero impact crater , the site of a former lake on Mars, and has also received the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) callsign IGY, just like any Earth airfield. A low-resolution view of the floor of the Jezero Crater and a portion of two wheels of the Perseverance Mars rover, captured by the color imager aboard the Ingenuity helicopter, on April 3, 2021. At this point, the rotorcraft was still beneath the rover., NASA Other objectives of the wider Perseverance program include searching for signs of ancient microbial life on Mars and demonstrating technology for future robotic exploration. The rover will conduct studies of the planet’s geology and past climate and this is the first mission planned to facilitate the retrieval of Martian rocks and dust and return them to Earth for further study. That is an ambitious target in itself, the sample-return mission (MSR) campaign. This calls for the samples to be picked up in the future by a “ fetch rover ,” launched into orbit, and delivered to an orbiter via a rendezvous in Martian orbit. The orbiter would then take the samples back to Earth. Ultimately, the program is planned to pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet . Clearly, a flying vehicle of this kind offers an entirely different type of access than a traditional wheeled or tracked rover, and, like Ingenuity, and they could be used to gather additional data over a much wider area. Planning is already underway for another NASA unmanned helicopter mission to Titan, Saturn’s latest moon, sometime in the mid-2030s. Around the same time, humans could also set foot on Mars. When they do, or when they return to Earth’s Moon , it is very likely that they will make use of similar drones, to scout ahead of them, too. In the meantime, fixed-wing options are also being assessed for potential Mars missions, including flying wing designs . With that in mind, this first tentative hop by a helicopter on the Red Planet could be the start of a whole new era of aircraft operations on other planets and moons.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 30, 2021",Project FoX Brings Tablet-Based Apps To F-35 Stealth Fighter Cockpits,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has, for the first time, live-streamed data directly from the F-35A stealth fighter and onto a commercial computer tablet in the cockpit, during ground tests at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. The March 31 trial, part of the Fighter Optimization eXperiment, or FoX, demonstrated that data from the jet could be used to communicate with mobile apps running on the tablet and there are hopes that the same concept could be used in the future on other manned fighters, as well as drones. In the initial trial, the flight test instrumentation system was streamed from the F-35’s onboard systems and onto the tablet, on which apps were running. The first two such apps, developed under Project FoX, are designed to help the pilot of the stealth jet negotiate hostile air defense systems, and to use artificial intelligence (AI) to combat the same types of threat. A pilot at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, using an F-35 Full Mission Simulator., U.S. Marine Corps Until now, although F-35 pilots regularly fly with a tablet on their knee, these haven’t been fully integrated with the cockpit and were not able to be physically plugged into the jet and receive real-time data from its own mission computers and its hugely powerful sensor suite . Now, as well as at Nellis, F-35s at Edwards Air Force Base and at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake , both in California, are also trialing the FoX Tablet interface. So far, the work had only been conducted with the jets on the ground but, once safety and security aspects are addressed, they will be used in the air, too. The first of the apps being run on the F-35’s FoX Tablet is the Battlefield Management Portal, which provides the pilot with surface-to-air threat information “in a new format designed to maximize pilot effectiveness in the suppression of air defenses [SEAD] mission.“ The second app, developed by Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Development Programs branch, uses AI to “increase the F-35’s advantages against advanced surface-to-air threats.“ Previously, this type of information would be presented to the F-35 pilot on the all-glass touchscreen display, which can be customized to present different data, and via the helmet-mounted sight. Both have been the subject of various criticisms in the past, with pilots, for example, pointing to the apparent high degree of latency in information reaching the helmet, which has also been compared unfavorably to a traditional head-up display. The touchscreen doesn’t have any tactile feel or feedback, which can make tapping-in commands a bit challenging during certain environmental and combat conditions. Even with these existing cockpit interfaces working seamlessly, there is still an argument to be made for having an additional source of situational awareness (SA), especially for the demanding SEAD mission, or other highly complex roles that the F-35 is increasingly finding itself used for, in the form of a tablet. A tablet is portable and, thanks to apps, can present a different tactical picture, or data set, than the other displays. Indeed, tablets are now a frequent fixture in the cockpits of — typically older-generation aircraft — to provide, for example, a means of displaying targeting pod data , or datalink-provided tactical and SA information , as well as flight manual and procedural info. An F-35A dedicated crew chief cleans the canopy of a jet at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Bryan Guthrie As mentioned at the top of this article, while Project FoX is being tested now with the F-35, there are plans for it to be migrated to potentially all U.S. military aircraft, both for use in combat missions and for development and test work. Since Project FoX is intended to insert advanced software and hardware quickly, it could play a big role in Air Force and Navy plans to develop new fighter aircraft and supporting systems, at a rapid pace. That fact that speed is of the essence in what the Project FoX hopes to achieve was reinforced by Lieutenant Colonel Raven “Rost“ LeClair, a test flight commander stationed at Edwards and an F-35 command chief instructor test pilot: “We are trying to find ways to go faster for less money, to bring more capability per dollar, and to push more capabilities to the warfighter more quickly… We want to shift timelines from capabilities being fielded in years to being fielded in a matter of months or weeks; both hardware and software.” While we often think about the F-35 in terms of its bleeding-edge cockpit interface and integrated avionics architectures, the fact is the technologies involved are no longer the latest and greatest, and actually tinkering with the software for an upgrade, for example, is not necessarily straightforward. Part of that is due to the way the Joint Strike Fighter has been talked about — and marketed. At one time, it was confidently predicted the F-35 would be able to have new software updates downloaded automatically, allowing new capabilities to become reality very quickly. An Air Force infographic laying out the key features of Project FoX., U.S. Air Force/Jamal D. Sutter The realization that the F-35 is not the same as an iPhone seems to have helped driven Project FoX. The initiative started life at the 461st Flight Test Squadron’s (FLTS) Future Technology Team and, according to an Air Force news release “was formed with the mission of pursuing advanced aerospace technology and rapid innovation for the F-35… after identifying capability gaps between the vision for agile software development and reality.” For the F-35, at least, while an integrated, missionized tablet offers all kinds of SA advantages for pilots flying into future battlespaces, it is likely that, at the beginning, Project FoX will be a tool to smooth the testing and fielding of new capabilities, such as the forthcoming Block 4 software package . This promises to enable enhanced radar and electronic warfare capabilities , as well as the ability to carry new weapons . And beyond the Joint Strike Fighter, the Project FoX team is hopeful that the technology developed will filter down not only to other aircraft, but should “eventually optimize capabilities for every DoD platform through state-of-the-art methods, combat autonomous toolsets, and hardware and software solutions.” That sounds incredibly ambitious, but combining the cockpit-integrated tablet with a “DoD Combat App Store” could be the way to achieve it, borrowing concept and terminology from the commercial sector. Ultimately, an app developed to help an F-35 pilot fly a SEAD mission could be downloaded onto a tablet used by an EA-18G Growler pilot, or the pilot of any other relevant platforms, including training assets, for that matter. “There is no reason why I can’t test the same capability and app on F-18 before F-35 or risk reduce software on F-35 for use by unpiloted aircraft,” LeClair explained. “By connecting a tablet to an aircraft’s data bus, the warfighter and tester will be able to utilize an entire DoD Combat App store of tools, customized to help solve tactical problems in real time.” Lt. Col. Raven LeClair, 370th Flight Test Squadron test flight commander and 461st FLTS F-35 command chief instructor test pilot, fields questions., U.S. Air Force/Giancarlo Casem “It also opens up a whole new world of opportunity for live-fly modeling and simulation,” LeClair added. “We will be able to find software bugs that escape the lab sooner and fix them faster, rapidly integrate AI tools that could never be run on the actual aircraft due to hardware limitations, provide unprecedented cyber-attack awareness and protection, and crowdsource testing on multiple platforms.” Returning to the smartphone analogy, Lieutenant Colonel James Valpiani, 461st’s commander and F-35 integrated test force director, explained that the jet “has tens of millions of lines of code. And, of course, it’s different than an iPhone or Tesla in that people are trying to shoot it down. It is a very complex aircraft with a very complex mission and an adversarial mission.” So while it has been acknowledged that the F-35 needs to be able to embody software and hardware changes fast, the path to actually realizing agile development has taken two years, according to Valpiani. Preflight checks are carried out on a T-6 Texan II trainer using an electronic flight bag., U.S. Air Force /Sean M. Worrell As to how pilots will adapt to the FoX Tablet, LeClair said that “They want this, and they want it yesterday,” noting the “tremendous support from combat aviators.” LeClair likened the tablet concept to an electronic flight bag, the electronic information management device that has replaced the paperwork previously used for flight management tasks. In this way, the FoX Tablet would likely include flight maps, operating manuals, and perhaps even aircraft diagnostic data, as well as a range of apps optimized for different missions or test programs. The tablet could also allow data to be displayed differently than what an aircraft’s cockpit displays will allow. For instance, 3D situational awareness display rendering, where threats and other situational and navigational information are displayed in a spatially volumetric form, can provide a huge advantage for aircrews trying to survive in a very dynamic and hostile environment. Some of the latest aircraft have wide area displays and graphics capabilities to do this. As far as we know, the F-35, whose systems are based on nearly 20-year-old tech today, is not capable of being able to generate this type of visual interface. But a tablet could be able to without upgrading the entire cockpit and its backend computing systems that drive its visual interfaces. The Super Hornet Block III’s wide-area display and powerful display processing technology can show a 3D instead of a 2D render of the situation around the aircraft at any given time., Boeing After the FoX Tablet comes the FoX BoX, which should optimize its utility in the cockpit. This is being developed at NAWS China Lake, home to ongoing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet mission systems test work. It aims to use a cyber-secure chipset to run “high-level, AI-capable computer processors that will serve as an operating system to communicate to aircraft, allowing the FoX Tablet to function mainly as a visual interface for aircrew.“ Meanwhile, ground tests of the tablet will continue on the F-35, before moving to the F/A-18, F-16 , and the F-22 . A first test flight — aboard an as yet unconfirmed platform — should take place later this year. It’s a program that could have a significant impact in the cockpits of a whole range of aircraft, and one that we will continue to watch with interest.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 3, 2021",A B-1B Bomber Suffered Significant Engine Damage While Deployed To Norway,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the U.S. Air Force’s B-1B bombers that took part in a historic deployment to Norway earlier this year suffered significant engine damage while in that country in a mishap that has not been previously reported. That incident is directly linked to a decision by the leadership of the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas to relieve a maintenance squadron commander there “due to loss of confidence” in their ability to command. The 7th Bomb Wing’s public affairs office confirmed that the mishap occurred and that it took place in Norway in a statement to The War Zone on Apr. 16, 2021. Four B-1Bs from the Wing’s 9th Bomb Squadron arrived at the Royal Norwegian Air Force’s Ørland Main Air Station in February. That deployment officially wrapped up in March . A B-1B bomber assigned to the 7th Bomb Wing at Ørland Main Air Station in Norway in March 2021., USAF “During a recent deployment to Norway, a B-1B did have engine damage but that incident is still under investigation and we are unable to provide further information at this time,” Technical Sergeant David Scott-Gaughan, a spokesperson for the 7th Bomb Wing, said. “A commander at Dyess AFB was relieved of command due to loss of confidence in her ability to lead the squadron.” Sources had previously told The War Zone that the incident occurred when a tablet computer was ingested in one of the engines, which caused substantial damage, necessitating the replacement of both engines on one side of the aircraft. The 7th Bomb Wing would neither confirm nor deny any of these specific details. It is worth noting that the Air Force had released pictures of B-1Bs returning to Dyess on March 23 following their deployment to Norway. Just this week, however, on April 12, the service announced that a lone B-1B assigned to the 7th Bomb Wing had flown from Ørland Main Air Station back to the Aegean Sea, which is situated between Greece and Turkey. “The bomber will return to Dyess AFB upon completion of the mission,” according to an official release . B-1Bs on the ground at Dyess Air Force Base on March 23 after returning from Norway., USAF That flight followed long-range, round-trip sorties that B-1Bs flew over the Aegean from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota last week. Those flights appeared to be, at least in part, a message aimed at Russia over its worrying and still-ongoing military buildup along its borders with Ukraine, which you can read about more here . Still, no explanation was given as to why this other B-1B was still in Norway nearly three weeks after the official end of the 7th Bomb Wing’s deployment to that country. This could lend credence to the information our sources had provided about the aircraft requiring substantial repairs to get it flying again. “Our commitment to regional peace and stability is unwavering,” Air Force General Jeff Harrigian, head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa (USAFE/AFAFRICA), said in a statement at the time. “Missions like this are just one example of NATO’s ready, lethal force that can respond to any global threat at a moment’s notice.” The 7th Bomb Wing did confirm to The War Zone that Lieutenant Colonel Kristen Shadden was the officer relieved of command in relation to the mishap. Military.com had reported earlier this month that the Wing’s commander, Colonel Jose Sumangil, had removed Shadden, then in charge of the 7th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, from her post on March 29. “As the commander of the 7th Bomb Wing, I do not take this decision lightly,” Sumangil had said in a statement to Military.com , but did not explain what the inciting incident had been. “At this time, our focus is on taking care of our airmen and ensuring a safe and disciplined work environment.” “Lt. Col. Shadden has been temporarily reassigned to a different unit at Dyess while her follow-on assignment is being determined,” Technical Sergeant Scott-Gaughan, the 7th Bomb Wing spokesperson, also told that outlet at the time, but did not elaborate on the circumstances leading to her relief. The Air Force had previously highlighted Shadden and the rest of the 7th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron as being critical players in getting the four B-1Bs ready for their deployment to Norway. Those preparations had been carried out at Dyess while the base, as well as Texas, as a whole, along with other neighboring states, was reeling from the effects of winter storm Uri. There are already estimates that predict that the total costs incurred from that storm, including from immediate damage and longer-term economic impacts , will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. “It did slow things down quite a bit, especially with the ramp being covered in snow and ice our people had to slow down to stay safe while they worked,” Lieutenant Colonel Shadden said in an interview for an official Air Force news story in March. “We had to get the aircraft deployed.” A view of the flight line at Dyess Air Force Base in the aftermath of winter storm Uri., USAF “We, as the 7th Bomb Wing, had committed to the combatant commanders that we were going to have four aircraft that deployed to Norway, and that was the goal,” she continued. “We had to make sure we had all these aircraft, including spares available, so that we could get these aircraft launched out on time.” The four B-1Bs did ultimately deploy as planned to Norway. During the deployment, the bombers conducted various sorties above and around the increasingly strategic Arctic region. This included one training mission that also involved B-2 stealth bombers , which had flown in from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri by way of Lajes Field in the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean. B-2 stealth bombers at Lajes Field in the Azores in March 2021., USAF In addition to the significance of demonstrating the Air Force’s ability to forward deploy bombers to locations from which they are better positioned to conduct Arctic operations, the Norway deployment also underscored the continued importance of the B-1Bs to the Air Force’s current bomber concepts of operation , in general. These new operating models are heavily focused on short-notice forward deployments around the world , carried out at irregular intervals , as well as long-range, round trip sorties to strategically significant areas from bases in the United States. At the same time, the Air Force is in the process of sending 17 of its oldest B-1Bs to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona with the express goal of improving the readiness of its remaining fleet of the bombers and ensuring their continued relevance for years to come. With this in mind, the service has been pushing ahead with efforts to expand the arsenal of these aircraft, including plans for the integration of future hypersonic weapons and the restored ability to carry various stores on external pylons . With all this in mind, it’s possible that there could be a silver lining to this B-1B mishap in Norway. The incident could provide valuable additional data and experience with regards to conducting significant repairs on these aircraft at forward locations, and any major hurdles involved in doing so, within the context of the Air Force’s current rapid-deployment concepts of operation. What the Air Force has learned from this particular mishap, and what changes it may decide to make to various tactics, techniques, and procedures, will certainly become more apparent when more information about the incident becomes publicly available.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",New Army Training Doc Outlines Ways To Give Soldiers Superhuman-Like Sensory Perception,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has published a new training circular that contains a section on how soldiers can train their senses to new levels of awareness, enabling them to almost unconsciously perceive small details about their surroundings in a near-superhuman manner. Other sections of the circular describe how cultural anthropology, the study of world religions, and even Gestalt psychology , can be leveraged in U.S. Army training in order to make soldiers into what some might call “warrior monks” with near-preternatural deductive reasoning ability. While many will scoff at some of the loftier ideas in the training circular, the document cites numerous case studies of soldiers in the field in which a greater sense of situational awareness could have saved lives. The Army is already offering training courses in this new type of Advanced Situational Awareness (ASA) at Fort Benning in Georgia, which is home to the service’s Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE). MCoE oversees the Army’s Infantry and Armor Schools, among other responsibilities. The training circular , published by the Headquarters of the Department of the Army this month, outlines a variety of techniques and requirements through which soldiers can learn Advanced Situational Awareness training methods of optimizing human performance “through building the skills necessary to develop agile, resilient, adaptive, and innovative Soldiers who thrive in conditions of uncertainty and chaos.” The document mostly focuses on ways by which soldiers can optimize and heighten their observation skills, enabling them to respond to anomalies or recognize unusual behaviors or objects that may present a threat more quickly. Using this training, the document writes, soldiers can “achieve a better understanding of their organic equipment and system: their capabilities, limitations, and components.” This heightened sensory perception “can lead to a new level of “Advanced Situational Awareness,” the circular claims, which “can be crucial to Soldier survival, as use of the sensory system provides input into a Soldier’s decision-making process.” U.S. Army According to Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) regulations , training circulars “are official departmental publications that are not doctrine, but doctrine based.” The information in training circulars can range from how to train for specific events or to operate certain pieces of equipment, or even contain “detailed procedures of a technical nature.” Training circulars have no set format or development process. This latest training circular claims that the U.S. Army’s Advanced Situational Awareness training is “designed to support Soldiers’ cognitive skills on the battlefield to create preemptive decision-making over threats, thereby increasing their combat lethality.” This training should be designed “with a combat focus and an understanding of the tactical mindset,” the circular reads. The document touches upon various facets of cognitive and Gestalt psychology, neuroscience, and even sociology in an attempt to develop ways through which soldiers can heighten their perception of their environments. The ASA training circular even recommends studies in theology, anthropology, and cultural studies as ways to better understand the motivations of human actors that soldiers may encounter in an overseas operation. Case studies are presented that highlight how better cross-cultural understanding and perception abilities may have prevented terror attacks in several overseas theaters, noting that sometimes recognizing an odd piece of debris by a roadside could have been the deciding factor in saving service members’ lives. A heavy emphasis is placed throughout the ASA document on the recognition of anomalies, either in human behavior or in soldiers’ physical environments. “Anomalies are the changes in something that occur above or below an established baseline. Soldiers should be cognizant of anomalies or activities occurring in an environment that are contrary to the norm,” the training circular reads. “Environments are the sum of the people and objects interacting with the surroundings and reacting to external stimuli; therefore, people and objects exhibiting suspicious behaviors or patterns can impact a baseline. These impacts can cause subtle changes, which can also indicate baseline anomalies. Every anomaly must be analyzed.” U.S. Army However, somewhat stranger sections of the document outline ways soldiers may be able to attune or train their sensory perception in order to respond to threats on a near-unconscious level. “A Soldier typically only uses 2 percent of the potential provided by the sense of smell,” the training circular reads. “Despite the fact that these senses are underutilized, they still provide useful target indicators. For example, cooking food, fires, cigarettes, aftershave lotion, soap, and insect repellents can indicate the presence of people.” Soldiers already depend on K9 units and the heightened olfactory senses of their highly-trained dogs for this very reason. U.S. Army Currently, Fort Benning offers two courses in Advanced Situational Awareness. The base’s Advanced Situational Awareness website states that the courses will teach soldiers how “to integrate the six domains of human behavior into training and combat, and to demonstrate how they can be applied to enhance the Squads ability to achieve overmatch in a universal operational environment.” The circular describes the soldier’s sensory system as “a valuable piece of equipment” and adds that if soldiers can heighten their sensory perception, they can “become more proactive and stay left of bang”: Soldiers train to achieve a better understanding of their organic equipment and system: their capabilities, limitations, and components. A Soldier’s sensory system is a valuable piece of equipment. The body cannot respond to a threat until directed by the brain, and the brain does not initiate action until the senses react to some external stimuli. Becoming more adept at performing these actions can be crucial to Soldier survival, as use of the sensory system provides input into a Soldier’s decision-making process. An eight-step training model is offered in the document. Concrete examples are presented about how to train soldiers how to recognize camouflage, differentiate between types of sources when using infrared optics, or even recognize the smell of various types of engine exhaust. Steven Aftergood, Director of the Federation of American Scientists’ (FAS) Project on Government Secrecy, told The War Zone that while the training circular is certainly curious in some regards, it shouldn’t be taken to represent a huge shift in the ways soldiers are trained for the field. “The document is an interesting artifact of military culture,” Aftergood said. “I doubt that it represents the Army as a whole, but it will be very attractive to a certain kind of person. It portrays the soldier not as some kind of grunt, but as a near-superman with hyper-senses that can out-perceive and out-think the adversary.” U.S. Army Some of the loftier goals in the ASA document are reminiscent of the “ First Earth Battalion ” dreamed up by Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channon. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, New Age ideas about human potential had become popular throughout wide swaths of American society, including, apparently, some in the U.S. Army leadership, such as Major General Albert Stubblebine, whose last posting before retirement was as head of the service’s Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM). Channon dreamed up a more perfect kind of ”warrior monk” type of soldier able to “connect naturally with others at higher and higher levels of awareness and performance.” The bizarre saga of Channon and Stubblebine was chronicled by Jon Ronson in his 2009 book The Men Who Stare at Goats . While there’s nothing in this new U.S. Army circular about staring at goats, it highlights an increasing focus on enhanced human performance throughout the DOD. The Air Force Research Laboratory is looking into ways of enhancing learning through the use of novel neurotechnologies or even maximize human physical potential by gathering revolutionary new levels of data about the human body. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army is also looking into ways to unlock the full potential of soldiers’ brains through technology. According to the Association of the United States Army (AUSA), some researchers claim that ”cognitive enhancement could be key to ensuring soldiers are physiologically equipped for the adversary of 2050.” The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and other military laboratories have been testing methods of improving learning and memory through auditory stimulation or biofeedback, or even how to restore memory functions in troops. “There is an enormous amount of cognitive training that can be done, tapping into the networks of the brain that can be improved, like visual processing, memory and other things, even dramatic improvements,” said Amy Kruse, a former DARPA project manager. “The mind and the body are quite connected.” It is that mind-body relationship that ties this new U.S. Army training circular to this broader area of human performance research being conducted in DOD labs. One of the goals of the “Core Mental Skills” in the U.S. Army’s Advanced Situational Awareness circular is to “Mentally rehearse successful performances to program the mind and body to perform automatically and without hesitation.” Thus, the goals of the training circular, while lofty and intriguing, are certainly grounded in reality. “Without the Soldier, weapons and tactics are useless,” the training circular reads. Why wouldn’t Army leadership want those soldiers to have the best cognitive tools available to them in order to best apply weapons and tactics and “out-perceive” their enemies?

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 2, 2021",Adversary Drones Are Spying On The U.S. And The Pentagon Acts Like They’re UFOs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We may not know the identities of all the mysterious craft that American military personnel and others have been seeing in the skies as of late, but I have seen more than enough to tell you that it is clear that a very terrestrial adversary is toying with us in our own backyard using relatively simple technologies—drones and balloons—and making off with what could be the biggest intelligence haul of a generation. While that may disappoint some who hope the origins of all these events are far more exotic in nature, the strategic implications of these bold operations, which have been happening for years, undeterred, are absolutely massive. Our team here at The War Zone has spent the last two years indirectly laying out a case for the hypothesis that many of the events involving supposed UFOs, or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), as they are now often called, over the last decade are actually the manifestation of foreign adversaries harnessing advances in lower-end unmanned aerial vehicle technology, and even simpler platforms, to gather intelligence of extreme fidelity on some of America’s most sensitive warfighting capabilities. Now, considering all the news on this topic in recent weeks, including our own major story on a series of bizarre incidents involving U.S. Navy destroyers and ‘UAP’ off the Southern California coast in 2019, it’s time to not only sum up our case, but to discuss the broader implications of these revelations, what needs to be done about them, and the Pentagon’s fledgling ‘UAP Task Force’ as a whole. A big pill to swallow Yes, I realize that the idea that an adversary is penetrating U.S. military training areas unmolested, and has been for years, using lowly drone technology and balloons, is a big pill to swallow, but as one of the people who have repeatedly warned about the threat posed by lower-end drones for a decade—warnings that largely were dismissed by the Pentagon until drones made or altered in ramshackle ISIS workshops in a war zone were literally raining down bomblets on U.S. and allied forces in Iraq—it isn’t really surprising at all. Nor is the fact that the Defense Department is still playing catch-up when it comes to the realities surrounding the drone threat , and not just to its forces abroad , but also to the homeland overall. The utter lack of vision and early robust interest in regards to this emerging threat will go down as one of the Pentagon’s biggest strategic missteps of our time. After years of not taking the threat from drones seriously, the Pentagon is trying to play catch up, including weaponizing swarm technology for their own uses across the services. Here is a screengrab from swarming test of Coyote drones., USN Screencap The gross inaction and the stigma surrounding unexplained aerial phenomena as a whole has led to what appears to be the paralyzation of the systems designed to protect us and our most critical military technologies, pointing to a massive failure in U.S. military intelligence. This is a blind spot we ourselves literally created out of cultural taboos and a military-industrial complex that is ill-suited to foresee and counter a lower-end threat that is very hard to defend against. Before I move forward, I must state that just because I believe the evidence is compelling that many of the bizarre encounters with mysterious objects in the sky as of late, and especially those that the U.S. military is experiencing, emanate from peer-state competitors, not another dimension or another solar system, there are certainly well-documented cases of seemingly unexplainable events that have nothing to do with this type of capability. In other words, our conclusions do not come even close to answering the question of UAPs or UFOs as a whole, especially in terms of the many unexplained incidents in decades past. What they do is highlight an alarming new capability set and tactics that seem to have been allowed to be exploited with little response for years while the Pentagon scratched its head and shrugged, or even worse, turned largely a blind eye toward it. And that brings us to one of the biggest problems with this topic, as a whole—people expect one blanket and grand explanation for the entire UFO mystery to one day emerge. This is flawed thinking at its core. This issue is clearly one with multiple explanations due to the wide range of events that have occurred under a huge number of circumstances. This thinking must be changed as it limits our ability to solve some mysteries in the hopes of coming up with some fantastical monolithic explanation for every related mystery. So, accepting that there is likely a wide array of explanations to this notoriously abused topic will be absolutely key to successfully studying it and destigmatizing it in our culture, and especially within U.S. military and intelligence circles. With that in mind, I also believe America’s prevailing cultural issues and the general stigma surrounding UFOs was successfully targeted and leveraged by our adversaries, which helped these activities to persist far longer than they should have. In fact, I believe that those in power who snicker about credible reports of strange objects in the sky and stymie research into them, including access to classified data, have become a threat to national security themselves. Their lack of imagination, curiosity, and creativity appears to have built a near-perfect vacuum that our enemies could exploit and likely have exploited to an astonishing degree. A very enticing target Nearly two years ago, I wrote a widely circulated piece that addressed my thoughts on the Pentagon’s sudden willingness to talk about UFOs and its potential implications. I went through the possibilities as I saw them, but above all else, it was clear that this wasn’t some over-hyped myth. Something strange was indeed going on. Soon after, we were the first to connect key technologies that had emerged around the time that sightings of certain types of mysterious UAPs began to accelerate amongst military personnel—in particular, Navy fighter pilots. This was largely based around new air defense data-fusion and networking capabilities being installed on Navy warships and aircraft, as well as the proliferation of Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars on Navy fighters and airborne early warning and control planes . We also noted that the most remarkable appearances of these objects seemed to correlate with major Navy exercises where these advances in air defense capabilities were being fully integrated across a Carrier Strike Group. In other words, it seemed that these mysterious craft had a very keen interest in America’s latest and greatest operational counter-air capabilities. Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group., USN We then got clarification from pilot witnesses on key claims about what they and their squadron mates had experienced before pursuing what was an inconvenient hypothesis for many—that at least some of what these aircrews and vessels were encountering were not an exotic unexplained phenomenon at all, but were in fact adversary drones and lighter-than-air platforms (balloons) meant to stimulate America’s most capable air defense systems and collect extremely high-quality electronic intelligence data on them. And this is critical data, incidentally, that is very hard to reliably obtain otherwise. These radar emissions, and the datalink communications that go along with them, underpin highly networked counter-air architectures that are unmatched anywhere on earth. By gathering comprehensive electronic intelligence information on these systems, countermeasures and electronic warfare tactics can be developed to disrupt or defeat them. Capabilities can also be accurately estimated and even cloned and tactics can be recorded and exploited. The very signatures of these waveforms alone can be used to identify, classify, and geolocate them by adversary platforms during a time of war, providing a big leg-up when it comes to battlespace awareness. We are talking about everything from common operating frequencies to highly-sensitive low-probability of intercept emissions tactics, to datalink encryption, to distinct radar modes and employment procedures here. In other words, this is among the most critical intelligence a peer-state enemy can obtain and there aren’t many easy ways of doing it. Even in a war zone, where aircraft and their systems are operating potentially in the same general area as adversary intelligence-collection systems, using their full combat capabilities may be restricted to maintain the secrets of those critical capabilities. Proximity to the emitters in question and how long their emissions are exposed to an intelligence-gathering system is a major limitation, as well. Traditional espionage is another way adversaries look to gain information on these critical systems, as well, but nothing beats going out and actually sucking up the electronic signatures as best you can. Actually becoming the target of their interest takes the quality of intelligence collected to a whole other level. Historic precedent The beginning of making the case for drones and balloons being the culprit for much of the recent UAP activity came when we posted an entire historical precedent for very similar operations dating back to the development of the A-12 Oxcart spy plane and the advent of modern electronic warfare itself. In essence, during the early 1960s, the CIA launched radar reflectors on balloons off Cuba’s coastline via a U.S. Navy submarine and employed an electronic warfare system called PALLADIUM that would trick the latest Soviet radar systems into showing their operators that enemy aircraft were rushing toward Cuban shores or doing all types of crazy maneuvers. This coaxed the Cuban air defense system and its radars to light up and spurred rapid communications between air defenders on the island. The balloon-borne radar reflectors of different sizes also showed up on the Soviet radars, and by monitoring the targets that the radar operators concentrated on, and thus could detect, it was determined how sensitive their Soviet radar systems actually were. This provided critical information on the survivability of the Mach 3+ and somewhat stealthy A-12, but beyond that, it set a precedent of how electronic warfare and airborne targets could be used to prod an enemy’s air defenses so that critical intelligence as to their capabilities could be determined—all without actually putting a pilot in the air at risk. A-12 Oxcart, the Skunk Works’ predecessor to the SR-71., USAF That was just the start of these types of operations. As the decades went by, far more complex and capable integrated air defenses began proliferating throughout the globe, placing a greater need on collecting this type of critical information. From what we understand, PALLADIUM evolved and subsequently spiraled into a far wider electronic intelligence gathering ecosystem, much of which is still highly secretive in nature and exists to this day. The U.S. has extremely capable standoff electronic intelligence-gathering aircraft, such as the U.S. Air Force’s manned RC-135 Combat Sent and Rivet Joint , as well as the Navy’s EP-3E Aries and P-8A Poseidon , not to mention U-2S Dragon Lady and unmanned RQ-4 Global Hawk , that are all capable of building up a picture of the enemy’s electronic order of battle from a distance. Even America’s top fighter aircraft are increasingly equipped with digital electronic warfare suites including highly advanced electronic support measures (ESM) that can provide tactical electronic intelligence of very high quality. Other countries, such as Russia and China, possess electronic intelligence (ELINT) gathering aircraft types, as well, albeit without the same level of capabilities or, in some cases, the same international reach and persistence. The RC-135U is especially well equipped to build up a regional electronic order of battle on a potential adversary, but it can only do so outside of said adversary’s sovereign airspace. Still, they have been known to make runs toward those boundaries in the hope of stimulating the air defense network they are trying to surveil. , USAF While the United States also has very advanced, stealthy assets that can penetrate into enemy airspace to collect electronic intelligence data of a totally different fidelity, right near the emitters themselves and over long periods, America’s adversaries do not, at least not yet. They have also historically lagged behind the U.S. government in space-based ELINT systems, which offer another way to scoop up emissions coming out of denied areas, and do so discreetly. This leaves America’s potential foes to have to get more creative in order to obtain this critical information. So, for the time being, even though exquisite stealth unmanned aircraft may be out of their reach, swarms of lower-end drones and other less-advanced unmanned airborne platforms certainly are not. And regardless of America’s own stealth capabilities, one would be remiss if they were to believe that clandestine operations, such as the one using PALLADIUM 60 years ago, aren’t still going on today. In fact, we know the use of balloons strapped with payloads to collect vital intelligence continued throughout the Cold War. While manned overflights of the Soviet Union ended with the U-2 crisis in May 1960, high-altitude balloons continued to float across Soviet and Warsaw Pact borders for decades to follow. Unsurprisingly, this activity was conducted covertly, but continued even after the advent of spy satellites. For the Soviet Air Defense Forces in particular, the balloons were a significant menace, proving especially hard to defeat. There is evidence that at least some Soviet fighter units maintained gun-armed interceptors at round-the-clock readiness specifically to shoot down the intruding balloons and one aircraft, the M-17 Mystic , was even developed to carry out this particular mission, although it never entered service in this role. The Russians surely took note of this unique intelligence-gathering application. Fast forward to the 21st Century, and revolution in lower-end unmanned aircraft has provided the perfect attritable platform—one robust enough to carry out the task, but low-cost enough so that it wouldn’t matter if it got lost in the process—for just such a mission set. And, as we explained in great detail, so are balloons carrying radar reflectors and expendable electronic intelligence and even electronic warfare payloads. Whereas 60 years ago, electronic warfare systems may have required an entire plane or a large pod on a plane, today totally expendable electronic warfare systems that can wreak havoc on radars and other air defense nodes can be dropped out of a chaff and flare dispenser or be housed in the tip of a small missile —or flown on a balloon or lower-end drone . Preconceived notions In our investigative pieces on PALLADIUM , we also detailed how radar reflector balloons can be made in many configurations and we even discovered a patent dating back to well before PALLADIUM for a radar reflector balloon that is an exact visual match for the initially totally bizarre-sounding “cube inside a sphere” objects that Navy pilots had reported seeing off the east coast. We also discovered that initial reports that pilots visually saw these craft moving erratically were incorrect. In fact, when physically encountered, they were floating in the air and acting exactly as balloons would. Airborne radar reflector patent dating back to 1945 that matches exactly what pilots described to have seen off the east coast in the middle of the last decade. , USPTO While balloons can look like virtually anything , drones can also look very strange due to the huge amount of configurations that exist. When most people think of drones they picture a small fixed-wing airplane or quadcopter type setup. That may be true for the heart of the burgeoning civilian market, but there are far more configurations, some of which look downright alien and perform unlike a traditional fixed-wing aircraft or quadcopter. These include everything from triangle-shaped flying wings to hybrid rotor/fixed-wing aircraft or even a vertical tube with a rotor at each end. There are even drones that launch smaller parasite drones and act as their mothership. New drone swarm platform tested by CN defense contractor on March 20: the “unmanned colony mothership system” (蜂群无人子母系统) developed by Zhongtian Feilong (中天飞龙) Intelligent Technology Co. deployed 9 drones for recon, strike, and jamming (干扰), and other missions pic.twitter.com/7FFziXUx4u — Devin Thorne (@D_Thorne) April 7, 2021 The U.S. Navy’s Nomad drone, an electronic warfare payload-carrying system, looks totally bizarre and would have flight characteristics that would appear very strange to someone who had no idea it exists. , USN Drones can also be networked together and fly in formation. They may not all look the same, either. For instance, smaller drones may be accompanied by a larger drone that carries computing hardware and communications gear, such as a basic satcom terminal or line-of-sight data-link, working as the command and control and communications router for the swarm. Or they may not have any man-in-the-loop communications at all, instead, they can be programmed to fly a pre-planned course or be equipped with programming for them to seek out certain stimuli in their environment, such as particular radar emissions, and to fly certain preplanned programs near those emitters. In fact, some of the biggest leaps in lower-drone technology came from Israel decades ago when they developed drone systems suited for seeking radar emitters and confusing or destroying them. They can also have surprisingly long range. Iran has many small and relatively cheap fixed-wing drones that can fly very long distances running on efficient, small gasoline motors, for instance. These drones can travel hundreds of miles and loiter for hours while still carrying a relevant payload and have been thoroughly weaponized and used repeatedly in offensive operations . This has led to dystopian warnings to Americans visiting or living in one of the world’s most highly defended capital cities. When it comes to drone configurations, there are a huge number of them being operated or developed around the globe by nefarious actors. The delta-wing design is among the most popular for lower-end militarized drones as it provides high efficiency for long range, a wide operational envelope, and has good stability. It also has a perfect area to install a radiation seeker, optical sensor, electronic warfare payload, or a warhead. , Saudi MOD These are just some general parameters that are the actual reality when it comes to unmanned systems, and they differ drastically from the assumptions most people make about smaller drones in general. I often hear “oh they can’t fly that way” or “they can’t fly that long, the battery would run out” or “they couldn’t be jammed so there is no way they are drones.” These statements are blatantly wrong, not just when it comes to the capabilities of a peer competitor, but even a less capable country or even a non-state actor. Small weaponized drones, especially those that carry an explosive charge, have become a cheap asymmetric linchpin capability and, just as I predicted years ago, are rapidly evolving into becoming game-changers on the modern battlefield. They are also becoming a big business and their use as assassination tools has migrated to drug cartels and other organized crime syndicates. Even their development has devolved down to individuals and small rogue groups operating far from war zones. https://youtube.com/watch?v=zwGU8ATz_pY Simply put, when it comes to lower-end drones, most people’s assumptions seem to be pulled out of thin air or from what they have seen at the electronics section at big box stores. As such, these preconceived notions are indicators of why relatively simple drones and their unique configurations and performance characteristics can seem unfamiliar, even to experienced fighter pilots or observers on the ground that have never been really trained on these threats and all the different ways that can manifest themselves. The swarm is not science fiction When it comes to the U.S. Navy, it is using swarms of lower-end networked drones, submarines, ships, unmanned underwater vehicles, and more, to convince the enemy to think they are seeing ghost fleets and aerial armadas that aren’t really there. You don’t have to take our word for it, the Navy has a program of record for just this—that being Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS. The War Zone was the first to report on this program, which you can read all about here , but, suffice to say, it lays out an architecture that represents a quantum leap in electronic warfare. Yet none of its components are all that exquisite; it’s just the networking of them together and being able to combine their effects cooperatively with highly agile computing and software that is. Swarming drones working together to decoy, jam, and distract the enemy? That is not a high-end capability. Unifying those effects with ships, other aircraft, submarines, and more in real-time to make multiple enemy sensors in disparate locations see the same thing? That is revolutionary. Basic NEMESIS overview. , USN After we posted the NEMESIS piece, many were asking our opinion if it was what Navy pilots had encountered off America’s eastern seaboard. I am comfortable stating that I don’t believe those incidents were all secret American tests of elements of what could be incorporated into NEMESIS. Quite the contrary, I believe it was largely a foreign power actively using what could be described as some components similar to what could be found in the NEMESIS ecosystem to collect critical intelligence on America’s most advanced sensor systems and more. Once again, this doesn’t mean everything aircrews saw off the east coast during this period were these capabilities, but it seems like a glaringly obvious explanation for most of them, and it is far more so now than it was when we first reported on those incidents. Also, many of the strange high-performance characteristics ships and planes sometimes detect by radar at beyond visual range during these incidents can and likely are the result of electronic warfare. In fact, things like rapid accelerations in speed and sudden drops in altitude on radar represent very basic tenets of electronic warfare tactics. In the case of the east coast events, for instance, as far as we have been told, the high-performance capabilities of these objects were never visually observed, but they were seen on radar. The visual encounters describe balloon-like objects doing balloon-like things—not moving fast at all—while other objects feature performance more similar to drones than anything else. Months after reporting on NEMESIS, we acquired the Naval Safety Center incident reports spanning most of the 2010s regarding anomalous objects that fighter pilots encountered off the eastern seaboard of the United States. What we found was stunning . While there were only a limited number of reports, and there were very likely other reports never filed with the safety center and instead filed as classified intelligence events, the ones that were there didn’t describe alien craft at all. Instead, they described jet-powered, missile-like drones and other unmanned fixed-wing aircraft flying up in the flight levels, as well as multi-rotor drones hovering at very high altitudes far out to sea. There there are balloon-like objects, the origins of which were all unexplained even after official investigations. An airspace map showing the W-122 warning area off the coast of North Carolina where some of the incidents in the reports The War Zone received reportedly occurred. W-72, where the bulk of the incidents took place, is visible to the north., VFRmap.com Certainly no civilian is flying cruise missile-like aircraft at high altitude dozens of miles off the east coast. And flying a multi-rotor drone far out to sea at bizarrely high altitudes isn’t normal. So, who do these belong to? Well if not us, and they are clearly not of an alien origin, then someone else. And who would want to be flying around in these specific chunks of airspace that are literally designated for use by America’s top military aircraft, with the Navy’s most capable warships often operating below? America’s preeminent adversaries—China and Russia—that’s who. The motive and the opportunity Those warning areas—airspace that can be set aside for military training—are where America’s most advanced sensors blare their powerful radio-frequency communications and sensor systems day in and day out. F-22s, F-35s, F/A-18E/Fs, F-15Es, E-2Ds, and much more, fill those training areas daily. Below them, Aegis Combat System -equipped cruisers and destroyers, and America’s supercarriers and amphibious assault ships, push their radar and networking systems to the limit to keep their skills sharp and to train for upcoming deployments. We are talking about the most advanced air defense sensor and networking technology on planet earth all operating in one region (the counterpart being off the coast of Southern California) as reliably as the office hours at your local bank. And they are doing so while at home, in areas where, unless intelligence warns them of spy ship activity nearby, their systems are largely being used to their maximum potential. All that potential intelligence zapping through the air, operating as if it is far from prying eyes. Simply put, it is the biggest electronic intelligence target on earth and the lowly drone and balloon, paired with America’s strange aversion to taking unusual things in the sky seriously, have provided the perfect medium for which to gobble it up with little to no chance of major repercussions. The E-2D Hawkeye represents a quantum leap in capability over its already capable predecessor. Based out of NAS Norfolk, the E-2s are out in these training areas regularly, as well as the fighters., USN In fact, the Navy fighter pilot who has spoken about recent experiences with the UAP issue the most, Ryan Graves, seemed to have inadvertently summed up what I believe has been going on, and not as a secondary ‘worst case’ possibility as he describes it. Graves stated the following on the Kevin Rose Show : “If we do have what we would call a ‘red threat,’ one of our traditional enemies that are using some type of perhaps new technology, or hard to identify technology that is out there in our working areas soaking up our waveforms and our radar and our sensor and our comms, watching our tactics on a daily basis, it’s a major, major intelligence failure to have these things out there. And because they look slightly different than what our average threat would look like, everyone wants to ignore it. So if we had a Chinese or Russian fighter jet flying out there watching us it would be a major deal. But because it looks slightly different we want to ignore it.” Once again, it is a hard pill to swallow, but, nevertheless, bingo! Robots in disguise As we noted earlier, these drones and the balloons, in particular, could also look very strange to pretty much anyone who encounters them, even like a cube inside a sphere, or a metallic blimp with strange appendages. In fact, the odder they look, the better the cover for ongoing operations. Putting infrared bricks on drones giving them huge IR signatures or making radar reflector balloons look alien in shape would not only confuse the targeted adversary and likely allow for these operations to go on for far longer unchecked than they would otherwise, but they would also massively increase the quality of intelligence data they receive. With this in mind, making things appear stranger and less threatening than they actually are is likely one tactic the enemy has used for these operations, and this can often come at a very cheap price. We have discussed how sometimes the simplest measures can make the most impactful illusions, and how even similar tricks that Disney uses to skew theme park goers’ perceptions could be employed in a guileful manner to confuse an adversary. That seems to be part of the playbook being executed here, and what better passively-reinforced cover story is there in America than UFOs and all the stigma that goes along with it? The fact that pilots have historically refrained from reporting unexplained craft in the skies due to fear of their careers being impacted is all you really need to know when quantifying how relevant and effective such a tactic can be. With that being said, not only could these things, or other platforms nearby, passively suck up electronic intelligence that presents itself in their vicinity, but the genius of their employment is that they themselves are the targets, and they are not necessarily friend or foe. This makes them flying intelligence ‘honey traps’ in their own regard. They get aircraft and ships to lock them up directly, likely running through multiple radar modes in the process as they get fully interrogated by various platforms, even at close range. This provides otherwise unthinkable opportunities to record all those signatures and tactics, even ones that may not be used otherwise if there was a known intelligence-gathering threat present. This is a rare photo of the combat information center (CIC) within the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Normandy where the ship’s diverse set of powerful sensors are brought to bear on targets ranging as far as hundreds of miles from their location., USN To put it another way, their ambiguous origins and the curiosity surrounding their presence sets up a situation in which they can make radar systems work directly against them without restrictions. Their small radar cross-sections and potentially elusive electronic warfare tactics would push those sensor systems and their operators even harder in order to lock them up, thus giving up even more valuable information. Once again, the operation involving PALLADIUM during the A-12’s development worked not just because they could get radar operators searching for something that wasn’t there, but because they gave them hard targets to lock up. It seems that we are seeing history repeat itself, but this time it’s the other guys putting on the magic show. It’s also worth saying that a campaign like this also has huge information and psychological warfare aspects. Eventually, if it is officially disclosed or outed, it makes the targeted country look horribly impotent in that they couldn’t even defend their own airspace or even define a threat to it. Even more embarrassing, they let hollow cultural stigmas provide an open door to enemy intelligence operations. Beyond that, these activities cause confusion and muddy the waters as to what is a threat and what isn’t. They can also cause fissures between those in uniform who observe these craft and their less than responsive commands. It even fits into Russia’s hybrid warfare playbook , elements of which have been copied by other nefarious actors around the globe, including China. Clandestine launch platforms In November 2019, we went on to lay out how submarines can launch their own aerial drones and have been able to so for far longer than most realize. Fast forward to today, and the Navy is now procuring swarms of drones for its submarines. Keep in mind, this is what they openly discuss , imagine the capabilities that have been in place for some time that have never been disclosed. Russia and China, who are looking for every asymmetric advantage against America’s overwhelming technological superiority, certainly had seen the promise that the lowly drone showed for these types of ELINT gathering operations and Russia, in particular , has the submarines to deploy them in the hemisphere in question. Doing so with radar reflector and electronic intelligence gathering payload-carrying balloons is an even lower hanging fruit. In the mid-2000s, studying and adapting UAV concepts of many sizes for submarine operations was in full swing. America’s adversaries didn’t just sit and watch, either., General Dynamics Many naysayers have said that this is impossible because there are no Russian submarines deep in the Atlantic and that the U.S. largely controls this massive body of water. We begged to differ on that point and it turned out that the Navy eventually did too. It is now open knowledge that Russian submarines are operating deep in the Atlantic to the point that the Navy is calling it a contested body of water. And if you think the Navy has a perfect track on those boats at all times, you would be sorely mistaken. So, there is a motive and there is a delivery method, but really, we are probably overthinking it, at least to some degree. The cold hard truth is that you don’t need a submarine to launch a swarm of low-end drones and/or balloons to gather intelligence on an adversary’s sensors. They can be launched from any vessel really, and especially from medium to large ones. There is a lot of shipping traffic out there at any given time, with ships flagged all over the globe and operated by an even more diverse roster of operators. A lowly freighter would be an effective delivery platform, and a far more accessible one. In fact, this concept of operations is well established already and considering the ranges that some of these smaller drones can fly, it is even less of an issue. They can be launched in international waters. An expanding picture of widespread events Over the past two years, we have also reported on what appears to be an increasing phenomenon of large drone swarms spotted over the United States, as well as its outlying territories, and especially near strategic installations. The Colorado drone swarm saga seemed like something of a bizarre series of events in which the general consensus couldn’t seem to settle on a case of mass hysteria or something actually occurring—this was not helped by really reckless reporting on the issue by one or two major outlets. Our subsequent investigation showed that internal correspondence between federal and local stakeholders pointed to it being anything but some product of mass groupthink. Then things got even more serious when we uncovered a series of drone swarm events over the massive Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona. Subsequent documents showed that this was far from a one-off anomaly, with dozens of drone incursions involving America’s nuclear plants having occurred not long before or after. How to protect this highly sensitive infrastructure from threats posed by drones remains a strangely awkward debate . While some claim an attack from small drones may have limited impacts on a nuclear facility—a highly debatable claim—there are other concerns, including those surrounding using drones to find networking security holes and more. Then, maybe most chilling, we uncovered that drones had taken a very troubling interest in one of the most important U.S. air defense sites on earth—the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile battery on Guam. This is literally the last line of defense against incoming ballistic missiles for America’s most important base in the Western Pacific. It is also the home of an AN/TPY-2 radar , one of the most advanced in the world, that provides surveillance and targeting for the THAAD missile interceptors. It isn’t hard to imagine how valuable electronic intelligence from that radar and the system’s local area and beyond-line-of-sight datalinks would be to an adversary like China, which not only has a huge interest in disabling such a capability during a time of war, but also learning from it to develop its own systems. The highly advanced AN/TPY-2 radar that helps detect incoming ballistic missiles and guides THAAD interceptors onto their targets., US Army While some may brush off the actual destructive capabilities of a relatively small drone, they shouldn’t. A drone packing a small charge may not be able to sink a ship or blow up an entire missile site, but it can punch a hole into a radar array and put the entire system out of business for long periods of time. In other words, a mission kill is just as effective at achieving the primary goal of disabling a defensive system as literally blowing it up. And yes, it is ironic that a THAAD battery, one of the most technologically impressive surface-to-air weapon systems ever created, can swat down incoming ballistic missiles but is extremely vulnerable to what could be as simple as a modified hobby drone. Once again, this is in large part a result of the Pentagon’s unwillingness to recognize the threat of low-end drones before it materialized and its chronic under-investment in short-range air defenses (SHORAD) that withered on the vine in the decades following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a situation which you can read all about here. The same can be said for warships. While a swarm of drones couldn’t sink a destroyer, they can overwhelm its defenses and neuter it by attacking its sensors, leaving it blind, vulnerable, and useless—the definition of a mission kill. Our report on the events that occurred off Southern California in the summer of 2019 underlined just how troubling the situation has become. USS Kidd, an Arleigh Burke -class destroyer that was at the center of reports of mysterious drone activity off the coast of California in 2019., USN Swarms of drones harassed a number of U.S. Navy destroyers executing combat drills less than 100 miles off Los Angeles. This occurred on multiple nights. The level of documentation in that article alone shows just how palpable this part of the so-called phenomenon has become. You can imagine just how good the intelligence would have been with those ships’ sensors and communications systems stimulated by the swarm of unknown origins within the perceived safety of America’s own territorial waters. That swarm could have been, and likely was, sucking up, or helping another nearby platform suck up, all that sensitive ELINT data on the most capable warships on earth and at very close range. Once again, in that case, the drone swarm could have come from a simple cargo vessel and it wouldn’t have to be even within line-of-sight of the destroyers, which are easily tracked using open sources during routine training. The drones used in this event appear to have been smaller fixed-wing types similar to those that America’s adversaries have built for various missions, like long-range strike, anti-radiation, decoy, and surveillance operations. As noted earlier, they can fly for hours and could easily be programmed to execute a certain route in the vicinity of where the destroyers were operating or even potentially programmed to react to certain RF emissions, at which time they would fly pre-programmed maneuvers near those emissions. This isn’t some crazy high-tech thing. These are capabilities that America’s primary adversaries possess and are further refining with each day. China, in particular, is far ahead in this regard and already has the operational capability to rapidly deploy large networked swarms that can work cooperatively together. Russia is also in the game and has focused on drone swarms that are electronic warfare enabled. Uncompelling ‘UFO’ evidence Beyond the so-called ‘Tic-Tac’ video that just looked like a blurry little Tic Tac, I have seen nothing in any government ‘UAP’ videos that supposedly show unexplainable capabilities or craft that actually portray that. In fact, quite the opposite. I have stated this repeatedly and tried to explain some of the unique dynamics at play with modern targeting pods and other factors, with many being offended by the mere thought that the videos simply are not what many have portrayed them to be. I have talked directly to the folks that design and build the sensor systems themselves. They don’t see anything either, which I find quite strange considering these videos are supposedly evidence of flying objects that are unexplained. Of course, we are only shown snippets of each video. There could be more footage that does show more puzzling maneuvers, but that simply isn’t the case at this time. At least when it comes to the ‘Go Fast’ and ‘Gimbal’ videos, while the exact origin of the craft shown may not be known, they certainly are not unexplainable . The three officially furnished government ‘UAP’ videos: In recent weeks, more official evidence has come to light. This includes recently released images taken from an F/A-18 cockpit that clearly show balloons, not strange totally unexplainable craft. A video and still images from the incident we reported on that occurred off the California coast in 2019 have also come to light. They seem to show either delta-wing-shaped drones, very similar to the ones we have discussed earlier, or, and far more likely, another type of drone that is obscured by bokeh effect, the result of a bright light source being recorded out of focus through a night-vision scope by another camera. Once again, nothing appears unexplainable here. Quite the opposite, really. The US Navy photographed and filmed “pyramid” shaped UFOs and “spherical” advanced transmedium vehicles; here is that footage. Please visit my Instagram and https://t.co/5JMYxoo9sI to read all the details that I can share at this time. pic.twitter.com/58CXZ1ljAF — Jeremy Kenyon Lockyer Corbell (@JeremyCorbell) April 8, 2021 One other leaked set of images, taken by the Littoral Combat Ship USS Omaha around the same period of time, shows what some claim is a ‘trans-medium craft’ disappearing into the ocean. The stills provided prove nothing of the sort. It looks like a balloon or other object hitting the water as seen through a thermal imaging system. Once again, maybe other data exists that is compelling and truly exotic, but this certainly isn’t that. May 1st 2020 a classified briefing was generated about the UFO / UAP presence via the Office of Naval Intelligence. I was able to obtain information regarding these & other UAP related briefings – as well as – unclassified slides & some intriguing military captured UAP footage. pic.twitter.com/F6V9h64Qfs — Jeremy Kenyon Lockyer Corbell (@JeremyCorbell) April 8, 2021 As for the authenticity of these latest photos and videos, our friend John Greenewald got confirmation that they are indeed authentic from the Office of Secretary of Defense spokesperson on the UAP issue, Susan Gough. Yesterday, to my surprise, I was able to get the Pentagon on the record regarding multiple leaked #UFO / #UAP briefings slides brought out by @g_knapp and @JeremyCorbell . They confirmed they are all genuine, but won't give their designation. MORE: https://t.co/TI0660TuuL — John Greenewald, Jr. (@blackvaultcom) April 10, 2021 As it sits today, the Navy’s top uniformed officer says the craft involved in the 2019 incidents off of Southern California remain unidentified. When it comes to the reality that drones and balloons appear to be the origin of many of these sightings, I wish it wasn’t the case. I would rather have all this be some huge revelation for mankind instead of having to come to terms with the fact that at least one of our adversaries, and possibly two, have played our own cultural norms against us and have executed what may be among the most successful and ingenious intelligence-gathering plays of all time. Meanwhile, it seems that the DoD is either incapable of identifying and evaluating what should no longer be considered an emerging threat—swarming drones and radar target balloons—or they are playing along by acting like they do not know, which could be the case for a number of reasons. First of all, it’s not the Navy’s job to protect America’s sovereign airspace, it is the Air Force’s. That service will say next to nothing about any of this, even when asked very specific questions . Why? Well, at least when it comes to the drone threat, they really don’t have the ability to defend against it and have clearly failed in doing so thus far. In fact, if unidentified flying craft are hanging out off of our coasts, why haven’t alert fighters scrambled to investigate them repeatedly? Their crews are the ones specially trained and equipped to do so. Maybe they were and we just haven’t heard about it, but if it was happening all the time, I find that doubtful. And yes, they do scramble on ‘UFOs,’ as we exclusively discovered a few years ago. https://youtube.com/watch?v=FvKiuZgWNG4 The truth is the Air Force does know that low radar-cross-section aerial vehicles, such drones and cruise missiles, are a massive threat . That is one major reason why the Air National Guard has equipped its F-15 fleet, and is now equipping its F-16 fleet, with AESA radars that can better spot these threats. These alert aircraft are also outfitted with targeting pods to identify any aircraft at long range, day or night, in relatively high resolution. The Air Force is also coming up with ideas to deal with large numbers of potential small threat aircraft at one time, such as using laser-guided rockets to swat them down , but those capabilities are still a while off from being operationalized. So there is finally action being taken, but saying “we really have had no way of defending the homeland against these low-end threats” really wouldn’t be a good look for the Air Force and it goes against the whole idea of not admitting your strategic weaknesses. The other possibility is that we are doing the same exact thing, using drones and balloons to gather critical information on enemy air defense capabilities overseas, and thus, we really don’t want to delve too deeply into the matter. In fact, we may want it to seem like we are totally stumped by these activities too. Considering we know efforts like PALLADIUM never really ceased, and considering our submarine drone-launching capabilities, and the fact that submarines are already used to suck up ELINT data clandestinely, this almost seems more likely than not. Don’t expect anyone to admit it though. Nobody keeps a secret like the ‘Silent Service.’ Even the U.S. Army is now actively pursuing balloon systems that will carry powerful sensors, communications systems, and electronic warfare packages, as well as drop swarms of drones deep behind enemy lines. Sound familiar? US Army These are just possibilities, but considering the intelligence value up for grabs here, and how hard it can be to obtain that intelligence, they are at least worth pondering and it is really quite possible that a mix of these scenarios could be at play. An investigation in a bubble It also seems quite possible, that when it comes to the Pentagon’s investigations into these matters, there is a lack of real expertise to properly evaluate the evidence. In all the discussions about this topic and the Pentagon’s ‘UFO’ programs under AAWSAP and later AATIP , it seems that they were working largely external to the sprawling intelligence infrastructure built over 70 years to quantify foreign threats using limited information and even to exploit them. For instance, the people in the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Foreign Material Exploitation apparatus can pull crashed MiGs from swamps and get them flying again under total secrecy and those in the Directorate of Science and Technology are tasked with evaluating complex foreign threats from a distance using all the data the intelligence community has to offer. Somehow, when it comes to UAP, we never hear about this existing ecosystem that is perfectly suited to evaluate the topic. It is as if the whole UAP issue has and continues to live in its own tiny intelligence bubble, walled off from the greater military intelligence environment. While claims that ‘smart people’ have looked at the data may be true, we don’t know who these people are or what their level of expertise or resources is. Do they even exist inside the DoD and intelligence community’s analysis world or are they external to it? How many eyes are actually working on these issues and collaborating to better understand and quantify them? From what we understand, historically very few, at least in regards to the programs that have been disclosed. The full section regarding the UAP reporting requirement from the Senate’s Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021., U.S. Government From everything I know about the now famed ‘UAP task force,’ and by others’ accounts as well, it is not some powerful inter-agency initiative with a solid mandate from inside the Pentagon and the intelligence community. Far from it. It is a few people in an office with very limited resources that are often hitting walls when trying to obtain critical information from other intelligence stakeholders. That’s a huge strategic problem. The primary reason for this being so troubling is not a looming threat from space invaders or inter-dimensional beings, or the dream of some all-telling disclosure to the public, it is because the next big threat that surprises us from a foreign adversary will likely look very unfamiliar, at least at first. As it sits now, the current technological threat analysis ecosystem appears to be broken. The fact that drones and balloons have appeared to fool it for years, or even worse, never got its attention, is damning. But once again, knowing the DoD’s abysmal track record on the drone threat issue, and the stigma in the DoD around ‘UFOs,’ a subject that few want to touch, this really isn’t at all surprising. An essential revolution What is critical to national security now is to transform this little struggling UAP task force into a properly-funded and internally mandated ‘unidentified observed capabilities’ fusion and analysis cell that pulls every piece of data the Pentagon and the intel community have to offer to evaluate incidents that involve aspects that don’t immediately make sense. This is not just about what happens in the sky either, but also what happens under the sea, where we know anomalous data is encountered but is seemingly tossed into the ether. The same can be said for any anomalous things that are observed in orbit , especially as space continues to rapidly evolve as tomorrow’s battlefield . Because of the extremely sensitive nature of these sources and methods of relevant data collection, the fusion cell would have to be able to deal with highly classified material, not just whatever it can get its hands on and other scraps from the greater intelligence apparatus. The key is bringing all the relevant data under one clearinghouse with access to the best analytical minds that can rapidly disqualify events that are not actually anomalous and work up high-end intelligence products on each observed event that is. That way we can leave the debilitating biases at the door and be quick to recognize and classify emerging threats as they appear, not years after it has become blatantly obvious they exist. It also has to work both ways. When an incident is observed via a particular sensor system or platform—even those that are highly classified—that data needs to be fed to the fusion cell and it needs to happen under standing orders from the top down. In other words, it can’t be just a ‘grovel for this or that’ after-the-fact scenario, there has to be a mandate to provide this information as soon as possible, not only after it is asked for. Basically, that has us playing with one hand and one leg tied behind our backs. This is just as much about identifying patterns of operations as it is about looking into individual capabilities and documenting single events with limited resources. What seems to be lacking here is the ability to see the bigger picture. This type of fusion cell would fix that and such an arrangement is not unique. They are created for many other matters, including terrorism and the proliferation of WMD. We have the model, the question is why aren’t we using it? Nowhere left to hide The truth of the matter is that, in addition to drone swarms and balloons, if something more exotic is truly out there, it will likely be detected much more frequently in the very near future than it has in the past. In fact, the establishment of the fully supported fusion cell I describe may not end up being a choice due to the changes that are about to occur in sensor technology. Just as we reported on a big revolution in radar and networking technology that allowed these objects to be discovered more frequently by fighter aircraft and other platforms starting roughly a decade or so ago, an even bigger one is just about to come to pass. Far more sensitive and capable radars will soon equip America’s new and potentially even some of its older warships . The U.S. Army is revitalizing its surface-to-air sensor systems with similar radars that are vastly superior to their progenitors, including gallium nitride-based AESA arrays . In addition, Navy and Air Force fighters will soon be flying with advanced infrared search and track pods daily, giving them a passive form of long-range detection and yet another sensor to bring to bear on low radar cross-section UAP contacts. You can read about how this technology could have a major impact when it comes to detecting and tracking UAP targets in this past post of ours. An F-15C equipped with a Legion pod that carries an advanced IRST. , USAF The Air Force is building out new sensing layers in space, especially ones that can detect and track hypersonic missiles careening through the atmosphere at extreme speeds. These new remote sensing layers will be able to see and track things we’ve never seen or tracked consistently before. The massive Long Range Discrimination Radar in Clear, Alaska, will provide radar data of an unprecedented fidelity over a huge area—it’s literally capable of reliably verifying ballistic missile countermeasures and decoys from reentry vehicles. U.S. Space Force is contracting out an array of telescopes to optically track objects in orbit and to detect suspicious changes in those objects’ activity. On top of all this, new artificial intelligence (AI) enabled software will make automatically detecting and tracking strange targets on all types of sensors easier than ever before. I could go on and on here. The bottom line is that a lot more people running military sensor systems will be able to detect hard-to-spot targets in the very near future. This will drastically increase the data set on anomalous events and will make many more people aware of this unique problem, which could make it much harder to keep under wraps. What has Congress really been told? The Pentagon’s nonsense in regards to UFOs appears to have actually threatened national security at the highest level—literally leaving the homeland with an open door to be walked through by lowly drones and our most prized military capabilities being allowed to be toyed with for their intelligence value on their home turf. I have stated on numerous occasions that the next 9/11 will come from swarming low-end drones and this situation further underlines just how plausible that is. But we really don’t even need to use our imagination. Just ask Saudi Arabia if that is plausible . For the enemy, this has been a perfect scenario where they have been able to do the seemingly unimaginable with literally no recourse—whether that is out of cultural stigmas, unwillingness to admit to a strategic weakness, or not wanting to allude in any way to our own operations or capabilities, the result is the same—these actions have become more brazen and the intelligence value being gleaned has become greater. While it is good that the Senate Select Committee On Intelligence has demanded a report on this issue , the question of exactly the quality of analysis that will go into that report is very real. Even recent leaked documents show things being classified as evidence of unexplained UAP, while even based on our own investigation, it seems pretty clear as to their basic classification. Common optical effects, balloons, and even known aircraft shapes seem to have chronically stumped the Pentagon’s UAP investigators. The same can be said for the now-famous briefings that Congressional members and the President have received on the issue. Who exactly presented this information and the question as to its accuracy and quality of analysis remains very murky. One cannot rely on legislators, even highly interested ones , or their staff to critically analyze data on such a bizarre, complex, and largely misconstrued subject. Are they even getting good, unbiased information at all? If investigators have been fooled on many of these incidents, regardless of the reasons, that means decision-makers in Congress many not be getting good information on this topic. At the same time, there is still a lot we do not know. It could very well be there are many additional, far stranger, and more compelling events that do not point to drone swarms or balloons as being the culprit. Let’s hope so! But that doesn’t change the reality that some of them do point overwhelmingly in that direction. The absolutely horrific communications job by the Department of Defense on this matter, one they themselves largely dragged back into the spotlight, has made the entire topic even more confusing for people to interpret. This must change in order to instill any form of confidence in the answers the government provides on this issue. There is a long and weird history of the U.S. government, and the Pentagon and intelligence community especially, abusing the UFO topic dating back the better part of a century. The media itself could do a way better job too. The fact that it’s always framed in an “alien” context when news relating to these events hits major outlets is highly detrimental to a very relevant cause. So, how do we fix this situation? What should come next? Plugging the gap Step one is to admit that we have a major drone problem far closer to home than anyone wants to own up to and that at least one of our adversaries has made a mockery of us and compromised key capabilities using remarkably low-end technology. Simply put, they have won and in an outstandingly ironic and ingenious way. Only once we come to terms with this can move on to solving this problem and confronting who is behind it, although I think it is pretty clear who that could be considering there is a list with really just two names on it. Step two, we just need to stop the UFO taboo charade and get serious about really looking into every anomalous observed capability, regardless of its cultural connotations. We must fully fund a real intelligence fusion center to work these cases and demand that our military and intelligence apparatus funnel all new ones to the fusion cell. This directive needs to come from the top within the military and the intelligence community. It can’t be another stepchild program foisted on the DoD by legislators that may not even be in office in a couple of years. This investigative unit must have unfettered access to every relevant data source and intelligence product the U.S. military and the intelligence community have to offer. If we find out aliens are visiting earth in the process, great! But that is not the point. Step three, totally change the communications strategy around this topic. Provide information on absolutely everything that you can, even if it is inconvenient, while protecting sources and methods where relevant. If we don’t go down this road, drones spying on our electronic emissions, tactics, and more may be the least of our worries. Those same capabilities can easily be tasked with defeating many of the same platforms they are surveilling. But above all else, it may be drones and balloons now, but we appear to be willfully covering our eyes to what could be our adversary’s next major technological breakthrough, which could very well look like it is alien at first glance. As it sits now, we would probably only find out that it actually isn’t once it’s too late.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 16, 2021",Targeting Pods Are Being Tested On Air National Guard C-130 Hercules Transports (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s workhorse transport aircraft, the C-130 Hercules , has undertaken operational testing with the Litening multi-sensor pod , traditionally used for precision targeting by fighters and attack jets . If it makes it to the front line, the new capability would initially help the C-130H model in its core airlift mission by ensuring it can put airdropped loads exactly where they’re needed, as well as checking to make sure landing zones are clear and giving the lumbering aircraft an added tool to avoid hostile air defenses. Beyond that, the pod could be added to other aircraft, too. The trials, involving a pair of C-130Hs, were run between April 5-13 this year at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. A joint team from the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center ( AATC ) C-130 Hercules Detachment, housed within the Arkansas Air National Guard’s 189th Airlift Wing, and the Illinois Air National Guard’s 182nd Airlift Wing, carried out the tests. The primary goal was to assess the pod’s functionality and explore what kinds of advantages it offers for the C-130H’s operational mission. An airman from the 189th Airlift Wing gives a thumbs-up during a C-130H training flight near Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Scott Poe Typically, a combat aircraft uses the Northrop Grumman Litening targeting pod to locate, fix, and target enemy positions while deploying precision-guided munitions. However, the tests at Davis-Monthan involved supporting the Hercules as part of the precision airdrop initiative — delivering dropped loads more accurately, especially from high altitude, which helps put the aircraft outside the range of ground fire. That latter factor is especially important when working in conflict zones, where even poorly equipped militia forces are likely to be armed with weapons that can pose a serious threat to a low-flying transport aircraft. Equipped with various sensors, including a high-resolution forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and full color TV sensor to capture imagery day and night, the pod could be used to identify a particular drop zone, before generating specific geographic coordinates, then tracking items of cargo dropped via the C-130’s rear ramp. As well as ensuring cargos land in the right area, sometimes it can be just as important that they don’t fall in the wrong area, something that can have a seriously detrimental effect for friendly troops and civilians alike. “AATC is working to fully integrate the Litening [targeting pod] with the C-130, primarily to aid the precision airdrop initiative,” explained Lieutenant Justin Brumley, the director of operations at AATC. “The pod helps the C-130 airdrop mission by adding the ability to generate airdrop location coordinates, locate and avoid enemy and sensitive objects, such as people or structures; and track airdropped supplies following the airdrop release.” A Litening targeting pod hangs from a C-130H at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, last April 8., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Blake Gonzales It’s unclear if the trials also involved the Joint Precision Airdrop System, or JPADS , a GPS-aided airdrop capability that already exists in service. Combined with this system, the Litening pod could be used to get coordinates, before using JPADS to program the actual pallets to aim for the correct landing spot. In the past, the Arkansas Air National Guard has already been earmarked for Litening pod trials, modifying two aircraft with underwing pylons to carry the pods and sending these planes to Tucson Air National Guard Base in Arizona for a series of trials lasting around six months in 2016. According to a news release at the time, these were planned to encompass airdrops, assault landings, and low-level and high-level formation flying. Although the results of the earlier tests were “promising,” according to officials , there is seemingly no public account of what was achieved and efforts to integrate the pod on the C-130H then seemed to lose momentum. That’s now changed with the recent activity at Davis-Monthan, during which the AATC worked alongside that base’s 563rd Rescue Group as part of an operational testing effort. The 563rd was on hand to provide training airdrop equipment, load it into the two aircraft, and also provide a drop zone location at Marana Regional Airport, a relief airfield serving Davis-Monthan. A maintainer from the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center checks a Litening pod at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Blake Gonzales “Operational testing means testing in a simulated operational environment,” Brumley added. “In this case, it means airdropping equipment to an active drop zone.” While this latest test is concerned with the C-130H ‘legacy’ aircraft operated by the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command, there’s hope to integrate the pod on other platforms, too. The more modern C-130J would be an obvious candidate. Overall, pod-based systems offer a particular advantage in that they can be adapted to different airframes and can be installed or not depending on the particular mission requirements. “If the Litening TGP becomes a fielded system for the C-130H, then a large amount of groundwork is laid for other platforms to readily implement this potentially game-changing technology,” stated Major Richard Damron, a project analyst for the AATC C-130H Test Detachment. In Australia, meanwhile, the C-130J is the platform that’s been used in a similar set of experiments using the Litening pod, as part of the wider Plan Jericho modernization drive for the Royal Australian Air Force. Flight trials began in January last year, again with the pod — borrowed from the Australian F/A-18A/B Hornet fighter jet fleet — mounted on a pylon below the wing. The trials aircraft also has a new high-speed satellite communications antenna fitted to transmit greater amounts of information, such as high-definition video, to other assets. Should the Litening begin to be fielded operationally by the U.S. Air Force’s C-130H fleet, it not only promises to improve the accuracy of airdrops and the survivability of the aircraft but also has other potential applications, too. It could be used in support of a wide range of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions, including monitoring natural disasters, such as wildfires , or state emergencies. The C-130’s long on-station time coupled with the pod’s datalink would allow the aircraft to transmit real-time imagery to a ground station, providing a non-traditional persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability in benign scenarios. For instance, as well as airdropping aid in the wake of a hurricane, a Litening-equipped C-130 could also remain on station to monitor the extent of the damage below, streaming imagery live to command centers and other rescue assets. U. S. Air Force Master Sgt. Clayton Woods, an Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center loadmaster, wears an AATC patch., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Blake Gonzales As well as monitoring the situation on the ground during the mission, a Litening pod could provide the Hercules crew with a significant boost in situational awareness (SA) throughout the flight. In this way, the pilots would be better able to operate from austere or unfamiliar runways and airstrips aided by high-definition imagery of these locations. Other efforts have been made to enhance SA for U.S. Hercules variants, too, including plans to use the cameras already available in the directional infrared countermeasures system on the HC-130J Combat King II rescue aircraft to turn them into an augmented vision system , in a project nicknamed Sauron’s Eye . Some C-130Hs have also received the Real-Time In Cockpit, or RTIC, modification, which provides another means of increasing situational awareness. RTIC provides information on the relative positions of other aircraft, as well as potential threats, and facilitates communication between different pilots. You can read more about RTIC in this feature on a separate AATC test program, involving the KC-135 Stratotanker. A forklift carries airdrop equipment at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Blake Gonzales If fielded on the C-130H, the Litening pod could fulfill one of the elements the Air National Guard is looking to add to these aging airlifters to keep them viable alongside the newer C-130Js. In its 2021 Weapons Systems Modernization Priorities Book, the Guard notes that “A targeting pod capable of providing standoff acquisition and assessment of drop zones/landing zones ensuring first pass success is a must in future combat” for the C-130H specifically. Ultimately, the service would like an open-architecture pod capable of holding additional items, as well, such as a jammer, decoys, and kinetic and non-kinetic defensive measures. Similar types of multifunctional pods, providing targeting, situational awareness, and more are already making their way into service, including the Legion Pod for the F-15C fighter jet, which you can read about here . Potentially, the kinds of capabilities the Air National Guard is eyeing for its C-130Hs could also be provided in another form, thanks to the aircraft’s prodigious load-carrying qualities. As an alternative to wing-mounted systems, one other option could be the Special Airborne Mission Installation and Response (SABIR), a modular system added to the aircraft’s rear paratrooper doors that can mount surveillance arrays, communications nodes, a radio and television broadcast antennas, among others. There are other initiatives, too, intended to extend the useful service life of the C-130H fleet, including upgraded engines and eight-bladed propellers, which promise to save millions in operating costs, an effort you can read more about here . While all 134 Air National Guard C-130Hs require propulsion system upgrades, currently only 34 are actually funded for this upgrade. A C-130H assigned to the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center takes off from Marana National Airport, Arizona, on April 8. , U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Blake Gonzales Despite its age, the C-130H clearly still has considerable utility for the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command, while the Litening pod integration, if successful, could yet provide an important and wide-ranging advance in the tactical capabilities of this, and potentially other airlifters. Update, April 16: Following the publication of the original article, Northrop Grumman got in touch with us to confirm that their Litening pod is also undergoing tests on other C-130s as part of the SABIR installation. This is the Special Airborne Mission Installation and Response system that we mentioned would also be a suitable candidate for mounting the pod on a Hercules. In this case, the pod has recently been flight tested on HC-130J Combat King II rescue aircraft flown by the Air National Guard in Alaska and at Red Flag. In addition to supporting precision airdrops of pallets, the pod can also support paratrooper jumps, the company explains. This would be ideal for the HC-130J mission of delivering pararescue jumpers, who will typically provide emergency treatment to patients before they are extracted by helicopters .

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 30, 2020",Fire Ravaged USS Bonhomme Richard Starts Its Death March To The Scrapper,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What’s left of the U.S. Navy’s former amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard was seen being taken under tow yesterday, headed from Naval Base San Diego, California, to its eventual destination — the International Shipbreaking Limited facility in Brownsville, on the Texas coast. The ship, also known by its hull number LHD-6, suffered a fire that raged for days last year, causing a massive amount of damage , leading to the decision to decommission and scrap it, a process that is estimated will cost around $30 million . According to a report from USNI News , the hull of the former Bonhomme Richard will be towed around the tip of South America and then onward to Texas, for dismantling. Work to remove the island began in February this year, according to USNI News , reducing the overall height of the ship for transit, and other useful spares were also stripped from the vessel while it was still in San Diego. The entire process of reducing the Bonhomme Richard to scrap is expected to take between nine months and a year. Contractors work to remove the aft mast aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard in August last year., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Jeffrey F. Yale The fire aboard the ship burned for around four days beginning on July 12 last year. It started in a lower vehicle storage area and set off multiple blazes that damaged some 60 percent of the ship, which was sitting pier-side in San Diego undergoing maintenance at the time. The island, mast, and flight deck suffered particularly heavy damage. A total of 63 sailors and civilian firefighters were injured in the incident, which was covered in depth by The War Zone at the time . Multiple investigations are still underway to determine the cause of the fire, but last August the service revealed that it was looking into the possibility of arson being a factor. The Navy decided that it would be too expensive to repair the warship or to convert it for another use such as a hospital ship or submarine tender and, last November, decided to scrap it . It was disclosed that rebuilding it as an LHD would have cost upward of $3 billion and taken between five and seven years; the cost of a brand-new America -class assault ship, by contrast, is around $4 billion . USS Bonhomme Richard on fire at Naval Base San Diego, California, on July 12, 2020., U.S. NAVY The fire onboard Bonhomme Richard came amid an apparent spate of similar incidents that befell U.S. warships. Another smaller, fire broke out on board Bonhomme Richard’s sister ship, USS Kearsarge last summer, and the future USS John F. Kennedy , a Ford -class aircraft carrier suffered a blaze while still under construction. Shipboard fires have also affected the U.S. Coast Guard in recent months, too. A blaze aboard the U.S. Coast Guard’s Legend -class cutter USCGC Waesche while at sea in the Western Pacific last September., U.S. COAST GUARD PACIFIC AREA/PUBLIC DOMAIN For the wider Navy, the loss of Bonhomme Richard reduced the Wasp class to seven vessels, which will have to bear the brunt of most amphibious assault operations. These are joined by two of the newer America- class amphibious assault ships, with a third, the future USS Bougainville , under construction. It comes, too, at an inopportune time, with the service pushing a proposed plan to increase its fleet size to more than 500 ships by 2045. The Navy bid an official farewell to the warship with a ceremony in San Diego on April 14, while an official release highlighted some of the milestones in the history of the Wasp- class vessel, which was commissioned in 1998. Early in its career, the Bonhomme Richard took part in Operation Stabilize in February 2000, providing peacekeeping and humanitarian operations off the coast of East Timor in Southeast Asia. The USS Bonhomme Richard refueling in the South China Sea in October 2016., U.S. NAVY During Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, Bonhomme Richard offloaded more than a thousand Marines and their equipment from the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines into Kuwait. After delivering attack and transport helicopters, plus troops and vehicles, AV-8B Harrier II jump jets flew missions from its deck into Iraq. In the process, the Harriers expended more than 175,000 pounds of ordnance while providing close air support to Marines on the ground. Between 2012 and 2018, Bonhomme Richard was based at Sasebo in Japan, assigned as the command ship for the forward-deployed amphibious forces in the Pacific. Most of the sailors from the Bonhomme Richard have been reassigned to different vessels in the fleet, leaving a skeleton crew aboard for the decommissioning, the ceremony for which you can watch in full below: Speaking at the decommissioning ceremony earlier this week, Rear Admiral Philip Sobeck, the commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3, provided the following words on the “Bonnie Dick”: “Sailors gave their all to prevail against seemingly impossible odds, and they won. They taught us that you don’t always save the ship, but you never stop fighting. The reputation of that fighting spirit began to proceed our Navy wherever we sailed and that same spirit persists today.” Whichever way you look at it, it’s a sad end for the amphibious assault ship, which provided years of good service during a career that was cut roughly in half.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 24, 2020",Watch Two French Submarine Halves Get Grafted Together In A Remarkable Repair Job,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There’s been a new twist in the project to graft a new front end to the fire-damaged French Navy nuclear-powered attack submarine Perle . Imagery from the dry dock shows that, rather than the expected “ nose job ,” two submarine halves are now being attached together to produce a “new” submarine, which will retain the Perle name. The procedure to fuse together the two hull halves of the Rubis class submarines will actually end up stretching the length of the submarine by 4 feet 6 inches. Earlier this month, the undamaged rear half of the Perle and the front half of the Saphir were carefully aligned on “walkers” at the Naval Group shipyard in Cherbourg, northern France. Saphir had previously been withdrawn from service in July 2019. Caused by faulty lighting, the fire onboard the Perle started on June 12 last year and burned for 14 hours, causing massive structural damage to the front end of the boat. There were no reports of injuries and no weapons or nuclear fuel were on board at the time. The fire-damaged front section of the Perle , while still in Toulon., BENOIT EMILE/MARINE NATIONALE/DÉFENSE Work began on the repairs to the Perle five months ago, followed by the serious job of cutting this submarine in February and then the Saphir in March. Naval Group described the overall process as “hybridization” given the significant required changes in the area between the two hull halves, which will take more than 300 workers a total of 250,000 hours to complete. “Naval Group and its industrial partners are fully committed to enabling the French Navy to recover the potential of its six nuclear attack submarines as quickly as possible,” said Pierre-Eric Pommellet, Chairman and CEO of the Naval Group. “The success of the repair works on the Perle owes a lot to the know-how and professionalism of the Naval Group teams involved and we are proud to offer these unique skills at the service of a challenge whose scope we fully appreciate.” Other repairs undertaken so far in the procedure to return the Perle to service has included welding work in the boat’s outer hull and rebuilding the inner decks in the new junction area — the new 4-foot 6-inch section that has been added to the middle. In addition, hundreds of cables and pipes have been attached together, along with the updating of some 2,000 drawings and documents, part of around 100,000 hours of engineering studies. The design work around the area where the two halves will get joined together has also made use of 3D digital modeling of the submarine, creating a “digital twin,” an increasingly popular approach when working on repairs to older structures . In this way, a design team was able to plot exactly where different pipes and cables would run between the front and the rear sections, and work out where holes and supports were needed. Electricians and pipe-fitters were also able to use the digital twin to practice how they would do their work once aboard the real submarine. The junction area itself will provide two new living quarters, making additional space for the crew, which numbers around 70. Crew aboard a French Navy Rubis class submarine., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The next steps for the Perle , once fully refurbished, will be the Periodic Interruption for Maintenance and Repair (PIMR), planned for the end of this year, after which the submarine will return to its base at Toulon, in southern France. The PMIR is roughly equivalent to the U.S. Navy’s Engineered Refueling Overhaul (ERO), during which the submarine is refueled and upgraded for returning to sea. The submarine is expected to be on active duty with the French Navy again in early 2023. The submarine Saphir , which served as the donor for the new front hull section for the Perle ., Jean-Michel Roche/Wikimedia Commons French Minister of Defense Florence Parly announced last October 22 that the Perle would be repaired and returned to service, specifically to help address the shortage of nuclear attack submarines. Although the six Rubis class submarines are scheduled for replacement by the new Barracuda class , Perle is the youngest, entering service in 1993, and the repair work was judged worthwhile, although the exact costs involved are unclear. In the meantime, the first of the Barracudas , the Suffren , was delivered to the French Navy last November. Resurrecting a damaged nuclear-powered submarine is not without precedent, of course. The U.S. Navy returned the Los Angeles class attack boat USS San Francisco to service after its collision with an underwater seamount in the central Pacific in 2005. In that case, the submarine received the bow of the USS Honolulu , another Los Angeles class boat, process that you can read more about here . The Los Angeles class attack submarine USS San Francisco (SSN-711) in dry dock to assess damage sustained after running aground approximately 350 miles south of Guam in January 2005., U.S. Navy Another U.S. Navy submarine was less fortunate. The Los Angeles class attack boat USS Miami catching fire in its dry dock during an overhaul in 2012. The submarine was retired from service as result. USS Miami enters dry dock at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in March 2012, just two months before being seriously damaged in a fire., U.S. Navy Since then, major fires have also broken out aboard other U.S. Navy vessels, including the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard , the future USS John F. Kennedy , a Ford -class aircraft carrier , and on Bonhomme Richard’s sister ship, USS Kearsarge . Other shipboard fires have blighted the U.S. Coast Guard, as well. The damage to Bonhomme Richard was so significant that the Navy decided to scrap it, a process that will itself cost an estimated $30 million . Clearly, significant efforts are going into returning the Perle to service, with the Naval Group conducting unique work in parallel to the construction of five Barracuda successor boats in the same yard. It points to the great value that the French Navy places on its attack submarines, which conduct critical missions including providing defensive screens for the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and the Triomphant class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. After all, a class of six boats provides for two or three that be deployed at sea at any given time. What is more, their areas of operations are expanding, too, including a rare trip to the Pacific by the Rubis class boat Émeraude at the end of last year. The Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Asheville (foreground) trains with the Émeraude in the Pacific last December., U.S. Navy By the time the last of the Rubis boats are retired from service in around 2030, this class will have provided close to a quarter of a century of service to the French Navy. Along the way, the return to service of the Perle will no doubt stand out among the most remarkable episodes in their long careers.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The former Soviet Kiev class aircraft carrier Minsk is rusting away, seemingly abandoned, in the middle of a man-made lagoon some 50 miles northwest of the Chinese city of Shanghai. It’s a visual that feels better suited to a movie or video game set in a cyberpunk dystopia or an Earth where nature has reclaimed areas in the aftermath of some kind of apocalypse. It looks to be a sad and lonely fate for the ship, which was already spared the scrapper’s torch once by Chinese businessmen in the 1990s. The ex- Minsk ‘s present home sits just off the Yangtze River to one side of the Sutong Yangtze River Bridge in Nantong, China. Its immediate neighbors are farms and associated agricultural facilities. Looking at satellite imagery of the site, to the immediate north of the Lagoon, there is what looks to be a viewing platform with a walkway leading back to various structures and a tented pavilion. All of this looks to be part of equally abandoned work on a planned theme park that was to feature the aircraft carrier at its center, but which never opened. A satellite image of the ex- Minsk at its present location near Shanghai in 2019. A portion of the Sutong Yangtze River Bridge is visible to the right., Google Earth A more general view of the former Minsk and its surroundings., Google Earth A close-up of the structures to the north of the man-made lagoon where the carrier is anchored., Google Earth How the ship, which had previously been the centerpiece of another amusement park in Shenzhen, just to the northeast of Hong Kong, some 750 miles away from its current location, got to where it is now, is something of a saga. The Minsk was first laid down in a Soviet shipyard, situated in what is now Ukraine, in 1972. It was the second ship in the Kiev class and was commissioned into the Soviet Navy in 1978. The Kiev class design is something of an oddity among modern aircraft carriers, to begin with, having a bow and island that both look more reminiscent of what you might expect to see on a battlecruiser , along with a relatively small, angled flight deck. The Soviets categorized these 40,000-ton-displacement vessels as a “heavy aviation cruiser,” a term also applied to the more traditional looking Admiral Kuznetsov that followed. Minsk in service with the Soviet Navy in 1983., DOD Befitting this description, the Kievs had launchers for eight P-500 Bazalt anti-ship cruise missiles, also known to NATO as the SS-N-12 Sandbox, and two turrets with twin 76mm guns, among other weapons. This was all in addition to their air wings, which typically consisted of a dozen Yak-38 Forger jump jets and a slightly larger number of Kamov Ka-25/27/29 helicopters. Kuznetsov also had a similar anti-ship missile capability, with launch cells built right into its flight deck, as you can read about more here. The Kiev class aircraft carrier Novorossiysk offering a full view of its bow-mounted missiles and one of its 76mm gun turrets., DOD Minsk was assigned to the Soviet Navy’s Pacific Fleet and had a largely uneventful service life in the twilight of the Cold War, as did her sister ships Kiev and Novorossiysk . A fourth Kiev class carrier, Baku , was commissioned in 1987. It featured a new phased array radar, improved electronic warfare capabilities, launchers for four more P-500s, and turreted 100mm guns in place of the twin 76mm weapons, among other additions, which often led to it being described as the sole example of a distinct subclass. A head-on view of Baku showing its revised forward armament, among other changes., USN When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the new Russian Navy took possession of all four ships, but found them difficult and costly to operate and maintain. Minsk was had already been effectively put into mothballs sometime between 1989 and 1990 due to “severe engineering problems,” according to the 1993 edition of Combat Fleets of the World . In 1993, Novorossiysk also suffered a major engine room fire. With limited immediate options to rehabilitate those two ships – the shipyards where they were built and that had the facilities necessary to conduct major repairs on them were now in the independent country of Ukraine – and the equally poor state of Kiev , the decision was made to sell them off as scrap. By 1995, Minsk and Novorossiysk had made their way to South Korea to be broken. The fate of Kiev was more complicated and we will come back to that later on. An attempt was made to get Baku , by then renamed Admiral Gorshkov , back into service. However, in 2004, that ship was sold to India and it subsequently an expensive and drawn-out conversion process that turned it into a more conventional short-take-off-but-arrested-recovery (STOBAR) carrier with a full flight deck and ski jump. A top-down look at the former Admiral Gorshkov , showing its completely revised bow and flight deck, which is now in Indian Navy service as the INS Vikramaditya ., Indian Navy The former Novorossiysk was ultimately scrapped in South Korea in 1997, but protests by South Korean environmentalists prompted the sale of the ex- Minsk first to a Chinese shipbreaking company, Guangdong Ship Dismantling, and then to Si Ke Investment Company, Limited. Si Ke, established by Chinese entrepreneurs who had made their money primarily through video game arcades, bought the ship with the express purpose of building a theme park around it. They paid approximately $4.3 million at the time, close to $7.3 million in 2021 dollars, for what was left of the Minsk . The aptly titled Minsk World opened in Shenzhen in 2000. A curious assortment of aircraft, including Chinese Q-5 Fantan combat jets, Soviet-made MiG-23 and MiG-27 Flogger swing-wing jets, and Mi-24 Hind helicopters , were put on display on its flight deck and down below in the hangar. The exact origins of the MiG-23s and MiG-27s, as well as the Mi-24s, are unclear, as the Chinese military never operated those types. Flying and non-flying examples of these types , and other Soviet military aircraft designs, certainly have been bought and sold on the open market, by commercial enterprises and private citizens , since the end of the Cold War. The gates to Minsk World in 2008. , BrokenSphere via Wikimedia Mi-24 Hinds, at left, and Q-5s, at right, on the deck of the ex- Minsk ., BrokenSphere via Wikimedia Inert weapons, or mock-ups thereof, including missiles, bombs, and torpedoes, as well as other Soviet militaria were also displayed. Exhibits covering the Chinese military were also added. As seen in the video below, song-and-dance numbers were also regularly held at indoor and outdoor stages installed on the ship. The original owners of Minsk World went bankrupt in 2006. The park and the carrier inside were subsequently auctioned off to a state-owned holding company, CITIC Group. Before Minsk World opened, some experts and observers had suggested that the purchase of the carrier by a Chinese company was some kind of subterfuge to assist in the establishing of a carrier capability for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). Kiev had also been sold to another Chinese firm with the stated aim of turning it into a tourist attraction. Around the same time, a more shadowy firm based in Macau, with ties to the PLAN, had bought Kuznetsov ‘s unfinished sister ship Varyag from Ukraine, saying it planned to convert into a floating hotel and casino . As it turned out, despite assessments from experts that it would be too onerous to return Varyag to any sort of operational state, the PLAN did formally commission that ship in 2012 as the Liaoning , and it remains in service to this day . There’s no indication one way or another that the acquisition of the Minsk , along with the actual opening of Minsk World, was in any way part of some larger plan on the part of the Chinese government to conceal its aircraft carrier ambitions. “Their target group is different,” an anonymous advisor to the Minsk World project had told The Washington Post in 1999 when asked if there was a concern about competition from a future hotel and casino created from the Varyag . The Liaoning , now in service with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy., Photo by VCG If there was any real competition to Minsk World, it could have come from Binhai Aircraft Park in Tianjin, China, some 100 miles southeast of Beijing, which is where Kiev went. Q-5s are also on display on that ship, as are mock-ups of Yak-38s . In 2011, the company that owns that park announced plans to turn that former carrier into more of a floating luxury hotel with at least five presidential suites. A picture showing the bedroom in one of the presidential suites that were added to the interior of the former Kiev at Binhai Aircraft Park., Xinhua “Previously, China didn’t have aircraft carriers. People find them mysterious and are curious about them. Even though China’s first aircraft carrier [the Liaoning] has now gone on sea trials, it will be quite hard for the public to ever visit it,” Liu Chang, a marketing manager at Binhai Aircraft Park told The Guardian newspaper at the time. “I guess people can come here to fulfil their curiosity.” Binhai Aircraft Park remains open and pictures show the ex- Kiev to be, at least on the surface, well maintained. The same cannot be said of the former Minsk , which, along with the aircraft on display, looked to be in an increasingly dilapidated state even before Minsk World shut down for good in 2016. The park was closed after government officials decided to reclaim the land it sat on for other purposes. A picture showing the poor condition of one of the aircraft, a MiG-23, on display at Minsk World even in 2008,, BrokenSphere via Wikimedia The ship, which had been repainted sometime in the intervening years with the hull number “16,” the same as that on Liaoning , was subsequently moved to where it sits now near Shanghai, arriving there between 2017 and 2018. There had been plans to establish a new Minsk World, but that has not come to pass, though it’s not entirely clear why. It is worth noting that there has been a massive aircraft carrier replica , reportedly meant to be a near-full-scale mock-up of the American supercarrier USS Nimitz , that people can tour at the Military Education Center near Dianshan Lake, close to Shanghai, since 2002. The carrier replica the Military Education Center near Dianshan Lake., Google Earth A view of the “ Nimitz ” replica from the ground., GlobalSecurity.org Whatever the ostensible plans for the remains of Minsk might be now, it is clearly all-but-abandoned. There is one video of the ship on YouTube, that an individual shot in 2019 using a camera on a quadcopter drone. There are no signs of activity on or around the ship whatsoever. In 2020, the Burbex YouTube channel, short for Brin’s Urban Exploration, which posts videos of individuals poking around various abandoned facilities, uploaded footage shot from within the ship. Remains of the exhibits, including one of the MiG-23s, are still inside, but are in very poor shape. The general condition of things strongly suggests these were not the first people to sneak aboard the aircraft carrier since it was first anchored in the enclosed lagoon. All told, there doesn’t seem to be any real security in place at the site, at all. All told, the future of what is left of the Minsk looks bleak. It remains to be seen how much longer the present owners will let the ship languish in its man-made lagoon before making some final decision about its fate. The longer it sits there, exposed to the elements with no real care given to its condition, the more likely it is that its next destination will be a scrapyard.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 3, 2021",Ex-Disney Employees Helped The Thunderbirds Create Their New Shortened Air Show Routine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds flight demonstration team has revealed details about its new air show routine, a pared-back, highlights reel kind of display that is designed to showcase the team’s airmanship as well as keep spectators engaged, inspiration for which was provided by former Disney employees, and even the rival U.S. Navy Blue Angels . As the team worked through a tough 2020, which saw the air show season largely canceled , efforts instead focused on saluting first-responders , as well as completely revising their existing demonstration routine. This is only the third time a Thunderbirds aerial demonstration has been devised from the ground up. The first was when the team was established in 1953, the second in the aftermath of the 1982 Diamond Crash , which tragically claimed four pilots’ lives, and prompted the switch to the F-16 fighter jet , advanced versions of which are still flown today. Indeed, these aircraft (Block 52 F-16C/Ds) are some of the most advanced — and youngest — Vipers anywhere in the Air Force. The U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds perform an echelon pass during an air show in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Jason Couillard For the crowds watching the Thunderbirds starting from the 2021 season — which kicks off with the Cocoa Beach Air Show in Florida on April 17-18 — the new routine is cut back from the previous approximately 1.5 hours to around 50 minutes. This has been achieved by removing six of the slightly less stunning, or more repetitive, maneuvers from the air display portion of the show and tightening up the carefully choreographed ground show. “Optimizing crowd experience,” in the words of Major Remoshay Nelson, the Thunderbirds Public Affairs Officer, was the key driver behind the revised routine. Emotion and entertainment are brought together, which is where the cartoon mouse comes in. “A lot of times we realized that our demonstrations can become a series of athletic maneuvers more like the Harlem Globetrotters, as opposed to a Cirque du Soleil performance,” explained Colonel John Caldwell, the commander of the team, or Thunderbird 1. “It took a lot of coordination, a lot of work, a lot of research for us to get to the point where you can tinker with something as complex as a fast jet demo team performance. Typically these things evolve over years and years.” “We started thinking about who else does this on a day-to-day basis,” continued Thunderbird 3, Major Zane Taylor, now on his second season with the team. “We started looking around in industry: Disney does this every day with live performances.” Major Taylor confirmed that the team spoke to former Disney employees “at length,” consulting on issues such as ideal show length, how to create the optimum finale — or multiple finales — how to script the show and keep the audience entertained. This helped the team settle on a shorter performance as the ideal, from a crowd point of view. Keeping things brief also has a more practical benefit. After all, sometimes the previous high-level (clear-weather, 8,000-foot ceiling) show could keep the jets in the air as long as 47 minutes, meaning F-16s were landing “on fumes because we were running out of gas,” remarked Colonel Caldwell. Crowds watch as the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds perform at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi., U.S. Air Force/Kemberly Groue As for the enduring inter-service rivalry with the Blue Angels, the Thunderbirds spoke to them as they set about revising their program, too. “Truth be told,” remarked Colonel John Caldwell, “some of the things that we added and changed in our demos were a result of the relationship and the respect we have for those guys. They actually contributed in some way to the changes that we made.” Noteworthy here is the fact that the Blue Angels have also introduced an abbreviated display program, which you can read about here , as a result of swapping their older F/A-18C Hornets for newer, but well-worn Super Hornets . The display sequence is now designed to bring the complexity, challenge, and capabilities of the F-16 and its pilots to the fore. This has been done in four key ways. First, the team has streamlined its famous ground show to better replicate how frontline airmen rapidly generate aircraft when on alert, in what is described as a “salute to airmen deployed around the world.” Also, instead of plugging into the jets to speak over the intercom, the pilots and ground crew now communicate exclusively using various hand signals and other non-verbal communication. This portion is reduced by around 10 minutes and now focuses on speed, replicating the kinds of conditions that might be found in an Agile Combat Employment (ACE) exercise, for example. Providing the core of the air display itself are the Thunderbirds’ six demonstration pilots, kicking off with the excitement of the attention-grabbing grand opening, followed by a succession of maneuvers that are now less repetitive and more tightly interwoven, over a period of around 30 minutes. Aircraft repositioning times between the diamond and solo maneuvers are cut back, keeping the high tempo of the overall show and providing for more continuous action on centerstage. Thirdly, as well as dropping some of the older maneuvers, some new ones have also been added, including the two shown below, the Stinger Cross Break and the Low Bomb Burst With Hit: U.S. AIR FORCE U.S. AIR FORCE Finally, the team has also incorporated new music into its show, designed to match the high energy and performance of the jets. The team members didn’t want to reveal what audiences are going to hear blaring from the public address systems, but they promise it will be appropriately impactful. The Thunderbirds represent a brand identity that’s just as enduring as the Disney franchise, and their return to the air show circuit will no doubt be enjoyed by millions of Americans in this new season. Final words to Colonel John Caldwell: “I would strongly encourage you to get out in 2021 and go find us on the road. Watch one of these shows. Because if you’ve seen the Thunderbirds in the past, I can guarantee you haven’t seen them the way they are now.” Update, April 15: The Thunderbirds have been in touch to provide an update to the story, clarifying a statement that one of the pilots made. In reworking its routine, the team consulted “former Disney entertainment professionals,” resulting in a new show that is heavily influenced by them and modeled, specifically, after how they conduct firework performances.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 4, 2021",Turkish F-16 Knocks Down Target Drone With New Indigenous Air-To-Air Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkey’s plan to introduce indigenous new-generation air-to-air missiles has reached an important milestone with the first successful air launch of the short-range Bozdoğan weapon. A Turkish Air Force F-16C Block 40 fighter jet recently fired one of these missiles, destroying a Turkish Aerospace Şimşek high-speed target drone. The heat-seeking Bozdoğan, developed under a two-part air-to-air missile program by TÜBİTAK Defense Industries Research and Development Institute, or TÜBİTAK SAGE, is intended to arm Turkish F-16s, and Turkish Aerospace’s forthcoming Hürjet advanced jet trainer and light attack aircraft, as well as the future TF-X advanced fighter jet . Reports from Turkey indicate that the initial air-launch test of the Bozdoğan  — Turkish for merlin, a small bird of prey — was carried out at the missile test range in the country’s Sinop province, on the Black Sea coast. This is the same facility that hosted trials of the Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system last year. The F-16 came from the Turkish Air Force’s 401 Squadron, the service’s test unit. According to the Defence Turkey website , the missile launch and engagement sequence was monitored both from the ground and by accompanying F-16s, at least one of which carried a Sniper targeting pod . An F-16C test jet armed with the short-range Bozdoğan under the wing, and the medium-range Gökdoğan on the wingtip station., TURKISH DEFENSE INDUSTRY SCREENCAP Video released showing the test reveals that the Bozdoğan’s infrared seeker head locked onto the target drone at around 9 miles and was launched at a distance of between 3 and 5 miles from the target. President Recep Erdoğan announced the successful missile test on Twitter yesterday, sharing a video and noting that Turkey had now joined a select group of countries that have successfully developed air-to-air missile technology. The Bozdoğan, which is broadly similar in appearance to the latest AIM-9X Sidewinder , features a high-resolution dual-color imaging infrared (IIR) seeker. Like other missiles in its class, it offers a high off-boresight capability , thrust-vectoring controls, and its seeker has a high degree of discrimination to defeat flares and other countermeasures systems , according to the manufacturer. Launch of the Bozdoğan., TURKISH DEFENSE INDUSTRY SCREENCAP The heat-seeking missile is just under 11 feet long, weighs around 300 pounds, and can reportedly hit targets as far away as 15 miles. No datalink is fitted but it has been suggested it could be added in the future, which would provide for lock-on after launch, or LOAL, capability. This is a capability that is critical for stealthy aircraft that carry their weapons concealed in internal bays, but also gives the weapon additional flexibility when launched from non-stealthy platforms. Radar tracks showing the path of the Bozdoğan after launch from the F-16, heading toward the Şimşek target., TURKISH DEFENSE INDUSTRY SCREENCAP More air launches of the Bozdoğan are planned for this year, with the goal of starting initial production in 2022. That task is likely to be handled by Roketsan, a Turkish firm responsible for a range of munitions, including diverse air-launched weapons . Bozdoğan is also just one part of TÜBİTAK SAGE’s Göktuğ air-to-air missile program, which is also working on the beyond-visual-range Gökdoğan missile, inert examples of which were also carried on the wingtips of the F-16 involved in the recent test. The Gökdoğan — which means peregrine — features radar guidance and will reportedly have a range of around 40 miles. While the Bozdoğan is slated to eventually replace the AIM-9 Sidewinder in the Turkish Air Force inventory, the Gökdoğan is planned to supersede the AIM-120 AMRAAM . The Bozdoğan and the Gökdoğan have been in development since around 2013 and were revealed to the public at the International Defense Industry Fair (IDEF) that took place in Istanbul in 2017. Test launches from the ground were conducted in 2018 and 2019, culminating in engagements against Banshee target drones, involving prototype missiles without warheads fitted. Captive carry flight testing began last year. The two missiles being developed under the Göktuğ program, Bozdoğan, in front, and Gökdoğan, at rear., TÜBİTAK SAGE Securing a local source of air-to-air missiles is all the more important since Turkey began to be “unwound” from the F-35 program amid a breakdown in military relations with the U.S. centered on Ankara’s acquisition of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system. With an eye toward potential U.S. sanctions, Turkey had already reportedly begun stockpiling spare parts for its F-16s, and other unspecified military systems, in July 2019. The same year, lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives agreed to a non-binding resolution outlining a number of potential courses of action against Turkey, specifically mentioning the F-16, as well as the CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopter, and the UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopter. It’s not immediately clear how President Joe Biden will deal with the military relationship with Turkey, but there are signs, at least, that the stance may be softening, albeit with continued calls for Ankara to abandon the S-400. Regardless, successfully integrating the new missiles onto the F-16 — which will be the backbone of the Turkish Air Force for years to come — is not necessarily easy. Defence Turkey pointed out that the first Bozdoğan flight test launch involved an older F-16, which had not undergone an avionics upgrade . While Turkey has access to the source codes for the mission computers on these jets, the same is not true for the modernized jets and, likely, the most advanced Block 52 and 52+ aircraft. While the integration of the two missiles on the non-modernized F-16 Block 30 and Block 40 jets should not present major difficulties, adding the radar-guided Gökdoğan, in particular, to the updated jets could be tricky since this weapon needs to receive in-flight updates from the AN/APG-68 radar. TURKISH DEFENSE INDUSTRY SCREENCAP However, even if the new missiles are limited to the less advanced jets — to start with, at least — an indigenous service-life extension , performed by Turkish Aerospace, should ensure that these older jets can remain in service longer, increasing airframe lifespan to 12,000 hours. Indeed, this structural improvement program is focusing on the oldest Block 30 jets that began to be delivered in 1987. These should be ideal for the integration of these Turkish-made missiles. There is also the possibility that the Bozdoğan, and the Gökdoğan, too, could attract interest among export customers. Turkey is well established as a provider of increasingly sophisticated weapons systems and subsystems and, although the air-to-air missile market is relatively crowded , the Turkish weapons would not be subject to the possible restrictions imposed by the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) guidelines, which can limit the transfer of defense and military technologies and services to certain countries. While the Turkish Aerospace Hürjet and TF-X are still in the development phase, being able to offer them to potential foreign customers together with integrated weapons options would also be a significant advantage. It would put Turkey among a select group of countries able to offer a complete package of combat aircraft and related weapons, which also include precision-guided air-to-ground munitions, some of which have standoff range . The Bozdoğan, and subsequently the Gökdoğan, should provide Turkey with yet more independence in its F-16 operations while continuing to expand its arms industries into new areas. Exactly how feasible it will be to integrate these new weapons across the Turkish F-16 fleet remains to be seen, however.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 20, 2021",KC-135 Tanker Tested With Loyal Wingman Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New systems installed in the U.S. Air Force’s KC-135 Stratotanker will allow the veteran aerial refueling tanker to serve as a communications node for other platforms, including armed drones, with plans to add underwing pods that will further expand this capability and boost its own defenses. In recent trials, the aircraft received data from the Kratos Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform-22, or UTAP-22, a low-cost loyal wingman drone that you can read more about here . The new capabilities are being added to the Cold War-era KC-135 under the Real-Time Information in the Cockpit (RTIC) initiative, with a first updated aircraft now flying with the Utah Air National Guard’s 151st Air Refueling Wing. The aircraft was upgraded last July, but details of the effort have only recently been officially released . A Stratotanker belonging to the Utah Air National Guard, which was named as the interim KC-135 Test Detachment last December 15., Master Sgt. Amber Monio/151st Air Refueling Wing The Utah Air National Guard began work on increasing the Stratotanker’s potential for developing and disseminating situational awareness data back in 2018 and last December this work culminated in an interim KC-135 Test Detachment being set up within the Utah ANG, formalizing its role in the program. The RTIC package outfits the tanker with communication capabilities that are compatible with the NATO-standard Link 16 system , with further plans to add the Situational Awareness Datalink (SADL), and Secure Beyond Line-of-Sight (satellite) communications, too. Link 16 and SADL are both tactical datalinks that allow platforms to share near-real-time information including digital voice communications, imagery, and text messages, as well as location and sensor data. RTIC is also a follow-on to the previous Roll-On Beyond Line-of-Sight Enhancement (ROBE) kit that was added to 20 KC-135s to permit data-fusion between Link 16 and SADL-equipped platforms and near-real-time communications between allied forces in combat and headquarters across the globe. Meanwhile, RTIC should give the Stratotanker crews a much greater level of situational awareness, pushing much more accurate information to airmen almost instantaneously, with potentially significant results on overall combat capability. Ground and flight testing for the RTIC program was scheduled to begin at Roland R. Wright Air National Guard Base, home of the 151st Air Refueling Wing, in March and be completed in May. “For years, I have relied on AWACS or receiver aircraft, a grease pencil and a laminated chart to build a real-time combat picture,” explained Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Gould, who led the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Test Center (AATC) team that worked to integrate RTIC on the KC-135. Last July, the first KC-135 in the Air Force inventory received Link 16 as part of its RTIC upgrade. , Master Sgt. John Winn/151st Air Refueling Wing “KC-135 crews will now have the ability to make better-informed decisions and communicate more effectively with their receiver aircraft, who have been equipped with a tactical datalink since the early 1990s, changing the way we [KC-135s] operate and provide combat effect,” Lieutenant Colonel Gould added. While exchanging data with the fighter jets and other platforms that KC-135s regularly top up during missions, the RTIC is expected to have wider significance as it paves the way for the much-heralded Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), a digital battle network system designed to collect, process, and share data among U.S. and allied forces in real-time. A 151st Air Refueling Wing KC-135 flight deck stripped out before receiving the RTIC upgrade., Master Sgt. John Winn/151st Air Refueling Wing “The RTIC program provides the pathway and baseline for the KC-135 to support the Advanced Battle Management System,” said Brigadier General Daniel Boyack, commander of the Utah Air National Guard. The Utah guardsmen have also been working on bringing a loyal wingman-type drone into the KC-135’s data-sharing environment, with an Air Force Research Lab experiment using the Kratos UTAP-22 over the U.S. Navy test range at China Lake, California. Those trials were run as part of the SkyDog Unmanned Aerial Vehicle program, about which there are currently very few details. Back in 2015, a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier II jet used a datalink to share information with a UTAP-22 acting as a loyal wingman. The Harrier controlled multiple units in a combat-like scenario via a basic point-and-click type interface. It is noteworthy, too, that the UTAP-22 has already been evaluated by the Air Force Reserve Test Center in a different capacity, air-launched from F-15C fighter jets as part of loyal wingman experiments that you can read more about here . The F-15C with a jet-powered UTAP-22 drone attached to its left underwing pylon. , @TUCSON.PLANE.SPOTTER Using “specialized equipment added to the RTIC infrastructure,” the KC-135 received off-board data from the UTAP-22, including information that wouldn’t necessarily be provided through Link 16. “Full-motion video, along with a host of sensor information was pushed to our crew,” said Lieutenant Colonel Gould. It suggests the KC-135 will go on to play an important role in manned and unmanned teaming, as the loyal wingman concept moves closer to a fully operational reality. It could also point to further movement on plans to defend tankers and other more vulnerable support aircraft using loyal wingman drones, a growing developmental trend that The War Zon e has talked about in the past . Manufacturer Kratos describes its UTAP-22 as an “unmanned aircraft capable of collaborative operations with manned assets in contested environments,” better known by the term loyal wingman. Expected to operate at least semi-autonomously, operational loyal wingman drones would receive mission instructions from another, piloted aircraft, although the UTAP-22, in particular, has also been demonstrated as part of a networked team of multiple drones. A Kratos UTAP-22 operated by the U.S. Navy, on a ground launcher., KRATOS Beyond sensors, of course, the UTAP-22s can carry up to 350 pounds of other stores internally, and 500 pounds more on underwing pylons and wingtip pods. These could include munitions, electronic warfare jammers, or perhaps even other, smaller drones . With a reported price of between $2 and $3 million , the UTAP-22 is also designed to be attritable, meaning combat commanders would be willing to risk losing them in more hazardous operational scenarios. The UTAP-22 also served as a stepping stone on the developmental path toward the altogether more ambitious XQ-58A Valkyrie , a purpose-built low-cost, loyal wingman-type drone, with stealthy features. The kinds of drone connectivity that have begun to be tested aboard the KC-135 could equally apply to drones like this, as well. The RTIC plans ultimately envisage the KC-135 serving as a “data repository,” that can bring together information from all types of platforms, in the air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains. Using AI, that data can then be fused together and presented as a cohesive picture. That could help fill in the mission currently provided by a small fleet of Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft that are currently in great demand. Technicians install equipment related to the RTIC upgrade inside a KC-135., Master Sgt. John Winn/151st Air Refueling Wing Meanwhile, the “data repository” ambition should align the veteran tanker closely with ABMS and the related Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) effort. “The KC-135 is expected to play a critical role as a node within ABMS and JADC2, this is the first step in supporting the future of warfare,” observed Colonel Jeremiah Tucker, commander of the AATC, the Air National Guard’s development and testing arm for unique capabilities. “Gathering, correlating and fusing off-board aircraft data is critical to creating former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisitions Dr. Roper’s ‘military internet of things.’ ” The AATC now plans on providing two Air Reserve Component KC-135s with underwing pods that can accommodate “a host of ABMS and defensive technologies” using an open-architecture concept. Work on this has also been underway for around three years, again in collaboration with the Utah National Guard. It’s not clear what those “defensive technologies” might be, but it could stem from the realization that, as a critical force-multiplier, even when flying “only” as a tanker, an enemy would likely seek to destroy a KC-135 at the first opportunity during a conflict. Therefore, it would make sense of the work to enhance the aircraft’s self-defense measures. The underwing stores for the KC-135, which have dubbed Gladiator Pods, would be based on the existing Multipoint Refueling System (MPRS) pod, currently fitted to allow KC-135s to refuel U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, as well as probe-equipped NATO and allied assets. MPRS pods are fitted to 20 U.S. Air Force KC-135s. Gladiator Pods are expected to appear on “a few” KC-135s by Fiscal Year 2023 for flight testing. “Utilizing the outer mold line of the MPRS pod, we can rapidly integrate modular and adaptive communication, defensive, and sensor technologies on the KC-135,” Lieutenant Colonel Gould said. Again, exactly how those defensive capabilities for the big tanker may manifest themselves is not yet clear, but what is ever more apparent is the fact the Air Force, as well as the Navy, has real concerns about the ability of non-stealthy support aircraft to operate anywhere near the front lines during a future major conflict. Beyond making something like a stealth tanker , there have been other defensive upgrades for these kinds of aircraft talked about in the past five years, as well. Video of the MPRS pod in action on a U.S. Air Force KC-135: The Gladiator Pod might also relate to previously announced plans to install a new pod on the KC-46A Pegasus tanker, allowing that platform to serve as a communications node as part of the ABMS initiative. Perhaps, delays to the KC-46 program have now seen the pod-based communications gateway shifted to the KC-135, although previous upgrades mean this aircraft already offers enhanced awareness and networking capabilities . The same U.S. Department of Defense release confirmed the AATC “plans on equipping the pod with the necessary sensors capable of detecting, identifying, tracking, and defending as a data node within ABMS.” This points to the fully integrated, RTIC-enabled, Gladiator Pod-equipped KC-135 not only serving as a tanker and as a data node and ABMS host but also offering some level of defensive self-protection. The standard Multipoint Refueling System under the wing of a KC-135., Odyssey2001ACC/Wikicommons AATC commander Colonel Tucker confirmed that he expects the KC-135 to serve in the front line beyond 2040, but the aircraft is already having to take on more taskings from its planned replacement, the KC-46, 146 examples of which are on order. What is more, the number of KC-46s on order means the Air Force still requires around 300 KC-135s to meet its basic tanker requirements, at least until more tankers become available under a new procurement drive. Earlier this year , General Jacqueline Van Ovost, the head of Air Mobility Command, said that work on the KC-46’s troubled Remote Vision System (RVS) — which the boom operators use when linking up with receiving aircraft — isn’t expected to be complete until “late 2023.” Bearing in mind the time it will take to integrate it and train personnel to use it, it makes sense that the leadership is preparing for the KC-135 to maintain the burden of combat operations until 2026. KC-135s of the 151st Air Refueling Wing at Roland R. Wright Air National Guard Base, Salt Lake City., Tech. Sgt. Annie Edwards/151st Air Refueling Wing The Stratotanker has already served the Air Force for more than six decades and a relentless stream of upgrades means its value is undiminished, even as the KC-46 waits in the wings. With an emerging role as a data node and ABMS host, however, the KC-135 could end up in even greater demand than it is now. The ability of an aircraft to increase situational awareness is among the most potent weapons on the modern battlefield, and the importance of this mission set is only set to increase . The KC-135 could well emerge as a powerful rear-tier networking node. As Colonel Tucker pointed out, “In a future conflict, the rate and volume of 1s and 0s the KC-135 passes will be just as valuable as the fuel it provides today.” This article was updated on April 13 to reflect changes made to the original Department of Defense news release . An official quoted in the original release had suggested the KC-46 was not due to become fully operational until 2026, a quote that has now been removed from the original. In addition, a passage from the release noting that the Stratotanker “is expected to provide the preponderance of air refueling beyond 2040 ” was removed as well.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 3, 2022",Navy SM-6 Missile Will Attempt To Swat Down A Mock Hypersonic Weapon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Missile Defense Agency, together with the U.S. Navy, plan to test an SM-6 missile against an “advanced maneuvering threat,” a term that has been used in relation to unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicles , later this year. The Pentagon says that unspecified versions of the SM-6 have already demonstrated some degree of capability against these types of weapons, examples of which Russia and China have already begun putting to service. A new variant of the SM-6, the Block IB , is already under development and will itself be able to reach hypersonic speeds. Barbara McQuiston, a senior U.S. official currently performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, including mention of the scheduled SM-6 test in her testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on Defense yesterday. The aim of the hearing was to give Senators on the subcommittee an update on Department of Defense innovation and research efforts, broadly. The US Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Hopper fires an SM-3 missile during a test. MDA has previously said that ships in this class would be the first to be armed with an anti-hypersonic weapon interceptor., USN “MDA [the Missile Defense Agency], in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, demonstrated early capability against maneuvering threats during flight-testing of the Standard Missile (SM)-6 Sea-Based Terminal (SBT) defense, and it will further demonstrate this capability against an advanced maneuvering threat-representative target later this year,” according to McQuiston’s written testimony. “We will continue to advance our SBT capability to address the regional hypersonic threat and will test that capability in the FY 2024 timeframe.” As noted, the phrase “advanced maneuvering threat” has previously been used in relation to hypersonic boost-glide vehicles. Russia has at least one such weapon, Avangard , in limited service now, as does China, with the DF-17 . China is also developing other weapons in this category, possibly including an air-launched type for its H-6N missile carrier aircraft . There is growing interesting in boost-glide vehicles elsewhere in the world, as well, including in the United States, where the U.S. Air Force , Army, and Navy are all in the process of developing their own designs. MDA has already been involved in U.S. hypersonic weapon testing, collecting data to support counter-hypersonic projects. Unpowered boost-glide vehicles use a rocket motor to get them to an optimal altitude and speed. At that point, the vehicle detaches and glides down to its target at hypersonic speeds, defined as anything above Mach 5, along an atmospheric trajectory. A graphic offering a very rudimentary look at the difference in flight paths between hypersonic boost-glide vehicles and more conventional ballistic missiles., GAO Boost-glide vehicles are designed to make very unpredictable movements during their flights compared to traditional ballistic missiles, even ones with maneuverable reentry vehicles. As a result, the hypersonic weapons present significant challenges for enemy air and missile defenses, even particularly dense defensive networks protecting high-value targets. The combination of speed and maneuverability makes these weapons difficult to spot and track, and reduces the overall amount of time available to react in any way, including simply trying to move critical assets out of the target area or otherwise attempting to seek cover. More conventional ballistic missiles with increasing degrees of maneuverability , including air-launched types, such as Russia’s Kinzhal , also reach hypersonic velocities in the terminal phase of flight and present their own form of “advanced maneuvering threat.” Air-breathing cruise missiles able to reach hypersonic speeds and maneuver erratically at low altitudes present another emerging concern. This is not the first time the Pentagon has publicly discussed using a variant of the SM-6 for hypersonic defense. In March 2020, Mike Griffin, then the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, first revealed that this missile was among those being considered for this role and that there were plans to test one of them against an actual hypersonic boost-glide vehicle sometime in the 2023 Fiscal Year. It’s not clear whether the test Griffin was referring to is the one now scheduled for this year or the one that MDA now plans to carry out in the 2024 Fiscal Year. Just days before Griffin made his remarks last year, Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill, director of MDA, had also said that the interceptor being developed under the Regional Glide Phase Weapon System (RGPWS) program would fit inside Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) launch cells. The SM-6 is designed to be fired from Mk 41 VLSs with longer “strike-length” cells. A graphic showing various weapons that can be loaded into Mk 41 VLSs with strike or tactical-length cells, including the SM-6., Lockheed Martin In her written testimony, McQuiston mentioned “a newly designated Glide Phase Intercept initiative to develop a capability to defeat a regional hypersonic threat.” It’s not clear how this new effort relates to the earlier RGPWS program. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has also been exploring counter-hypersonic capabilities through its Glide Breaker program . It’s also not clear what variant or variants of the SM-6, which is also known as the RIM-174 Standard Extended Range Active Missile (ERAM), MDA plans to employ in any of these future hypersonic defense tests. The original SM-6, which entered service in 2013 as a new weapon for Navy warships equipped with the Aegis combat system , is a highly-capable missile, as you can read about in more detail here . It can be employed against aircraft and low-flying cruise missiles and has the ability to knock down certain kinds of ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of their flight – the same SBT role that McQuiston references in her testimony. An SM-6 Block I or Block IA missile., Raytheon The SM-6 has a nascent surface-to-surface capability, as well. The Block IA version of the missile adds a GPS-assisted guidance option to expand its ability to hit static surface targets. Both the Block I and Block IA variants have two-way data links that allow them to get updated targeting information in flight from both the ship that launched them and offboard platforms. In 2019, the Navy disclosed additional plans for a Block IB version of the SM-6 that would mate the guidance system and other components of the Block IA to the enlarged missile body used on the SM-3 Block IIA missile. The SM-3 Block IIA is designed to engage ballistic missile threats in the mid-course portion of their flights when they are flying at extremely high altitudes. A briefing slide giving a sense of how much larger the SM-3 Block IIA’s body is compared to older SM-3 variants, which are similar in general size and shape to SM-6 Block I/IA missiles., MDA It is the still-under-development Block IB version of the missile that would seem best suited to hypersonic defense. A report on U.S. hypersonic weapons development programs that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, released in March confirmed earlier reports that this variant will fly at hypersonic speeds. A table from the March 2021 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on US hypersonic weapon developments that includes the SM-6 Block IB missile as among the types now in development., GAO An SM-6 variant would also be a good starting place for developing a hypersonic defense weapon that could be used to protect assets at sea, as well as on land. The U.S. Army is already in process of evaluating a land-based version of this missile as a longer-range strike weapon. The Navy could potentially integrate advanced SM-6s into existing and future Aegis ashore missile defense sites , as well. If the hypersonic defense version of the SM-6 remains similar, if not largely identical, to an existing variant, such as the Block IB, the missile could remain an extremely flexible weapon that ships or ground-based launch platforms could still employ against a wide range of other targets, as well. It’s certainly not hard to see how one variant might offer a single line of defense against hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, as well as air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles and advanced ballistic missiles. At the same time, questions remain about just how effective any kind of interceptor will ever be against hypersonic threats. “ Directed energy weapons (high energy lasers or particle beam) or space-based interceptors provide the best overall hope of a hard kill,” the NATO Science & Technology Organization said in a March 2020 report , which seemed to imply the possibility of a successful interception of a hypersonic weapon was low, in general. Clearly, the forthcoming tests of the SM-6 in the counter-hypersonic role are meant to prove that a version of this weapon will indeed offer valuable additional protection against these emerging advanced threats.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 18, 2021",F-15 Eagle Scores “Longest Known” Air-To-Air Missile Shot During U.S. Air Force Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An F-15C Eagle fighter jet destroyed a target drone last month in what the U.S. Air Force describes as “the longest known air-to-air missile shot to date.” Exactly how far away the fighter was from its target when it fired the radar-guided AIM-120 AMRAAM missile has not been disclosed, but the test is a clear signal that the Air Force is making very long-range aerial engagements a priority. The potentially record-breaking missile shot, at least in terms of U.S. capabilities, took place during a WSEP East event — or Weapons System Evaluation Program — that provides air-to-air and air-to-ground training and evaluation, giving pilots the chance to use these weapons for real. WSEP East refers to evaluations at Tyndall Air Force Base , in Florida, while those at Hill Air Force Base in Utah are known as WSEP West. An F-15C Eagle from the 44th Fighter Squadron loaded up with AIM-120 missiles during a WSEP mission at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida., U.S. Air Force / Tech. Sgt. John Hoffmann In this instance, the F-15C fired an AIM-120 AMRAAM at a BQM-167 sub-scale drone , resulting in a successful “kill,” likely achieved somewhere over the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where the vital Gulf Range Complex provides over 130,000 square miles of training airspace, allowing both large-scale air combat training and sustained flying at supersonic speeds. The units involved in the milestone event included the 28th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), based at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, which provides detachments that assess the operational effectiveness of current and future weapons systems using fighter radars, air-to-air missiles, as well as electronic attack and electronic protection suites. The 28th TES was partnered with the 83d Fighter Weapons Squadron at Tyndall, which hosts the WSEP East events. “This test effort supported requests from the CAF [Combat Air Forces] for “long-range kill chain” capabilities,” said Major Aaron Osborne of the 28th TES. “Key partnerships within the 53rd Wing enabled the expansion of capabilities on a currently fielded weapons system, resulting in warfighters gaining enhanced weapons employment envelopes.” Intriguingly, it has been suggested that the mysterious appearance of a BQM-167A target drone on a Florida beach on March 19 — an incident that we covered in depth here — could have been related to the AMRAAM shot. Missiles used in these tests often have their warheads replaced with telemetry packages and kills are scored by evaluating the missile’s proximity to the target at the end of its terminal attack. While the model of AIM-120 used in the test was not disclosed, it was almost certainly one of the latest AIM-120D weapons. While it looks outwardly like one of the earlier AMRAAMs, the D-model offers considerably more range . While official performance figures are classified, it is generally assumed to be able to hit targets at a distance of between 75 and 100 miles. Of course, in practical applications, a whole range of factors impact a missile’s reach, above all the energy and altitude state of the launching aircraft and the target. The claim of the longest known missile engagement is interesting as the U.S. Navy’s AIM-54 Phoenix had a maximum range of around 100 miles and foreign designs supposedly outstrip even that. This points to the AIM-120D having flight profiles that can exceed the reach of those weapons, or at least the AIM-54, if the Air Force’s notice refers to American-made missiles only. An F-15C fires an AIM-120 AMRAAM., U.S. Air Force It is possible that the range was achieved thanks, at least in part, to the power of the F-15C’s massive active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, the APG-63V3, which The War Zone has examined in some depth here . At the same time, these missiles are networked and third-party sensors can also provide targeting data for engagements without the launching aircraft locking the target up themselves. This is likely what is being referred to in the mention of the “kill chain” in the Air Force’s statement on the test. You can read all about this type of engagement architecture in this past post of ours . APG-63V3 AESA installed in a 142nd Fighter Wing F-15C., Tyler Rogoway The Air Force news release about the missile shot noted that it was “directly supporting calls for increased lethality and affordability” made in the 2018 National Defense Strategy. This document clearly identifies Russia and China as the major challengers to American military interests and, furthermore, both these countries are actively involved in developing very long-range air-to-air missiles of their own. While the kinds of ranges offered by the most modern Chinese air-to-air missiles are unknown, Russia, for its part, has announced performance figures for some of its beyond-visual-range weapons. According to data from the manufacturer, the R-37M , at least in its export form, can defeat “some types” of aerial targets at a range of up to 124 miles. This likely refers to only larger, less agile, aircraft targets and is very much a “sales brochure figure,” with all the caveats that entails. A Su-35S launches an R-37M missile., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP Whatever range the U.S. missile attained in this long-range test, the AMRAAM is clearly reaching the end of its development potential. As well as big, long-legged weapons like the R-37M, there is also a new generation of ramjet-powered missiles with throttleable engines that maximize kinematic performance all the way to the ends of their engagement envelopes. While the pan-European Meteor is already established in service, Russia and China are also working on similar ramjet air-to-air missiles concepts, and have other very long-range solid-fuel air-to-air missiles already in testing. These weapons not only put tactical and strategic combat aircraft at risk, but also key support aircraft, like airborne early warning and control aircraft and tankers. The Air Force said that the March AMRAAM test “laid the groundwork for modernizing range capabilities in support of future long-range weapons testing on the Eglin-Gulf Test and Training Range,” suggesting that there will be more potentially record-breaking AIM-120 tests to come, and also trials of new generations of air-to-air missiles optimized for beyond-visual-range engagements. An aircraft maintainer uses the MJ-1 Bomb Lift Truck to load an AIM-120 onto the F-15 Eagle munition rail at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida., U.S. Air Force/Kristin Stewart The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy are already working together to develop a new air-to-air missile, the AIM-260, that will replace the AMRAAM. You can read about that weapon here and here , but noteworthy is the fact that it is expected to not only out-range the AIM-120, even without a ramjet motor, but also offer performance that at least matches Chinese and Russian efforts in this field. With that in mind, it may not be long before the Air Force can announce an even longer-range missile kill over one of its test ranges. Update, 1:30 pm PST: The 53rd Wing has confirmed that the missile used in the “longest known air-to-air missile shot” test was indeed an AIM-120D, as we expected. The same unit has stated that the BQM-167A target drone washed up on the Florida beach on March 19 was not related to this exercise . We have also received information pointing to two very long-range AIM-54 Phoenix shots dating from the 1970s. One apparently involved a target drone downed at just over 126 miles after the missile was launched from an F-14A Tomcat. The other, reportedly achieved during a training exercise in Iran, in January 1979, saw an AIM-54 hit a target drone at a range of 132 miles.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ship tracking software shows that the Belgian Navy’s Karel Doorman class frigate Leopold I sailed around the area where an Israeli-owned cargo ship, the Hyperion Ray , was reportedly the victim of an attack in the Gulf of Oman earlier today. That incident, which remains unconfirmed, follows a recent attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear site, as well as one earlier this month in the Red Sea on the Iranian cargo ship M/V Saviz , which is widely understood to be a covert mothership operated by that country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC. Israel has been accused of carrying out both of those attacks. The exact nature of the attack on the Bahamian-flagged Hyperion Ray remains unclear and there have been no reported casualties.

An unnamed spokesperson for the Hyperion Ray refuted that there was any damage and said the ship continued on its route. Still, the appearance of the 3,320-ton-displacement Leopold I sailing around the last known position of the Hyperion Ray ahead of the reported attack, close to the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), does add additional evidence that some kind of incident did happen. This frigate is currently assigned to the European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz (EMASOH) mission, which aims to ensure safe passage for commercial ships in these strategically vital waters. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for any attack on Hyperion Ray and there is no official confirmation of any incident from the ship’s owner or operator, or Israeli officials. If an attack did occur, it would certainly be in line with an expanding spate of tit-for-tat clandestine operations between Iran and Israel directed primarily at the countries’ respective commercial shipping activities. It is particularly notable that the Helios Ray , a sister ship of the Hyperion Ray that is owned by the same Israeli company, was also the victim of a reported attack earlier this year in the Gulf of Oman. The reported attack on Hyperion Ray also comes just days after a mysterious attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear site, which officials in Tehran have described as an act of “ nuclear terrorism ” and blamed on Israel. Exactly what happened at Natanz remains unclear, with some reports suggesting a cyberattack was responsible for damage that cut power to the facility, including underground centrifuge banks where Iranian authorities have been enriching uranium to increasingly levels of purity. Others say the attack was carried out using an explosive charge . The New York Times reported that an unnamed American official said that Israeli authorities had informed the U.S. government that their country had carried out the attack. Israel has repeatedly said it will do whatever it feels necessary to prevent Iran from getting into a position where it could build a nuclear weapon . There are reports that the attack on Natanz may have set back Iranian uranium enrichment plans by nine months or more. However, the power outage was orchestrated, it may have resulted in substantial damage to large numbers of centrifuges, which can only be safely stopped by gradually slowing them down. A bank of centrifuges at Natanz., Atomic Energy Organization of Iran This is broadly the same effect that the Stuxnet computer virus had, in part, after being introduced into computers at Natanz sometime between 2009 and 2010. Stuxnet was also developed by the United States and Israel with the aim of setting back Iranian nuclear efforts. Whatever the exact nature of the attack on Natanz was, Iranian officials have threatened to take revenge on the perpetrators. An incident involving the Hyperion Ray could also have been in direct response to the attack on the Saviz in the Red Sea last week. This Iranian cargo ship is widely understood to be a covert mothership that Iran’s IRGC uses to assist Houthi rebels in Yemen and carry out malign activities in the area. The vessel was reportedly hit by an explosion, apparently due to limpet mines attached to its hull. Of course, the reported attack on Hyperion Ray might not be in direct response to any particular preceding incident, but part of a general campaign of Iranian retaliation against Israel. Israel has been accused of being behind multiple strikes carried out against Iranian vessels in the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, and elsewhere, over the past two years, at least. All of this comes as the U.S. government is in the early stages of negotiations, presently being conducted indirectly , with the regime in Tehran over the former’s return to a controversial international deal over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. President Donald Trump withdrew from that agreement , known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018. Iran has since responded by systemically violating all of its key terms . After the Natanz attack, Tehran vowed to boost its uranium enrichment levels from 20% to 60%, almost at the purity required to produce nuclear weapons. At the same time, Iranian authorities continue to assert that the country’s present nuclear program is entirely civilian in nature. For its part, the Biden administration has flat denied any involvement in the Natanz attack. Whether an attack on the Hyperion Ray did occur or not, the reported incident only underscores concerns that this shadow war between Israel and Iran will keep escalating as negotiations between Washington and Tehran continue.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 30, 2021",Biden Throws Down The Gauntlet On Pulling Troops Out Of Afghanistan Ahead Of 9/11 Anniversary,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a major foreign policy development, the U.S. government has confirmed its intention to pull out virtually all U.S. military forces from Afghanistan no later than September 11th of this year, which will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks . The withdrawal, which President Joe Biden’s administration plans to begin carrying out this month and says it will complete regardless of any conditions on the ground , would mark the effective end of a nearly two-decades-long American military intervention in that country. At the same time, it raises significant questions about Afghanistan’s future, given that the Taliban remain a very real threat to the central government, whose security forces heavily dependent on foreign support . The Washington Post was the first to break the news , which other outlets subsequently reported on . A conference call was subsequently held where a senior U.S. official confirmed the withdrawal plan and offered additional details. A US Army soldier kneels on the rear ramp of a CH-47 Chinook flying over Afghanistan., US Army “This is not conditions-based,” that official said , adding that Sept. 11, 2021, was a “no later than” date for the withdrawal to be completed. “The president has judged that a conditions-based approach, which has been the approach of the past two decades, is a recipe for staying in Afghanistan forever.” “President Biden will give our military commanders the time and space they need to conduct a safe and orderly withdrawal, not just of U.S. forces but of allied forces as well on the principle of ‘in together, out together,'” the official added, referring to foreign troops in Afghanistan, which would appear to include those operating under the auspices of the NATO-led Resolute Support security assistance mission. “We will take the time we need to execute that – and no more time than that.” It’s unclear how aware Afghan or NATO officials were of the withdrawal plan prior to today. “Administration officials were in the process of notifying officials in NATO nations as well as Afghan officials and the Taliban on Tuesday,” according to The Washington Post . The current U.S. intervention in Afghanistan began when Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel moved into Afghanistan just days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The first U.S. special operations forces followed in October 2001 . The ostensible mission, as outlined in the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, a resolution that Congress passed on Sept. 18, 2001, was to “to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or  persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.” A picture showing CIA personnel inside a Russian-made Mi-8/Mi-17-type helicopter headed for Afghanistan in September 2001., CIA While the U.S. government’s primary stated reason for remaining in Afghanistan has remained a desire to prevent the country from again becoming a base for terrorist attacks on the United States could be planned, the actual mission evolved into one of state-building to support those objectives. Nearly 9,600 foreign troops, including U.S. forces, are in Afghanistan today under the NATO-led Resolute Support mission. A joint raid conducted by elements of the U.S. military and the CIA had already led to the death of Al Qaeda leader and 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011. “We went to Afghanistan to deliver justice to those who attacked us on Sept. 11…We believe we achieved that objective some years ago,” a U.S. official had told The Washington Post . President Biden reportedly arrived at the decision to set this firm withdrawal date after considering various courses of action and with an eye toward other threats to U.S. national interests abroad. “This is not 2001,” the senior U.S. official said. “It is 2021, and in 2021, the terrorist threat that we face is real and it emanates from a number of countries, indeed a number of continents, from Yemen , from Syria , from Somalia , from other parts of Africa .” The withdrawal also comes amid a continuing push, which began in earnest under President Donald Trump, to reorient the U.S. military more toward preparing for “ great power competition ” with potential near-peer adversaries, such as China or Russia. The Biden administration has continued to point to China as the “pacing threat” for future U.S. military planning . With regards to Afghanistan, it remains unclear exactly what forces the U.S. government now plans to withdraw from Afghanistan in the coming months. The senior U.S. official said that, except for military forces assigned to protect the embassy, everyone else would be on their way out. At present, the U.S. military official says it has around 2,500 troops in the country, but the actual number is reportedly closer to 3,500. It’s unclear how much overlap there is between either of those figures and unacknowledged special operations forces and CIA paramilitary personnel who are also widely understood to be operating in the country. US special operations forces at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan in December 2019, after the arrival of then-President Donald Trump on Air Force One, seen in the background., OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images The White House has also said the U.S. military will “reposition our counterterrorism capabilities “keeping significant assets” at unspecified locations “in the region to counter the potential reemergence of a terrorist threat to the homeland from Afghanistan, and to hold the Taliban to its commitment to ensure al Qaeda does not once again threaten the United States or our interests or our allies.” It’s also not clear how these withdrawal plans will impact other U.S. security forces elements in Afghanistan. The U.S. State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, commonly referred to by the acronym INL , has a robust presence in the country, including a helicopter shuttle service that runs between the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul and the U.S. Embassy there, which you can read about in more detail here . Agencies under the U.S. Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), have also conducted field operations in Afghanistan in the past. US State Department CH-46 helicopters sit on the tarmac at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in front of a US Air Force C-32A passenger transport aircraft ahead of the departure of then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on June 25, 2019. , US State Department “Biden administration officials say the United States intends to remain closely involved in the peace process and will continue to provide humanitarian aid and assistance to the Afghan government and security forces, which remains almost totally dependent on foreign support,” The Washington Post had reported. That latter point is especially important given how heavily the U.S. government subsidizes the Afghan military and other state security forces, including through contractors who are largely responsible for maintaining higher-end systems, especially aircraft, such as the Afghan Air Force’s A-29 Super Tucano light attack planes and its UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. It also remains to be seen how the Taliban, the largest and most powerful militant group in Afghanistan opposed to the central government in Kabul, responds to the Biden administration announcement. The Taliban had threatened to resume attacks on foreign forces if Biden did not withdraw U.S. troops by May 1, a date set in an agreement between the group and the previous Trump Administration. In addition, while the Taliban has largely kept to its moratorium on attacking U.S. and other foreign troops, it has continued to aggressively engage Afghanistan’s national security forces and other government officials. This has included targeted assassinations, some of which have involved small drones carrying improvised munitions . At the same time, the aforementioned peace talks between the Taliban and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s government in Kabul that began under the Trump Administration have been stuttering along without any significant progress for months. “We discussed the ongoing peace process, the upcoming peace talks in Turkey, and also spoke about the upcoming phone call with President @JoeBiden,” Ghani had Tweeted out earlier today, referring to a call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Various other militant and terrorist groups, including a faction aligned with ISIS, are also active in Afghanistan. The U.S. military has even acknowledged indirect coordination with the Taliban in fighting against this ISIS branch, which is known as ISIS-K . Regardless of what U.S. forces may actually remain in Afghanistan, or elsewhere in the region, after the planned withdrawals, there are already concerns about what this plan could mean for the country’s central government. “We’ll stand behind the diplomatic process, and we will use our full toolkit to ensure the future that the Afghan people are seeking has the best chance of coming about,” the senior U.S. government official said. “We will also look to work with other countries using diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian tools to protect the gains made by Afghan women.” Whether the U.S. government will remain prepared to prevent the collapse of the government in Kabul should the Taliban attempt to forcefully overthrow it is unclear. “We will encourage any future government in Afghanistan to expand resources for refugees and internally displaced peoples while also working with Congress to expand and expedite Special Immigrant Visas for those Afghans and their families who supported U.S. efforts in Afghanistan,” the senior U.S. official added, underscoring how the country is already often too dangerous a place to remain for Afghans who worked with U.S. or NATO-led coalition forces. Afghan Army troops., US Army The Biden Administration has already faced a flurry of criticism from Republican members of Congress over the plan. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the withdrawal plan was a “grave mistake,” while Senator Jim Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma and the ranking member of his party on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said it was a “reckless and dangerous decision.” At the same time, not all Republicans were categorically opposed to the idea. “If we’re ready to go, I’ll be supportive,” Utah Senator Mitt Romney said. “If we’re not ready to go, I’ll be making that very clear.” Senator Ted Cruz, a prominent critic of Biden, voiced general support for the idea of troops “coming home.” With President Biden’s first budget proposal, for the 2022 Fiscal Year, set to come sometime between May and June, there is the potential for opponents of the pullout to try to block funding for the plan directly or indirectly, or simply threaten to prompt a government shutdown if the withdrawal proceeds. Whatever happens now, Biden and his administration have taken a significant policy position aimed at largely bringing U.S. involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan to an end after nearly 20 years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 23, 2021",Navy P-8A Maritime Patrol Planes To Get Pods Loaded With Radar Jamming ‘Little Buddies’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy recently tested a new podded self-protection system for the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane. The pod, the outer shell of which is derived from the shape of the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile, is designed to release an AN/ALE-55 towed decoy capable of jamming enemy radars or luring incoming radar-homing missiles away from the aircraft. These pods, and the decoys inside them, often referred to as “little buddies,” could help improve the survivability of the service’s P-8As, especially during higher-end conflicts involving near-peer adversaries, such as China or Russia. The decoy system is just one of a number of efforts that the Navy, as well as the U.S. Air Force , have conducted in recent years exploring ways to add additional countermeasures capabilities to larger, non-stealthy aircraft. A P-8A assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 20 (VX-20) out of Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River in Maryland finished basic airworthiness testing of the pod out over the Navy’s Atlantic Test Ranges on March 12, 2021. The service then sent the system to Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake in California, where it successfully completed “effectiveness testing” on March 26. The plan is now to fully integrate the system onto the P-8A and field it operationally. A P-8A Poseidon with a prototype of the podded decoy system under its wing., USN “This has the potential to be a game-changer for protecting the warfighter,” Navy Captain Eric Gardner, the Program Manager for the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office within Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), also known as PMA-290, said in a statement. “We continue to look for ways to enhance capabilities that allow the fleet to be successful.” The development of the towed decoy pod was a collaborative effort between the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office and NAVAIR’s Advanced Tactical Aircraft Protection Systems Program Office, as well as the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division’s (NAWCAD) Aircraft Prototype Systems Division (APSD) and Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation & Demonstration (RPED) team. BAE Systems, the manufacturer of the AN/ALE-55 decoy was also involved by way of a so-called Other Transaction Authority (OTA) deal, a contracting mechanism meant to support rapid prototyping and other research and development work. The actual funding for the project came from the Naval Innovative Science & Engineering (NISE) program. “A lot of the challenge and effort went into designing, to our best estimates, for what BAE was expected to put in the pod,” Michael Hansell, the lead engineer on the project at APSD, said. “We had to adapt and redesign rapidly. We worked as fast as possible to support PMA-290 and RPED to make sure we could pivot and adjust to meet established timelines.” From what can be seen of the pod in the pictures that the Navy has released, it is an AGM-84-shaped design with the decoy launcher mounted at the rear. Starting with the general form factor of the Harpoon, which the P-8A is already certified to carry, would have only helped in crafting a self-protection system that could be rapidly integrated onto the Poseidon. The choice of the AN/ALE-55 also makes good sense as it is already in service on Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets . When deployed, the decoy trails behind the aircraft, towed by a fiber-optic line. An artist’s depiction of an AN/ALE-55 decoy trailing behind an F/A-18E/F Super Hornet., BAE Systems The AN/ALE-55 can scramble hostile emitters, such as enemy radars, to prevent them from locking onto the aircraft, or initiate electronic attacks to break an established lock. The decoy also has the ability to emit signals designed to lure incoming missiles away from the plane towing it. The system functions by way of a control unit, in this case mounted in the pod, that sends specific commands to the decoy via the fiber-optic line. This all makes for a very flexible system that can respond quickly to various and potentially rapidly changing threats. The AN/ALE-55 is a marked improvement over the older AN/ALE-50 decoy , which had an entirely self-contained electronic warfare system, the function of which could not be dynamically altered to respond to more specific kinds of threats. Beyond its specific capabilities, the AN/ALE-55 will simply offer P-8A crews an important tool to defend against radiofrequency threats. At present, the aircraft defensive suite is much more focused on protecting against heat-seeking threats, with a missile approach warning system tied to a directional infrared countermeasures system and dispensers loaded with decoy flares . The P-8A’s directional infrared countermeasures system is seen under the tail., USN A US Navy P-8A fires decoy flares., USN The aircraft does have radar warning receivers to alert the crew that an opponent is trying to or has locked on them. The aircraft’s robust electronic support measures (ESM) package offers an additional way to monitor for threats, as well as to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions with regards to enemy emitters, such as radars, too. The P-8A’s countermeasures dispensers can launch cartridges loaded with radar-confusing chaff , but chaff is not commonly carried because the P-8’s radar signature is so big, it would do little to protect the aircraft in most cases. The P-8 does not have any sort of internal electronic warfare jamming system for self-protection, or the ability to carry such a system in a podded form. It’s interesting to note that there had been an expectation in the past that spiral developments would lead to the integration of radiofrequency countermeasures systems onto the P-8A, but those plans had previously been dropped. “Radio frequency countermeasures are planned for spiral development, with installation provisions (including wiring and mounting pylons) incorporated into all production aircraft,” the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, wrote in the section on the P-8A in its annual report covering the 2011 Fiscal Year . DOT&E’s Fiscal Year 2017 report notably lacks any such language regarding the P-8A. “On- and off-board sensors and datalink systems are used to improve tactical situational awareness of expected threat systems,” it says instead. It’s not surprising that the Navy has returned to the idea of adding more robust radiofrequency countermeasures to the P-8A’s defensive arsenal given the shift in focus across the U.S. military in recent years toward being better prepared for higher-end conflicts, especially against major potential adversaries, such as China or Russia. Poseidons, together with other anti-submarine warfare assets , would be critical in a major conflict in the Pacific region, as well as in and around Europe, where improving Russian and Chinese submarine capabilities present increasing challenges for American forces and their allies and partners. In a major conflict, the Navy’s P-8A would be very vulnerable to increasingly longer-range sea and ground-based air defenses , as well as enemy combat aircraft equipped with ever-more-advanced air-to-air weaponry . The Iranian shootdown of a U.S. Navy RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance. Demonstrator (BAMS-D) drone over the Gulf of Oman in 2019 also underscores the increasing proliferation of these threats to smaller countries, as well, and how they are increasingly a factor around the world, even on routine missions outside of formal conflicts. This decoy-launching pod is in line with a variety of other efforts the Navy, along with the Air Force , has been pursuing in recent years to help improve the survivability of various platforms that are critical, but also large, slow and non-stealthy. This includes the Poseidons, as well as various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, aerial refueling tankers , and cargo planes . The video below shows the interaction between the crew of a Navy P-8A and Chinese forces on a man-made outpost in the disputed South China Sea in 2015. With all this in mind, it’s not hard to imagine the Navy’s new podded decoy system, which appears to be a relatively low-cost, but a highly-capable defensive tool, finding its ways onto other aircraft within the service and elsewhere across the U.S. military, as well as with allies and partners. Versions of the P-8, itself, are already in service in Australia , India, and the United Kingdom . The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and South Korea all have examples on order, too. At the same time, this pod will be just one part of a growing electronic warfare ecosystem, that could include additional capabilities within particular aircraft, such as the P-8, working together with other offboard platforms. The Navy is heavily invested in an overarching networked electronic warfare effort, dubbed the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS, that is seeking to link together systems on manned and unmanned aircraft, especially autonomous drone swarms , as well as ships and submarines so that they can work together cooperatively. A key focus area of NEMESIS, which you can read more about in this past feature , is on developing ways to create phantom fleets of aircraft and ships, viewed by a range of enemy sensors over a wide area, to confuse opponents and make it difficult for them to respond effectively. However the Navy’s overarching electronic warfare plans do continue to evolve, in the near term, these podded decoys look set to give the Navy’s P-8As an important defensive capability against radio frequency threats that they really do need.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s supposedly inexpensive Littoral Combat Ships have added another item to their apparently never-ending list of problems with the revelation that the cost of operating the vessels is far higher than planned, comparing unfavorably even to a wildly more capable Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer. As a result, the service is considering switching the upkeep of the warships from contractors hands’ to the Navy, which, in turn, would mean that their crews will have to be increased to cover maintenance demands. At the outset, the relatively small crew complement aboard these ships was a key selling point and was intended to bring overall costs down . David B. Larter of Defense News reported this latest development in the LCS saga today. Budget data obtained by the publication reveals that the annual cost of running a single LCS is currently around $70 million, compared to approximately $81 million for an Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer (DDG). The Littoral Combat Ship USS Independence (LCS-2) underway off the coast of San Diego., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Ace Rheaume Specific figures were not provided for either of the two LCS subclasses (which are very different ships) or any of the different Flights of Arleigh Burkes . While it’s unlikely the current Flight IIA and future Flight III ships cost the same to operate as the earlier Flight I and II ships, the figures are bad news for the LCS program, whichever way you look at it. After all, while the Burkes are well established in U.S. Navy service, and, beyond being far more prolific, they are also significantly larger, with the future Flight III variant having an estimated fully-loaded displacement of 9,500 long tons. By comparison the Independence class LCS has a displacement of 3,050 long tons, while the Freedom class design displaces closer to 3,450 long tons. The Aegis combat system -equipped DDG-51 destroyer is also a far more capable warship that is loaded with advanced sensors and plans call for it to only become more so in the future. These ships also carry relatively huge arsenals of advanced weapons, in addition to their 5-inch gun, 25mm chain guns, 20mm Phalanx close-in weapon system (CIWS), and torpedo tubes, as well as their two MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. The Flight I and II destroyers have 90 cells for their missile vertical launch systems and the Flight IIA and III have 96 cells. These can accommodate various weapons, such as the SM-2 and SM-6 series of surface-to-air missiles and the Tomahawk land attack cruise missile . Meanwhile, the LCS has no large vertical launch cells at all. Among the LCSs, only the USS Gabrielle Giffords has so far received the RGM-184A Naval Strike Missile (NSM) and this integration has not been without difficulty . USS Tulsa has at least some of the components of the NSM system and the Navy does still plan to add NSM to all Freedom and Independence class ships, eight of which will be carried on each. U.S. NAVY Other weapons for the LCS include the an AGM-114L launcher and Bushmaster chain guns as part of the Surface Warfare Module, although it won’t find its way onto every hull, and the 57mm automatic cannon . Looking further ahead, there has been talk about adding laser weapons to the LCS hulls, too. The most capable weapons on these ships today are their MH-60R Seahawk helicopters and, in some cases, their MQ-8 Fire Scout drones. Gilday confirmed that the original crew concept for the LCS — as few as eight officers and 32 enlisted sailors in the Independence class, for example — had the adverse effect of pushing up maintenance costs by requiring contractors to do more of the work while in port. He said the plan is now to bring more of the maintenance work in-house. That might also be easier said than done. In recent years the Navy has struggled to meet its recruiting goals , forcing it to look at a variety of reduced and other novel crew concepts, as well as deployment mechanisms , to help ensure readiness. This also comes at a time when the service is planning to boost its fleet to provide as many as 534 ships and submarines, including various kinds of unmanned vessels . “So if you snap the chalk line today, the costs are pretty high, especially compared to a [guided-missile destroyer] DDG,” Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday said, at a recent media roundtable. “But what we’re trying to do is move from a contractor-centric maintenance model to a sailor-centric maintenance model or a Navy-centric maintenance model.” USS John Finn (DDG-113), an Arleigh Burke Flight IIA ship, conducts pre-delivery trials in the Gulf of Mexico., U.S. Navy/Huntington Ingalls Industries “That’ll be a significant cost saving if we get to that point,” Gilday added. “Of course, we have to take a look at: If we do that, do we have adequate numbers of people on board the ship to be able to do that fully? If it needed to be a phased plan, how long it would take? Boosting crew complements could bring other problems, too, not least finding the physical space to accommodate them, without losing valuable space for the mission modules. The numbers of sailors aboard each of the LCS vessels has already increased in the past, at least twice, the most recent being a response to changing requirements when the Freedom and Independence class ships were tasked with single missions. Overall, however, Gilday sees the increased manpower on the ships as a sensible approach to leverage cost savings, provided that an adequate spare parts supply is maintained. Meanwhile, the two LCS families still have other issues to contend with. The most recent major problem related to reliability, namely “a material defect” in the transmission’s combining gear on the Freedom class that officials said would have to be fixed before any more of the warships were accepted for service. When that issue was reported , back in January, 10 examples of the Freedom class had been delivered, with another five under construction or in the process of fitting out, and one more on order. One of the Freedom class LCSs, USS Detroit (LCS-7) sails in formation with three Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyers: USS Lassen (DDG-82), USS Preble (DDG-88), and USS Farragut (DDG-99) while conducting maritime security operations in the Caribbean Sea., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Anderson W. Branch Defense News reported today that prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, together with RENK AG, the original equipment manufacturer, has found a fix for the combining gear and Gilday said the Navy will begin testing it this month. In the past wider maintenance concerns led to discussions about using certain support ships as expeditionary maintenance bases afloat to help support LCS operations, something The War Zone discussed here . Then there are ongoing concerns relating to the long-awaited mission modules that give each of the LCS vessels a purpose. Originally, it was planned that these mission modules could be switched out rapidly while in port before that idea was abandoned. Each ship now has a single mission module installed relatively permanently, but the anti-submarine warfare and mine warfare mission packages will still not be available until next year. On the other hand, there is still a possibility that some of the hulls will be retired, especially now that an entirely new class of more capable frigates, which uses a foundational design from an Italian shipbuilder , are on the horizon, offering the Navy access to a “true frigate.” The first two LCSs in each subclass, in particular, are at risk, since they are so different from their successors, meaning the Navy has planned on retiring these particular hulls entirely . However, one of these ships, USS Freedom (LCS-1) was recently deployed on a counter-narcotics patrol in the Eastern Pacific—officially its last patrol—although there has been some pushback to these retirement plans.

Part of this has involved optimizing the crew concepts for the vessels and reassessing maintenance requirements . It’s alarming that, despite all this, and the fact that these ships were built to rule the littorals, the LCSs have still not yet ventured into Central Command’s littoral-dominant area of operations. For many, the LCS has become something of a poster child for what’s wrong with defense procurement, but the fact that these ships, envisioned to be cheap and ready to operate, cost as much to keep in the fleet as a destroyer, while struggling to even deploy on patrols, has taken that notion to a whole new level.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 25, 2021",Today’s F-35As Not Worth Including In High-End War Games According To Air Force General,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior U.S. Air Force officer has said that there is no value in including the service’s current fleet of F-35A Joint Strike Fighters in tabletop wargames simulating future high-end conflicts, such as one covering an American military response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan . That same individual also called into question how relevant any of the service’s existing examples of these fighter jets would be for conducting combat operations near or over the territory of a near-peer adversary, including China. This all comes at a time when the F-35 program, as a whole, is facing a new surge of scrutiny , including from members of Congress. Air Force Lieutenant General Clint Hinote, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategy, Integration, and Requirements, made his remarks regarding the F-35A in an interview that Defense News published today focusing on a wargame last year that simulated an attempted Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Defense News described the outcome of that wargame as a “pyrrhic” victory for the U.S. military and one that was only achieved by the employment of capabilities that are not yet actually in service. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., USAF Those capabilities include F-35As equipped with the full suite of upgrades enabled by the still-in-development Block 4 software package. Block 4 F-35As are set to feature enhanced radar and electronic warfare capabilities , as well as the ability to carry new weapons . This particular wargame also featured notional stealth combat aircraft developed through the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, a multi-faceted project that you can read about in more detail here , as well as non-stealthy F-15EX fighters able to carry long-range hypersonic weapons , cargo aircraft reconfigured as flying arsenal planes , and a swarm of low-cost drones providing a distributed sensor network across a broad area of the battlespace, among other things. The entire Defense News piece on this wargame is worth reading in full , especially given growing concerns within the U.S. military, as well as among experts and observers, that a Chinese military intervention against Taiwan may be increasingly inevitable in the near term. The outcome of the scenario, which Yahoo News previously reported also involved a Chinese biological weapon attack against American forces across the Indo-Pacific region, is also notable in contrast to a similar 2018 tabletop simulation. “After the 2018 war game I distinctly remember one of our gurus of war gaming standing in front of the Air Force secretary and chief of staff, and telling them that we should never play this war game scenario [of a Chinese attack on Taiwan] again, because we know what is going to happen,” Lieutenant General Hinote had told Yahoo News earlier this year. “The definitive answer if the U.S. military doesn’t change course is that we’re going to lose fast. In that case, an American president would likely be presented with almost a fait accompli.” At the same time, Hinote’s comments about the F-35A are notable in their own right. “We wouldn’t even play the current version of the F-35,” Hinote told Defense News . “It wouldn’t be worth it,” he continued. “Every fighter that rolls off the line today is a fighter that we wouldn’t even bother putting into these scenarios.” Hinote further explained that survivability was only one factor in his assessment, though he did not name any particular existing or emerging threats that would limit the combat utility of current generation F-35As. China is notably developing and fielding an increasing number of advanced manned and unmanned aircraft , including growing numbers of J-20 stealth fighters , along with new weapons to go with them, as well as new ground-based air and missile defenses and associated sensors . Russia, another potential high-end adversary, is doing the same , albeit to a more limited degree . The Lieutenant General also cited the F-35As limited range in the context of an Indo-Pacific scenario as an issue, something we here at The War Zone have highlighted in the past . There have been discussions over the years about developing drop tanks or conformal fuel tanks that could work with all three F-35 variants to help extend their ranges. The Air Force, in particular, is exploring various future aerial refueling concepts that might help provide more survivable ways to extend the reach of American combat aircraft, especially stealthy types, in future conflicts, as well. Regardless of the specifics, the Lieutenant General’s comments are the latest in a string of what can be characterized, at best, as mixed-messaging from the Air Force about its plans for the F-35A going forward, as well as its view of the program, as a whole. The projected costs to operate and maintain F-35s of all variants across the U.S. military throughout their planned life cycles, which have only grown in recent years, are the core of these discussions. At present, the Air Force still publicly plans to buy 1,763 F-35As, in total, primarily to replace its F-16 Viper fighter jets . The F-35A assigned to the Air Force’s F-35A Lightning II Demonstration Team, at bottom, flies together with the F-16C assigned to the service’s F-16 Viper Demonstration Team, above., USAF As of 2019, the Pentagon said the estimated price tag for sustaining F-35A, B, and C operations across the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy was $1.196 trillion through 2070. This figure had been relayed to Congress in part to inform them that this figure had increased by $22 billion specifically due to growing costs associated with the Block 4 upgrades that Lieutenant General Hinote has now said are absolutely essential to ensuring the relevance of the Joint Strike Fighter in future high-end conflicts. As of February, the average cost-per-flight-hour to operate any of the three F-35 variants is $36,000, according to Lockheed Martin . The company says its goal remains to get that figure down to $25,000, which would put it closer to the cost-per-flight-hour of operating an F-16C/D . The unit costs to purchase new Joint Strike Fighters had been declining in recent years, as well, but those price figures look set to plateau, or even rise again , as new capabilities are added to future jets. In January, Will Roper, in an interview with Aviation Week that was published after he had left his post as Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, had said “I think it’s [the F-35A] a long way from being an affordable fighter that we can buy in bulk.” He also suggested that the Air Force’s planned purchases could be scaled back in favor of a revised mixture of capabilities that might include new, lower-end manned combat jets, such as advanced F-16 Viper variants , and greater numbers of lower-cost “loyal wingman” type unmanned aircraft. A Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie unmanned aircraft, at bottom left, a type the Air Force is experimenting with, including as part of the development of “loyal wingman” type drones, flies together with an F-35A, at center, and an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, at top right., USAF Then, in February, Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Brown confirmed that the Air Force had initiated a new study into possible changes to the composition of its future manned and unmanned combat aircraft fleets. At that time, he specifically mentioned the possibility of acquiring a new, “clean-sheet design” separate from the F-35 that could replace a portion of the service’s existing F-16s and cited F-35 operations and maintenance costs as a factor. “I want to moderate how much we’re using those aircraft,” Brown said, referring to the F-35A fleet. “You don’t drive your Ferrari to work every day, you only drive it on Sundays. This is our ‘high end’ [fighter], we want to make sure we don’t use it all for the low-end fight.” Those comments from Roper and Brown prompted a burst of criticism about the F-35 program, which has been a long-troubled saga that continues to face significant hurdles . Brown, the Air Force’s top uniformed official, did subsequently respond to the reporting surrounding his February remarks by saying that the F-35 was the “cornerstone of the U.S. Air Force fighter fleet.” F-35As, along with F-16Cs, on the runway at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska during an “Elephant Walk” readiness exercise in 2020., USAF Regardless, all of those comments were then followed by unusually critical remarks from Representative Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington State who is the present chair of the House Armed Services Committee, at an event that the Brookings Institution hosted on March 5. “[I want to] stop throwing money down that particular rathole,” Smith said, referring to the F-35 program. “What does the F-35 give us? And is there a way to cut our losses? Is there a way to not keep spending that much money for such a low capability because, as you know, the sustainment costs are brutal,” he continued. “What I’m going to try to do is figure out how we can get a mix of fighter-attack aircraft that’s the most cost-effective. And I am telling you right now a big part of that is finding something that doesn’t make us have to rely on the F-35 for the next 35 years.” Chairman Smith’s comments could point to a looming budget battle between the Pentagon and lawmakers over the F-35, broadly, beyond any reexamination of the program that the Air Force might be working through now. Though the service has repeatedly insisted that the NGAD program, as well as its acquisition of new F-15EXs, will not impact funding related to its F-35A fleet, it is Congress that ultimately decides how the defense budget shakes out. The potential for rising unit costs, in addition to how expensive the aircraft will be to operate and maintain for the foreseeable future, could have further impacts on discussions regarding the opportunity costs associated with continuing to buy more of any F-35 variant. From left to right, an F-15C Eagle, an F-15E Strike Eagle, and an F-15EX Eagle II., USAF Lieutenant General Hinote’s new comments about the F-35 in the context of last year’s wargame can only now call into question the utility of the service’s current F-35As in any potential major conflict, at least in the very near term. It’s not clear when the Air Force expects to complete the rollout of the full Block 4 upgrade package across its F-35A fleet, or when those updates might similarly make their way into the Marine Corps and Navy’s F-35B and F-35C fleets . “The current development process used by the F-35 JPO [Joint Program Office] and Lockheed Martin, that is supposed to provide new capabilities and updates in 6-month increments, is not working,” the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, reported bluntly at the close of the 2020 Fiscal Year, which came to an end on Sept. 30, 2020. “It is causing significant delays to planned schedules and results in poor software quality containing deficiencies.” A number of older F-35As will never be brought up to the Block 4 standard , either, relegating those jets to training and other non-combat duties. In addition, the F-35 program is still working to resolve a laundry list of deficiencies across all three Joint Strike Fighter Variants, 10 of which are Category 1 issues, the most severe type. These are things that could impact the operational effectiveness of the jets, or worse . This is the same number of Category 1 problems DOT&E said were still open by the close of the 2020 Fiscal Year. DOT&E said there were another 861 unresolved, but less severe deficiencies. Just this month, the F-35 Joint Program Office declined to elaborate on the exact nature of the 10 Category 1 deficiencies, six of which are classified, according to Defense News ‘ Valerie Insinna. It is also important to note that the U.S. military’s existing Joint Strike Fighter Fleets have seen improvements in their readiness rates in recent years, but those metrics continue to be a point of significant concern . Major problems persist with the cloud-based computer backend, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which is critical to the day-to-day operation of all F-35 variants and that you can read about more here . ALIS has been directly linked to poor readiness rates in the past. The U.S. military is already in process of replacing ALIS with a new system, called the Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN). Beyond that, any scaling back of the American end of the F-35 program could influence decisions that existing or potential foreign Joint Strike Fighter operators make, as well. There is already discussion in the United Kingdom about whether or not that country will upgrade its F-35Bs to the Block 4 standard , with the potential cost of doing so being a major factor. All told, the Air Force’s F-35 plans are very much in a new state of flux, which could also point to possible shakeups in Joint Strike Fighter plans elsewhere across the U.S. military. Lieutenant General Hinote’s position that it makes no sense to include the current generation of jets in high-end wargames can only add additional fuel to what is already a fiery debate among proponents and critics of this aircraft.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 9, 2021","Articulated Gun Pods Allowed Soviet Aircraft To Fire Backwards, Downwards, And Even Sideways","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Despite manufacturers’ and air forces’ efforts to do away with gun armament on aircraft in the earlier years of the Cold War, these weapons consistently proved their utility and never went away. It was the Soviet Union’s efforts to boost the firepower of its tactical jets that saw some of the most radical ways of putting more guns on aircraft, with some ingenious podded weapons capable of firing forward, backward, and even sideways. Paralleling developments in the United States, the Soviet Union’s first fighter jets after World War II were provided with guns as their main armament, before, in the late 1950s, guns began to be done away with altogether, leaving fighters armed with (not always reliable) guided missiles. But the lessons of close air combat in the Middle East and Southeast Asia during the 1960s showed that guns were still vital in many air combat situations. At the same time, the increasing importance of ground-attack missions also called for gun armament — typically of the heavier-hitting 23mm or 30mm caliber in the Soviet Union. An array of Soviet-designed guns, many of which appeared in podded form. The rotary weapons here are, from left to right: GShG-7,62, GSh-6-23, GSh-6-30, and the naval AK-630. , Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons By the early 1970s, a new generation of attack-optimized, gun-armed tactical fighter jets were beginning to be fielded by the Soviet Union, and to provide even greater firepower, development was also underway on a range of increasingly ingenious, and potentially devastating gun pods. In 1971, the Soviet launched production of a gun pod for tactical jets and assault helicopters that simply lifted the 23mm GSh-23 autocannon from the late-model MiG-21 Fishbe d and MiG-23 Flogger fighters and installed it in a “unified gun container,” Unifitsirovannyi Pushechnyi Konteyner in Russian, or UPK-23-250 to give it its full name. As well as the twin-barreled GSh-23 series cannon , the 10-foot 5-inch UPK-23-250 carries 250 rounds of ammunition and an electrical drive unit. More conventional than the pods that followed, the UPK-23-250 is aimed by simply directing the aircraft toward the target. Nevertheless, it remains in production and is now the most widely used gun pod in the Russian inventory, arming a wide range of tactical jets and rotorcraft. A UPK-23-250 gun pod at the ARMY-2018 arms exhibition at Kubinka outside Moscow., Boevaya mashina/Wikimedia Commons While the UPK-23-250 has proven reliable and hard-hitting, it has always been constrained by the requirement of the pilot to keep flying directly toward the target being attacked, putting their own aircraft at risk of counter-fire from the ground. One way to avoid this was a movable gun mount, allowing targets to be engaged ahead of the aircraft’s flight path (if firing forward) or behind the aircraft (if the pod was mounted firing to the rear). In the post-war era, at least, it seems that only the Soviet Union developed and fielded these types of weapons. The initial result was the “detachable movable gun mount,” or Syomnaya Podvizhnaya Pushechnaya Ustanovka, and the first of these to be fielded was the SPPU-22-01. This again uses the proven twin-barreled GSh-23 cannon, with 250 rounds of ammunition. The barrels are mounted on an articulated mechanism that angles them 23° downwards, with the flight computer ensuring that they continue to track the target as the aircraft maneuvers. The angle of the gun has to be selected prior to the mission and can’t be changed once in flight. An SPPU-22-01 carried by a Polish Air Force Su-22 Fitter ground-attack aircraft, showing the twin gun barrels angled downward., Łukasz Golowanow/Wikimedia Commons Weighing 705 pounds when loaded with ammunition, the 12-foot 6-inch SPPU-22-01 is primarily associated with the Su-17/Su-22 Fitter swing-wing ground-attack aircraft — it’s possible, in fact, that the ‘22’ in the pod’s designation refers to this platform. Both these gun pods feature twin-barreled cannons in which the firing action of one barrel operates the mechanism of the other. This reduces the wear compared to a single-barrel arrangement and also ensures a faster rate of fire. However, by the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union was working on rotary cannons, similar in principle to the classic American M61 Vulcan . While the U.S. gun fires 20mm ammunition, the Soviets always preferred larger calibers, either 23mm or 30mm. Six-barrel rotary cannons were produced in both these forms and armed the MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor and Su-24 Fencer strike aircraft (both 23mm), as well as the MiG-27 Flogger ground-attack aircraft (30mm). The six-barrel 30mm weapon also found its way into the AK-630 series of naval artillery for close-in air defense of warships and later provided the gun component for both the land-based Tunguska and Pantsir family, plus the naval Kortik/Kashtan combined gun/missile air defense systems. A video showing the Kortik combined gun/missile air defense system firing its 30mm guns onboard a Russian Navy warship: Meanwhile, the six-barrel 23mm gun, the GSh-6-23, was adapted for the most unusual Soviet gun pod yet, the SPPU-6, which entered production in 1976. This retains the articulated mounting proven in the SPPU-22-01, but this time, the entire gun assembly can be tilted 45° downwards, as well as 12° to the side, obviating the need for the aircraft to dive directly toward the target. While the previous pods with moveable guns were depressible only, this new weapon could move on two axes. A GSh-6-23M cannon from a MiG-31 interceptor, preserved as a museum exhibit., Vyacheslav Bukharov/Wikimedia Commons The 16-foot 7-inch low-drag pod also contains the gun control system and 400 rounds of ammunition. The total weight, when loaded, is over 1,150 pounds. Again, the pod can be mounted with the barrels facing forward, or to the rear of the aircraft, for strafing in the rear hemisphere. Furthermore, both “left-handed” and “right-handed” versions of the pod were produced, with the cannon mounted on different sides. The only aircraft so far confirmed to carry the pod is the Su-24, which can carry a maximum of three. An SPPU-6 preserved in an armaments museum, with the gun arranged to fire downward and to the side., via Twitter The SPPU-6 has been rarely seen in service, suggesting it may not have been as successful as hoped, but it can be imagined that, at the very least, it could have an enormous psychological effect on any troops unfortunate to be confronted by it. In effect, it would turn a Su-24 into a supersonic gunship , with trainable Gatling guns under the wings, one more under the belly, plus a similar weapon in the standard fixed installation under the fuselage. Having said that, the duration of fire provided by the pods, at least, is strictly limited. With a rate of fire of 4,000 to 6,000 rounds per minute, the ammunition in each pod would be exhausted in as little as four seconds. The SPPU-6 gun pod was intended for fixed-wing aircraft, and its considerable weight and recoil meant it was only suitable for larger attack aircraft. However, thought was also given to developing smaller, lighter pods specifically to arm assault helicopters. In the late 1970s the Vympel design bureau, famous for its work on air-to-air missiles , developed the GUV-8700, GUV standing for Gondola Universalnaya Vertolotnaya, or universal helicopter pod. The GUV-8700 is modular, with two different loading possibilities. In its simplest form, it contains a single 30mm Plamya-A grenade launcher with 300 grenades, adapting the popular infantry weapon for aircraft use. The other option contains one YakB-12.7 .50-caliber machine gun with 750 rounds and two GShG-7,62 .30-caliber machine guns with 1,800 rounds each. Each of these guns is a four-barreled rotary type, the GShG-7,62 being the equivalent of the iconic M134 Minigun . When loaded, the 9-foot 10-inch GUV pod weighs just under 1,000 pounds. One further Soviet gun pod from this period is known, this time in 30mm caliber, although it seems never to have progressed beyond the prototype stage. This was the SPPU-687 pod with a depressible mounting carrying a single-barrel GSh-30-1 cannon, of the same type used in the MiG-29 Fulcrum , Su-27 Flanker , and others. The pod reportedly carried 200 rounds, but little more is known of the project. A poor-quality, but rare image purportedly showing the 30mm SPPU-687 pod., via Twitter As long-term proponents of artillery , it’s perhaps little wonder that the Soviets went to such great efforts to turn their combat aircraft into “flying artillery,” too. Today, however, most of these weapons are rarely seen, with only the UPK-23-250 enduring. Exactly why they have generally fallen from favor is unclear, but the rapid removal of the MiG-27 and Su-17 from service soon after the Cold War ended couldn’t have helped. Overall, these weapons were likely somewhat limited in terms of accuracy and complex to operate. It could also be that the vibration of the larger gun pods had an adverse effect on aircraft airframes, and their fall from favor may also be related to changes in tactics, focusing on standoff range wherever possible. On the other hand, Russian tactical aircraft do still make considerable use of unguided bombs and rockets , which have limitations in terms of range and accuracy. Whatever the reason, these gun pods remain some of the most intriguing aircraft weapons developed in the post-war years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 23, 2021",Russian Gunboats Head To The Black Sea To Join Military Buildup Near Ukraine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Navy is sending 10 vessels, a mixture of landing craft and small gunboats, from its Caspian Sea Flotilla to the Black Sea. The deployment is ostensibly part of a larger series of readiness drills, but comes amid a continuing and worrisome Russian military buildup near the country’s borders with Ukraine. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or OSCE, has also said there has been a spike in GPS jamming in the region, which has impacted its ability to monitor the situation as part of an existing agreement between Russia and Ukraine. All of this only further fuels concerns that a significant escalation in the conflict between these two countries may be imminent. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the planned movement of the boats from the Caspian on Apr. 8, 2021. The press release said that the Caspian Flotilla vessels would join their Russian Navy counterparts in the Black Sea for exercises focused on testing their “readiness to repel sea and airborne assault forces.” Russia’s Southern Military District, which includes the Black Sea Fleet, as well as the Caspian Flotilla, had announced on Apr. 2 that there would be major upcoming readiness drills involving approximately 15,000 personnel. On Apr. 6, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said there would be other such exercises , which the Russians refer to as “control checks,” coming across the country, too. A Russian Navy Project 11770, or Serna class, landing craft., Russian Ministry of Defense Russia’s Ministry of Defense did not specifically identify what vessels are now set to head to the Black Sea, but its press release did include a picture of three Project 11770, or Serna class , landing craft. The release also used the phrase “artillery boats,” a term Russia applies to its Project 1204, or Shmel class , gunboats. The Caspian Flotilla has around six Serna class landing craft and four Shmel class gunboats, which would align perfectly with the statement that 10 vessels, in total, would take part in the forthcoming exercises. The 84-foot-long Sernas displace around 100 tons with a full combat load and are designed to carry a single T-72/T-90-series or T-80-series main battle tank, two BTR-80-series wheeled armored vehicles, or up to 92 troops or 50 tons of other cargo. They have a range of approximately 600 nautical miles when traveling at a cruising speed of 12 knots, or around 100 nautical miles at their top speed of 30 knots. The Black Sea is only around 700 miles across, east to west, at its longest. The distance between Russia and Ukraine across the Sea of Azov, just to the north of the Black Sea and the site of a major skirmish between Ukrainian and Russian forces in 2018, is under 200 miles. The approximately 71-ton displacement Shmels have a primary armament consisting of a 76mm D-56TS gun in a bow turret derived from the one on the PT-76 light tank . They also have two 25mm cannons in a turret at the stern, as well as provisions for various machine guns and automatic grenade launchers. They can also have a single 17-tube 140mm BM-14-17 rocket launcher, capable of bombarding targets close to shore, and can carry naval mines, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8TAzQITLjAU Though Russian officials have said that this deployment is part of the recently announced “control checks,” it’s hard not to see it as part of a broader signal the Kremlin is sending to its counterparts in Kyiv. These 10 vessels are just part of a massive stream of military assets, including huge trainloads of tanks, other armored vehicles, artillery, air defense assets, and other military equipment, that have been flowing into southwestern Russia for nearly two weeks now, as you can read more about here . A new Russian military outpost with dozens of tanks and other vehicles has also now appeared in the country’s Voronezh Oblast. Transport-erector-launchers associated with the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile and the Iskander-K ground-launched cruise missile have been spotted in Voronezh, as well. This region sits right on the border with Ukraine. The statement about the deployment of the Caspian Flotilla vessels coincided with Ukraine announcing its own snap naval drills in the Black Sea. CNN has now reported that the U.S. Navy may be looking to deploy its own warships into that body of water in a show of force, as well. Yesterday, the U.S. Air Force also sent two B-1B bombers from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota on a long-range, round-trip mission to the Aegean Sea, just south of the waterway leading into the Black Sea. The ostensible reason for these sorties was to “showcase the U.S. commitment to European security,” which would seem to be related, at least in part, to the situation developing along the Russia-Ukraine border. It’s also worth noting that the Air Force previously disclosed that a mission that B-1Bs conducted in the Black Sea region last year effectively saw those aircraft train to decapitate Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. With regards to the newly announced deployment of additional naval assets, the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet does already have more robust amphibious warfare and other light boat capabilities, as well as larger warships and submarines . However, the 10 Caspian Flotilla vessels would still provide useful additional amphibious landing and inshore fire support capacity during any actual combat operations. It’s also worth noting that Russia has conducted exercises in the region, including in and around the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, in the past, which did not presage new rounds of major fighting. This has included dramatic amphibious landing drills , among other things. Since 2014, the government in Kyiv has been fighting separatists in eastern parts of the country known collectively as the Donbass. Though ostensibly local, these groups have significant ties to Russian intelligence agencies and are actively supported by actual Russian military units. At the same time, there is a growing consensus, among foreign governments, as well as experts and observers, that aspects of this particular situation do more strongly point to an impending crisis of some kind. In a press conference on Apr. 7, top Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby specifically said that the U.S. government had a “concern” about what he described as “the deteriorating security situation resulting from increased Russian Federation activity along the Ukrainian border.” “The rapid and building presence of Russian forces along that border and in Crimea certainly are not conducive to creating an air of stability, you know – you know, in – in Ukraine,” he continued. “As I said yesterday, it’s not completely clear what the Russians are doing there, we’d like to understand that more, and that uncertainty is obviously not contributing to a more stable, more secure situation.” Online flight tracking software has shown a flurry of aerial intelligence-gathering activity on the part of the U.S. military, as well as the United Kingdom, in the region in recent weeks, but it’s unclear what they may have been able to glean about the troop buildup. U.S. Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, as well as RC-135V/W Rivet Joint spy planes, have been observed flying in the region. U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes and U.K. Royal Air Force Rivet Joints, have been spotted, as well. “I’m not going to get into intelligence assessments here from the podium,” Kirby told reporters yesterday. As already noted, however, OSCE has also reported increased GPS jamming in the region, something that has been a factor, on various levels , for years now and is almost universally linked to Russian forces . This has had a major impact on its ability to monitor developments along the de facto boundary, or “line of contact,” between separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and the rest of the country. This international organization has a formal mandate to conduct surveillance of military activities in this region under the Minsk Protocol, as well as the subsequent Minsk II deal, which Russia and Ukraine first agreed to in 2014 and that is aimed at ultimately resolving the ongoing conflict diplomatically. “On the evening of 6 April, an SMM [Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine] long-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was unable to take off from its base … to conduct regular monitoring of areas on both sides of the contact line, due to dual GPS signal interference assessed as caused by jamming,” according to an OSCE release on Apr. 7. “This is the first time such interference has prevented a take-off since the Mission launched long-range UAV operations in October 2014.” An OSCE map giving a good general view of the de facto boundary between areas of eastern Ukraine under separatist control and the rest of the country. , OSCE “Since 21 March 2021, the SMM’s long-range UAVs have been experiencing increased levels of GPS signal interference on take-off and landing, affecting both of their GPS receivers,” the statement continued. “Over the last two months, 62.5 percent [sic] of SMM long-range UAV flights encountered GPS signal interference, and on 75 percent [sic] of the affected flights, it occurred more than once.” For its part, Russia has begun to actively criticize Ukraine, as well as NATO, accusing them of being the ones to inflame the situation. This kind of rhetorical deflection is a tactic that the Kremlin has been observed employing to varying degrees, often through misinformation and disinformation , in the past and is often meant to distract from its own malign activities. “We are closely watching the situation. Concrete measures will be taken depending on how it develops,” Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Russian Security Council Patrushev, told Russia’s Kommersant newspaper in an interview published on Apr 7. “Russia is closely monitoring the situation in Donbass, based on its development, specific measures will be taken.” “I support the assessments that also exist inside Ukraine that the beginning of hostilities is the beginning of the end of Ukraine,” Dmitry Kozak, Deputy Chief of Staff to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said today . He added that the Russian military would come to the defense of Russian citizens in Eastern Ukraine, a reference to separatists groups in Ukraine, in the event of a significant surge in fighting, “depending on the scale of the fire.” Despite reports of the recent arrival of military aid from the United States, the Pentagon told The War Zone flatly that no emergency assistance of any kind has been provided to Ukraine since the troop buildup began. The Department of Defense directed further questions about previously scheduled deliveries of any military or internal security-related equipment, or related assistance, to the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. At the time of writing, we are still waiting for responses to our queries from both of those entities. The U.S. government did facilitate the delivery of a shipment of Humvees and very small boats to Ukraine’s military in January. As for what may be driving the current situation, a water shortage in Crimea has reached crisis proportions in recent months. Ukraine put dams in place to block the supply of water to the Peninsula after Russian forces took control of it in 2014, but a confluence of factors has resulted in Crimean reservoirs running dry, creating immense hardships for residents. Absent some kind of agreement with Ukraine, which has said it will not ever supply water to Crimea until it comes back under its control, Russia would have to seize a substantial chunk of territory to gain physical access to natural sources of fresh water. Russia’s President Putin has also been under greater than usual political pressure domestically, as well as on the world stage, in recent months, which could be another factor. The Russian leader has faced particular scrutiny over the imprisonment of long-time critic and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, who recently went on hunger strike and is now said to be in worryingly poor health . Navalny was arrested immediately upon his return to Russia in January on charges he and his lawyers say politically motivated. He had previously been in Germany, where he received treatment after an attempted assassination by Russian government operatives. However the situation on the Russia-Ukraine border continues to evolve now, the steady influx of additional forces, which now included naval assets, together with the rhetoric emanating from the Kremlin, continues to point more and more toward at least major crisis, if not a larger conflagration.

Adam Kehoe,"Updated on Apr 4, 2021",U.S. And Chinese Carrier Groups Mass In The South China Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tensions between China and its regional neighbors in the South China and Philippine Seas increased markedly this week. Naval exercises by both the United States and China have massed an unusual number of warships in the South China Sea at a time of renewed diplomatic friction as concerns over China’s territorial ambitions grow. The uptick began late last week. The War Zon e reported that China’s Liaoning Carrier Strike Group (CSG) maneuvered through the strategic Miyako Strait on Sunday, just southwest of Okinawa. Since then, a separate point of tension between China and the Philippines over a mass of fishing vessels identified as part of China’s People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM) led to a series of heated diplomatic exchanges between Manila and Beijing. Open-source intelligence analysts tracked the movements of the Liaoning carrier strike group this week as it appeared to traverse the Luzon strait, the body of water that, along with the Bohai Channel, separates the Philippines and Taiwan. This crucially strategic area is also the primary boundary between the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea and connects the greater Pacific to the northern reaches of the South China Sea. As such, this area is of intense reconnaissance interest to all stakeholders in the region. The United States military paid particularly close attention to these waters in July last year, regularly flying intelligence-gathering planes such as the EP-3E Aries II and RC-135V/W Rivet Joint into the area. Since then, the surveillance flights have continued, often spiking at times when there is heavy Chinese naval activity in the area. The Liaoning CSG maneuvers around the strait were closely observed by Japan and the United States. Analysts identified a U.S. Navy Alreigh Burke class destroyer shadowing the group, as it headed west towards the South China Sea: This striking shot captured U.S. Navy Cmdr. Robert J. Briggs and Cmdr. Richard D. Slye as they monitored the Liaoning, just thousands of feet away , from the bridge wings of the USS Mustin earlier in the week on April 4 . USN By April 10th, analysts flagged one Type 055 Renhai class missile destroyer and one Type 052D Luyang class destroyer splitting from the group and heading north towards the Taiwan strait: Imagery derived from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite identified an unusually large number of military vessels in the South China Sea on Saturday: The increased number of ships was not just due to the Chinese naval exercise alone. Yesterday the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group and the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) conducted a coordinated exercise in the South China Sea. The TRCSG consists of the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 11, the Ticonderoga -class guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill (CG 52), Destroyer Squadron 23, and the Arleigh Burke -class guided-missile destroyer USS Russell (DDG 59). The USS Makin Island’s group also consisted of amphibious assault ships the USS Somerset and USS San Diego. A cluster of vessels was spotted via satellite imagery just east of Taiwan’s Pratas Islands. In recent years, Pratas Island has been of increasing concern to observers of the South China Sea. Writing for The Diplomat , analyst Yoshiyuki Ogasawara has focused on the Pratas Islands as a potential target of China’s geopolitical ambitions as it approaches the centennial anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party on July 23 this year. Ogasawara argues that capturing the island could be a way for China to demonstrate progress towards its goal of reunifying Taiwan without sparking a wider conflict. The small island located between China, Taiwan, and the Philippines has a strategic vantage on the South China Sea. Its small size and flat geography make it difficult to defend. According to Ogasawara, the island typically has no permanent residents but has seen a quiet build-up of a garrison of about 500 Taiwanese Marines. Last year Taiwanese F-16s began flying patrols with live Harpoon anti-ship missiles in an effort to deter China’s interest in potentially capturing the island. U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidons have done the same . Chinese military exercises apparently focused on capturing the island were reported in May last year. Pratas Island, Google Earth Pratas island is quite small, but it includes an airstrip and some accommodations. , Google Earth The area has also recently seen an increase in drone incursions. On Wednesday, Taiwanese official Ocean Affairs Council Chair Lee Chung-wei addressed the drone issue, describing them as circling the island . He declared a willingness to shoot them down, stating “if we need to open fire, we will open fire.” Additionally, China has recently invested heavily in coastal bases, such as a massive new helicopter base directly across the strait of Taiwan that could prove essential to a major offensive against the island. Meanwhile, the week saw a near-constant stream of Chinese overflights of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone. According to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense , there have been 46 overflights across the southwestern portion of the Taiwan Strait. These flights have included as many as fifteen People’s Liberation Army aircraft at one time, including 8 J-10 and 4 J-16 fighter aircraft in one incident. Sample photos of J-10s and J-16s involved in the flights., Taiwan MoD Chart showing the approximate tracks of the Chinese aircraft., Taiwan MoD China and the Philippines also appeared to deepen their dispute over more than two hundred Chinese vessels occupying an area in the West Philippines Sea known as Whitsun Reef. On April 5th, the Chinese embassy in the Philippines issued a statement expressing that it is “completely normal for Chinese fishing vessels to fish in the waters and take shelter near the reef during rough sea conditions.” On Thursday, the U.S. State Department provided a readout stating that Secretary of State Blinken had spoken with his Philippine counterpart Teodoro Locsin, Jr. about the “massing of PRC maritime military vessels.” Blinken additionally “reaffirmed the applicability of the 1951 U.S.-Philippine Mutual Defense Treaty to the South China Sea.” China’s foreign minister spokesman Zhao Lijian responded by saying that the United States should stop “inciting quarrels and sowing discord.” Compounding matters, a news team from the Philippines’ ABS-CBN described Chinese Coast Guard Vessels “pursuing” Philipine fishing vessels on Friday. The War Zone recently covered the incident , including the apparent new role for China’s stealthy catamaran fast-attack missile craft in tense South China Sea waters. Earlier in the year, China adopted a new law that some have claimed violates the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that permits the Chinese Coast Guard to fire on foreign vessels in some circumstances. The legal change added ongoing concern about China’s growing network of artificial outposts through the South China Sea. Last month, Australia, India, Japan, and the United States issued a joint statement as part of the so-called “quadrilateral security dialogue” or “Quad,” affirming each country’s commitment to upholding the “rules-based maritime order in the East and South China Seas.” Security concerns and the future of the Quad alliance will almost certainly be a key subject in upcoming talks between Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and President Biden on April 16th. In the coming weeks, it will be crucial to see if regional stakeholders are able to manage these tensions. Negotiations and inter-alliance relationships, especially within the emerging Quad, will be crucial to creating an effective counterbalance to the increasingly capable and assertive Chinese military’s operations in the region. The War Zone will continue to watch and report developments in the East and South China Seas.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 4, 2020",Meet South Korea’s New KF-21 “Hawk” Indigenous Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea has rolled out the first prototype of its next-generation indigenous fighter , previously referred to as the KF-X, and officially named it the KF-21 Boramae, meaning hawk in Korean. The jet, South Korea’s most ambitious yet, is expected to fly next year and the country’s president has confirmed a demanding schedule to complete the development program for the initial version of the aircraft by 2026. The Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) is expected to induct 40 KF-21s by 2028 and have the full fleet of 120 aircraft deployed by 2032. The aircraft are urgently required to replace aging F-4E Phantom II and F-5E/F Tiger II fighters and are intended to complement F-35A stealth fighters —60 of which are being procured from the United States—as well as older F-15K Slam Eagle and F-16C/D aircraft. A ROKAF pilot disembarks the first prototype KF-21 at today’s ceremony in Sacheon., MBC News Screencap The rollout ceremony took place today at the Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) facilities in Sacheon, South Gyeongsang province, and saw an address by President Moon Jae In. He heralded “a new era of self-defense,” and “a historic milestone in the development of [South Korea’s] aviation industry. Moon also set a goal for South Korea to become the world’s seventh-biggest aviation industrial power by the 2030s. Full-scale development work on what was then known as the KF-X began in 2015 and in 2019 South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), which manages defense procurement, announced the go-ahead for the construction of a prototype. Last September, KAI announced that the final assembly of the prototype fighter was underway, mating the fuselage sections and wings. There are plans for four single-seat and two twin-seat prototypes, each of which will be powered by a pair of U.S.-supplied General Electric F414-GE-400K engines. The manufacturer was selected in 2016 to supply 240 F414 production engines plus spares program. Variants of this turbofan are also found in the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler , and Sweden’s JAS 39E/F Gripen , and are also planned to power the Indian Tejas Mk 2 . Seoul expects to issue its first KF-21 production contract in 2024, leading to deliveries of the Block 1 variant in 2026. Block 1 will offer air-to-air capability only, while Block 2 will be cleared for air-to-ground missions. A pilot salutes from the cockpit of the prototype KF-21., MBC News Screencap While developing and producing an indigenous multi-role fighter is a significant challenge, KAI has amassed plenty of experience in producing high-end military aircraft, including the supersonic FA-50 light combat aircraft used by the ROKAF and exported. Korean industry was also involved in a local production of the Block 52 F-16C/D multi-role fighter for the ROKAF. The KF-21 does exhibit some low-observable features, adopting the canted twin tails, fuselage shaping, and edge alignment, among other features, established by the F-22 and F-35. However, it does not provide the kind of all-aspect stealth offered by these U.S. fighters. Instead, the twin-engine jet is intended to fill the gap between the F-35 and the F-16, in terms of capabilities, but should be cheaper overall than the F-35, the sustainment cost of which is a cause for concern in the United States and elsewhere . The KF-21’s weapons will be carried externally, on six under-wing and four under-fuselage hardpoints. The flags of South Korea and Indonesia appear on the forward fuselage of the KF-21., MBC News Screencap Once the jet is in service — around 2026 — work is expected to commence on a more advanced derivative, featuring internal weapons carriage, for example. In its initial form, the KF-21 is expected to have a radar cross-section equivalent to the Eurofighter Typhoon , but successive upgrades should reduce this much further. Even the fighter flying into combat without weapons in its most survivable state could be an important sensor node for other fighter aircraft of lesser capabilities. Under a project worth a total of $7.9 billion, South Korea is developing the KF-21 together with Indonesia, which agreed to pay 20 percent of development costs and plans to acquire 50 examples for its own air force . In the past, Indonesia was behind on payments for the program and there were suggestions that its status in the program could be under threat . However, Indonesia’s Minister of Defense Prabowo Subianto attended today’s rollout ceremony and Korean officials confirmed that the cooperation plans remained in place. The plan is to make the aircraft available for export to other countries, too. All in all, the KF-21 could be a very attractive proposition for foreign customers. The aircraft has been designed to have better kinematic performance than an F-16C and will feature an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, produced by South Korea’s Hanwha Systems, as well as advanced weapons options, including the ramjet-powered Meteor air-to-air missile provided by Europe’s MBDA. Flight tests of a demonstrator radar have already begun using a Boeing 737 testbed. Concept artwork of a KF-X armed with four semi-recessed Meteors, IRIS-T self-defense missiles, and a pair of JDAMs., MBDA Weapons have already been selected for the Block 2 version of the KF-21. These comprise the GBU-12 Paveway II , GBU-31/38 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), GBU-54/56 Laser JDAM , GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb I , and the CBU‐105 Wind Corrected Munitions Dispense r (WCMD). All these stores are currently in ROKAF service which should accelerate the integration process. The new fighter jet is expected to carry a payload of up to 16,975 pounds, a maximum takeoff weight of 56,400 pounds. It is expected to achieve a top speed of around 1,400 miles per hour (approximately Mach 1.83) and have a range of 1,800 miles. Of course, these are brochure numbers, so we will have to wait and see how it plays out in reality once the aircraft is flight tested. Its range, in particular, would be far less during actual combat operations. While there are a number of other, similar advanced fighter projects with stealthy ambitions are underway, including in Europe , India , Japan , Turkey , and the United Kingdom , the Boramae will be the first to fly. KAI may have traded some advanced capabilities for a more rapid development path for its fighter design, but that could pay off in the long run if the KF-21 secures export orders. The KF-21 should play a major role in furthering South Korea’s indigenous defense capabilities. In all, 65 percent of components are being made in South Korea. Importantly, KAI is developing critical avionics, including the mission and flight-control computers. Korean industry is also responsible for the AESA radar, electronic warfare equipment, infrared search and track sensor, and electro-optical targeting pod. Mass production of the KF-21 will also create 10,000 new jobs, according to President Moon. This is in addition to 12,000 jobs involved in the project between 2016 and 2020. The first prototype during its final assembly at KAI. , KAI Aside from its importance to the South Korean industry, the KF-21 will further bolster the ROKAF’s qualitative edge as it faces a growing military threat from a nuclear-armed North Korea. Already, there is a huge mismatch between the ROKAF and the Korean People’s Air Force (KPAF) in North Korea. While the most modern fighter jets in the KPAF inventory are a relatively small number of late Cold War-vintage MiG-29 Fulcrums , the ROKAF is spearheaded by F-35As , more than two dozen of which have now been delivered to Cheongju Air Base, where the first examples arrived in March 2019. South Korea can also call upon 60 multi-role F-15K Slam Eagles, advanced versions of the F-15E Strike Eagle , and the survivors of 180 F-16C/Ds originally delivered. Seoul is now in the process of upgrading 134 of its Vipers to the F-16V standard , with new avionics including an AESA radar. Future plans also envisage orders for short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B variants of the Lightning II, which would equip its next amphibious assault ships . As well as highly capable frontline fighters, the ROKAF has a range of important force multipliers that would be expected to support the KF-21 in combat. These include Boeing E-737 Peace Eye airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, otherwise known as the E-7 Wedgetail , which can keep watch over North Korea’s airspace. There are also Raytheon RC-800 intelligence-gathering aircraft that are equipped for signals intelligence, surveillance, and tactical reconnaissance. Additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capacity is provided by specially configured Dassault Falcon 2000EX aircraft adapted for the role by L3 Communications Integrated Systems. These platforms would help provide the KF-21, and other fighters, with real-time data on North Korean air, land, and sea threats. KBS News Screencap Were the two countries to go to war, the KPAF would still be able to put up significant numbers of admittedly obsolete aircraft but would instead rely upon its huge advantage in artillery and mobile missile launchers. In terms of non-conventional weapons, North Korea can call upon an expanding nuclear arsenal as well as chemical , and potentially biological, weapons. The Korean People’s Army also has significant numbers of fixed and mobile surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery, which would need to be suppressed during a large-scale conflict. With this in mind, the Block 2 version of the KF-21 with air-to-ground capability will likely be of particular importance to the ROKAF. With its KF-21 Boramae, South Korea has taken a different route to field an indigenous new-generation multi-role fighter, rapidly, and the program has made impressive progress so far. The countdown to its first flight is now on. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Air Force Munitions Air-To-Air Fighters Meteor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 28, 2021",Turkey Confirms U.S. Destroyers Are Headed For The Black Sea Amid Russia-Ukraine Crisis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkish authorities have confirmed that two U.S. Navy warships are set to head into the Black Sea soon. There is no official word yet on which vessels will heading into that body of water, but there are reports that the Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS Donald Cook and USS Roosevelt are the ships in question. All of this comes as the Russian military continues to pour forces, including additional naval assets , into the southwestern portion of the country along the border with Ukraine , fueling fears that a new crisis between Moscow and Kyiv, or worse, might be about to erupt. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry disclosed today that it had received a formal notice about the impending transit of the two warships from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea via the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits, both of which are Turkish territorial waters. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention , countries that do not have a Black Sea coastline must give advance notice about the deployment of naval vessels in and out of that body of water. That agreement also places restrictions on how many warships countries outside of the region can have there at once, via limits on the total displaced tonnage of the vessels, and how long these deployments can last. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Roosevelt ., USN “A notice was sent to us 15 days ago via diplomatic channels that two U.S. warships would pass to the Black Sea in line with the Montreux Convention,” the Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Apr. 9, 2021, according to Reuters . “The ships will remain in the Black Sea until May 4.” CNN had reported on Apr. 8 that the Navy was considering sending warships into the Black Sea sometime in the coming weeks. The U.S. Navy has declined to confirm what warships are now headed into the Black Sea or what they will do once they arrive there. “U.S. Navy ships maintain a regular presence in the Black Sea and abide by the Montreux Convention. As a matter of policy, we do not discuss future operations or ship schedules,” Navy Lieutenant Commander Matthew Comer, a spokesperson for U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVFOREUR-AF) and U.S. 6th Fleet, told The War Zone . Turkish television channel NTV did report , citing sources within the country’s Foreign Ministry, that the USS Donald Cook and USS Roosevelt were the ships now bound for the Black Sea. These two destroyers are both forward-deployed in Europe, operating from Naval Station Rota in Spain. They have each deployed to the Black Sea on multiple occasions in the past, with the Donald Cook having been in that body of water as recently as February. If it is true that these are the ships the U.S. Navy is sending, it’s hard not to see their return in the current context as, at least in part, a signal aimed at Russia. Having a pair of Burkes in the Black Sea would offer additional assets to help monitor Russian activity and be in a position to better respond to various contingencies if they were to suddenly emerge. At the same time, it’s worth pointing that any major conflict involving both Russia and the United States in this region would turn the Black Sea into an anti-ship missile shooting gallery , where Russian forces would have a major advantage, at least initially. Russia’s anti-ship, as well as other anti-access and aerial denial capabilities, in the region have grown since it seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. The Kremlin has since deployed significant numbers of additional combat aircraft, as well as surface-to-air and ground-based anti-ship missile units to bases there. This is in addition to the modernized Black Sea Fleet that largely calls Crimea home. These vessels are packed with a wide array of anti-ship missiles, too. Its Kilo class diesel-electric submarines are also a major threat to American warships in the enclosed body of water. When Donald Cook , together with the USS Porter , another Arleigh Burke class destroyer forward-deployed in Spain, arrived in the Black Sea earlier this year, they were greeted by an aggressive Russian response . This included being buzzed by an Su-24 Fencer combat jet and nearby drills involving Su-30SM Flankers armed with anti-ship missiles and coastal defense missile batteries in Crimea. This reality is almost certainly one of the reasons why Navy destroyers based in Spain have been equipped with specialized electronic warfare systems that are, at least in part, designed to defend against anti-ship missiles. You can read more about the AN/SLQ-62 Transportable Electronic Warfare Module-Speed To Fleet (TEWM-STF) system here . These ships have other special modifications, as well, including the SeaRAM point defense systems. It’s also interesting to note that 15 days ago, when Turkey said the U.S. government formally notified it of its latest plans to send warships into the Black Sea, would be March 25, two days after the conclusion of a major Russian military exercise in the southwestern portion of the country. Significant numbers of troops that had taken part in those drills then stayed in the area afterward, reportedly drawing the attention and concern of U.S. officials. USS Donald Cook during an SM-2 missile-firing drill. Note the SeaRAM system on the rear pedestal. This modification is unique to U.S. destroyers forward-deployed to Rota, Spain., USN In addition, On March 26, four Ukrainian soldiers were killed in a recent spike in fighting between that country’s military and separatists who occupy areas in the eastern portion of the country that is known collectively as the Donbass. Those groups, who have been fighting the government in Kyiv since 2014, have significant ties to Russian intelligence agencies and receive direct support from actual elements of the Russian military. By March 27, there were clear indications that Russia was conducting a major military buildup along its borders with Ukraine. Russian authorities have since confirmed these deployments, which are still ongoing , though they claim they are part of series of readiness drills across the country. On March 30, The New York Times reported that U.S. European Command (EUCOM) had raised an internal alert level regarding the security situation in Ukraine from “possible crisis” to “potential imminent crisis.” The latter level was reported to be the most serious on the watch list’s scale. “The fact that they [the Russians] haven’t been transparent is only causing more instability, more insecurity” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said today. “We’re watching this very very carefully.” “It is a big build-up… the biggest one that we’ve seen since 2014,” he continued. “We don’t think that the Russian have been totally transparent about what they’re doing.” What exactly might be driving the current Russian military buildup near Ukraine remains murky, whether or not an actual escalation in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is indeed in the offing. A water crisis in Crimea , as well as domestic political issues in Russia, especially surrounding the imprisonment and worryingly poor health of Alexei Navalny , a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and anti-corruption activist , appear to be among the factors. The impending arrival of U.S. Navy warships in the Black Sea is all but certain to draw a response of some kind from the Russian government. Russian officials have already begun to blame NATO, as well as Ukraine, for the spike in tensions in the region. This kind of rhetoric reflects misinformation and disinformation tactics the Kremlin has regularly employed in the past to deflect and distract from its own malign activities. How all of this might impact the continued evolution of the situation on the Ukraine-Russia border remains to be seen.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Apr 11, 2021",Navy Labs To Reopen The Once Taboo Case On Nuclear Cold Fusion,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Researchers at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division have reopened the case on low-energy nuclear reactions, or LENRs, largely unexplained phenomena that are at the core of theories about “cold fusion.” Five different government-funded laboratories under the control of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, and National Institutes of Standards and Technology will conduct experiments in an attempt to once and for all settle the debate over this little-understood and highly controversial topic. Despite the controversy and stigma associated with LENR, many experts across the U.S. military believe that the science behind them is sound, and if working technologies can someday be developed, it could transform military operations to an extent not seen in over a century. LENRs are a theory that attempts to explain results some scientists have observed over the last several decades which seem to indicate a unique type of anomalous energy production stemming from a certain class of non-fusion nuclear reactions which have been found to occur at or near room temperature. Interest in LENRs and so-called “cold fusion” dates back to the early 20th century, when scientists encountered anomalous heat effects produced by known chemical processes. These remained unexplained for decades. One of the biggest controversies in the field then came in 1989 when chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann announced they had successfully reached a “sustained nuclear fusion reaction” at room temperature. Craters on the surface of a sample of palladium which may have resulted from low-energy nuclear reactions., SPAWAR/U.S. Navy Scientists around the world began examining their data, and, needless to say, not all agreed with Fleischmann’s and Pons’s conclusions. Some believed low-temperature fusion reactions were indeed occurring, others believed some type of misunderstood chemical reaction was taking place, while others still thought the two chemists had observed some new type of phenomenon altogether. One scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) even went so far as to accuse the duo of fraud in the Boston Herald . No other laboratory was able to replicate their results, and Fleischmann and Pons eventually retracted their conclusions. Boston Herald/New Energy Times Still, enough researchers believe there is at least something to LENRs and that the topic is worth a serious second look. The 2016 Scientific American guest blog “ It’s Not Cold Fusion… But It’s Something ” claims that “Hidden in the confusion are many scientific reports, some of them published in respectable peer-reviewed journals, showing a wide variety of experimental evidence” for LENRs, “including transmutations of elements.” The same article states that studies have also shown that LENRs “can produce local surface temperatures of 4,000-5,000 K and boil metals (palladium, nickel and tungsten) in small numbers of scattered microscopic sites on the surfaces of laboratory devices.” A more recent theory suggests that LENR reactions have nothing to do with fusion at all, and instead are produced by weak interaction and are perfectly consistent with known physics. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division seeks to get to the bottom of the LENR phenomenon with an honest look at the available data and by conducting new experiments. NSWC Indian Head specializes in energetics, a branch of research involving the development and testing of explosives, propellants, pyrotechnics, fuels, and other reactive materials as they pertain to propulsion and weaponry. Oliver Barham, a project manager at NSWC Indian Head, says that despite past controversies surrounding LENRs, the laboratory believes the science behind these little-understood reactions is worth a second look . “I’m not as worried about looking into something that is considered controversial as long as there’s good science there,” Barham told IEEE.org . “The whole point of our effort is we want to be doing good science. We’re not out to prove or disprove anything, we’re out to assemble a team of scientists who want to take it seriously.” Barham says the lab will serve as an “honest broker” that will reexamine decades’ worth of data collected by the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Carl Gotzmer, Indian Head’s Chief Scientist, says that even mentioning “cold fusion” was once considered a “career ender,” but since Indian Head is a government-funded laboratory, they have a bit more freedom to pursue such a controversial topic if there is a possibility of rewarding scientific results. Carl Gotzmer (left) and Oliver Barham, NSWC Indian Head The Department of Defense (DOD), as a whole, has been interested in LENR research for some time. Previously, the Navy’s LENR research was conducted at Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) Systems Center – Pacific. According to LENR subject matter expert and author Steven Krivit, SPAWAR “produced some of the most interesting experiments and observations in the field and published more LENR papers in mainstream journals than any U.S. LENR group.” SPAWAR’s LENR research was terminated in 2011 . Just two years prior, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) published a report on LENR research which stated that based on the available scientific data from around the world, “nuclear reactions may be occurring under conditions not previously believed possible.” The report states that Italy and Japan lead international research on the topic, and that the stigma associated with the topic in the United States means that most of the information surrounding LENR is presented at international conferences, with U.S. data in the hands of foreign scientists. DIA ultimately concluded in 2009 that “if nuclear reactions in LENR experiments are real and controllable, whoever produces the first commercialized LENR power source could revolutionize energy production and storage for the future” and that “the potential applications of this phenomenon, if commercialized, are unlimited.” The report goes on to state that LENR could lead to batteries that last for decades, revolutionizing power for sensors and military operations in remote areas and/or space, and that “the military potential of such high-energy-density power sources is enormous,” potentially leading to “the greatest transformation of the battlefield for U.S. forces since the transition from horsepower to gasoline power.” New forms of energy production and storage are of key interest to the DOD. Energy and fuel needs are one of the most significant logistical challenges for military operations in remote locations or areas of conflict where establishing supply chain infrastructure can be a major challenge. The DOD is looking at a variety of new forms of energy production, from modular solar energy units , developing miniaturized nuclear reactors , and even beaming solar energy down to the battlefield from satellites in space. In addition, DOD-associated contractors have been touting progress in nuclear fusion technologies in recent years, as have America’s peer-state rivals . Clearly, energy has become one of the most pressing topics of defense research and development, and a looming energy revolution has the potential to upset the global power balance in terms of nations’ abilities to project their power in conflict zones and remote, contested areas. According to a story in the September 2018 issue of the U.S. Naval Institute’s Proceeding magazine, LENR research could open up a wide range of new technologies including near-room-temperature superconductors, and new energy-dense power sources that could enable “near-indefinite loiter times” and “facilitate a wide range of subsurface swarm tactics for offensive, defensive, reconnaissance, decoy, or diversionary purposes.” The publication goes on to list several other potentially revolutionary applications for LENR energy sources – if they are ever developed: Other options abound. LENRs could power and provide operational flexibility for undersea surveillance and could provide increased capability for acoustic tomography. Towed sonar systems could cut their tethers, becoming power-independent of their host ships, able to operate at greater distances to prosecute contacts. Logistics and resupply change dramatically when refueling becomes almost an afterthought. Autonomous power from LENRs could provide the opportunity to explore intermittent use of active acoustics to supplement passive acoustic sensing. It could power next-generation listening posts for signals intelligence applications or provide a way to create ubiquitous sensor nets to monitor the maritime domain. In near-Earth orbit, applications could include onboard power, space propulsion, and sustained orbital repositioning capability. Space propulsion thrust requires reaction mass, but a LENR-based system could produce extended thrust at high efficiencies by separating the energy source from the propellant mass. The author, listed in the publication as an employee of Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), writes that “failure to thoroughly evaluate and develop LENR and its by-products risks missing a window of opportunity for establishing an early foothold and first-mover advantage in a disruptive technology with direct value to the Navy, as well as military, strategic and geopolitical implications. Radical innovations invariably fall outside existing development efforts. Their unfamiliarity can cause strong, sustained, systemic pushback. The Navy has encountered this pushback on many occasions: when steam displaced sail, when coal gave way to oil, and oil to diesel electric; when wooden ships gave way to ironclads, battleships gave way to aircraft carriers, and when conventional forms of propulsion yielded to nuclear.” That wording would seem to eerily echo a statement given by then-Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson in 2017, who told reporters “My sense is that we’re on the dawn of something very substantial in terms of naval warfare. Something as substantial as the transition from sail to steam, as the transition from wood to ironclad, as substantial as the advent of nuclear propulsion in terms of what it means for naval power.” Richardson has yet to clarify his comments. DTRA/The Black Vault The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD R&E) recommended as recently as 2016 that the Secretary of Defense present a briefing on the “military utility of recent U.S. industrial base LENR advancements to the House Committee on Armed Services.” The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) took a serious look at the topic in 2006 and again ten years later , writing in 2016 that “there are indications that the field of LENR is slowly gaining acceptance,” and that “both SPAWAR HQ and SSC-Pacific say that the phenomenon is real and that it is nuclear in nature.” That report concluded that “additional research is needed to determine the mechanism by which low energy nuclear reactions occur.” While the DTRA’s main purpose is to counter and deter the proliferation or mishandling of weapons of mass destruction, a large part of DTRA’s mission as stated on their website is to “anticipate and understand future threat networks” and “understand basic revolutionary sciences and battlespace changing technologies.” It’s clear, then, why such a potentially game-changing technology as LENR would fall under their purview given how revolutionary the Navy, DTRA, and DIA describe it to be. NSWC Indian Head plans to publish their initial results on their LENR experiments and reviews of data by the end of the year. The War Zone will follow these developments and update our reporting as more information is published. Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com Brett Tingley Nuclear Nuclear Power"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 5, 2021",Turkish Cops Now Have Their Own Attack Helicopters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Turkish Police are, as far as we know, the first law enforcement organization of their kind to fly dedicated attack helicopters. For some weeks now, the civilian police department has been operating the locally produced T129B ATAK developed by Turkish Aerospace. Photos released today by the Anadolu Agency show the initial aircraft — one or possibly two of which are understood to have been delivered so far — although the rotorcraft was formally introduced by the Turkish Police, which is a branch of the General Directorate of Security, in late February. A total of nine Phase 2 ATAKs are on order for the service, which follows the Turkish Army and Turkish Gendarmerie — a military law-enforcement agency — in operating it. The first Turkish Police T129B ATAK. Note the rocket pods carried under the stub wings., VIA TWITTER The T129 ATAK is based on Leonardo’s A129 Mangusta , as used by the Italian Army, and made its first flight in August 2011. Phase 2 is the latest production version of the ATAK, first flown in November 2019 and cleared for service last December. The Phase 2 helicopter has numerous upgrades, including increased indigenous content. Visible changes include a new pod under the starboard stub wing, plus new antennas and sensors on the nose and stub wings. The additional equipment comprises new electronic warfare systems, including an Aselsan laser warning receiver, plus a new radio frequency jammer, radar warning receiver, and VHF/UHF radio. The payload is increased to permit the carriage of additional weapons, as well as the new systems. While the ATAK can be armed with indigenous Roketsan UMTAS long-range anti-tank missiles and Stinger air-to-air missiles, the aircraft for the police, so far at least, have apparently only received unguided 2.75in and laser-guided Roketsan Cirit 2.75in rockets carried in pods under stub wings. The is helicopter also fitted with a 20mm M197 Gatling gun in the nose. The first delivery of the type to the Turkish Police involved aircraft serial number EM-101 and was confirmed on Twitter on February 17 by Turkey’s Minister of Interior Süleyman Soylu. “We are proudly including the first of our attack helicopters, which we will receive by the end of 2022, in the fleet of our Aviation Department,” said Turkish Police Chief Mehmet Aktaş. While the Turkish Police has a long history of flying helicopters — for at least 40 years — the addition of tandem two-seat attack helicopters to the service is a significant, and apparently unparalleled, development. Anadolu Agency In fact, it’s hard to see how a helicopter armed with a multi-barrel 20mm cannon and guided and unguided rockets would be used in daily crime-fighting scenarios. However, local media reports indicate these aircraft will actually be used in counter-terrorism operations alongside those of the army and gendarmerie as part of a “change in mission concept,” according to Anadolu Agency . “Our helicopters will be assigned as a mobile fleet in the provinces of the region, primarily in Diyarbakır, Van, Şırnak, and Hakkari,” Police Chief Mehmet Aktaş explained. All these provinces are in the southeast of the country, where Turkish security forces operations targeting Kurdish militants are most intense. A Turkish Police T129B ATAK undergoes ground runs., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The ATAK allows nothing less than for police aircrew to proactively engage terrorists, like the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), by launching offensive operations over Turkish territory and providing close air support to law-enforcement forces and troops on the ground. The police are already involved in these types of missions, as part of joint operations with branches of the military. Furthermore, the police ATAKs are expected to be utilized for border security in the mainly mountainous terrain of southeast Anatolia. In fact, the level of threat posed by the PKK in particular demands a robust helicopter for police operations. In the past, PKK fighters have claimed the destruction of at least one Turkish AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter within Turkey using a man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS). The enhanced self-protection system incorporated in the Phase 2 ATAKs could help redress the balance against heat-seeking missile threats. The PKK has also used anti-tank weapons against Turkish military helicopters in the past, too. While the PKK has waged an insurgency in Turkey since 1984 and also operates extensively across its borders in Iraq and Syria , Ankara has stepped up its operations against the militants since a ceasefire with them ended in 2015. Among the police pilots now flying the new type is Özge Karabulut, who recently completed nine weeks of training to convert onto the type as Turkey’s first female attack helicopter pilot. She is also qualified to fly the service’s Bell 429. Özge Karabulu in the cockpit of a Turkish Police T129B ATAK., Anadolu Agency The introduction of the ATAK with the Turkish Police further increases the presence of the helicopter in Turkey, with at least 50 examples delivered to the army and 24 reportedly on order for the Gendarmerie. In terms of export orders, however, the ATAK has been less successful. The type was offered unsuccessfully to Pakistan, while the Philippines apparently selected the type as its favored attack helicopter candidate but is yet to sign a deal. Export sales of the T129 require U.S. approval, above all for the LHTEC CTS800 turboshaft engines, originally developed to power the U.S. Army’s RAH-66 Comanche , and this was the apparent stumbling block in the case of the Philippines. Turkey has been working on an alternative indigenous engine, the TS1400 , but its completion is some way off. A T129B ATAK in a hangar, with the Turkish Police badge on the tailfin and “Polis” titles on the fuselage., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Meanwhile, Turkish Aerospace is already looking at new-generation attack helicopters to follow on from the T129. In February, the company displayed a mockup of a proposed electric-powered, unmanned, T629, and said the first flight of an experimental demonstrator was due before the end of this year, although few other details were released. That said, an all-electric powerplant, at this point, seems implausible, while even a hybrid type would be a major technological achievement. Previously, the T629 designation had been applied to a manned attack helicopter, expected to use the indigenous propulsion system from the T625 Gökbey indigenous utility rotorcraft. Importantly, this attack helicopter was planned to be free of components controlled by the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), making Turkey free to export it as it wished. Then there are longer-term plans for the future ATAK 2, schemed as a heavyweight attack helicopter, planned to be twice the weight of the T129, implying a maximum takeoff weight of around 22,000 pounds. Full-scale development of the ATAK 2 was announced in February 2019, with a contract for Turkish Aerospace and plans for a maiden flight by 2024. For the time being, however, Turkish Aerospace remains dedicated to the T129B, now in service with three different Turkish services and also marketed abroad. Whether the attack helicopter’s presence with the Turkish Police remains an oddity, or whether other law enforcement agencies might also adopt similar equipment, is yet to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 7, 2020",The Army’s Plan To Finally Replace The Tank Busting TOW Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army wants a new anti-tank guided missile that is faster than and can hit targets at least twice as far away as the latest, extended-range versions of the BGM-71 TOW family. At the same time, the service wants the new weapon, which would have a maximum range of at least six miles, to be similarly sized to existing BGM-71s so that it can work with existing vehicle-mounted and infantry launchers. Mark Andrews, the head of the Combat Capabilities Branch of the Maneuver Requirements Division, part of the Maneuver Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate at the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning in Georgia, provided the new details about the Army TOW replacement plans at an industry day event on Apr. 7, 2021, according to Military.com . Right now, the new anti-tank missile effort does not appear to have a specific name, with Military.com referring to it simply as a future Close Combat Missile System-Heavy (CCMS-H). CCMS-H is how the Army refers to the current generation of TOWs that are in service now. US Army soldiers fire a TOW missile in training., US Army TOW – which originally stood for Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire-guided – is what is known as a semi-automatic command to line of sight missile, meaning the operator has to keep sighting system aimed at the target until the moment of impact. Earlier variants of the TOW missile, which first began entering service in 1970, received course correction data from the launcher via physical wires unreeled from the rear of the weapon after it left the launch tube. The initial generation of TOWs was followed by the Improved TOW (ITOW) in 1978 and the TOW 2 series in 1992, all of which remained wire-guided. The latest generation of TOWs, which Raytheon , the current manufacturer, began large-scale production of in 2006, have wireless datalinks instead of wires. The Army now refers to them as Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wireless-guided missiles, though the abbreviation remains unchanged. “We want to increase range to the maximum set possible given the capability,” Andrews, the Combat Capabilities Branch chief, said of the future missile, according to Military.com . “So, if we can get out to 10K [10,000 meters; just over six miles] or plus-10K, we want to be able to achieve that.” The TOW 2B Aero missile, originally known as the TOW 2B Extended Range, can hit enemy tanks and other targets out to around 4,500 meters, or just under 2.8 miles, according to the Army . Non-extended-range BGM-71 variants that are still in service have ranges closer to 3,750 meters, or just over 2.3 miles. “We want to retain the current arming distance that the TOW missile has,” he added. Existing BGM-71 missiles all have a minimum range of just 40 meters, or around 131 feet, allowing them to also engage very close-in threats, if necessary. “We want to be able to shoot on the move and … we want the missile to get there quicker than it currently takes our TOW missiles to [travel] max distances,” Andrews continued. It’s unclear how long it takes existing TOWs to reach their maximum ranges, but the missiles reportedly have a maximum speed of around 1,000-feet-per-second, or just over 680 miles per hour, a relatively modest speed for a missile. For a weapon like TOW, speed is particularly important since the operator has to keep the launcher pointed at the target through the missile’s entire flight. The longer it takes for the missile to hit its mark, the longer the shooter has to remain in a position where they have a line-of-sight view of whatever they’re shooting at. This can leave them vulnerable, at least to some degree, during that time. A faster-flying missile could also be more capable of defeating emerging active protection systems , as well. A fire-and-forget TOW variant with an imaging infrared seeker was under development , starting in the 1990s, but was canceled in 2002, ostensibly due to shifting budget priorities. The Army is interested in its future anti-tank missile having some kind of active seeker, as well as two-way datalink and lock-on-after-launch capability. This would allow launch platforms to remain much more concealed, before and after launch, especially if the missiles could be cued to their targets via offboard sensors. A low-quality picture of the fire-and-forget TOW variant with an imaging infrared seeker in the nose., DOD “An adjacent vehicle could take your targeting data and you could pass it to them,” Andrews said. “They could fire the missile because they are best postured to fire that missile.” Andrews also said that the Army wanted the missile to be more maneuverable than TOW, giving it improved capabilities when engaging threats concealed behind hard cover. This could help simplify the requirements for the warhead, as well. To be able hit the top of tanks and other heavy armored vehicles, typically an area where they are most vulnerable, the TOW 2B variant notably has a tandem, downward-firing warhead that detonates as the missile flies overhead.  However, this precludes it from being used effectively in a direct fire mode against other kinds of targets, which is the reason why other TOW variants with more traditional warheads also remain in service. It’s interesting to note that the Army, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, spent decades working on faster-flying anti-tank missiles, including designs without warheads that relied instead on the sheer force of their impact to damage and destroy targets. The last publicly known of these projects, the Compact Kinetic Energy Missile (CKEM), which Lockheed Martin was developing, was canceled along with the rest of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program in 2009. You can read more about CKEM, and other similar developments over the past 40 years, in more detail here . However, CKEM, and other similar weapons the Army explored in the three decades or so leading up to the end of FCS, were significantly larger than TOW. Combat Capabilities Branch head Andrews made it clear that what the service wants now is something that has the same form factor as the BGM-71-series. A briefing slide regarding CKEM from 2006., Lockheed Martin “We have thousands of launchers out there that we just don’t want to have to replace,” he said. Some of those launchers are built into vehicles, such as the Bradley family and ATGM Vehicle variant of the Stryker , and replacing them would require even more substantial changes, too. This could also make it attractive to the Marine Corps, as well as foreign TOW operators, many of which also have specialized vehicle-mounted launchers. A Bradley fighting vehicle fires a TOW missile., US Army A US Marine Corps Light Armored Vehicle-Anti-Tank Weapon System (LAV-ATWS), another example of a specialized vehicle-mounted launcher for the TOW missile now in service., USMC If it works with any existing TOW architecture, the new missile could conceivable also be employed in an air-launched mode, as well. However, Army and the Marine Corps attack helicopters no longer carry BGM-71s, having transitioned completely to the AGM-114 Hellfire. It’s also worth pointing out that the latest versions of the TOW launcher have powerful electro-optical and infrared optics and offer valuable secondary surveillance and battlefield situational awareness capabilities. Even if the new missile has a fire-and-forget mode, the Army might not be eager to give up these core components of the existing targeting system. Army soldier train with an M41 TOW Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS). This targeting system offers significant secondary surveillance and battlefield situational awareness capabilities. , US Army It’s not immediately clear how it might be possible to fit a missile with a range of over six miles into a package similar in size to the existing TOW missile. However, advanced high-grain propellant rocket motor technology has been used in the development of other extended-range missiles, such as the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER), where there is also a demand for the new weapon to be at least close in size to the weapon being replaced. Whatever the final shape of a future TOW replacement might be, the Army’s renewed interest in this kind of weapon underscores a general interest in new anti-tank capabilities that had emerged across the U.S. military in recent years. The was initially driven primarily by concerns about a potential conflict with Russia following that country’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea regio n in 2014. This is actually an area of the world that may be facing an all-new crisis right now . The Army has more recently talked about the general significance of heavy armor , friendly and hostile, in the context of being better prepared for a possible future conflict with China. The ground forces of both Russia and China are already heavily mechanized and both countries have been working on improved armored vehicles of various types . In addition, anti-tank missiles of various types have conclusively demonstrated their value against a wide range of targets, including helicopters on or near the ground, in a number of recent conflicts. TOW missiles, among other ATGMs, supplied to rebel groups in Syria by various countries, including the United States, were an iconic and often decisive feature of the fighting in that country for years. As it stands now, the Army’s goal is to at least begin replacing the venerable TOW with this much more capable future missile sometime between 2028 and 2032, at which time BGM-71-series will have been in service for around six decades.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 1, 2021",Now China Has Cruise Missile Carrying Catamarans Chasing Away Ships In The South China Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Chinese stealthy catamaran fast-attack missile craft have reportedly been involved in an incident with a boat chartered by a Philippine media company in the hotly contested waters of the South China Sea . According to an account citing ABS-CBN reporter Chiara Zambrano , the Type 022 Houbei class vessels appeared today in the Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef located in the disputed Spratly Islands . The missile craft then apparently aggressively chased away the boat operated on behalf of the ABS-CBN news crew, which had been sailing in the area to monitor the movements of other Chinese vessels. This comes after a succession of reported incidents of intimidation of Filipino fishermen by Chinese boats, as well as alleged illegal fishing by Chinese vessels in these waters. In March, the Philippine Coast Guard said it had identified no fewer than 220 Chinese ships at another nearby reef, in waters also under Philippine jurisdiction. A PLAN Type 022 fast-attack missile craft during previous maneuvers in the East China Sea., PLAN “We were on our way to Ayungin Shoal [the Philippine name for Second Thomas Shoal] when a white Chinese Coast Guard ship headed toward us,” Zambrano said. “It moved closer and closer, and we could see that through our lens. After that, it sent a radio communication and in English asked who we were and what we were doing in the area.” A tweet with a satellite image apparently showing the two Type 022 boats around 15 miles southeast of Ren’ai Shoal, a distance of Second Thomas Shoal: The news team boat then apparently decided to head back to Palawan , at which point the fast-attack missile craft gave chase. “Two smaller but faster ships chased us,” Zambrano recounted. “The ships were Type 022 Houbei fast attack craft with two missiles mounted.” The Second Thomas Shoal has been de facto in the Philippines’ possession since 1999, when a Philippine Navy amphibious transport ship, the BRP Sierra Madre , was intentionally grounded on the reef. Since then, the rusting wreck has been maintained by a contingent of marines as an improvised military outpost. However, beginning in 2013, China has increased its maritime presence near the shoal, to protests from Manila. The area is within the Philippines’ internationally recognized exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and surrounding waters are rich fishing grounds. A still from the ABS-CBN news report purportedly showing a Type 022 boat close to Second Thomas Shoal., ABS-CBN SCREENCAP In the past, Chinese fishing boats and patrol vessels from the Chinese Coast Guard and have been sighted close to the shoal. This latest incident may be the first time that a Houbei class missile craft operated by the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), specifically, has been identified here. Late last month , three of the Type 022 vessels together with a supply ship were seen apparently moored at Mischief Reef. This area is home to one of China’s man-made outposts in the South China Sea. It is also known in the Philippines as Panganiban Reef and falls within the Philippine EEZ. While there doesn’t seem to be imagery available to support this claim, there is no doubt that huge numbers of Chinese fishing vessels have been moored around the disputed reef in recent weeks. However, it is not clear where these PLAN fast-attack missile craft are operating from and whether any examples are now permanently or semi-permanently deployed at outposts in the South China Sea. Last November, “multiple” Type 022s took part in Chinese maritime maneuvers in the South China Sea, together with three Type 071 amphibious assault ships . This was part of what the Global Times , an offshoot of the People’s Daily , the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, described as “a real combat scenario drill, with the catamarans training in comprehensive attack and defense, air defense and anti-terrorism.” The PLAN did not disclose exactly where the large-scale maneuvers involving Type 022s took place and the South China Sea is a very large area. With this in mind, missile craft operating in the northern end of these waters, near Hainan or Woody Island , would be significantly different from them patrolling the waters further south, and much further from the Chinese mainland, such as the Second Thomas Shoal. These prolific vessels — China built more than 80 examples in a seven-year span — are part of a rapid expansion program for the PLAN. Chiefly considered a coastal defense asset up until now, it seems they might also now be used in a more expeditionary role, which could have major strategic implications for the South China Sea. Video of the Type 022 class vessels during a previous military exercise: https://youtube.com/watch?v=4wtV_3pI0RA In fact, the Type 022 appears to be especially well equipped for this sort of work, with robust datalink and other command and control capabilities that would allow for greater coordination with other Chinese aircraft and warships. In addition to that equipment, these catamarans are also well-armed, with eight launchers for YJ-83 subsonic anti-ship missiles and a fast-firing 30mm H/PJ-13 Gatling-type gun on the bow to engage aerial targets and provide fire support. Short-range air defense is apparently entrusted to man-portable air defense systems operated by the crew. Firing the 30mm H/PJ-13 Gatling-type gun on one of the Type 022 boats., PLA The boats are credited with a maximum speed of around 36 or 38 knots and while their range is unknown, it could be around 300 miles. As noted before, the Type 022s spotted at Mischief Reef were accompanied by a supply ship that would be able to increase their radius of action considerably. As well as maritime activity in this area, the importance of the Spratly Islands to Beijing’s wider ambitions in the South China Sea has also been reflected in the construction of artificial outposts here. Three locations, in particular, Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef, and Subi Reef have all been subject to significant artificial expansion by China since 2014. They are defended by HQ-9B surface-to-air missiles and ground-launched YJ-12B anti-ship missiles, and all three are also equipped with long runways , at least some of which are capable of supporting bombers. A map of the South China Sea, including the Spratlys, with the so-called nine-dash line highlighted in green. The area within this, covering around 90 percent of the South China Sea, is claimed by China., CIA The Spratly Islands have also been a regular host to long-range air patrols by Chinese fighters, including Su-30 Flankers . By not only deploying warships and aircraft to the Spratly Islands, but also transforming them into manmade bases provides a platform for Beijing to stake its claim to a vast economic exclusion zone, packed with shipping routes, fishing areas, and natural resources. From these outposts, China would be able to expand its anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) umbrella and then potentially claim control of the entire area, if it so wished. In the past, China has denied that it’s actively establishing military strongholds in the South China Sea, but the fact remains that its claims cover the largest portion of this area and, despite international opposition and “freedom of navigation” missions by the U.S. military and others, Beijing has been unwilling to yield any ground over the Spratlys and, further north, the Paracel Islands . China already has a fortress-like network of manmade outposts to project power in the southern end of the South China Sea, and it’s possible these could become further fortified with permanently stationed fighter aircraft, long-range sensors, and missile systems. However, having forward-deployed flotillas of Type 022s would provide an additional immediate layer of defense, as well as a way to strike outward against enemy naval forces from those bases. In particular, the vessels’ shallow draft and high speed make them ideal for defending these kinds of littoral claims. What is more, these vessels’ small crew requirements and ability to operate from austere locations would help maintain a powerful localized presence. On top of that, the apparently new presence of these missile-armed craft in the southern South China Sea alone sends a powerful signal to the Philippines and other regional powers with competing claims in this region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 14, 2019",One of US Special Operations Command’s Newest Spy Planes Is Hunting Terrorists In Libya,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With two other mysterious spy planes now retired, U.S. Special Operations Command appears to have fully transitioned to using newer, modified de Havilland Canada Dash-8s for certain discreet persistent surveillance missions. At least one of these planes is already becoming a regular feature over Libya , where American special operators continue a secretive hunt for terrorists, including individuals with links to the infamous Benghazi attack . According to the U.S. military’s latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, which it released in February 2018, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) operates at least two of the twin engine Dash-8s as part of a fleet of aircraft known as SOCOM Tactical Airborne Multi-Sensor Platforms, or STAMP. That program also oversees at least three smaller twin engine Beechcraft King Air B300s . We don’t know the exact configuration of these Dash-8s. Federal Aviation Administration records only shows SOCOM as having registered one aircraft of this type, which carries the U.S. civil registration code N8200L, so the exact status of the other plane is unclear. But we do know that N8200L’s previous owner was Dynamic Aviation , a contractor that had operated the plane as a surveillance platform on contract to the U.S. Army. Dynamic flew a number of Dash-8s for the Army in two configurations, known by their program names Desert Owl and Saturn Arch. One of Dynamic Aviation’s Dash-8s, registration N8300S, while flying as part of the US Army’s Desert Owl program in 2015., Bill Word Desert Owl’s primary sensor was a PedRad 7 synthetic aperture radar capable of creating images across an area nearly two miles wide depending on the aircraft’s altitude. It also had a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras. The Saturn Arch aircraft carried a “Mission Sensor System,” as well as another sensor called “Big Green.” We don’t know exactly what these pieces of equipment did, but at least one of them could have been a laser imaging system. Those aircraft also carried a secondary camera turret, as well as another hyperspectral camera, which could create pictures based on an object’s electromagnetic signature, and compact wide-area optical camera system . It is possible that the Desert Owl planes had additional sensor suites, as well. All of the aircraft, which looked similar externally regardless of configuration, featured satellite data links to transmit information back to ground exploitation stations or share it with troops on the ground in near real time. One of Dynamic Aviation’s Dash-8s, registration N8300Y, while flying as part of the US Army’s Saturn Arch program in 2015., Bill Word With this equipment on board, both types of planes had the mission of performing persistent surveillance missions across relatively wide areas, using their sensors to build larger maps of entire regions. From there, analysts could examine the imagery for items of interest, potentially establishing so-called “ patterns of life ” for specific terrorists or small groups of militants. The Army primarily employed them to hunt for improvised explosive devices and, by extension, to trace insurgent movements back to bomb workshops or other base camps. That same wide-area surveillance information can help U.S. forces determine when the best most might be to try and kill or capture a particular individual with as little risk to nearby innocent civilians as possible. It seems very likely that SOCOM’s Dash-8s have a similar combination of wide-area sensors given that the U.S. military routinely tasks special operations forces with tracking small groups of terrorists across vast areas where the enemy might be able to use the terrain or local populations to otherwise hide their movements. The aircraft may also have additional signals intelligence equipment to detect and monitor enemy communications, especially cell phone signals , in order to help refine their search areas. The Pentagon’s 2019 fiscal year budget request includes $5 million for SOCOM’s STAMP aircraft, but all for upgrades to the smaller B300s, including the addition of a piece of equipment nicknamed “Tincup.” It is entirely possible the Dash-8s may also carry that system, whatever it is. Also Interesting to note, after N8200L was handed to the US Special Operations Command from the US Army, it received a more clandestine livery you can see here. https://t.co/Y0i55KhZXF — Aircraft Spots (@AircraftSpots) February 13, 2018 We already know that from details regarding the Army’s future Dash-8-based RO-6A spy planes that the platform is big enough to carry a robust combination of cameras, radars, and signal grabbing systems, which you can read about in more detail here . That service bought a number of the other Desert Owl and Saturn Arch aircraft from Dynamic in order to turn them into the RO-6As. These aircraft will eventually replace all of the Army’s older EO-5C intelligence gathering aircraft , which use the de Havilland Canada DHC-7 airframe. The Canadian planemaker, now part of Bombardier, stopped making the aircraft in 1988 and built less than 120 of them to begin with, meaning they’ve been steadily more expensive to operate and difficult to support. Bombardier continues to make versions of the Dash-8 family, meaning there is more ready source of common spare parts and support services. And though it only has two engines, each one of the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW100 turboprops on the newer aircraft is twice as powerful as that company’s older PT6s found on the DHC-7, giving them better range and endurance. It seems that SOCOM came to a similar conclusion and when it decided to send two DHC-7s of its own to the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona in August and September 2017. Pictures of those aircraft also suggested they carried a diverse combination of sensors . One of the two DHC-7 spy planes that SOCOM appears to have traded in for newer Dash-8-based surveillance aircraft., USAF The FAA’s online database says SOCOM formally took ownership of N8200L in September 2017. As of February 2017, however, plane spotters and online flight trackers had begun picking up that aircraft, now wearing a more discreet civilian-style paint scheme, flying missions over eastern Libya from Souda Bay on the Greek island of Crete in the Mediterranean. The island is home to a U.S. Navy base, which serves as a common base of operations for American forces in the region. This isn’t particularly surprising. Before then, SOCOM’s two shadowy DHC-7s – often mistaken for Army EO-5Cs – had made regular flights in the same areas of Libya.

In October 2017, another raid into Libya bagged Mustafa Al Imam , in connection with the incident. Persistent aerial surveillance would have been essential in planning both of those missions. #Libya – #MSCD photo of an EO-5C surveillance aircraft purportedly flying over #Derna this morning pic.twitter.com/0O8WY7RXmM — Oded Berkowitz (@Oded121351) January 2, 2017 It is also possible that N8200L could be supporting continued American operations focused on preventing ISIS-linked militants from establishing a firm foothold in Libya. In 2016, the United States launched a brief aerial campaign to help Libyan government forces retake the eastern city of Sirte, with special operators on the ground reportedly helping coordinate those air strikes and monitor enemy movements. Since then, the U.S. military has continued to launch sporadic targeted strikes against ISIS-affiliated terrorists in Libya. Between September and November 2017, U.S. Africa Command publicly announced 10 separate strikes in the country, which could have been the product of intelligence from special operations elements in the air or on the ground . Whatever the case, it seems safe to assume that we’ll be seeing more of N8200L, as well as the other STAMP aircraft, flying discreetly over Libya, or perhaps other hotspots, in the near future.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on May 3, 2021",The Boscombe Down Incident Remains One Of Military Aviation’s Most Intriguing Mysteries,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the story goes, on the evening of September 26, 1994, an aircraft was set to take off from Runway 23 at RAF Boscombe Down, a Royal Air Force Base in Wiltshire, England that is tasked with flight testing and weapons development. As the aircraft made its run down the runway, a malfunction caused the crew to abort the takeoff. Soon after, London Air Traffic Control Center, or LATCC, was contacted and notified that the entire runway needed to be closed. What followed was a highly peculiar and swift response that is still wrapped in secrecy. It included the mysterious stricken aircraft being wrapped up and presumably partially disassembled so that it could be flown home to the United States in a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport plane. Despite eyewitness testimony, there has never been an official explanation for the strange events at RAF Boscombe Down on that fall night in 1994, but it seems quite clear that some kind of clandestine event did indeed occur. An Incident At Boscombe Down RAF Boscombe Down, today known as MoD Boscombe Down , has long been a major locale for military aircraft testing and evaluation in the United Kingdom. Cutting-edge testbeds and recovered foreign tactical jets are just some of the aircraft that have called Boscombe Down home since its construction in 1917. The British Aircraft and Armament Evaluation Establishment (AAEE) began using the base for aircraft experiments in 1939, and in 1994 the site was placed under the control of the Defense Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), Britain’s equivalent to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 2001, DERA was split into two parts that became the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and the private company QinetiQ . It was during the base’s time as part of DERA the mysterious incident occurred. Much of what the public understands about the incident stems from a March 1997 cover story in Air Forces Monthly written by Ren Hoek and Marco Van der Welk that reads like an aviation ghost story. Cover of Air Forces Monthly, March 1997, AFM The story goes like this: On September 22, 1994, eyewitnesses living near Boscombe Down reported hearing an abnormal noise approaching the base. According to local television news reports the next day, the noise sounded almost like a freight train or a low-frequency rumbling or humming. A few days later, on the evening of September 26, an unknown aircraft malfunction shut down Runway 23 at RAF Boscombe Down. Eyewitnesses reported that the broken aircraft was quickly covered by a frame and tarpaulins while surrounded by emergency vehicles. While sitting on the runway, the aircraft’s rear section was unusually elevated, possibly indicating a nose wheel collapse. Shortly after, the aircraft was pulled into a hangar where it sat behind closed doors for two days. A Eurofighter Typhoon taking off from RAF Boscombe Down years after the 1994 incident., Wikimedia Commons During this time period, it became clear that a cleanup operation was underway. Witnesses reported seeing U.K. special operations forces at Boscombe Down, and two special operations aircraft reportedly arrived at the base: an Agusta A109 helicopter from the British Army’s 8 Flight AAC , a unit that provided covert transport for Special Air Service (SAS) personnel, and a Chinook from the RAF’s No. 7 Squadron, a unit tasked with supporting British special operations forces. According to the two-year investigation conducted by Air Forces Monthly, witnesses reported several unusual aircraft coming in and out of Boscombe Down during this time. A USAF C-12 Huron , used by the DoD for priority air transport throughout Europe, landed in the days following the incident, as did “an apparently unmarked” Boeing 707. Though the Boeing 707 has not been conclusively identified, there are reports that a particularly shadowy example of one of these aircraft, ostensibly operated by the USAF with the serial number 67-19417 and designated as either an EC-137D or EC-137E, appeared at Exeter Airport, some 80 miles to the southwest of Boscombe Down, a month after the incident. It’s not clear whether or not this sighting was directly related, but this aircraft, which was acquired by the U.S. government in 1992 and flew in an effectively unmarked gray-white paint scheme for around a decade, was subsequently linked to clandestine activities and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). 67-19417, an EC-137D or EC-137E, on the ground in Stuttgart, Germany, in March 1994., JetPix via Wikimedia It’s also worth noting that this jet had previously been on the U.S. civil register as N707HL, with the last civilian owner being a company known as E-Systems in Greenville, Texas. E-Systems, which subsequently became a division of Raytheon, already had a long history of working on highly-classified aircraft projects for the U.S. government, including the U.S. military and the CIA, by the early 1990s. Today, 67-19417 is in storage at the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, where it is listed as an EC-137D. Perhaps most interestingly, eyewitnesses reported also seeing a Boeing 737/T-43 landing at the base that featured the now-iconic red and white markings associated with aircraft operated by private contractor EG&G. That company famously operated the “Janet Airlines,” 737s that shuttle employees to and from the Groom Lake facility and Tonopah Test Range Airport north of Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as other clandestine flight test and aerospace development locales throughout America’s southwest. URS Corporation acquired EG&G from The Carlyle Group in 2002 and stopped using the EG&G brand in 2009, morphing it into URS Federal Services. A “Janet Airlines” Boeing 737-200 framed against the MGM Grand hotel and casino in Las Vegas as it takes off from McCarran International Airport., via Beer Root via Wikimedia On September 28, eyewitnesses reportedly got a glimpse of the partially-covered air vehicle when another aircraft was removed from the same hangar in which it was stored. The mystery aircraft was said to have been charcoal grey with inward-canted twin tail fins and featured chines extending from its nose section, not too dissimilar from those found on the SR-71 or the characteristics we see on stealthy aircraft designs, such as the YF-23 . The aircraft was reported to be the size of a large fighter jet and its canopy appeared to hinge forward at the front. The crashed aircraft remained in the hangar at Boscombe Down until a lumbering USAF C-5 Galaxy appeared to fly the wreckage home on September 28, 1994. The C-5’s original flight plan had it landing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany until it requested a diversion to Boscombe Down late in its flight. A C-5 delivers a partially disassembled SR-71 to Minnesota for display., Public Domain via SR71.us When the C-5 took off from Boscombe Down days later after being loaded with “an unidentifiable tarpaulin-covered object,” its destination was reportedly listed as KPMD , otherwise known as USAF Plant 42 Airport . Plant 42 is home to the most advanced military aircraft manufacturing centers in the world, including Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, as well as sprawling Northrop Grumman and Boeing installations. At that time, two specially modified C-5Cs, serial numbers 68-0213 and 68-0216, were based at Travis Air Force Base in California and frequented Palmdale, mainly for use in support of various space programs and some clandestine aircraft development programs. They lacked an upper passenger compartment and had other modifications allowing them to carry even larger outsized cargo than their standard C-5A stablemates. In the weeks following the incident, RAF Boscombe Down was visited by a C-20 Gulfstream IV with the U.S. civil registration code N604M reportedly operated by the CIA. The same aircraft made several stops throughout England in early October 1994 under heavy security, including Southampton where Northrop Grumman’s facilities in the United Kingdom are situated. The British Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Defense Department both denied the incident had occurred. David Oliver, former editor of Air Forces Monthly , told The Independent that the magazine had “no doubt that an incident did happen on the day in question and it has never been satisfactorily explained by the authorities” after their two-year investigation. Oliver assured The Independent “that Royal Air Force officers had been among the sources” of their investigation and that “he was sure the report was true.” In 1994, Martin Redmond, a Member of the U.K. Parliament from Don Valley, brought up the incident in that legislative body. The response from Defense Minister Nicholas Soames was that he was “aware of a press report of such an incident,” but that “Staff at Boscombe Down have confirmed, however, that there was no crash at the unit on that date or, indeed, so far this year.” Soames added that “the only flying which took place that night was the launch of two Royal Navy Sea King helicopters in support of an exercise.” Black Triangles And Black Budgets In their March 1997 cover story, Air Forces Monthly make the case that the crashed aircraft was the long-rumored, never-confirmed ASTRA (Advanced Stealth Reconnaissance Aircraft), one of the more popular “ghost stories” of black budget aircraft lore. The article claims the ASTRA was produced by Northrop and even includes the alleged USAF serial number of the crashed vehicle, 90-2414. According to Air Forces Monthly , the vehicle was referred to as AV-6 (Air Vehicle Six), and may have been born from research related to the production of the YF-23 , the unsuccessful contender for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that spawned the F-22 . An advertisement ahead of AFM’s Boscombe Down cover story, which would actually appear in their March 1997 issue., Air International The alleged ASTRA is only one of a number of shadowy aircraft which are claimed to have been developed around the same time period. For instance, many rumors and small pieces of disparate, unsubstantiated evidence suggest, when viewed just the right way, the existence of an extremely high-speed, manned aerial surveillance platform. The name largely attributed to this mythical aircraft, Aurora, derives from a few misinterpreted line items in Air Force budget documents throughout the 1980s that actually belonged to what would become the Advanced Technology Bomber and then the B-2. Sightings of unknown black, triangular aircraft are often attributed to Aurora, ASTRA, or similar apocryphal programs. Several high-profile sightings throughout the 1990s fueled speculation that the United States was operating just such a classified reconnaissance aircraft. In one of these sightings, a trained former member of the Royal Observer Corps reported witnessing a black triangular aircraft refueling from a KC-135 over the North Sea while being escorted by two F-111 Aardvark combat jets . There has never been hard proof of such a high-speed reconnaissance aircraft’s existence, especially one in an operational state that would have been flying around the globe on missions at the time. Additionally, by that time, a then still secret revolution in aerial reconnaissance had already occurred, making snapshots in time collected by high-speed aircraft less attractive than using stealth technology to persist over an enemy’s territory sucking up intelligence for hours on end. Also, significant improvements in spy satellites made the high-speed and also hugely expensive airborne reconnaissance proposition far less attractive than it once was . That brings us to the so-called TR-3A “Black Manta” subsonic stealthy tactical reconnaissance aircraft. There were also large numbers of sightings of a broader triangular shape aircraft during this period, especially over Europe, which led to a UFO buzz. Popular Mechanics even ran a cover story in December 1991 exploring the idea of the rumored TR-3A. Of all the possible classified aircraft of the era, our own Editor In Chief Tyler Rogoway believes such a subsonic, penetrating, tactical reconnaissance aircraft, potentially with secondary electronic attack capabilities, possibly did exist in very small numbers during this time period. This aircraft would have served as a missing link of sorts that would have bridged the persistent and penetrating reconnaissance revelations made by then Northrop’s top-secret Tacit Blue demonstrator and unmanned penetrating reconnaissance aircraft concepts that began to emerge in the late 1990s, culminating in at least one operational type, the RQ-170 Sentinel . You can read more about the potential existence of this ‘missing link’ of a ghost plane here . Concept art from a 1991 Popular Mechanics cover story about the alleged TR-3A., Popular Mechanics There was also a lot of work being done around the time regarding small and stealthy tactical special operations transport aircraft, with some notional designs seemingly quite similar to the aircraft described. Such a capability would likely be quite attractive to the Ministry of Defense, which could have prompted a joint program between the two countries. This would have occurred after stealth was proven over Iraq during Desert Storm via the F-117. The U.K. passed on being part of the F-117 program when it was still in the realm of top-secret classification. You can read about the stealth special operations tactical transport aircraft saga in our two-part series on the mystery surrounding it linked here and here . A proposed design for a relatively small, stealthy, short takeoff and vertical landing capable assault transport aircraft known as the Low Observable Air Vehicle-11 (LOAV-11) that has a remarkable resemblance to the aircraft described at RAF Boscombe Down., LTV The public curiosity over the alleged ‘black’ aircraft grew to the point that then-Secretary of the Air Force Donald B. Rice issued a statement in December 1992, calling ideas of such an aircraft nothing but “fantasy.” A USAF spokesperson added that the Air Force has “looked into all such sightings, as we have for U.F.O. reports, and we cannot explain them. No Air Force aircraft were operating at the times and places of the alleged sightings.” That same year, the Federation of American Scientists, or FAS, also concluded that at least the Aurora was nothing but a ghost story . The U.K. press reported several similar sightings , strange engine noises, and deflections by Parliament throughout the same period, although none of these was ever confirmed to be related to any black aircraft. One could easily argue that actually admitting to a clandestine aircraft with a sensitive role defeats the point and denials are hardly unheard of in this regard. There is also the possibility that the crashed aircraft at RAF Boscombe was something else altogether. Boscombe was involved in evaluation of aircraft from ‘threat’ nations around this post Cold War timeframe. According to The War Zone ‘s Thomas Newdick, it’s possible that the aircraft was a captured or recovered foreign-made design being evaluated or tested against Western-made aircraft. “Eastern Bloc combat aircraft and helicopters from mainly former East Germany and Hungary are almost certain to have passed through here,” Newdick says. “It would explain the level of secrecy since this stuff was all highly classified. A lot of the time the presence of these aircraft in the UK is only confirmed through records of transfers in Germany and, in other cases, where the aircraft ended up on ranges or in UK museums.” Further investigation The War Zone ’s own Joseph Trevithick has pursued multiple Freedom of Information requests to the USAF, the CIA, and the U.K. Ministry of Defense in relation to the Boscombe Down incident. The most noteworthy response he says he’s received so far is a statement in which a CIA spokesperson did not refuse to confirm or deny that any such incident had occurred at all, but instead pointed him to the USAF. “We believe your request as written would more likely fall under the auspices of the U.S. Air Force and Department of Defense,” Allison Fong, Information and Privacy Coordinator at the CIA, wrote in response to a Freedom of Information Act request Trevithick submitted regarding Boscombe Down. The Air Force Safety Center responded to an identical FOIA request by stating it had no information about any incident that involved one of the service’s aircraft at Boscombe Down in 1994. Air Force Materiel Command and the U.K. Ministry of Defense have yet to respond to identical requests. A 2001 image of RAF Boscombe Down. , Google Earth The War Zone contributor and former editor of Combat Aircraft Monthly Jamie Hunter has looked into the RAF Boscombe Down incident on his own, too.  He says he has yet to find evidence other than accounts that corroborate the fact that a C-5 Galaxy did, in fact, land at RAF Boscombe on the alleged date. “I remember seeing a flight plan for the C-5, which was due to fly into Boscombe Down,” Hunter told The War Zone, “but I didn’t actually see it on the ground.” The War Zone also spoke with author and consultant Nick Cook, who at the time was aviation editor at Jane’s Defense Weekly and was the first to break the Boscombe Down story in The Sunday Telegraph . While Cook is confident that the incident happened the way it has been described, to this day he remains unsure about what the craft may have been: “My former editor, who had some good sources in the RAF and MoD, was contacted to see what he might know about what happened at Boscombe Down. He contacted me, and to be honest, it sounded really fanciful when I heard it. Something crashed on the runway, special forces went into action around the site and shut it down. I said I’d look into it, but I wouldn’t hold my breath. I contacted a few sources and sure enough, after a few calls, I was fairly satisfied something had happened. They shut down the main highway, the A303, that runs into Boscombe Down. The cover story didn’t make a whole lot of sense. The main cover story was that a Tornado had been testing a towed decoy, which had gotten stuck on its roller and wouldn’t retract. The cover story about a towed decoy was familiar because the RAF had been testing towed decoys for Tornados and it was quite secret. So if you’re going to cover up something secret and do it well, its best to do it authentically with another secret. So a decoy makes sense. But it was patently a cover story. I definitely think something happened. The C-5 definitely came into Boscombe Down. I didn’t talk to the witnesses directly but I read enough witness testimony to say they saw something with a tarpaulin on it on the runway. It had to have been American or have had some American lineage in it in order for the C-5 to have turned up. There were quite a few rumors of joint black programs between the U.S. and the U.K. at the time. There was a lot of the Aurora stuff knocking around at the time but I don’t think it was Aurora. It sounded smaller, tactical, deployable, F-117-like. That sort of size. Certainly, something happened. What it was, I have no idea.” Evaluating the Boscombe Down incident nearly 30 years later is clearly a difficult proposition . Whatever the case is, the evidence available about the incident suggests that something sensitive occurred at Boscombe Down on that fall evening back in 1994, but the culprit of the incident remains a mystery to this day. Still, it may be that the incident at the testing base was the closest the public has come to being exposed to a true and still classified ‘black’ jet of the era, whatever its origins. The War Zone continues to pursue its investigation into the events at RAF Boscombe Down. We will follow up if we finally get a major break in the case. Author’s note: Thanks to Joerg of Dreamlandresort.com for also taking the time to talk to us about his knowledge of this event.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 8, 2019",Russia Looks To Repurpose Surveillance Jets After Open Skies Treaty Exit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After Russia followed the United States out of the Open Skies Treaty, the former is now offering its specially configured Tupolev Tu-214ON aircraft, which it describes as “the most advanced aircraft” certified to take part in flights under that agreement. The converted airliners, equipped with cameras and other sensors, are being pitched for alternative duties on behalf of the Russian military, or even civilian surveillance tasks. In a post on its Facebook page yesterday, the state-owned Rostec Corporation, the parent company of the United Aircraft Corporation, which in turn is responsible for Tupolev, posed the question “What is waiting for the unique Tu-214ON aircraft after Russia withdraws from the Treaty on Open Skies?” The post, which you can read in full here , then promoted the capabilities of the soon-to-be-surplus Open Skies surveillance aircraft, the most modern aircraft type used by Russia for this purpose. One of the two Open Skies Tupolev Tu-214ON aircraft at Zhukovsky in Russia., Artem Katranzhi/Wikimedia Commons According to Rostec, quoting the general designer of the Vega subsidiary, Vladimir Verba, the concern is “ready to retrofit the Tu-214ON with special equipment to solve other tasks.” The corporation suggests that the Tu-214ON could “be used to monitor the security of military facilities of the Russian Federation, objectively control the results of tests of various weapons, and evaluate the effectiveness of exercises.” Furthermore, Rostec anticipates the aircraft “will also be in demand for such purely civilian tasks as mapping [and] assessing the ice conditions on rivers and in the seas, which can be very important in the framework of the Arctic Program.” That latter point suggests a potential new role for the Tu-214ON in support of Russia’s burgeoning activities in the Far North. Of course, these include a highly strategic military component , as well as securing access to natural resources and maritime trade routes . The Treaty on Open Skies was originally signed in 1992 but only entered into force in January 2002. Since then, a total of 35 countries have joined. In August 2002, Russia conducted the first observation flight under the treaty. Under the terms of Open Skies, inspection flights are permitted over member states’ territory, provided certain rules are adhered to, including missions being in the presence of monitors from the surveilled country. In this way, countries can collect data on military forces and activities. The treaty limits the resolution of the reconnaissance sensors that can be utilized, and therefore the level of detail of the imagery that’s gathered. Moscow announced its intention to leave the treaty back in January, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that it had “launched domestic procedures for withdrawal.” While that wording is not necessarily indicative of a complete exit, it’s noteworthy that now Rostec is offering the services of the Tu-214ON in some new capacity, although there is no indication the aircraft are available for sale or lease Russia’s departure from Open Skies was precipitated by former President Donald Trump’s decision to walk away from the treaty, citing Russian violations of its terms. These included restricting the duration of flights over the Kaliningrad exclave on the Baltic Sea and near the breakaway Georgian regions that Moscow recognizes as independent countries. You can read more about these treaty compliance issues in detail in this past War Zone piece . The Trump administration finally withdrew the United States from the treaty last November. The Russian Open Skies fleet is based at Chkalovsky northeast of Moscow and, as well as the two Tu-214ONs, it includes four of the smaller An-30B twin-turboprops and one Tu-154M-LK1. The latter aircraft was used for missions over the United States, including one that you can read about here , as was the more capable Tu-214ON . The sole Tu-154M-LK1 that was typically used Open Skies missions over North America., Dmitry Terekhov/Wikimedia Commons Unlike the older An-30B and Tu-154M-LK1, which carry only optical cameras, the Tu-214ON was envisaged to utilize every type of sensor that is permitted under the treaty: a side-looking radar (that can work over land and water in most all conditions), an infrared scanner, and a suite of optical and TV cameras. All this equipment was to be integrated by Rostec’s Vega concern before the two aircraft were handed over to the Russian Ministry of Defense in 2013 and 2014. In the event, however, and despite many sources claiming the contrary, the radar was never installed. Nevertheless, in 2018, the Trump administration briefly refused to certify the aircraft, although this may well have been political intransigence rather than a comment on aircraft capabilities. After all, this happened after Russia had revised the surveillance fit on the planes, abandoning the radar and installing digital cameras with the same resolution as those used on the An-30B and Tu-154M-LK1. According to Rostec, the cameras have a resolution of 30 centimeters, while the infrared sensor has a 50-centimeter resolution. Should the Tu-214ON remain in Russian military service, it is probable that the original higher-resolution camera would be reinstalled and, potentially, other sensors too. The Russian Ministry of Defense already operates the two Tu-214R Mullet military reconnaissance aircraft based on the same airframe and including equipment that would be prohibited under Open Skies. This includes a side-looking radar with antennas on the forward fuselage sides and below the rear fuselage. Its electro-optical sensor suite includes digital still, infrared, and TV cameras. Finally, a signals intelligence (SIGINT) suite is used to gather radio-frequency traffic which can then be analyzed and transmitted to other platforms via satellite communications. Befitting its military role, the Tu-214R also carries countermeasures dispensers for self-defense. These aircraft have been noted patrolling off the coast of Japan as well as along the border with Ukraine and in Syria . However, the Tu-214ON would need significant modification to approach the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities of the Tu-214R, not least since it currently lacks any means of real-time data transfer or other specific military systems. One of the two secretive Tu-214R Mullet military reconnaissance aircraft., Rimma Sadykova/Wikimedia Commons Outside of the intelligence-gathering role, the Tu-214 is also well established with Russian military and government operators. The Rossiya fleet, which provides transport for the president and other high-level state authorities, flies 15 examples. These are fielded in standard transport, airborne control post, radio relay, and combined airliner/command post configurations. One of the Tu-214 airliners used for governmental transport in the Rossiya fleet., Dmitriy Pichugin/Wikimedia Commons As well as the two Tu-214R and two Tu-214ON aircraft, the Russian Ministry of Defense operates another two airliner/command post variants, while the Federal Security Service, also known by its Russian abbreviation FSB, has a single airborne command post. Lastly, Tupolev retains a single testbed version of the Tu-214, specially adapted for trials of systems destined for the upgraded Tu-22M3M and Tu-160M bombers. Adapting the Tu-214ONs to one or more of these existing configurations could be an attractive way of boosting the special missions or VIP transport fleets, especially since the easiest route — converting them to commercial airliners or freighters — is unlikely to result in much interest since series production of the Tu-214 for civilian customers was wound up in 2017 after just 54 examples had been built. More ambitious would be using the existing airframes as the basis for one or more of the projected developments of the Tu-214 that so far remain unbuilt. These include the Tu-214PP Porubshchik-M escort jammer, Yastreb battlefield airborne command post, Tu-214P Apatit maritime patrol aircraft, and the UTK DA training aircraft for bomber aircrew. The latter type is required to replace the aging fleet of adapted Tu-134s currently used in the role and would likely include mission systems that made it suitable for training crews for the future PAK DA strategic bomber , as well. As Russia continues to modernize its bomber fleet, bomber crew trainers like this Tu-134UBL are increasingly in need of replacement., Igor Dvurekov/Wikimedia Commons With such a unique capability already installed, and the potential to further develop this to support a wide range of military activities, it seems unlikely that the Tu-214ONs will ever leave Russia, although Rostec does, somewhat optimistically, offer the Tu-214ON package for export, stating that it was “ready to produce [these aircraft for other countries as well.” Any foreign interest in aircraft based on the Tu-214 is likely to be severely limited by the fact that the type has only ever been built in small numbers and there are currently few operators outside Russia. Finally, there is the lingering possibility that Russia might yet return to the Open Skies program. With the statement on withdrawal being fairly vague, there is still room for maneuver. Perhaps Moscow aims to resume flights under the treaty after gaining concessions, whether related to sensor capabilities or flight restrictions in its own airspace. As for U.S. plans for its own Open Skies future, a return to the treaty looks unlikely under the Biden administration, which said that doing so would send the “wrong message,” according to a memo obtained by Defense News . Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force has confirmed plans to retire the aging OC-135B aircraft that were used for the treaty flights, with these now expected to be delivered to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, this summer . Time will tell what happens with Russia and Open Skies but it seems certain that its highly capable Tu-214ON surveillance assets will be busy again, in some capacity, soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 12, 2021",Iran Confirms Its Covert Mothership In The Red Sea Was Attacked,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Iranian government has confirmed that the M/V Saviz was the victim of an attack in the Red Sea yesterday. The ship is widely believed to be a mothership that the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps uses to assist Houthi rebels in Yemen and otherwise conduct discreet activities in the region, particularly around the strategic Bab Al Mandeb Strait . There are reports that Israel carried out the attack and that it is the latest incident in an escalating series of tit-for-tat clandestine operations by the two countries that have primarily targeted each others’ commercial ships. The attack also came on the same day that the United States and Iran held their first indirect negotiations over the future a controversial multi-national deal regarding Tehran’s nuclear programs. Saeed Khatibzadeh, a spokesperson for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, told reporters at a press conference that the attack on Saviz had taken place at around 6:00 AM local time on Apr. 6, 2021, off the coast of the East African country of Djibouti. He said that the damage had been minor and that there were no casualties. He declined to specify the method of the attack, saying the matter is under investigation. In its initial reporting, Iran’s Tasnim News Agency , which is linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said that “information obtained … suggests that the incident happened after the explosion of limpet mines attached to the hull of the ship.” The New York Times subsequently reported that the damage to Saviz ‘s hull was below the waterline. The M/V Saviz seen in a video produced by Al Arabiya in Saudi Arabia in 2018., Al Arabiya capture “Fortunately, no fatalities were caused by the incident, and technical evaluations on how the incident occurred and its origins are underway,” Khatibzadeh said . “Our country will take all necessary measures about it through the international organizations,” he added . The exact nature of the incident otherwise remains murky. “Several Iranian news outlets showed images of flames and smoke billowing from a stricken vessel in the Red Sea, but the full extent of the damage or any casualties was unclear,” according to The New York Times . However, The War Zone has been unable to find any such images online, even ones that might have been purported to show the ship on fire, but were later determined to be unrelated. The Times also reported that an American official had said that Israeli authorities had informed the U.S. government at around 7:30 AM on Apr. 6 that their country had carried out the attack. That same individual told The Times that Israel conducted the operation in direct retaliation for previous Iranian attacks on unspecified Israeli ships. This would appear to be a reference, at least in part, to the Israeli-owned, by Bahamian-flagged cargo ship Helios Ray , which was the victim of an apparent attack in the Gulf of Oman in February. Authorities in Israel subsequently said the IRGC was responsible for that incident, something the regime in Tehran has publicly denied. The Helios Ray incident already appeared to be an Iranian retaliatory operation in response to years of Israeli attacks on the country’s commercial ships. The Wall Street Journal had first reported on that anti-Iranian shipping campaign, which is said to date back to at least 2019 and involve limpet mine attacks on at least a dozen Iranian vessels, in March. The targeted ships were primarily oil tankers, but some were also said to have been carrying weapons and other military equipment bound for Iranian proxy forces in the Middle East. There were also indications that the attack might have been timed in such a way as to ensure that U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower , and elements of its Carrier Strike Group, were sufficiently far away from the Saviz at the time. Eisenhower was reportedly some 200 miles away when the Iranian ship was attacked. The carrier and her escorts had been delayed in passing through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea, in the first place, due to the now-infamous grounding of the container ship Ever Given in that vital maritime chokepoint in March. If it is true that Israel was responsible for the attack on Saviz , it would represent a significant escalation in the country’s clandestine operations against Iran’s ships. Though ostensibly a commercial vessel flagged in the Bahamas, the Saviz is owned and operated by a company linked to the IRGC. It has been operating in the Red Sea continuously since 2017 and Iranian authorities now fully acknowledge that it has a military purpose, though they dispute what it is. Iran’s public position is that the ship is a sea base supporting counter-piracy and other maritime security efforts in the southern end of the Red Sea. “The ship was practically operating as Iran’s logistical station in the Red Sea,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Khatibzadeh reiterated at today’s press conference. “The ship’s information and mission had been already announced to that organization [the International Maritime Organization] officially.” Other reporting over the years, however, has presented considerable evidence that Saviz is a special operations mothership of sorts that is, at least in part, a hub for operations in support of Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. These activities could involve aiding in the smuggling of weapons and other equipment to that group and the gathering of intelligence that could be used to plan attacks on commercial interests of opponents in and around Bab Al Mandeb Strait and elsewhere in the region. Officials in Saudi Arabia, who have led a coalition fighting the Houthis since 2015, have publicly accused Iran of using the ship for these purposes. The Saviz does provide a valuable forward base to support Iranian maritime interests in this region, in general. With this in mind, it’s interesting to note that the Iranian oil tanker Sabiti was observed via satellite imagery sailing toward the Saviz after suffering a reported attack in the Red Sea in 2019. The former ship is believed to be one of the earliest targets of Israel’s anti-Iranian shipping operations. It’s perhaps interesting that the Saviz has gone unmolested for so long now, despite the accusations about its real purpose. The Saudi military even went so far as to rescue an injured Iranian sailor for the ship in 2019, saying it had a humanitarian duty to do so, despite its public position that the vessel represents a threat to its own national interests, as well as those of its partners in Yemen. It’s worth pointing out that that operation would have given Saudi authorities an opportunity to more closely examine the ship, at least externally, and possibly gain intelligence from the evacuee. What may have changed now is not entirely clear, but the attack did come as U.S. and Iranian representatives held the first of what is hoped to be a series of indirect talks via European diplomats in Vienna, Austria. These diplomatic engagements are aimed at paving a way for the United States to rejoin a controversial multi-national deal over Iran’s nuclear program, as well as getting the regime in Tehran back into compliance with that agreement. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from what is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018, a decision that was subsequently followed by the enacting of significant new sanctions against Tehran. The Iranians have since violated all of its key provisions in an effort to pressure the remaining parties to meet its demands and resist American pressure to step up their own sanctions or withdraw entirely. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with many other Israeli officials, as well as a number of members of Congress in the United States, oppose the JCPOA and America’s involvement in it. The Biden Administration, for its part, had initially stressed that Iran would need to get back in compliance first and that it would get no sanctions relief before some sort of deal is struck regarding the return of the U.S. government to the agreement. There have since been reports that American officials were at least considering relaxing some sanctions to get Iran to the negotiating table. “It’s clear what the timing [of the attack] intends to achieve,” a U.S. official told The Wall Street Journal . Any negotiations between the United States and Iran over the JCPOA will be “complicated by Saudi and Israeli interference and their hard-line posture,” an Iranian diplomat also told that newspaper. How Iran chooses now to respond to this attack could further frustrate attempts at renewed U.S.-Iranian diplomatic engagement. At the same time, it also further points to the Israeli government’s willingness to do whatever it feels is necessary to undermine the Iranian regime and keep it isolated on the international stage.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 23, 2021",The F-15EX Is Now Officially Named The Eagle II,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s latest fighter jet, the Boeing F-15EX , has officially been named Eagle II, in a ceremony that took place today at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The event, which also saw a relatively low-key official rollout of the first of these jets, serial number 20-0001, played very much on the illustrious legacy of the fighter with the Air Force, and the choice of name, which is bound to disappoint some, is no doubt intended to draw upon the type’s unrivaled post-war combat record . The first F-15EX had been accepted by the Air Force on March 10 and, after being ferried from Boeing’s St. Louis, Missouri, facility to Eglin, is now undergoing testing by the 40th Flight Test Squadron. This was the first new F-15 to be delivered to the Air Force in 17 years and it represents a major change in the way the service procures fighters and one which could have significant repercussions as it looks to balance its fleet to meet emerging threats. All three current U.S. Air Force Eagle types, the F-15C/D, F-15E, and F-15EX, side-by-side. , 40TH FLIGHT TEST SQUADRON/PUBLIC DOMAIN It was around two and a half years ago that The War Zone broke the F-15X story — before the aircraft received the F-15EX designation. Since then we have provided updates on the fighter and the potential changes it could bring to the Air Force. You can read much more on the topic by clicking here and here. Most recently, we reported on the official confirmation that the F-15EX is now also being earmarked for the carriage of new hypersonic weapons , news that was again indicative of the transformative effect that the jet could have on the Air Force. The service plans to eventually buy at least 144 of these aircraft to replace its aging F-15C/D Eagles and there have also been discussions about acquiring yet more of them to supplant its F-15E Strike Eagles , as well. During the naming and unveiling ceremony today, Lieutenant General Duke Z. Richardson, the Military Deputy, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, noted that 10 percent of the current F-15C/D fleet is grounded due to structural issues, while 75 percent of the jets have exceeded their planned service life. With a 20,000-hour planned airframe lifespan, the F-15EX is likely to be around for at least half a century — all in all, pretty remarkable considering the original F-15 celebrates the 50th anniversary of its first flight next year. The newly named F-15EX will now continue its test program at Eglin, prior to service entry in an operational capacity. A second test jet, serial 20-0002, is in the final stages of production, with delivery to the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron also planned for this month. The 40th Flight Test Squadron and the 85th Test and Evaluation squadron will conduct developmental and operational testing simultaneously . Another four more jets are set to be handed over to the Air Force by the end of Fiscal Year 2023, if not before. The first F-15EX handed over to the Air Force, in the markings of the 40th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin., U.S. AIR FORCE/TECH. SGT. JOHN RAVEN Thereafter, the first jets are due to be delivered to the Oregon Air National Guard’s 173rd Fighter Wing , the Air National Guard’s main F-15C/D training unit, based at Kingsley Field, in Fiscal Year 2024. The following year, the 142nd Fighter Wing, another Oregon Air National Guard unit, at Portland Air National Guard Base, is slated to become the first operational unit to fly the jet in Fiscal Year 2025. Responsible for 93 percent of all homeland defense missions, the Air National Guard will recapitalize all its F-15C/Ds with either F-15EX or F-35A jets, although the precise balance is yet to be disclosed. There remains, too, a question mark over which powerplant will be used for subsequent batches of F-15EX jets. While the first six examples are being outfitted with General Electric F110-GE-129s, the Air Force will hold a competitive process to decide whether to retain this engine or switch to the rival Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-229. The path toward making the F-15EX operationally ready should also be smoothed by using testing data gathered from previous F-15 Foreign Military Sales variants — like the Qatari F-15QA variant upon which the F-15EX is based. Instead of full-up survivability testing on the new aircraft, the Air Force has also elected to call upon existing data, a voice it says will save $108 million and accelerate the testing process. Critical to the aircraft’s survivability will be the Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS), a radar warning and electronic warfare suite that is already in development and which has been put to the test in a large-force exercise scenario onboard the F-15E . As the Air Force increasingly distances itself from longstanding plans to acquire more than 1,700 examples of the F-35A stealth fighter, the future prospects for the F-15EX look good. Already, officials are speaking openly about tentative plans to buy new F-16 fighter jets , as well as to cut F-35A numbers, and focus more on the potential offered by various unmanned platforms . While officials have been keen to reiterate the centrality of the F-35 to its plans, the stealth jet is now increasingly referred to in terms of being a “high-end” fighter, in the words of Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Brown, opening the door to purchases of more cost-effective types, that can be procured rapidly, like the F-15EX. In the meantime, the focus of much attention will be on the less-than-inspired choice of name. Since the original F-15 Eagle, the Air Force has introduced the F-15E Strike Eagle , while the Golden Eagle name was applied semi-officially to the 179 or so F-15C/Ds that were slated to be deeply upgraded and retained. The F-15EX has since displaced those plans. Boeing, for its part, has pushed the Advanced Eagle name while marketing its latest F-15 iterations, of which the F-15EX is directly related. On the other hand, the “II” suffix follows recent trends with the F-35 Lightning II, as well as the Jolly Green II , the Air Force’s next combat search and rescue helicopter. Looking further back, the A-10 Thunderbolt II also directly recalled a historic, albeit unrelated, Air Force type. Time will tell if the new name sticks, or if, like the F-16 Viper , those who fly and maintain the F-15EX use a different nomenclature altogether . The future for the Eagle II, whether you like the name or not, looks bright. This article has been updated with an additional paragraph discussing the naming decision.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jun 29, 2021",Russian Knights Aerobatic Jet Team Launches Live Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Knights aerobatic demonstration team celebrated its 30th anniversary and to commemorate this milestone a promotional video has been published online that provides some spectacular insight into the unit’s six-ship precision formation-flying work. It also includes a rarely seen missile-firing sequence, a reminder that the team’s flight crews maintain their operational qualifications as combat-rated pilots within what is technically a frontline unit. The team’s anniversary video , which was posted today to the Russian Ministry of Defense’s YouTube channel, showcases plenty of aerobatics. This includes low-level formation flying and dramatic breaks by the team’s two-seat Su-30SM and single-seat Su-35S multi-role fighters over the team’s base at Kubinka outside Moscow. The latest Su-35S jets began flying with the team last year and the Russian Knights are expected to operate the two types in parallel for the foreseeable future. One of the team’s Su-30SM fighter jets rolls inverted overhead Kubinka Air Base., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap Most interesting, however, is the sequence starting at around the 1:16 mark in the video, seen below, showing a short-range infrared-guided missile streaking off the port wing of one of the team’s Flankers, leaving a shower of sparks in its wake. The missile is an AA-11 Archer — either a ‘legacy’ R-73 or one of the more modern R-74Ms, which are externally similar. You can read more about those missiles, and the enduring search for a successor, in this previous article . Pilots conducting live-fire missile launches is by no means typical for a demonstration team, whose crews, in the Western world, at least, normally join up and leave their combat duties for a given period, focusing exclusively on demanding display flying, before returning to frontline units. In Russia, it is different, however, and the pilots of the Russian Knights are expected to retain combat qualifications alongside their work as aerial ambassadors for Russia within a unit that’s formally designated as the 237th Aviation Technology Demonstration Center, or 237 TsPAT, to use its Russian abbreviation. In fact, the regiment is technically part of the frontline order of battle and its aircraft are fully combat-capable, only differing in terms of their flamboyant paintwork. Unlike their U.S. counterparts, the jets are not fitted with smoke generators or other major modifications. Cockpit lights illuminate moments before a missile is launched., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap This elite unit actually comprises two aerobatic teams flying from Kubinka. In addition to the Russian Knights, there are the Swifts, flying MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets. Interestingly, alongside these public-facing units, Kubinka also hosts some more shadowy aircraft, such as the Il-20M Coot intelligence-gathering aircraft that was accidentally shot down over Syria in September 2018. Since 2009, the 237 TsPAT has been subordinated to the sprawling Lipetsk center, which is responsible for evaluating new Russian military aircraft, as well as developing tactics and training aircrew. As such, the pilots from the Russian Knights would likely also be expected to impart their expertise on younger aviators as part of the center’s training remit. Beyond that, the pilots of the Russian Knights and Swifts are expected to undertake combat duty if required and therefore fly day-to-day combat training, in common with any other frontline Russian regiment. As part of this, there are periodic opportunities to conduct live firing of weapons. Since the Su-30SM and Su-35S are multi-role fighters, pilots have to be proficient in using air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry. The Russian Knights have flown versions of the Flanker fighter family since they were officially established on April 5, 1991, beginning with the Su-27. While big and heavy, these jets, and the subsequent Su-30SM and Su-35S derivatives have superb aerodynamic qualities and plenty of power. While the original Su-27 remains a good air show performer, the new members of the Flanker family are arguably the best in the world , and also represent some of the most modern multi-role fighters anywhere in the Russian Aerospace Forces. Inside the cockpit of a “Russian Knights” Flanker., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap The badge of the Russian Knights — the unit’s parent regiment dates back to 1938., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap While there have, in the past, been rumors that the Russian Knights might disband , or re-equip with Yak-130 tactical trainers, the fact the unit has both a frontline role and a promotional one is likely to secure its future for many years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 1, 2021",The Army Wants Networked Mines That Leap Up To Attack The Tops Of Tanks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army wants new anti-tank mines that will be able to automatically detect the arrival of enemy vehicles. The complete systems would then fire submunitions into the air that would be able to sense those targets and attack them from above. The top is generally the most vulnerable area on tanks and other armored vehicles . The service also hopes to eventually be able to link these weapons to other types of mines in heavily networked minefields to reduce risks to friendly forces and innocent bystanders. The U.S. Army’s Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey posted a contracting announcement asking for proposals for what it has officially described as “Terrain Shaping Obstacle (TSO) Top Attack prototype” on Apr. 1, 2021. The “top attack” system is envisioned as one part, or Increment 1, of a three-part Common Anti-Vehicle Munition (CAVM) system. The other two planned components are an advanced “bottom attack” mine (Increment 2) and a network architecture (Increment 3) that will link minefields with both types together, as well as to actual humans, via a Remote Control Station (RCS) that can be installed like an app on tablet-like hand-held tactical computers. US Army troops carry XM204 Wide Area Munition systems during a test. The Army says it wants the new CAVM system to be more effective than the XM204., US Army “The top attack system is envisioned to consist of the Common Anti-Vehicle Munition (CAVM) top attack munition, the top attack dispenser launcher module (DLM), the Remote Control Station (RCS), and an obstacle planning capability,” the Army’s contracting notice explains. “Obstacle planning” here referring to the process of figuring out the exact desired layout of minefields. The top attack mines themselves need to be able to effectively engage targets up to 164 feet away. “Emplaced systems shall be capable of operating in a standby mode for up to six months with the ability to transition to a pre-armed mode for 30 days,” the contracting announcement says. As for the RCS, the Army wants it to be able to oversee up to 12 individual minefields, each covering an area of around 400,000 square feet, on average. The service says the individual DLMs and the RCSs should connect via two-way line-of-sight datalinks with ranges up to around 3.1 miles. A two-way connection allows the minefields to communicate their ‘health,’ such as whether individual mines have engaged targets or have somehow become non-functional, to a human operator. This would also allow soldiers to switch minefields on and off at will, allowing friendly forces to pass through or disabling them should innocent bystanders suddenly enter the area. “A device shall display authoritative safety information with a 1 in 1 million probability of false display of safe to the RCS operator,” according to the contracting notice. The Army does not specify how the top attack mine would function, but this would not be the first such system the service has acquired. “The CAVM top attack munition shall have improved lethality over previous generations of top attack munitions (M93 Hornet and XM204),” the service makes clear. The M93 Hornet , also known as the Wide Area Munition (WAM) entered service in the early 1990s. It used seismic and acoustic sensors to spot targets. After that, the M93 would fire a submunition with an infrared sensor, which would then zero in on that target. An M93 mine as it looks when it is emplaced., via FAS A proximity sensor would then detonate the submunition above the vehicle in question. Its warhead was designed in a way wherein the explosive force would create a fast-flying 450-gram tantalum armor-piercing slug, as well as additional shrapnel for added effect, including against any nearby personnel. The Army had plans to integrate the M93 into various mine-dispensing systems, such as Volcano , which can be mounted on trucks or helicopters to rapidly emplace minefields across wide areas. However, this did not come to pass, and the Hornet has remained primarily a hand-emplaced system, making it hard to employ quickly on a large scale. Readily available details about the XM204 are more limited, but it is described as a “munition system” that launches submunitions from a manually-emplaced launcher on the ground. It is also referred to as a “Wide Area Munition,” suggesting that it could simply be a ground-based dispenser for use with the existing M93 or a derivative thereof. It’s also interesting to note that the Army is now starting to look for an apparent replacement for both the M93 and the XM204, despite the latter system only having gone through key System Engineering Review processes last year. The outcome of those reviews is unclear, but they were also delayed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. US Army soldiers carry an XM204 system., US Army In addition, it’s worth mentioning that the form and function of the actual mines in these systems, as well as the planned future CAVM system, is similar in many respects to the BLU-108/B Sensor Fuzed Munition (SFM), which you can read about in more detail in this past story . Components of SFM were derived from an earlier landmine project known as the Extended Range Anti-Armor Mine, or ERAM. The U.S. Air Force continues to field cluster munitions, also known as Sensor Fuzed Weapons (SFW), loaded with SFM submunitions. This is also not the first time the Army has explored networked ‘smart’ minefields with an eye toward improving reliability and safety, as well as limiting the potential for unexploded mines to turn into hazards for civilian populations long after a conflict had ended. The Gator Landmine Replacement Program , which the service initiated in 2016, was one such effort. Gator is a family of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines designed to scattered across large areas in various ways, including via the ground-based Volcano and air-dropped cluster munitions. “The Army’s end goal is to create a munition that can be detonated remotely by a soldier — a design feature that in theory could reduce the risks that land mines pose to civilians. It could also keep the United States aligned with — but still not signatory to — an international treaty signed by more than 160 countries that bans the use of antipersonnel mines, but does not prohibit mines designed to destroy vehicles like tanks and armored personnel carriers,” according to a 2018 New York Times story . “Since 2016, the Army has spent $106 million on this initiative, called the Gator Landmine Replacement Program, yet it is still in its early stages.” In 2018, the Army was already talking about a new family of mines that included common top and bottom attack types, networked together and dispensed using various systems. The CAVM system appears to be a direct outgrowth of these efforts and it is clear from the contracting notice that the goal is to be able to disperse these mines in multiple different ways. A 2018 US Army briefing slide describing a new family of mines that could be emplaced in various ways., US Army “To enable future operational needs, the top attack Common Anti-Vehicle Munition (CAVM) design should consider compatibility with delivery platforms such as 155mm tube artillery, developmental Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF), robotic ground vehicle platforms , current and future vertical lift (FVL) aircraft, unmanned aerial aircraft , and fixed wing aircraft ,” the contracting notice says. LRPF is a term that covers various new longer-range weapons now in development for the Army, including the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) 155mm self-propelled howitzer and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). While these emplacement methods would allow US forces to rapidly seed minefields across broader areas, including behind enemy lines to complicate an opponent’s movements, it’s not clear how this would work with the stated networking plans. Beyond-line-of-sight datalinks would be required, which have been under discussion a component of the CAVM system in the past, to connect human operators to those minefields. A US Army briefing slide showing the various components of a notional future networked CAVM minefield that includes satellite-enabled beyond-line-of-sight datalinks., US Army The Army, as well as the U.S. military as a whole, has focused heavily on plans to incorporate some kind of ‘man-in-the-loop’ control scheme into future landmine designs as a counter to criticism about its continued use of these kinds of weapons. Opponents of landmine use point primarily to the dangers these weapons, especially if emplaced indiscriminately, can present to civilians well after a conflict has come to an end. The United States is notably not a signatory to the Ottawa Treaty , which came into force in 1999 and is focused on the elimination of anti-personnel mines, specifically. There are 164 signatories to that deal to date. It is worth noting that this agreement does not cover anti-tank mines, or dual-purpose anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, as well as any mines that can be employed in a mode where they are remotely triggered, such as the M18A1 Claymore . President Barack Obama had instituted restrictions that prohibited any use of anti-personnel mines outside of the Korean Peninsula, where minefields are a key component of defenses along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea. President Donald Trump’s administration had relaxed those rules in January 2020. Just today, the Pentagon confirmed that, at least so far, neither President Joe Biden nor his Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, had made any changes to America’s landmine policies. “Landmines, including anti-personnel mines, remain a vital tool in conventional warfare that the United States military cannot responsibly forgo, particularly when faced with overwhelming enemy forces in the early stages of combat,” Mike Howard, a Pentagon spokesperson told The Daily Beast on Apr. 6, 2021. “Withholding a capability that would give our ground forces the ability to deny terrain temporary and therefore shape an enemy’s movement o our benefit irresponsibly risks American lives.” The New York Times subsequently reported that the Pentagon clarified that U.S. landmine policy is now again under review. Again, however, it important to stress that the Obama-era restrictions and the changes made under Trump only apply to anti-personnel mines and have had no impact on the use of anti-tank types, such as the Army’s planned future CAVM system. There has also been a general resurgence since the end of the Obama years in new anti-armor capabilities across the U.S. military . This was prompted in no small part due to new concerns about a potential conflict with Russia following the Kremlin’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. This region has recently reemerged as a potential flashpoint amid a worrisome Russian troop buildup, which you can read about more here . The Russian Army already fields a diverse array of tanks and other armored vehicles and has been working to upgrade and expand those fleets . Armored vehicle developments in China have also become a point of concern for the U.S. military in recent years as it works to better prepare itself for a potential large-scale conflict in the Pacific region. All told, even if President Biden does end up bringing back Obama’s landmine policies, the Army looks set to push ahead with the development of new, advanced anti-tank mines, and the networks and other subsystems to go with them, to help counter enemy armored forces during future conflicts.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 23, 2020",New Telescopes Will Help Space Force Watch For Hostile Satellite Activity,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Space Force, the U.S. military’s newest branch , will be making use of new ground-based telescopes to keep watch on objects in orbit during the daytime, offering a key advantage over existing technologies that typically operate at night. Once installed, the six telescopes will be able to observe objects more than 22,000 miles distant and could give warnings of space-based anti-satellite weapons maneuvering toward US satellites, for example. The telescopes and related technology are being provided by Numerica, a Colorado-based start-up that already operates various ground-based telescopes. SpaceNews reported on the development, noting that the firm funded the technology for this latest venture using $3 million provided by the U.S. Air Force. The first $750,000 of this was won as a Small Business Innovation Research award during a 2019 pitch-day event hosted by the Air Force, as the service sought to attract space industry enterprises to the military sector. The remaining funds were then provided to fully mature the technology. One of Numerica’s deep-space telescope stations at a site in Spain., NUMERICA The six new daytime telescopes are being installed in Colorado as well as at locations in Australia and Spain, Todd Brost, the director of special projects at Numerica, confirmed to SpaceNews . Interference from sunlight makes telescope tracking of space objects a difficult challenge and one that has, traditionally, required large and expensive telescopes to address. Numerica has been a pioneer in developing telescopes to provide daytime commercial tracking services of satellites, ensuring that these objects can be pinpointed around the clock, and not just in the hours of darkness. The company says its telescopes use “high-speed shortwave infrared cameras, customized optics, and advanced algorithms” to observe Earth-orbiting satellites. In the process, the company claims, these telescopes are not only becoming increasingly autonomous but also cheaper to operate. “The greatest interest from the government side,” Brost said, “is maintaining custody of high-interest objects for longer periods of time so you know whether they maneuver, or if they’re doing something unusual.” The ability to watch satellites at all times obviously has significant implications for the military, especially amid confirmation from the Space Force last summer that Russia had conducted two on-orbit anti-satellite weapon tests in the previous three years. There have also been other instances of unusual activity relating to Russian satellites, including so-called “inspector” satellites able to deploy other satellites themselves, and apparently dubbed “nesting doll” satellites by the U.S. military, which you can read more about here . A diagram showing unusual activity by Russian so-called “inspector” satellites during 2019 and 2020, including at least one apparent on-orbit anti-satellite weapon test last year., CENTER FOR STRATEGIC & INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Last year the U.S. military expressed concern about a Russian inspector satellite that appeared to be shadowing an American KH-11 spy satellite. A graphic showing the position of Cosmos 2542, a Russian “inspector” satellite, and an American KH-11 spy satellite, known as USA 245, in January last year., VIA @M_R_THOMP For its part, Russia insists that its inspector satellites are intended to get close to the country’s other space-based systems, to examine them if they break down or otherwise malfunction. These kinds of craft are also notably small and highly maneuverable, making their detection harder. However, using these telescopes, the service could be able to keep an eye on any satellites approaching their U.S. counterparts, perhaps with the intent to disrupt or destroy them , or otherwise to spy on them. Increasingly, it appears, Moscow is at least testing technology and concepts that would provide it with the means of disrupting or destroying other space-based platforms, whether by a kinetic attack, electronic warfare jamming, or even a high-powered microwave beam . An infographic from the Defense Intelligence Agency depicting a number of ways in which one satellite might attack another, including by acting as a kinetic kill vehicle., DIA As well as the inspector satellites in the Cosmos family, other Russian satellites have also performed suspicious movements in recent years. According to the Center for Strategic and Internal Studies (CSIS), last year the Luch military communication satellite maneuvered next to seven other satellites, including examples originating from Europe, the U.S., and commercial Asian operators. “Though these orbital maneuvers are no longer rare for this particular satellite, the vast majority of satellites that operate in [geostationary orbit] are stationary, which makes the activity of Luch highly unusual year after year,” CSIS stated in its latest report on the topic. The kind of capability offered by these new ground-based telescopes could be very useful for the Space Force. Above all, keeping an eye on the movements of suspicious satellites from Russia or elsewhere would be a top priority for the U.S. military, in order to protect its own space-based assets. The critical importance of satellites to the U.S. military is hard to overstate, with these providing a whole range of capabilities including early warning , intelligence gathering , communications and data-sharing, navigation and weapons guidance , and others. As such, during (or in advance of) a large-scale conflict, they would be prime targets for potential enemies capable of combatting them, of which Russia is the most capable in the space domain. Russia, however, is not the only power with access to various anti-satellite systems. China , and other countries, too, are also working on ground-based and air-launched interceptors and directed-energy weapons . The new telescopes will be owned and operated by Numerica, but all imagery and data gathered will be made available to the Space Force. Brost also told SpaceNews that, in the future, building sites for the exclusive use of the military could also be a prospect, with “discussions” now underway between the company and the Pentagon. Brost confirmed to SpaceNews that a prototype telescope system is already tracking active satellites in the middle of the day “pretty consistently.” Next, the company will combine the imagery from its daytime telescopes with that from nighttime sensors to provide a complete picture. Intriguingly, Brost also observed that, by using his company’s telescopes, the Space Force may also be able to secure imagery from locations that would otherwise be beyond its reach, perhaps for political or geostrategic reasons. “A couple of our sites that we’re looking at are in places that it’d be very doubtful that the U.S. government could put sites there,” Brost admitted. Currently, Numerica has more than 130 optical sensors of different types at more than 20 locations worldwide. Wherever these daytime telescopes are ultimately located, it all points to the Space Force looking to establish a satellite tracking sensor network that draws upon both military and commercial assets and technology and which is increasingly distributed. Recently, the Space Force also announced that its Space Surveillance Telescope (SST), pictured at the top of this article, had achieved “first light” after its move from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, to Harold E. Holt Naval Communications Station in Western Australia. The SST is part of the U.S. Space Surveillance Network , into which data is also fed by various radars . Space Force also has additional space-surveillance radars as part of its $1.5-billion Space Fence system. Located on Kwajalein Island in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Space Fence became operational just over a year ago and its radar data would be fused with telescope imagery as part of round-the-clock space surveillance operations. This system also helped fill a general gap left by the decision to shutter the older Cold War-era Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS), also known colloquially as Space Fence, in 2013. This latest deal with Numerica also underscores the increasing interest across the U.S. military in leveraging private companies’ capabilities with regards to space operations to increase capacity in various areas , including communications. The use of the Numerica telescope network is also further evidence that the Space Force is increasingly positioning itself as a critical strategic actor in any potential future confrontation with a sophisticated enemy with access to space. To start with, the service will be expected to keep a close and constant watch on what other countries are doing in space , and the Numerica telescopes look like they could be a capable — and affordable — step in that direction.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 29, 2021",Broken ARRW: Air Force’s First Hypersonic Missile Fails During Inaugural Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s hotly anticipated first live-fire flight test of a prototype AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic missile, or ARRW, was unsuccessful. The service says there was “an issue on the aircraft,” a B-52H bomber assigned to the 419th Flight Test Squadron out of Edwards Air Force Base in California, and it “did not launch” the weapon. The abortive test was conducted over the Point Mugu Sea Test Range in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California on Apr. 5, 2021. This came a day after the end of a self-imposed 30-day deadline that the Air Force had announced on March 5. The plan had been for this launch to validate the performance of the missile’s rocket booster, as well as the separation of a simulated unpowered boost-glide vehicle payload. The surrogate vehicle was not designed to actually fly and was expected to disintegrate after release from the missile body. US Air Force personnel work on an AGM-183A captive-carry test article loaded on a B-52H bomber during an earlier test., USAF “Instead, the test missile was not able to complete its launch sequence and was safely retained on the aircraft which returned to Edwards AFB,” according to an official Air Force press release. The Air Force has conducted seven previous flight tests involving captive-carry test articles that are not designed to be released from the B-52Hs carrying them. At present, the service plans to buy at least eight full-up AGM-183A prototypes, some of which could be deployed in a limited operational capacity depending on how future flight testing goes. “The ARRW program has been pushing boundaries since its inception and taking calculated risks to move this important capability forward,” Air Force Brigadier General Heath Collins, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Weapons, said in a statement. “While not launching was disappointing, the recent test provided invaluable information to learn from and continue ahead. This is why we test.” A complete prototype of the AGM-183A with an actual hypersonic boost-glide vehicle inside its nose has also yet to be tested. Operational examples of these weapons will use their rocket boosters to loft those vehicles to an optimal speed and altitude. After that, the wedge-shaped vehicle is designed to glide toward its target along an atmospheric flight trajectory at hypersonic velocity, defined as anything above Mach 5. The boost-glide vehicle is cable of making more unpredictable movements compared to traditional ballistic missiles, even those with maneuverable reentry vehicles. This gives the hypersonic weapon distinct advantages for penetrating through hostile air and missile defenses to reach time-sensitive or other high-value targets. The combination of speed and maneuverability also presents novel challenges to opponents when it comes to spotting and tracking these weapons, which, in turn, makes it extremely hard to defend against them in any way, including simply trying to move critical assets out of the target area. The Air Force has previously said that ARRW will only need between 10 and 12 minutes to hit targets 1,000 miles away. This could suggest the weapon has an expected average speed of between 5,000 and 6,000 miles per hour, or roughly between Mach 6.5 and Mach 8. This first flight test had already been much anticipated, having been pushed back twice already since the end of 2020. Notices to Airmen (NOTAM), which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had begun issuing 10 days ago, regarding airspace restrictions over a particular area in the Pacific near the Point Mugu Sea Test Range had already indicated that this test was imminent. The most recent set of NOTAMs covered restrictions today, April 5. Ahead of the official announcement regarding the test, plane spotters, using online flight tracking software, had also noticed one of NASA’s WB-57F test aircraft, which has the U.S. civil registration code N927NA, flying an orbit near this restricted airspace. The WB-57Fs can be configured to carry various payloads to support different types of tests. Recent sightings of N927NA have confirmed that the aircraft is presently flying with a nose-mounted turret containing electro-optical and infrared video cameras, a sensor system that has been used to gather visual data about missile tests in the past. Images showing a NASA WB-57F with the sensor turret nose, at left, and a look at the displays for those cameras inside the aircraft, at right., NASA/Southern Research Online flight tracking data also showed that two U.S. Navy P-3C Orion aircraft belonging to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 30 (VX-30) out of Naval Air Station Point Mugu in California were flying orbits in the same general area. It is unclear if this activity was in any way related to the ARRW test. At the same time, the Navy does employ P-3 variants for range control , which involves, in part, ensuring that no unwanted guests stray into restricted airspace during tests, as well as other testing support purposes. USAV Worthy , a U.S. Army missile range instrumentation ship, was also observed arriving in San Diego in late March. This ship, which carries multiple radars able to collect valuable telemetry data, has supported hypersonic testing in the Pacific in the past. The failure of the first live-fire ARRW test also notably comes after Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, had some choice words with regards to the U.S. Army ground-based Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) program. LHRW is that service’s half of a joint effort with the U.S. Navy . “Honestly, I think it’s stupid,” Ray said of LRHW in an edition of the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute’s Aerospace Advantage podcast released on March 31. “I just think it’s a stupid idea to go and invest that kind of money that recreates something that the service has mastered and that we’re doing already right now.” What Ray was referring to in regards to what the Air Force has already “mastered” is Bomber Task Force (BTF) deployments and other long-range bomber missions , which the service routinely conducts around the world. His position was that adding hypersonic weapons to those aircraft would be simpler than the Army’s plans for all-new LRHW units and concepts of operation to go with them. Ray went on to raise multiple criticisms of the Army’s project, specifically the potential difficulties in finding locations to base LRHW units in the Pacific region, where a number of American allies have already said they will not host these weapons. Other elements of the Department of Defense have, however, voiced support for hypersonic weapon developments across the Air Force, Army, and Navy, including as part of broader plans in the Pacific to contain the Chinese government’s expansionary behavior and general growing influence. The comments from the head of AFGSC do point to a potential looming budget battle, wherein the success or failure of certain systems in testing could be a major factor. Regardless, while this failed test can only be disappointing for the Air Force, it still no doubt provided important new data that the ARRW program will be able to make use of going forward. The AGM-183A remains set to be the Air Force’s first operational air-launched hypersonic weapon and is a capability, as General Ray underscored, that the service views as critical to its future high-end concepts of operation again major potential adversaries, especially China.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 28, 2021",Stealthy Valkyrie Drone Uses Weapons Bay For First Time To Launch Smaller Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the U.S. Air Force’s XQ-58A Valkyrie stealthy, affordable unmanned aircraft has, for the first time, released a store from its internal payload bay. The latest test flight, the sixth for the Valkyrie, saw the payload bay doors open for the first time in flight, to drop one of the much smaller ALTIUS-600 drones. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) announced the milestone test today , although it took place at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground test range, Arizona, on March 26. The test was conducted by the Air Force, working together with Kratos, which produces the Valkyrie, and Area-I, responsible for the ALTIUS 600 , which the Air Force describes as a small, unmanned aircraft system, or SUAS. On April 1, Anduril Industries announced it had bought Area-I, which would continue to operate under that name as a wholly-owned subsidiary. An XQ-58A Valkyrie launches at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, during a separate test in December 2020., U.S. AIR FORCE/STAFF SGT. JOSHUA KING While the release of a store from its internal payload bay was the highlight, the sixth flight of the Valkyrie included other important test points, too. The Kratos drone continued to expand its operating envelope by flying “higher and faster than previous flights,” Alyson Turri, the demonstration program manager, said, although no performance figures were provided. “Successful operation of the internal weapons release system/function along with further aerodynamic envelope increases continues to assert the incredible capability and cost-per-performance value of the low-cost attritable XQ-58A Valkyrie,” Steve Fendley, President of Kratos Unmanned Systems Division, said. “Additionally, this unique and key mission function success adds an exclamation point to the 30-month development of the Valkyrie system by the Kratos and AFRL team, which resulted in a pre-production system with substantial operational capability, not simply a proof-of-concept flight demonstrator.” The Valkyrie involved in the test also appears to be the third airframe completed so far, wearing the Air Force serial number 15-8003. The initial XQ-58A, serial number 15-8001, took its first flight in March 2019, but suffered a mishap later the same year while completing its third flight. 15-8001 has been used as part of the AFRL’s Low-Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program, which has served as a stepping stone to the Skyborg project, which is focused on the development of various technologies that go into semi-autonomous “ loyal wingman ” type unmanned aircraft and, eventually, fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). In December 2020, the Air Force announced that it had hired Kratos, as well as Boeing and General Atomics, to build actual prototype drones to carry the Skyborg suite of systems. A third XQ-58A, 15-8002, has been used as a platform to explore attritable drone concepts of operation, as well as a testbed for new communications gateways to help different stealthy aircraft “talk” to each other. Attritable refers to systems that are designed to be low-cost enough that they can be employed in high-risk situations that might preclude the use of a more costly, exquisite asset. It’s not clear how many XQ-58As the Air Force presently intends to acquire for its various test efforts. A photo accompanying today’s press release also shows the ALTIUS-600 drone being ejected rearward from the bay, via what appears to be a downward-angled Common Launch Tube (CLT). Using the CLT, an increasingly popular method of launching small payloads across the U.S. military, would make good sense and suggests that the Valkyrie could also be able to launch any of the other stores that can use these tubes, including Raytheon’s AGM-176 Griffin missile, the GBU-44/B Viper Strike glide bomb, or the GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition (SGM). A battery of Common Launch Tubes mounted in an MD 969 helicopter ., MD Helicopters It’s unclear how many tube-launched ALTIUS-600s the XQ-58A might be able to hold inside its internal bay. The Valkyrie has previously been said to be able to carry at least two 250-pound class GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), but it may actually be able to carry up to four of those weapons. As for the specific store used in this first test of Valkyrie’s payload launch capability, the choice of the ALTIUS-600 demonstrates the goal of having the XQ-58A be able to launch smaller drones, as opposed to weapons, for the time being, at least. The ALTIUS-600 — or Air-Launched, Tube-Integrated, Unmanned System 600 — has been launched from U.S. Army MQ-1C unmanned aircraft , as well as UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters , in various tests in recent years. A UH-60M Black Hawk launches an ALTIUS 600 drone during a test last year., U.S. Army Weighing less than 30 pounds, the ALTIUS 600 can itself carry various types of payloads weight between three and seven pounds, including full-motion video cameras, small signals intelligence systems, or even a kinetic warhead. The same SUAS could also be a candidate for the Army’s new family of air-launched multi-purpose unmanned aircraft with swarming capabilities, which you can read more about here . On the Air Force side, the latest experiment combining the Valkyrie with the ALTIUS 600 parallels General Atomics’ work with its Sparrowhawk small drone , which was used in captive carry tests aboard an MQ-9 Reaper drone last September. Unlike the ALTIUS 600, the Sparrowhawk was not launched from the Reaper, but it also differs in that it is intended to be recoverable in flight. Sparrowhawk is also significantly larger than the ALTIUS 600, which, in terms of size, has more in common with the Raytheon Coyote . The coyote drone is similarly designed for launch from the CLT and has so far been delivered from manned aircraft, but there is no apparent reason why they couldn’t also be launched from drones like the Valkyrie, too. It’s also worth noting that the Pentagon recently announced the completion of the Low-Cost Cruise Missile (LCCM) research and development program that involved the Coyote Block 3 version , together with an associated launcher, a jam-resistant datalink, and a software package intended to enable these drones to operate as an autonomous swarm. This work conducted as part of that project has now been provided, in various parts, to the Air Force, as well as the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, to help with other ongoing efforts A graphic depicting the sequence of a Coyote Block 1 drone deploying from a launcher on a ship., Raytheon While the potential mission spectrum of the Valkyrie, or its evolved successors, encompasses electronic warfare, or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), either in groups of loyal wingmen operating with manned aircraft or in networked autonomous swarms , the ability to launch drones itself opens up new possibilities. As already noted, the Valkyrie was designed from the outset to be a low-cost drone that could be operated in scenarios from which it wouldn’t necessarily return. Giving it the capability to launch even less expensive drones, in turn, could not only increase the effects delivered by the XQ-58A, but also boost its own survivability. What is more, the small size of the ALTIUS 600 would allow a Valkyrie or a small team of them, to leverage support from a proportionally much larger swarm of SUAS drones, either working cooperatively with each other autonomously or collaboratively with the Valkyries. The ALTIUS 600., U.S. Army As well as explosive charges to attack ground targets, other possible payloads for the ALTIUS could include different types of sensors, which could, for example, enable an ISR-tasked Valkyrie to dramatically increase its surveillance coverage during its mission. For self-protection, or to overwhelm hostile air defenses during an offensive operation, the ALTIUS 600s could work as stand-in jammers by packing electronic warfare payloads or act as decoys , thereby protecting not only their Valkyrie launch platform but also friendly manned aircraft or cruise missiles in the vicinity as part of a larger coordinated operation. Indeed, the Valkyrie now seems well placed to deploy lower-tier swarms as part of wider aspirations across the entire U.S. military to field this kind of capability. In this way, the Valkyrie could exist in a gray area between non-expendable (including manned) platforms and expendable platforms, delivering multiple SUAS-type drones into harm’s way. These could then prosecute networked missions, including attacks, using the kind of capabilities that are being demonstrated as part of the Golden Horde flight tests , which began late last year . With the air launching of the ALTIUS 600, the latest in a series of boundary-pushing tests that could help shape the way air combat is conducted for many years to come, the Valkyrie’s adaptability is looking ever more attractive. No doubt, it will be fascinating to see how the drone-launched drone concept, in particular, develops from here. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Drones"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At a roundtable with reporters today, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday, the U.S. Navy’s top officer, was asked about a series of bizarre incidents that took place in July 2019 and involved what only have been described as ‘drones’ swarming American destroyers off the coast of Southern California. The War Zone was the first to report in detail on this series of mysterious events after the incident was originally uncovered by filmmaker Dave Beaty. Asked by Jeff Schogol of Task & Purpose if the Navy had positively identified any of the aircraft involved, Gilday responded by saying: “No, we have not. I am aware of those sightings and as it’s been reported there have been other sightings by aviators in the air and by other ships not only of the United States, but other nations – and of course other elements within the U.S. joint force.” “Those findings have been collected and they still are being analyzed,” Gilday added. “I don’t have anything new to report, Jeff, on what those findings have revealed thus far. But I will tell you we do have a well-established process in place across the joint force to collect that data and to get it to a separate repository for analysis.” At the time of writing, it is unclear if Admiral Gilday was referring to the Department of Defense’s Navy-led Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), created last August to examine “incursions by unauthorized aircraft into our training ranges or designated airspace.” A Senate-requested report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena is expected later this year. Representatives from the UAPTF could not be reached for comment. A preliminary response to our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiries indicates that the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) possesses documents about the incident and that they are intermingled with records from several other agencies. This would make sense as the UAPTF was established within ONI , according to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Schogol also asked if there was any suspicion that the aircraft described as drones were “extraterrestrial.” Gilday responded, “No, I can’t speak to that – I have no indications at all of that.” The War Zone has reached out to the Navy, Coast Guard, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for further details regarding the drones flying near Navy destroyers in 2019. Members of the intelligence and armed services committees in both the Senate and the House were asked for comment, as well. While at least some elected officials indicated they were aware of the issue, none were able to make a statement at this time regarding the encounters off the coast of Southern California two years ago.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 8, 2021",Netflix’s The Crown Is A Love Letter To Aviation,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After capping off its fourth season, it is no secret that Netflix’s The Crown , which follows the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, is a cinematic tour-de-force. While the acting, writing, sets, and costumes all get much acclaim, one element of the show’s world-building magic that doesn’t get enough attention is its near-perfect attention to detail in how it portrays aviation’s intersection with the Royals’ lives. In fact, I would go as far as to say that aviation is another supporting character of The Crown’s superb and ever-morphing cast. When watched through its current four-season run, it becomes clear that the series subtly acts as a love letter to aviation in its own right. I came to watch The Crown via a circuitous route. I checked out the first episode half a decade ago when it premiered and, for whatever reason, found it a bit dour. In retrospect, I quit not just due to that first impression really, but more so because of distractions from other shows that were released around the same time. As it went on to win award after award I never found the time to come back to it—I wouldn’t call myself a big enthusiast of the Royal Family and the never-ending aura of palace intrigue that surrounds it. Then, with the release of season four, and knowing that it would span the 1980s, including Margaret Thatcher’s time in office as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and many geopolitical events I was interested in, I gave it another shot. What I quickly learned is that not only was the show absolutely incredible in pretty much every way, but it really wasn’t just about the Royal Family’s notorious insider melodrama, it was just as much a political drama as anything else. A couple of episodes into season four, I was hooked, big time. Screengrab via IMPDB.org Since then, I have watched the rest of the series in chronologically reverse order, which, oddly enough, worked out amazingly well. While the earlier seasons of the show were definitely stuffed with period romance, the kind of which the last two seasons couldn’t compete with due to the portrayed progression of time, the level of writing and the complexity of the storytelling evolved triumphantly throughout the series back half. Some episodes are working on so many levels that you have to really take a step back to admire just how well written and edited they are. Still, the production— that marvelous production —really is worth the price of admission in itself. Throughout the globe-spanning and at times almost dream-like ride The Crown takes us on, and even as the cast switches completely every two seasons, one constant that stands out above all else is how much care was put into every single scene involving aviation. And there are a lot of them, to say the least. I have never seen a show so removed from transportation technology at its core, yet work so hard to make its transportation technology set-pieces so accurate. Each and every scene that an aircraft appears in just oozes passion for the topic. Vickers Super VC-10 in a classic BOAC livery., Screengrab via IMPDB.org Aviation was and still is a huge part of the Royals’ lives, with the show kicking off in 1947 and ending its fourth season in 1990, it has aircraft, and the use of air transportation in general, seeded throughout. In a way, it gives a unique depiction of aviation history, including the progression from the piston engine age to the jet age, just as it does of U.K. history. While the writers definitely brandish their artistic licenses in crafting the show’s plot, it doesn’t do the same with the aircraft it features. The DC-4 is among the first flying machines to star in the show. , Screengrab via IMPDB.org Even the aircraft interiors are remarkably accurate and beautifully reproduced., Screencap Not only was flying a staple act for Royals executing their duties, but there are large plot threads based around Prince Philip learning to fly and the death of many of his exiled family members aboard a Nazi Junkers Ju 52 . Even a flashback of a flyover of Windsor Castle by Avro Lancaster bombers during World War II is executed in a way in which you feel like your standing right there looking up. Those types of scenes also make you happy you invested in good home theater audio as the sound editing is fantastic. Roaring Lancasters depicted in formation over Windsor Castle., Screengrab via IMPDB.org Not a single aircraft is glaringly out of time and place throughout The Crown’s four seasons. From the soon-to-be Queen flying off to Kenya on Douglas DC-4 in the early 1950s to Princess Diana jetting off on her New York tour aboard a Franco-British Concorde , it’s all there, and it is absolutely gorgeous. It is so refreshing to see reasonably accurate depictions of the real and somewhat obscure aircraft flown during each period of time the show covers, not just some convenient stand-in plane picked off the shelf. And they are all there. As you move through the series and the decades you will be showered with Vickers Viscounts , De Havilland Devons , and so much more. And yes, the RAF Red Arrows flight demonstration team also make an appearance. All that being said, if you really dig through every aircraft and date, you will be able to find one or two discrepancies, but these would be extremely trivial in nature, like an aircraft showing up a year before it entered service or in a different livery. A couple of flying sequences may be a tiny bit embellished, as well, but they serve as key plot points, so that is understandable. Overall, it’s very impressive, and really, when it comes to production, this is what The Crown is all about—extreme attention to detail that immerses the viewer in a rich historic bubble. How they make this happen is fascinating in itself , but for the aircraft, they use a mix of real aircraft, practical sets, and CGI to make them come alive in the moment. RAF De Havilland DH.104 Devon C.1 starring in an episode of The Crown. , Screengrab via IMPDB.org Just to underscore how much of a triumph The Crown’s homage to aviation is, take another big-budget show streaming right now that is actually all about aviation— For All Mankind . I am a fan of this show. It is engrossing and it doesn’t play the alternate timeline/reality card too heavily considering it underpins its premise, which allows it to work well. The acting and characters are great. Yet, amazingly, what it is inconsistent at, at best, is actually depicting the aviation and spaceflight events the plot demands with believability and accuracy. It can go from engrossing to distractingly cheesy in an instant when it depicts flying sequences. This is not nitpicking from an aviation nerd, it really takes you out of the moment with how cartoonish these scenes can get. I consider this a huge loss and overall missed opportunity for what is otherwise a good show. It almost seems that somehow For All Mankind’s production team thought that good drama could just paper-over rickety aerospace action sequences. Clearly, I would beg to differ in that regard. This comparison provides a stark contrast. That The Crown is not about aviation at all, but it goes so far and works so hard to give its aerospace-related moments such wonderful treatment, which largely separates it from the pack. The fact that it does flying sequences remarkably better than a show about flight also proves that The Crown’s attention to detail is an equal opportunity proposition—nothing gets a pass. Princess Diana aboard a Concorde. Even the interiors of the various aircraft depicted were largely accurate. Note Concorde’s tiny windows in this shot. , Screengrab via IMPDB.org A Concorde depicted at JFK Airport in New York with amazing accuracy. , Screengrab via IMPDB.org There is so much in The Crown for other transportation aficionados, as well. The cars increasingly take center stage as the show moved forward—Jags, Aston Martins, Rolls Royces, and Land Rovers galore. What’s better is that they all ‘feel’ lived in, replete with whining breaks and faded canvas tops. We also get great depictions of other forms of royal transport, like the royal train and the iconic royal yacht, HMY Britannia . So, if any of this interests you, you should start streaming The Crown immediately. While you may have come for the planes, trains, automobiles, you will end up falling in love with everything else this marvelous series has to offer. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 17, 2020",Israel’s New Surveillance Jet Combines Two Other Aircraft’s Missions Into A Single Airframe,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israeli Air Force has unveiled a new multi-mission intelligence-gathering aircraft, the Nachshon Oron. The new aircraft will join an existing fleet of airborne early warning and signals intelligence platforms, all based on the Gulfstream bizjet airframe , but will add important new capabilities, including those focused on the maritime domain. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) announced yesterday that the Oron had been formally unveiled by 122 Squadron, “Nachshon,” a specialist intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) unit at Nevatim Air Base in Israel’s Negev desert. The aircraft, based on a Gulfstream G550 airframe, arrived in Israel last month, after delivery from the United States where it was manufactured and flight-tested. It wore the temporary registration N552GD for its delivery flight, which took it via a stopover in Shannon, Ireland. The first Nachshon Oron after arriving at Nevatim Air Base., Amit Agronov/Israeli Air Force Exactly how many examples of the Oron the IAF will acquire has not been revealed, nor whether it is intended to supplement or to eventually replace some of the service’s existing three Shavit (signals intelligence) and two Eitam (airborne early warning and control) aircraft. These are also flown by 122 Squadron and are based on Gulfstream 500/550 executive jet airframes. The mission avionic suite aboard the new platform is being developed for the Israeli Ministry of Defense by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), which described it as “the world’s most advanced intel (ISR) mission aircraft.” However, the mission systems have not yet been integrated, a process that will take up to two years to complete, after which the aircraft will be declared operational. Already, nine years have been spent on designing and developing the aircraft and its subsystems. “The Oron is yet another manifestation of the IAF’s increasing effectiveness,” said the IAF commander, Major General Amikam Norkin, during the aircraft’s acceptance ceremony. “The aircraft adds another layer to the IAF’s current operational and strategic capabilities, which allow for continued air superiority in the Middle East and an ability to defend Israel’s skies and ensure its security.” Outwardly, the Oron appears similar to the Eitam, with prominent “cheek” radomes grafted onto the sides of its fuselage. In the Eitam, these contain antennas for the Elta EL/M-2085 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, with others in the nose and tail helping to provide 360-degree coverage. These radars are likely to be retained on the Oron but have almost certainly been upgraded — the Eitam first entered service back in 2006. The Shavit, meanwhile, is configured for the signal intelligence (SIGINT) mission and entered IAF service in 2005. It is fitted with ground-scanning radar capable of ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging in a long fairing below the fuselage and examples are frequently seen operating over the Mediterranean, off the Syrian coast. Examples of the Israeli Air Force’s Nachshon Shavit (left) and Nachshon Eitam (right)., Oren Rozen/Wikimedia Commons The Oron’s advanced sensors — including radar — are intended to survey large swaths of land, air, and sea, and the aircraft itself will bring together three discrete missions: aerial imaging, airborne early warning and control, and maritime intelligence-gathering. “The majority of these capabilities already exist in our squadron and the Maof Rahav unit [a joint IAF and the Israeli Intelligence Corps], however, with the new aircraft, we managed to condense them all onto a single flight platform,” explained the deputy commander of the 122 Squadron, identified only as Major I. In addition to its more advanced onboard systems, compared to the Shavit and Eitam, the Oron also has workstations for a larger number of mission crew, including intelligence person to analyze the collected data in real-time. The precise number of crew was not disclosed, but the original Eitam jet is understood to carry at least six operators, plus two flight crew. It also has the ability to send the information it collects to ground stations for exploitation. IAF commander, Major General Amikam Norkin, speaks during the welcome ceremony for the Oron., Amit Agronov/Israeli Air Force “We’ll need to choose the right personnel to perform several missions during a flight,” explained Major I., reflecting the fact that the aircraft will be able to perform a wide range of operational missions even in a single sortie. In fact, so significant is the aircraft’s multi-mission capability that the IAF is already considering whether operating it will require changes to the squadron’s organizational structure as well as new types of mission profile compared to the Shavit and Eitam. Israeli media sources are already suggesting that the Oron will have particular relevance to intelligence-gathering and target identification missions directed against objectives in Iran, Iraq, and Yemen, and elsewhere in the region. “The IDF and the air force already have a variety of intelligence-collection capabilities, but the Oron strengthens our superiority and our ability to operate in the second and third tiers and to move between fronts rapidly and over a long period of time,” IAF chief Amikam Norkin told the Times of Israel . Second-tier countries are those that have been identified as posing a direct threat to Israel but don’t share any borders with it, like Iraq and Yemen, while the third tier covers threat countries that are located even further away, primarily Iran. Yemen has become the focus of increased Israeli attention of late after reports emerged that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels operating there now possess Iranian-supplied “ suicide drones ” capable of reaching Israeli targets . More recently, Iraq has also become the focus of Israeli attention as it seeks to prosecute Iranian proxies operating in that country , too. Then there are the repeated Israeli attacks launched against Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria, where Iran has been seeking to establish an increasingly robust permanent military presence, from where it can, in turn, support militant groups in the region, including providing advanced weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Last December, IDF Spokesperson Hidai Zilberman was quoted by the Times of Israel as having told a Saudi news outlet that Iranian proxies operating in Iraq or Yemen were capable of attacking targets in Israel and he pointed to the threat posed by Iranian-supplied unmanned aerial vehicles and “smart missiles,” in particular. The Oron, once fully operational, could be used to not only monitor these kinds of threats, at a considerable distance from Israel, but also coordinate any potential offensive action that might be taken against them. According to the Times of Israel , Brigadier General Yaniv Rotem, head of research and development at the Israeli Ministry of Defense said the new aircraft would allow the military to more easily identify targets for attack, using mission systems supported by artificial intelligence. “We have made a machine that knows how to create and expose targets in all weather, in very short periods of time — mere seconds — over plots of land of thousands of [square] kilometers and at ranges necessary for attacks,” Rotem said. The fact that multiple types of intelligence can be brought to bear from a single platform will allow for rapid fusion of those intelligence types to create a more complete picture of the situation at any given time. This actionable intelligence could then be leveraged for prosecution by other tactical platforms. Not long ago, the U.S. Air Force was looking for a very similar capability , but this was mysteriously passed over . We believe this capability set is still being pursued by the USAF, albeit via an unmanned stealthy drone form that is highly networked in nature and remains hidden in the shadows at this time. The 122 Squadron, “Nachshon,” insignia is applied on the tail of the Oron., Amit Agronov/Israeli Air Force Yoav Turgeman, vice president of IAI, reiterated that the all-indigenous equipment onboard the Oron “will improve the ability of the [Israel Defense Forces] on a number of fighting fronts, principally in the air force’s abilities to conduct strikes.” This kind of capability has already been proven in combat by the earlier Eitam, during the three-week Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip in December 2008 and January 2009. On that occasion, this aircraft located ground targets for airstrikes and generated a complete picture of the operational theater for Israeli commanders. As well as identifying targets, including those on the move, the Oron would likely serve as a communications node linking together the various branches of the Israel Defense Forces and their assets — including unmanned assets — in any large-scale operation. With the F-35I stealth fighter, known locally as the “Adir,” now well established in IAF service , it seems likely that the Oron will also be expected to analyze and disseminate the huge quantity of information gathered by this aircraft, too. Aside from being a critical node in any potential IAF airstrike against targets in the so-called second and third tiers, and operations closer to home , the Oron’s new maritime intelligence-gathering capability is also highly significant. As Israel’s maritime security interests expand beyond the eastern Mediterranean to include activities in the waters around Yemen, for example, a platform of this kind is of particular importance, while Israel has also been suspected of being behind a series of clandestine attacks on Iranian vessels . The Oron could also provide a useful adjunct to the Israeli Navy’s new Sa’ar 6 class corvettes, which you can read about in detail here . Among these warships’ key missions will be defending offshore gas platforms within Israel’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the eastern Mediterranean. Having a long-endurance aerial surveillance presence to monitor this area would help protect a major strategic asset that provides the majority of Israel’s energy requirements. Overall, the unveiling of the Oron demonstrates again the wide-ranging modernization drive that the IAF is currently engaged in. The fact that the Oron will be able to conduct a variety of critical roles in the course of a single mission suggests it’s likely to be a regular participant in a range of peacetime and combat scenarios once fully operational.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 23, 2022",These Are The Two Companies Competing To Build The Army’s Next Arctic Combat Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has chosen two teams, one made up of U.S. company Oshkosh Defense and Singaporean firm ST Engineering, and another involving two divisions of BAE Systems, to compete in the service’s Cold Weather All-Terrain Vehicle competition, or CATV. The goal of the CATV program is to acquire new tracked vehicles specifically for operations in and around the increasingly strategic Arctic region to replace the service’s aging Cold War-era Small Unit Support Vehicles , or SUSVs. Oshkosh Defense announced that it, along with ST Engineering, had been selected to provide a version of the latter company’s Bronco 3 articulated carrier for the CATV competition, on Apr. 5, 2021. BAE Systems has not yet issued its own press release, but the Army confirmed to Defense News that it is also competing for the CATV contract. The company had submitted its Beowulf design for consideration last year. The Army had first revealed it was looking for a replacement for the SUSVs, which the U.S. Marine Corps also operates, in 2018, as part of a project that was then known as the Joint All Weather All Terrain Support Vehicle (JAASV). A US Army Small Unit Support Vehicles (SUSV)., US Army The Army acquired its fleet of SUSVs, which are versions of the Swedish Hägglunds BvS-206D articulated carrier, in the 1980s. These vehicles, which are amphibious, as well as capable of being air-dropped or carried slung underneath a helicopter, have received various upgrades over the years and remain in limited service . However, the design is out of production and they are increasingly difficult to maintain. Tim Goddette, the Army’s Program Executive Officer for Combat Support and Combat Service Support vehicle programs told Defense News that they are “no longer sustainable.” “Oshkosh Defense and ST Engineering will deliver two prototypes – one General Purpose and one Cargo vehicle for testing and soldier evaluation” in the third quarter of this fiscal year, which began on Apr. 1, according to a press release from Oshkosh. “The prototypes will be evaluated on payload, mobility, crush resistance, swimming, and transportability.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=VUnRmbcI3oM “Oshkosh Defense and ST Engineering bring together an abundance of defense industry and manufacturing expertise to address the U.S. Army’s need for a proven vehicle that can easily maneuver in arctic environments,” Pat Williams, Vice President and General Manager of U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps programs at Oshkosh, added in a statement. “We are confident that the Oshkosh CATV will enable Soldiers to efficiently move personnel and supplies in the most extreme conditions, and we look forward to getting them into the hands of the end user for testing and evaluation.” The Bronco is an articulated carrier, meaning it consists of a forward and a rear section, linked together by a common, flexible drive chain. A key benefit of this configuration is the ability to better navigate steep inclines compared to more traditional tracked vehicles, since the two halves can move independently, making it easier for them to keep their tracks fully on the ground, as the vehicle moves over the obstacle. A SUSV demonstrates the benefits of an articulated design with respect to moving over inclines., US Army The original Bronco was developed in the 1990s and entered Singaporean military service in 2001. It was followed by the improved Bronco 2 variant and the U.K. armed forces also operated a version known as the Warthog. Thailand is the only other country to operate Bronco type. A British Warthog, a variant of the ST Engineer Bronco family., Crown Copyright The amphibious Bronco 3, unveiled in 2017 and which passed through Arctic testing in 2019 , is the latest iteration of the design and is based, in part, on lessons learned from the British experience with the Warthog in Afghanistan. The new carrier has a v-shaped hull, as well as a revised internal configuration, to increase survivability against mines and improvised explosive devices. It also has a greater payload capacity compared to its predecessors, while still being able to hit speeds of just over 40 miles per hour on improved roads. It has extremely low ground pressure, aided by its rubber-band-type tracks, giving it excellent off-road mobility, including over snow. The track design also offers advantages in maintenance and logistics over traditional metal link-type tracks. Perhaps most interesting is the Bronco 3’s modular design, which allows for the rear section to be rapidly reconfigured for different roles using standardized modules. Beyond the general-purpose troop and cargo-carrying types, ST Engineering already offers a fire-support version armed with a 120mm mortar and computerized fire control system. The vehicle can also be armed with a remote weapon station on top of the front cab that can accommodate various kinds of weapons, giving personnel inside an immediate self-defense option without having to leave the relative safety of the vehicle. In a very cold weather environment, this is even more important, as it means the personnel inside do not have to expose themselves to the elements, either. Though the BvS-206 series is out of production, Hägglunds, which is now a BAE Systems subsidiary, does still make articulated carriers, with its latest offering being the Beowulf. The BAE actually first publicly revealed this design at the annual National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS) symposium in 2016. Beowulf is an improved version of the rubber-tracked BvS10 design and also has a top speed of around 40 miles an hour, as well as a range of 250 miles on a single tank of gas. Interestingly, the British armed forces also operated a version of the BvS10, known as Vikings, and that earlier design is in service with other European military forces. The BvS10, as well as old BvS-206 variants, can be also be configured to carry various heavy weapons, including TOW anti-tank missiles and mortars, as well as remote weapon stations, and it seems very likely that Beowulf will have similar armament options. British Vikings in Afghanistan in 2009., Crown Copyright BAE has said in the past that this new variant remains air-portable slung under a CH-47F Chinook . UH-60 Black Hawks could also carry the vehicles to a landing zone via sling load, but each one of these helicopters could only one half of one vehicle, which would then have to be reassembled after arriving at its destination. That is something the Army trains to do now with the existing SUSVs. UH-60 transportability, as well as the need for the vehicles to be air-droppable from a C-130-type cargo aircraft , were among the requirements the Army had outlined as part of the initial JAASV effort in 2018. A CH-47F Chinook carries a SUSV via sling load., US Army A UH-60 Black Hawk with the rear half of a SUSV slung underneath it., US Army The Army has told Defense News that it wants to have all of the initial prototypes delivered by June 14 and then plans to send them to the Cold Regions Test Center in Alaska for tests that run from August through December. The service expects to choose a winning design by the end of June 2022. The CATV program has $6.6 million earmarked for research and development in the 2021 Fiscal Year budget and another $9.25 million set aside to actually begin buying vehicles, according to Defense News . The Army says it plans to buy around 110 examples in the first order and eventually acquire a fleet with at least 163 vehicles, in total. Oshkosh Defense has said the expected production contract could eventually grow to 200 CATVs. It’s not clear whether all of those would be for the Army or if that might include examples to replace the Marine Corps’ SUSVs, as well. Whatever design the Army chooses, in the end, will provide valuable added mobility for units operating in the Arctic, both for routine movements and during combat. While the service only looks interested in acquiring personnel and cargo-carrying variants initially, as already noted, the Bronco 3 and Beowulf have room available to configured for various other kinds of missions. Possible payloads could include mortars or other indirect fire support weapons, or other capabilities, such as electronic warfare suites . Like the existing SUSVs, the future CATVs could be valuable for other missions in cold weather climates, including humanitarian assistance or disaster relief operations. Various Army National Guard elements maintain small SUSV fleets in part to conduct these kinds of emergency missions domestically in cold weather environments. A SUSV with a police-style light bar on top specifically configured for the Colorado Army National Guard’s Snow Response Team., CO ARNG Regardless, the Army’s intent to purchase new, specialized Arctic vehicles underscores the growing significance of that region to the service , as well as elsewhere across the U.S. military and among America’s allies and partners.  Of the $9.25 million the service received to buy CATVs, Defense News reported that $8.25 million of that was added by Congress on top of what the service had initially requested, highlighting the general consensus that there is increasing potential for conflict in the High North. The U.S. military, as well as others, including near-peer competitors, especially Russia , as well as China , are steadily expanding their abilities to project power in the Arctic. Geopolitical competition in the region is already increasing as global climate change has caused ice to recede, presenting emerging economic opportunities, including newly viable shipping lanes and access to untapped natural resources, including oil reserves. The new CATVs, dozens of which the Army looks set now to take of in the coming years, will provide important added mobility and other capabilities during any future operations in the Arctic or other cold-weather environments.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are coming in quickly, but a U.S. Park Police Bell 412 helicopter was seen making an unusual landing on the lawn outside of the east front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., following a major security incident. The U.S. Capitol Police says that two of its officers were injured when a car rammed into a security barricade outside of the building. There are reports that the driver then exited the vehicle wielding a knife and was shot by other Capitol Police officers. The two officers injured when the car hit the barrier, as well as the suspect, were then sent to an unspecified hospital. A picture of the car crashed into the barrier outside of the US Capitol building in Washington, D.C., on Apr. 2, 2021., AP A close-up, enhanced look at the contents of the vehicle’s trunk., AP Video footage of where the car crashed into the barrier had shown first responders bring out stretchers to tend to those who had been injured. One of the U.S. Capitol Police officers is reportedly in critical condition. The incident also triggered a general lockdown and sent sirens and alerts blaring from a “Giant Voice” emergency public address system, which you can read more about here . That system had also been set off after a fire broke out near the Capitol on Jan. 18, which was quickly determined to not actually have been a security threat. The Capitol Police also instructed people within the overall Capitol Complex to seek shelter, including in underground tunnels, which you read more about here . Separately, there were reports that the D.C. National Guard had begun mobilizing personnel to respond to any further incidents. Security in Washington has been heavy since a mob stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6 in the run-up to President Joe Biden’s inauguration . The Capitol complex and significant surrounding areas are now literally fenced off. In March, a decision was also made to keep National Guard elements in place in the city at least until late May , citing concerns about the potential for future attacks. The U.S. Park Police is the law enforcement component of the National Park Service and has jurisdiction in various locales across the United States, including various areas in and around Washington, D.C. Their Bell 412 helicopters, which are equipped with sensor turrets under their noses containing electro-optical and infrared video cameras, routinely conduct patrols in the skies over the nation’s capital. Park Police officers also train to fire small arms for the doors of these helicopters at threats on the ground. An older picture of a Park Police Bell 412 helicopter. Note the officer in the door with an AR-15/M16-type rifle., AP The ability of the Bell 412 to land right outside the Capitol that was demonstrated today is interesting in itself, as it points to tactics, techniques, and procedures that could be employed in so-called continuity of government operations . Under these plans, the U.S. military and other government agencies are prepared to quickly move senior officials, especially the President and their closest advisors and leaders of Congress, to secure, hardened locations, including various underground bunkers , to ensure the U.S. government continues to function even in the midst of severe crises. A wide array of helicopters stationed around the capital are tasked with this doomsday mission. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE, 3:05 PM EST: The U.S Capitol Police has now confirmed that one of its officers succumbed to the injuries they sustained in this incident. The suspect who drove the car is also dead. Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said the incident “does not appear to be terrorism-related” and that “we just don’t know” what the suspect’s motives were. It has also been confirmed that a National Guard Quick Reaction Force (QRF) was deployed to the Capitol. Overall, the incident has shined a light on the contingency response plans that are now in place around the Capitol. UPDATE, 4:05 PM EST: The D.C.

Adam Kehoe,"Updated on Aug 27, 2021",China’s Liaoning Carrier Strike Group Passes Through Japan’s Miyako Strait,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning , passed through the Miyako Strait, just southwest of Okinawa, on Sunday. The reworked Russian-built carrier appeared to be traveling with a retinue of five ships that make up its strike group. According to a report from the Japan Self Defense Forces, the group included: 2 Type 052D Luyang class destroyers 1 Type 055 Renhai class missile destroyer 1 Type 054A Jiangkai class II frigate 1 Type 901 Fuyu class fast combat support ship Imagery of the Liaoning’s carrier strike group that moved through Miyako Strait., Japan Self Defense Forces Additionally, the JSDF detected a Shaanxi Y-9 flying over the Miyako Strait, and ultimately scrambled to intercept it. China has uniquely configured Y-9s for a number of roles. Usually, they are of the electronic surveillance or maritime patrol type when they are involved in an incident like this. That way, the aircraft can monitor the response to the vessels’ presence and garner valuable intelligence on a nation’s readiness and sources and methods used to track the flotilla. The track of the Y-9., JSDF JSDF In recent years, Japan has routinely scrambled aircraft to intercept territorial incursions, largely in reaction to Chinese overflights. According to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, there have been thousands of such scrambles in recent years. While the Miyako Strait provides a narrow passage of international waters through Japan’s exclusive economic zone, it is widely seen as a highly strategic waterway. Speaking to The Diplomat , a specialist in Chinese security affairs for the United States Air Force, Ben Lowsen, said, “Chinese strategists see these passages as crucial to their ability to deploy forces beyond the first island chain.” The Liaoning ’s movements, while legal under international law, demonstrate Beijing’s increasingly assertive posture and their growing familiarity with integrated carrier strike group operations in the open ocean. In addition to the Y-9 intercept, during the same period of time, Taiwan reported aircraft incursions in their airspace. Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense reported an overflight from a PLA Shaanxi Y-8 transport over the Taiwan Strait: Track of a Chinese Y-8 transport around the same time as the carrier group’s transit through the strait. , Taiwan MoD Provocative ship movements are also nothing new in the region. The Liaoning previously crossed the Miyako Strait with its strike group in April 2020, creating international headlines . At the time, China boasted the only operational aircraft carrier in the region after the USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Ronald Reagan were forced pier-side due to COVID-19. The Chinese carrier’s first transit through the strait occurred five years ago, in 2016. AP The carrier’s move also comes at a tense time in other contested areas that China is asserting its growing might over, namely in the South China Sea. On March 22 the Philippines demanded that China remove more than two hundred vessels spotted near a disputed reef. A recent expose by Foreign Policy demonstrated that dozens of the vessels are part of the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM), following a categorical denial from Chinese officials . While this most recent incident in the South China Sea is another in a long line of aggressive acts orchestrated by the Chinese in the littorals, Liaoning moving out beyond the first island chain with a mature strike group is a reminder of the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s blue-water ambitions. These are only set to grow as the country’s naval capabilities and overall capacity to project power afar continue to improve . With Liaoning and its indigenously-build clone, Shandong , now operating with their carrier strike groups on a regular basis, as well as China’s third carrier—the Type 003—deep under construction in Shanghai, and more advanced carriers in development, Beijing’s commitment to the power-projection capabilities of the aircraft carrier is crystal clear.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2021",Army Makes Gargantuan Bet On New Augmented Reality Goggles For Its Soldiers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army recently awarded a massive contract, which could ultimately be worth close to $22 billion over the next decade, to Microsoft for the production of new augmented reality vision systems. These helmet-mounted systems feature advanced sensor fusion capabilities, similar to those found on the latest generations of night vision and other image-enhancing optics. In addition, they will have the ability to project a wide array of data piped in from various sources, including off-board platforms, providing improved situational awareness and other potentially game-changing benefits to troops in the field. The Army announced the deal for production of what it calls the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) on March 31, 2021, but said that it had actually been signed five days earlier. The contract includes “a five year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)-like ordering period” and “five one-year options for CLS [contractor logistics support],” with “a potential agreement ceiling of $21.88B,” the service told Breaking Defense . A soldier wears an Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) headset during an experiment in 2020., US Army It’s not clear how many IVAS units the Army might eventually buy, but it has talked about purchases of as many as 40,000 of these systems in the past. The U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. special operations forces might also piggyback onto those orders in the future. “The IVAS aggregates multiple technologies into an architecture that allows the Soldier to Fight, Rehearse, and Train using a single platform,” the Army said in its March 31 press release. “The suite of capabilities leverages existing high-resolution night, thermal, and Soldier-borne sensors integrated into a unified Heads Up Display to provide the improved situational awareness, target engagement, and informed decision-making necessary to achieve overmatch against current and future adversaries.” IVAS is a militarized derivative of Microsoft’s commercial HoloLens augmented reality system. The company began selling the first generation of Hololens in 2016. The initial IVAS prototype variants, also known as Capability Set 1 and 2, or CS1 and CS2, were effectively HoloLenses with some modifications to meet the Army’s requirements. Those systems proved to not be robust enough for military use, notably being unable to work in the rain . Since 2019, the current version, known as Capability Set 3 (CS3), is much more rugged and was just recently put through cold weather testing in Alaska. US Army General John Murray, head of Army Futures Command, tries out an earlier IVAS prototype in 2019., US Army Troops conduct cold weather test involving the IVAS CS3 version in March 2021., US Army As already noted, the goal of IVAS is to provide individual soldiers with a wealth of capabilities and important data in a similar fashion, in broad strokes, to what one might expect to see from the kinds of helmet-mounted displays used by the pilots of combat aircraft . Projecting all that information on a helmet-mounted visor is very much akin, in concept, to the advanced helmet used by pilots flying variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . IVAS has night vision and thermal video cameras, which allow individuals to see at night or through smoke, dust, and other obscurants, much like more traditional night vision or thermal optics. It will be able to fuse those feeds together to maximize the fidelity and other benefits that these different kinds of imagery offer in different environments. The system might eventually be able to automatically spot and mark objects of interest for the user and IVAS reportedly already has some level of facial recognition capability, which could assist in positively identifying specific individuals during raids. In the future, artificial intelligence-driven systems could further help speed up the process of identifying potential threats that might not be immediately obvious, especially in an actual firefight where things can easily be quite chaotic. Those kinds of capabilities are already being integrated into larger fire control systems on vehicles , as seen in the video below. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xSrZVfJsuuY IVAS can also pipe in a video feed from a suitable optic mounted on a rifle , carbine , or a machine gun , giving personnel a way to peer around corners or into other hard-to-reach areas without first having to expose themselves to any significant degree to possible enemy fire. In the same way, sensor feeds from off-board platforms, including video cameras mounted on manned or unmanned aircraft, including tiny drones that individual soldiers can deploy themselves, as well as ground vehicles, can be projected right onto the visor. “In the past, as the soldier in the back who’s going to actually be dismounting [from a vehicle] on the objective you may have a single screen to look at that can maybe toggle between the driver’s view or the commander’s view, or the gunners view, or perhaps you’re looking through periscope blocks or asking the crew themselves what is actually happening around you,” Army Sergeant First Class Joshua Braly said after taking part in a test of the IVAS together with new remote vision systems installed on M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles and a Stryker wheeled armored vehicles earlier this year. “But overall when you are buttoned up in the back of a platform you have very limited situational awareness to what you’re walking into.” A soldier wearing an IVAS headset stands in a hatch on a Stryker armored vehicle during a test in 2021., US Army “This changes how we operate honestly,” Army Sergeant Philip Bartel, a member of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, who also took part in that test, added. “Now guys aren’t hanging out of vehicles in dangerous situations trying to get views on what’s going on.” In this particular test, the combination of IVAS with the cameras mounted on the vehicles allowed troops in the rear compartment to “see” through the hull to was happening outside. This is similar to how the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) works on the F-35. Various branches of the U.S. military, as well as other militaries around the world and private companies, have already been exploring how to apply similar technology to other aircraft , as well as ground vehicles and even ships . Many of these vision-enhancing capabilities are already offered by advanced night vision optics, such as the Army’s own Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENVG-B). You can read about those goggles in more detail here . https://youtube.com/watch?v=XTG29w9tf-w The big additional capability that IVAS brings to the table is its augmented reality functionality. This means additional data can be projected onto the visor, such as map information and waypoints, locations of potential enemy forces or innocent bystanders, and more. The way IVAS is designed, that kind of symbology could be presented in a way that appears more directly overlaid on the object in question, such as a building or other terrain feature, rather than simply an icon on a flat screen. “The system also leverages augmented reality and machine learning to enable a life-like mixed reality training environment so the CCF can rehearse before engaging any adversaries,” the Army noted in its press release. What the service is talking about here is developing capabilities so that simulated opponents and other objects, including vehicles or buildings, can be virtually inserted into actual live training exercises. This is a capability that a company called Red 6 is also developing for aerial combat training, as you can read about more in these past stories . Augmented reality training holds the promise of being able to conduct larger-scale exercises involving a wider array of enemy capabilities without having to physically simulate every aspect of an exercise . This, in turn, presents potential cost savings and opens up the possibility of using less robust facilities for more complicated training. This could also help simplify more complex training exercises involving personnel on the ground, as well as in the air. Red 6’s Dan Robinson explained this potential use of distributed augmented reality to help with training, as well as in operational contexts, to The War Zone during an interview last year, saying: Just let me give you an example, if there’s a special forces guy on the ground calling in an attack on, let’s say, a tank, or a farmhouse, or something like that, and it’s a training scenario, well, wouldn’t it be great if that tank was synthetically generated and the guy on the ground is in our AR system, talking to the individual up in his airplane that’s about to drop a smart bomb on that tank or something like that? Wouldn’t it be great if they could see the same common picture within the augmented world? And we’re calling that the joint augmented battlespace because you’re exactly right. We’re solving, probably the most complex challenge of all, because airplanes flying around at multiple hundreds of miles an hour in three dimensions, well, if we’ve solved it for that we’ve certainly solved it for a tank, a boat, whatever it is on the ground. The ability to connect those individuals together is something that represents a truly exciting and massive market opportunity. And it doesn’t stop there. I touched upon it a little earlier because I think whilst there are massive training applications for this, there are also massive operational applications through this technology. Let me give you an example, guys and girls on the ground fighting for their lives trying to call in close air support . For the individual in the cockpit that’s about to press that button, that’s a tremendous amount of stress, especially if they’re in a sort of danger-close scenario, right where there are troops in contact. You want to make sure that you get that right. So, we all just used the traditional ‘nine line’ to call in close air support, and stuff like that. Well, what if we were connected in an augmented world? And, we could paint targets on the ground, bad guys and good guys clearly delineated through whatever visuals you wish to use. It would take away ambiguity, it would shorten the kill chain massively, and it would absolutely save lives, and there are multiple applications that we could think of and discuss, but I think there are huge operational aspects for this tech as well. It’s not immediately clear when the Army, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps and elements of U.S. Special Operations Command, might expects to reach an initial operational capability with the IVAS system. The service says that there is still further test and evaluation to be done even after signing this new contract. Future budgets could have an impact on the project, as well. Congress notably trimmed $230 million from IVAS’s research and development in the National Defense Authorize Act (NDAA), which was passed and signed into law earlier this year. A US Army soldier demonstrates how to put on an IVAS headset., US Army It’s also worth noting that Microsoft has faced some controversy for this work in the past. In 2019, employees sent a letter to company executives demanding a halt to work on the project over criticisms about helping to turn warfare into a “video game” and helping the U.S. military “increase lethality.” Still, the Army’s ability to move in the space of around two years from the CS1 version of the system to the latest, much more capable model it has been using in experiments for months already shows that considerable progress has already been made toward making this potentially revolutionary capability a reality.

Brett Tingley and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 25, 2020",The Cheyenne Attack Helicopter Had A Crazy Rotating Gunner’s Seat Right Out Of Star Wars,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne was the world’s most advanced attack helicopter in its heyday, sporting revolutionary features that were far ahead of their time . Unfortunately, the Cheyenne program never fully succeeded due to technical issues, program management shortfalls, changing procurement priorities, high cost, and a crash in 1969 that left a test pilot dead. Despite never entering service, the Cheyenne left a profound impact on the concept of close air support and attack helicopter design, and today holds a special place in military aviation history. Looking back, one of its wildest features was a gunner’s seat that literally swiveled 360 degrees along with its weapons. Over half a century after appearing on the AH-56, that gunner’s station looks like something straight out of a Star Wars space battle sequence. The need for a U.S. Army attack helicopter presented itself quickly when the United States entered the Vietnam War, although the Army’s search for a close air support and/or attack helicopter dates back to at least 1957 . When the U.S. Army deployed the 57th Medical Detachment to Vietnam in March 1962, it sent along Bell UH-1 Iroquois, better known as “Hueys.” Large numbers of additional Hueys followed as more divisions were deployed to Vietnam. Many of these Hueys in Vietnam were subsequently armed, including with improvised weapon systems crafted by troops in the field. By the late 1960s, the U.S. Army was testing a wide variety of weapons on the Huey, including various automatic weapons , anti-tank guided missiles , and rocket launchers. AH-56 Cheyenne firing rockets., U.S. Army After seeing the clear need for a well-armed multi-mission attack helicopter for its involvement in the worsening Vietnam War, the U.S. Army established the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) in 1964 to develop and procure a new attack helicopter. In 1965, the service declared Lockheed as the winner of the AAFSS program contract, and 10 prototypes of their proposed attack helicopter were ordered. The Army designated the helicopter the AH-56A and nicknamed it the Cheyenne. The Cheyenne sported aerodynamic features not seen on other helicopters of its time. A nearly 4,000-horsepower turbine engine and a pusher propeller on the tail boom allowed the helicopter to hit a 224-mile-per-hour cruise speed and dash at speeds up to 240 miles per hour. The Cheyenne had 26.7-foot fixed wings to supply lift, which, combined with the pusher propeller, took much of the aerodynamic load off of its rigid main rotor. Supplying thrust with the pusher propeller meant that, unlike standard helicopters, the Cheyenne could quickly accelerate and decelerate without pitching its nose up or down. Conversely, the Cheyenne could also pitch its nose up or down while hovering without moving forward or backward. U.S. Army Bob Mitchell, the curator of the U.S. Army Aviation Museum, says that this combination of aerodynamic features gave the Cheyenne a key advantage over other attack helicopters at the time. “One of the key factors in gunship operations – certainly when conducting diving fire – is that your speed builds exponentially, so you only have a couple of seconds to acquire, engage then start your recovery,” Mitchell said in an interview for an official Army story on the AH-56 in 2018. “On the Cheyenne, the pilot could enter his dive, then reverse thrust on the pusher to slow the aircraft down considerably, allowing him to fixate on the target, fire and then start his recovery. For that reason alone it was a beautiful gunship.” The Cheyenne’s unique ability to distribute fire during its attack runs didn’t stop there. The Cheyenne had a two-seat tandem cockpit with the pilot in the rear and an advanced fire control suite for the gunner in the front seat. One of the craziest features of the Cheyenne was this gunner’s seat and control station. Reminiscent of the gun turrets on World War II bombers, and like the swiveling gunner seats in the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars , the Cheyenne’s gunner’s seat, sighting system, and firing controls rotated a full 360 degrees to allow the gunner to face the direction in which he was firing, even completely to the rear. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation Youtube GIF A periscope sight allowed the gunner to aim the 30mm XM140 cannon in the belly turret with 360-degree direct fire capability. This drastically expanded what a potential attack run could look like for a helicopter of the era and increased the tactical flexibility of the helicopter overall. The pilot wore a then-cutting-edge helmet-mounted display (HMD) that would also allow them to independently aim the helicopter’s nose-mounted turret. This forward turret could accommodate either a 7.62mm Minigun or a 40mm M129 grenade launcher . The gunner’s cockpit in the Cheyenne with its swiveling chair and control station., Public Domain In addition to the turrets, the Cheyenne featured six hardpoints on its stub wings on which it could carry pods loaded with 2.75-inch rockets, wire-guided BGM-71 TOW antitank missiles, or external fuel tanks, among other stores. The Cheyenne’s fire control system featured doppler radar and a laser range finder, both well ahead of their time. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation Many elements of the Cheyenne’s avionics systems were revolutionary, as well. The AH-56 sported an automatic flight control system and multiple radar systems, all connected to a then-state-of-the-art digital “Computer Central Complex” (CCC), allowing it to safely operate at low altitudes. Central to this was the Cheyenne’s AN/APQ-118 terrain-following radar system , manufactured by Norden, which could be used in both manual terrain-following (MTF) and automatic terrain-following (ATF) modes. Journal of the American Helicopter Society According to a 1971 study of the Cheyenne’s radar system published in the Journal of the American Helicopter Society, the computing suite in the AH-56 combined what were then cutting-edge avionics, including a forward-looking radar (terrain-following radar, or TFR), an automatic flight control system (AFCS), a vertical situation display (VSD), and a plan position display (PPD), enabling “safe, low altitude penetration of territories under IFR and night conditions.” Other sensor capabilities, including infrared and electronic support measures, as well as datalink systems, could help the unique helicopter act in an advanced scout and forward fire support director role. The Cheyenne entered flight testing in 1967, including an initial test at Van Nuys Airport in which the Cheyenne wowed onlookers with its ability to “bow” to the crowd, that is, lowering its nose while in a stationary hover. Testing continued until March 1969, when the third Cheyenne prototype experienced unexpected vibration of its main rotor during a flight test. The vibrations caused the rotor to strike the canopy and tail boom of the aircraft, killing pilot David A. Beil instantly. In the aftermath of the crash, the Army immediately issued Lockheed a Cure Notice, a statement made by the government that a contractor has failed to meet its requirements. Two months later, the service’s Cheyenne production contract with Lockheed was terminated. The Cheyenne below its maker’s title., Public Domain The Cheyenne program then languished in bureaucratic purgatory for several years until the Army officially canceled it in 1972. Not that long after, the Army launched the Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) program, which would eventually lead to the AH-64 Apache. Official reasons for the AH-56’s cancellation were numerous, as we previously stated. However, according to the “ Abridged History of Army Attack Helicopter Program ” prepared by the Office of the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (OAVCSA), there were numerous other problems related to the management of the program and not the helicopter itself, including the OAVCSA’s claim that Lockheed did not have “adequate helicopter experience.” Lockheed never pursued the development of another helicopter, although today’s Lockheed Martin Corporation develops helicopters through its Sikorsky subsidiary. Another reason for the program’s demise was that the Cheyenne was designed at somewhat of a transitional period between analog and digital avionics. By the time the Army canceled the AH-56 program, digital avionics, which were lighter, faster, more reliable, more precise, and had better night and all-weather capabilities, were beginning to be developed. The cost of transitioning the AH-56 over to these new systems was also cited as a factor in its cancellation. The far simpler Bell Cobra, which was developed adjacent to Cheyenne as a low-risk alternative, was seen as a far cheaper and readily available option, in part due to it sharing an engine, transmission, and rotor system with variants of the Bell UH-1 Iroquois already in service. Out of the 10 AH-56 prototypes that Lockheed built, four aircraft survive to this day: two are on display at the Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker in Alabama, one is at Fort Polk in Louisiana, and another at Kentucky’s Fort Campbell. Two surviving Cheyennes at the Army Aviation Museum., US Army Many of the features found on the Cheyenne would later show up on other aircraft. For instance, by the time the Boeing AH-64 Apache entered service in 1986, helmet-mounted targeting displays were standard, although with far more capabilities than Cheyenne’s system had. The Apache also integrated the digital sensor and cockpit technologies that the AH-56 was just too early to incorporate. As for swiveling gunner’s seats and sighting systems, just making the sensors themselves swivel, as well as the gun turret, and projecting the video feed in front of the pilot’s eye and on cockpit screens was a far more attractive option that was largely made possible by technological progress during the 1970s. While the Cheyenne never officially entered service, it nevertheless had a profound impact on the design of future attack helicopters and helped unlock the possibilities of an advanced close air support aircraft concept. In his 2018 interview, U.S. Army Aviation Museum curator Bob Mitchell said that without the Cheyenne, there would be no A-10. “I like to refer to the Cheyenne as the father of the A-10 program, because after that, the next aircraft the Air Force would design would be the A-10 Thunderbolt for close air support,” he explained . “Now, because of the Cheyenne, we finally got a dedicated aircraft for close air support.” In addition, the Cheyenne’s high-speed, compound helicopter configuration has been reborn, at least to a certain degree, in the form of the Sikorsky S-97 Raider , a variant of which could very well become the Army’s next scout helicopter. Other variants of Sikorsky’s X-2 technology , namely the SB-1 Defiant , which is in the running to satisfy a huge component of the Army’s Future Vertical Lift program, also have some general similarities to AH-56. Even Boeing recently was looking to pitch a major refresh of their Apache by adding a pusher propeller and stub wings, which would have given it a very similar configuration to Cheyenne’s. Maybe Cheyenne’s biggest problem was that it was too ambitious, and it definitely pioneered its share of wacky technological dead-ends, like the gunner’s rotating seat, but it also got an amazing amount right and should be remembered in that light.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 7, 2021",U-2 Flight Along The Border Yesterday Wasn’t A Surveillance Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says that a U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane that flew along a portion of the border with Mexico yesterday was on a training mission and was not conducting surveillance in support of other U.S. government agencies. Beyond the current headlines about the border , the flight had caught people’s attention, because the U.S. military, including contractors working on its behalf, does have a long history of supporting domestic law enforcement operations along the U.S.-Mexico border. This has included providing valuable aerial surveillance capabilities. U.S. military aircraft, including U-2s, also regularly take part in counter-drug operations and other missions targeting ostensibly criminal activity outside of America’s borders in the Northern Hemisphere, as well. A U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane., USAF The sortie on Apr. 1, 2021, saw the U-2S in question, which has the serial number 68-10329 and was using the callsign Pinon 71, head out north from Beale Air Force Base in California before turning east into Nevada. Beale, home of the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, is the Air Force’s main hub for U-2S, as well as RQ-4 Global Hawk drone, operations. After entering Nevada, 68-10329 turned south and followed a path roughly along the Nevada side of the Nevada-California border before passing into Arizona. The aircraft then turned slightly more to the southeast and flew a large s-shaped pattern over the Arizona-New Mexico border. A map showing the route taken by 68-10329 on Apr. 1, 2021., ADS-B Exchange The U-2S then flew around El Paso in Texas before heading back west along the U.S.-Mexico border. The flight tracking data is incomplete for much of the rest of the sortie, but it would appear that the plane traveled along the border through New Mexico, Arizona, and then California, before heading back north to Beale. Despite what is shown on the map above, there is no indication that the aircraft ever crossed into Mexican airspace. “The flight you’ve reference was confirmed to be a training sortie out of Beale and was not conducted as a patrol or joint operation with external agencies,” Air Force Captain Brittany Curry, the public affairs chief for the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, told The War Zone in a statement. Curry added that 68-10329 did not collect imagery of any kind during the flight. As already noted, though, this would have hardly been the first time that U.S. military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, as well as other aviation assets, including those flown by contractors working for the Department of Defense, have supported law enforcement operations along the U.S. border with Mexico. Though the federal government is generally prohibited, by law, from deploying active-duty military forces domestically, there are mechanisms through which various kinds of support, including aerial ISR capabilities, can be provided to law enforcement and other domestic civilian agencies. You can read about those processes and the legal stipulations involved here and here . The Air Force’s U-2Ss can carry a variety of different sensor packages , including panoramic and other wide-angle cameras and radar imaging systems , and one of these aircraft could, conceivably offer a way to relatively quickly get a snapshot of border activity at a particular moment in time, even if 68-10329 did not in this particular case. That same imagery would also be useful for general mapping purposes , including in the creation of radar maps that can show details electro-optical or thermal imagery cannot. The U-2 can also carry communications intelligence gathering payloads. U-2S, serial number 80-1090, seen equipped with a panoramic camera in its Q-Bay in February 2021., Matt Hartman In addition, while 68-10329 might not have been patrolling the border during this flight, there has been a notable uptick in U.S. military aviation support of various kinds, from both active-duty units and elements of the National Guard, to law enforcement agencies along the border starting in recent years. This started in 2018 under former President Donald Trump’s administration. In 2019, after Trump declared a national emergency with regards to security along the border with Mexico, Newsweek obtained a U.S. military document that described new requests for aerial ISR and other aviation support, including U.S. Navy P-3 Orion maritime patrol planes, which are also capable of overland surveillance, as well as U.S. Army MC-12 manned ISR aircraft and MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones. It’s unclear if any of those platforms were subsequently deployed to the border. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uqh5JgpaVvQ In addition, it’s worth pointing out that U-2s have certainly provided ISR support for counter-drug operations and others efforts targeting transnational criminal activity over the years. The Dragon Lady’s involvement in the War on Drugs dates back to the 1970s . They have even conducted flights over Mexico on at least one occasion, as part of an operation known as Equis Emerald in 2009, though it’s unclear what the exact mission was in that case. U-2s have also been used in the past to collect imagery to support disaster relief and humanitarian response operations, both inside the United States and abroad . A portion of a table of contents from internal Air Combat Command historical review covering activities in 2009, which mentions the Equis Emerald overflights of Mexico that year., USAF via FOIA In the meantime, while President Joe Biden officially ended the Trump-era national emergency with regards to the U.S.-Mexico border in February, thousands of U.S. military personnel remain deployed supporting border security operations. Biden has also been facing criticism from Republicans in Congress about its handling of what they describe as a new border crisis . All told, there are no indications that the U.S. military support being provided to border security operations now is set to get scaled back in the near term, although the U-2 Dragon Lady wasn’t part of those plans on this occassion.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 3, 2022",The World’s Most Secretive 737 Just Showed Its Bizarre Self Over The Mojave Desert,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to shy aircraft that we know exist, the Air Force’s wildly modified NT-43A flying signature measurement aircraft, known by its callsign “RAT 55,” really takes the cake. The nearly 50-year-old aircraft has no definitive home. It lives at either Area 51 or the Tonopah Test Range Airport and spends its very limited time in the air flying, usually in formation with stealthy aircraft, high over the desolate and sometimes inaccessible ranges that span large swathes of desert in California and Nevada. While online plane trackers have seen data associated with RAT 55 pop up here and there in recent months, nobody had spotted the bizarrely shaped test jet for what seemed like at least a couple of years, that is until now. I did a full profile on RAT55 six years ago. It definitely caught many people’s imaginations. The one-of-a-kind NT-43A is the strangest looking and most secretive Boeing 737 ever created, and that is saying something considering over 10,000 of the type have been built over nearly 60 years, with the airframe being adapted for many purposes . One of the few decent pictures of RAT 55. In recent years, more additions have been added to aircraft, including a dorsal enclosure., Uncredited The aircraft in question’s current configuration, which transformed it from a T-43A navigational trainer aircraft into the strange form it is in today, will be celebrating its 20th birthday this year. As for what the aircraft was built to do, here is what I wrote back in 2015: The NT-43A radar aircraft testbed (probably where the “RAT” callsign comes from) is most likely the last stop in advanced low-signature testing and validation for new stealthy aircraft , new radar-absorbent coatings and heat mitigation technologies, as well as exotic and stealthy structural modifications to existing aircraft. In other words, whether it be a whole new aircraft or just a new radar absorbing material applied to an existing stealthy aircraft, the NT-43A evaluates it under realistic flight conditions with its powerful radars and infrared energy detecting devices. Even repairs and depot-level work on existing stealth aircraft may be validated in flight via the NT-43A. The NT-43A’s massive radars are most likely able to take incredibly detailed synthetic aperture ‘pictures’ of their target aircraft, as well as collecting sensitive ‘raw’ radar measurements and associated data. Its front and rear pods that give the jet such an ungainly appearance allow it to collect radar and infrared data (the IR sensors sit atop the radar fairings) from every angle around the target aircraft in flight without having to fly at oblique angles towards and away from it. The radar system may have some bistatic capabilities when both front and back arrays are used in conjunction with one another. Beyond evaluating a design’s low observable qualities in flight, data collected by “RAT 55″ is most likely also used to better understand a stealthy aircraft’s strengths and weaknesses. For instance, an aircraft may have very little radar signature head-on, but at certain angles, its radar cross-section grows significantly. Once these intricacies are very well documented, the performance of enemy radars, infrared search and track systems and anti-air missile systems can be better theorized. This allows for a much more accurate understanding of how close a ‘stealth’ aircraft can get to different threats without being detected or without being engaged. Mission planners can then build elaborate routes around known enemy air defense systems and give crews good advice on how to present the best aspect of their aircraft to unplanned ‘pop-up’ threats so that they have the best chance of surviving a mission. This route of lowest possible detection and greatest possible survival is known as the ‘Blue Line’ among stealth aircraft crews… A RAT 55 patch. We speculate as to the name RAT, but the 55 likely comes from the aircraft USAF serial number: 73-1155, Ebay.com While similar ground-based signature evaluation capabilities exist, such as the DYCOMS facility at Area 51 , they cannot view every aspect of the aircraft being surveilled, and especially from above, where prowling fighters and airborne early warning aircraft represent a real threat. Above all else, think of RAT 55 like a flying lab that comes to its subjects so that they can be evaluated from every angle in their actual operating environment and under real-world conditions. It is a very low-density, high-value asset that serves as another piece in the absolutely massive American weapons development and testing enterprise . While other airborne signature measurement assets exist , RAT 55 is certainly the most elaborate and secretive, and it serves as a critical asset when it comes to maintaining America’s dominance in low-observable technologies. Recent data collected by plane trackers seemed to point to the possibility that the NT-43A RAT55 we have come to know may have been replaced by a less extensively modified aircraft that was using its same or similar callsign. Considering nobody had actually photographed the very noticeable jet during what appeared to be a resurgence in test flights seemed to add to this possibility, but nothing was definitive. The aircraft also hadn’t appeared in any satellite imagery of the Tonopah Test Range Airport or Area 51 for some time. Regardless, we now know that the NT-43A RAT 55 is alive and doing what it has always done, in this case trailing a B-2 Spirit of Death Valley gathering signature measurements. A B-2 with RAT 55 in trail over Death Valley on March 30th, 2021., Uncredited Photographer A B-2 with RAT 55 in trail over Death Valley on March 30th, 2021., Uncredited Photographer At the same time, another highly peculiar secondhand 737-700, a jet that was outfitted with mysterious conformal sensors and still wore its original green factory coating years after it was delivered, which carries the U.S. civil registration code N712JM, has appeared . It flew a number of test flights off the California coast and around the region last June. While the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office appears to be the current ‘owner ‘of this mysterious aircraft, it turns out that it was briefly owned by Denmar Technical Services. At the time of writing about the green mystery plane, we stated: The plane’s history is also highly puzzling. It was originally delivered to a Wells Fargo Bank trustee, a common way to hide the true ownership of an aircraft and a financial tool often used by aircraft owners, in 2013. It stayed this way until April of 2019, when a relatively obscure company named Denmar Technical Services took ownership of it. The company simply describes itself as “providing our customer with superior radar measurement systems and services” and nothing more on its website. Note, it says customer, not customers. They are based in Reno, Nevada, and have relatively minor activity in terms of disclosed government contracts. The company owned the aircraft for a short period of time, just one year ago almost to the day, before it was transferred to the USAF. During this time, and a year before it, there was no flight data we could find under its registration until it showed up in Colorado Springs in March of 2020. The aircraft appears to have been a resident of Sierra Nevada Corporation at Colorado Springs Airport, which is adjacent to a significant Air Force Base that shares its runways, but the mystery 737 wasn’t being housed there. SNC is maybe the world’s most known aircraft modification company, especially for unique military applications. So, a specially modified 737 is literally right up their alley. Denmar does very high-end radar and signature test work with the USAF and they were the masterminds behind the original conversion of the NT-43A into RAT55 as we know it today. Other evidence also points to this second-hand, but far newer 737 becoming a successor to RAT55, including indications that it is being developed by an integrated signature testing force, possibly based out of the Tonopah Test Range Airport, in which the USAF’s still flying F-117s are directly involved. N712JM, the mystery 737 belonging to the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), sits at Santa Maria airport during testing., Reader Submission The standard version of the T-43A was retired from the USAF over a decade ago and a dwindling handful of 737-200 based airframes are still flying around the globe today. They are becoming increasingly challenging to support. As such, it seems somewhat likely that RAT 55 may be nearing the end of its service life and that a replacement is in the works—the green 737 that flew test missions over California last year. That aircraft has all but disappeared from view, but we know it has spent time at Sierra Nevada Corporation’s aircraft modifications facility in Colorado. It is probably there being converted into a new ungainly RAT 55 now, with the flight data pilots collected during its test flights having been used to validate the design of new structures that will turn the literally green 737 into something of a very useful monstrosity like its progenitor. We have to stress that we have no definitive evidence that this is the case, but there seems to be an overwhelming abundance of clues pointing in that direction. So there you have it, RAT 55 is alive and back plying its trade. For how long we can’t be certain, but with the B-21 coming online soon and likely a host of other low observable platforms in the Air Force’s not-so-distant future, its replacement could very well be waiting in the wings.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 3, 2021",This Is The Early Warning Radar Helicopter The Royal Navy Could Have Had,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Royal Navy recently announced that the first Merlin Crowsnest carrier-based airborne early warning helicopter had been delivered to its home base, at Culdrose in Cornwall, ahead of a scheduled first operational cruise aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth later this spring, bringing a powerful new surveillance capability to the fleet. But the Crowsnest concept could have been altogether very different, had the U.K. decided on a more advanced — and more costly — active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar setup. With the primary task of long-range air, sea, and land surveillance, a radar helicopter, like Crowsnest, is a vital component of the U.K.’s resurgent carrier strike capability , providing a way to detect, identify, and track threats beyond an armada’s horizon, ensuring that it’s protected. One of the first Crowsnest-equipped Merlin HM2 helicopters delivered to Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose recently., CROWN COPYRIGHT The Royal Navy had gone for years without any carriers at all after the retirement of HMS Ark Royal , together with all of the country’s short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) Harrier GR9s , as a result of the 2010 Strategic Defense and Security Review. Now, a multi-billion-dollar project has reinstated what the U.K. Ministry of Defense describes as the Carrier Enabled Power Projection (CEPP) capability, and Crowsnest is central to this. As well as the two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers themselves, and at least 48 F-35B Lightning Joint Strike Fighters , around $329 million is being spent on Crowsnest. Delivery of the first aircraft to the operating unit means the Royal Navy is, once again, ready to take an airborne early warning (AEW) helicopter to sea. While the current Crowsnest will be an eagerly awaited and critical addition to the carrier strike group, it might not have been the best solution in terms of overall capability. Overall, the path to get to this point has been a fairly tortuous one. It’s been an incredible 21 years since what was then known as the Future Organic Airborne Early Warning program was announced in the U.K. parliament. At that point, it was anticipated that the resulting capability could be in service by 2012. Before settling on the current Crowsnest solution, the U.K. had considered an active electronically scanned array (AESA) array which, as also seen in the photo at the top of this story, was installed in pods along the lower fuselage sides of the Merlin. A Merlin testbed helicopter fitted with the Lockheed Martin Vigilance suite during trials back in 2014., Rick Ingham Known as Vigilance, this was a Lockheed Martin offering and it incorporated technology derived from the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-81 used in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . At some point later on, Lockheed switched from the AN/APG-81-derived radar to the Israeli Elta EL/M-2052 radar, again contained within side-mounted pods. The same containers, which attached to the Merlin’s existing torpedo hardpoints, also carried identification friend or foe (IFF) and electronic support measures (ESM) equipment. Either way, once equipped, this AEW Merlin would have benefited from all the advantages of an AESA radar , chiefly its ability to rapidly scan huge volumes of airspace compared to older radars that use a mechanically-steered dish. AESAs also offer increased detection and tracking ranges compared to similarly-sized mechanically-scanned designs. They have improved target discrimination and identification capabilities, especially when it comes to spotting low-flying targets with small radar cross-sections, such as cruise missiles or drones . Clearly, such a capability is hugely important when it comes to protecting a carrier group. Lockheed Martin began testing the Vigilance system in late 2011 and flight trials were conducted using a Merlin test aircraft at MOD Boscombe Down , in southwest England, the U.K. military aircraft testing establishment. There are next to no details available of what this testing achieved, but it’s clear it was part of a so-called assessment phase to compare the different available options. Thought was also been given to a bespoke AEW aircraft based on the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor , which would have offered greater endurance and a higher operating altitude than the Merlin. The V-22 has long been eyed as a potentially highly useful, if expensive, addition to the Royal Navy’s future carrier strike groups, also being able to provide carrier onboard delivery , aerial refueling , combat search and rescue , and other missions. An artist’s impression of an AEW-equipped Royal Navy V-22 Osprey., ROYAL NAVY Helicopter AEW platforms are, by their nature, limited by their operating altitude, which reduces their radar reach, and by their range, as well as being more fatiguing for their operators. All those drawbacks would have been addressed by the U.S. Navy’s E-2D Advanced Hawkeye , one other platform that was under consideration. However, this would only have been feasible if the U.K. had opted to equip its carriers with catapults for launching aircraft and arrester wires for recovering them. While a “cats and traps” configuration was briefly the plan, as you can read about here , the final choice fell on a STOVL carrier, tailored around the F-35B. While the Osprey and Advanced Hawkeye were likely never realistic propositions, on cost grounds, the Ministry of Defense spent many years — and a reported $49 million — weighing up the options. A U.S. Navy E-2D Advanced Hawkeye prepares to catch the wire aboard USS Gerald R. Ford underway in the Atlantic Ocean., U.S. Navy In the background, meanwhile, defense firm Thales offered a less ambitious and cheaper adaptation of the existing Searchwater 2000 and Cerberus used in what was then the Royal Navy’s radar helicopter, the Sea King ASaC7 . This had first entered Royal Navy service in 1982 as an urgent response to the lack of AEW coverage during the Falklands War and the original Searchwater technology dated back to the latter half of the 1970s. In April 2015, Lockheed Martin teamed up with Thales to pitch this offering as an alternative to Vigilance. The following month, the U.K. Ministry of Defense selected the Lockheed/Thales proposal . The decision had cost millions of pounds and years of development work, to end up with what was, essentially, the same equipment already in use, ported over to a helicopter that was also well established in service. In November 2016, a contract was agreed with Lockheed Martin UK to provide and integrate 10 Crowsnest systems as roll-on/roll-off kits for the existing fleet of 30 Merlin HMA2 anti-submarine warfare helicopters, all of which are being adapted to accommodate the equipment. In the process, 200 jobs were secured across the United Kingdom, with Lockheed Martin, as well as sub-contractors Thales and Leonardo Helicopters. A Royal Navy Merlin Crowsnest undergoes maintenance. , CROWN COPYRIGHT Today’s Crowsnest system essentially utilizes the same Searchwater 2000 radar and Cerberus tactical sensor suite that were both used in the long-serving Sea King ASaC7, the last of which were retired in September 2018, after nearly 40 years of service. As in the Sea King, the mechanically scanned radar antenna is carried in an inflatable bag that pivots down from the side of the helicopter. The appearance of this installation led to the “Baggers” nickname for the helicopter and its operators, who, like the equipment, have also been passed from the Sea King ASaC7 to the Merlin Crowsnest. Up to 600 contacts can be monitored by the Cerberus suite, including airborne threats as well as small, fast-moving targets over land and water. The ability to provide overland surveillance is something that was exploited by the Sea King ASaC7 over Afghanistan, in particular, where the aircraft were used successfully in support of NATO forces on the ground. A Royal Navy Sea King ASaC7 helicopter operating in Afghanistan., CROWN COPYRIGHT As a mechanically scanned system, the Searchwater 2000 not only falls short in terms of capabilities compared to an AESA equivalent but also has increased maintenance demands, with more moving parts compared to a conformal AESA system. A potential failure of the pivoting arm, for instance, would prevent the helicopter from undertaking its mission and the spinning dish also needs constant upkeep. That said, some improvements have been made to the equipment for the new Crowsnest application and these reportedly address the human interface, target identification capability, and resilience against electronic jamming. Above all, however, the Crowsnest system was chosen by the U.K. Ministry of Defense as it was judged the more affordable one, and one which should have presented a minimum risk. Selecting the same equipment as used in the Sea King ASaC7, even if it is “warmed over,” should also reduce the demands on training and logistics. As it was, despite choosing what was considered the lower-risk solution, the Crowsnest program ended up delayed anyway. Originally anticipated to enter operational service in 2018, coinciding with the withdrawal of the Sea King ASaC7, it wasn’t until March 2019 that a Merlin HM2 fitted with Crowsnest took to the air for the first time. A revised initial operating capability (IOC) date was then planned for December 2020, to align with the declaration of IOC for HMS Queen Elizabeth in the carrier strike role. This called for one carrier “fitted with the Crowsnest radar system, with supporting infrastructure, logistics, communications and surveillance in place.” HMS Queen Elizabeth during its first major exercise in British waters last October., CROWN COPYRIGHT However, a report last June from the U.K. Government’s National Audit Office, which scrutinizes public spending, noted that “the initial contracted capability will not be available until September 2021, 18 months later than planned.” “The Department did not oversee its contract with Lockheed Martin effectively and, despite earlier problems on the project, neither was aware of the subcontractor’s lack of progress until it was too late to meet the target delivery date,” the report continued. “It subsequently concluded that the subcontractor working on the project, Thales, failed to meet its contractual commitments to develop the equipment and had not provided sufficient information on the project’s progress. The Department and its industry partners have since implemented a recovery plan and enhanced monitoring arrangements.” Delays have continued, however, and a “full airborne radar capability” for Crowsnest is now not expected until May 2023. Meanwhile, for the forthcoming Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) deployment to the Mediterranean and the Indo-Pacific — the first operational cruise for HMS Queen Elizabeth — nine Merlin HM2s from 820 Naval Air Squadron (NAS) are expected to go onboard. Of these, three are likely to be equipped with the pre-IOC Crowsnest kits. Taking maintenance and training requirements into account, that leaves precious few airframes for anti-submarine warfare. Once that first carrier deployment is complete, we may have a better idea of how well this ‘renewed’ iteration of the Crowsnest performs. It could well be that the Royal Navy has a worthy successor to the Sea King ASaC7 in the making, or it might even come to regret turning down the more advanced AESA solution from Lockheed Martin.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 17, 2022",Navy’s Aviation Boss Lays Out Big Vision For Drone-Packed Carriers Of The Future,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A top U.S. Navy official has laid out new details about the service’s vision for its future carrier air wings, including plans for the replacement of its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet multirole fighters. As well as a Super Hornet successor, which would be developed under the Navy’s Next Generation Air Dominance program, that same initiative is now also planning to replace the EA-18G Growler electronic attack jet, all part of reshaping a carrier air wing that could eventually feature as much as two-thirds unmanned aircraft. At the same time, the officer threw cold water on plans to add a new class of light aircraft carriers to the fleet. While the Navy is working alongside the Air Force on some aspects of the respective Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) programs, the official said these are expected to result in different airframes and vehicles, but ones that will share some commonality in terms of avionics and subsystems. This suggests a platform-agnostic approach of the type that is a key feature of the Air Force NGAD program, a factor that The War Zone has discussed in the past . Two EA-18G Growlers assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 over the Atlantic Ocean. NGAD’s Increment two is seeking to replace the electronic attack jet., U.S. Navy The comments were made yesterday by Rear Admiral Gregory Harris , the director of the Air Warfare Division within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The official’s words shed some light on the otherwise murky US Navy iteration of the NGAD program, which is running in parallel to the U.S. Air Force’s own NGAD efforts , and aims to supersede the F-22 and even the F-35 , at least to some degree. Last September, it was revealed that some kind of prototype related to the Air Force’s NGAD effort was already flying . The Navy, however, is still fleshing out the requirements for its NGAD initiative. Like equivalent efforts in the Air Force, as well as in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe , the Navy’s NGAD will be a “family of systems,” as Harris described it, with the F/A-XX as its centerpiece in the carrier air wing as the Super Hornet’s replacement. However, while Harris admitted that F/A-XX “may or may not be manned,” he also said it will “most likely be manned.” Beyond that, however, the overarching NGAD program will include a mix of manned aircraft and drones. “We believe that as manned-unmanned teaming comes online, we will integrate those aspects of manned and unmanned teaming into that,” Harris added. However, the kinds of drones that NGAD is expected to yield may not be primarily intended to work alongside manned fighters. While the Air Force calls these types of combat drones loyal wingmen , Harris referred to them, informally, as “little buddies.” These drones could equally end up being used as adjuncts to electronic warfare or early warning platforms , as well as fighters. So far, the Northrop Grumman X-47B is the most advanced drone to have operated from a carrier deck, but only in an experimental capacity., U.S. Navy The reference to early warning aircraft is especially notable. Harris went on to suggest that NGAD might also address a successor to the E-2 Hawkeye radar plane, noting that “We will have to replace the E-2D sometime in the future.” Now, it seems, an unmanned airborne early warning and control platform is a possibility, which would seem to align with U.S. Marine Corps plans in this field . Rear Admiral Gregory Harris, Director, Air Warfare Division, N98, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations., U.S. NAVY The Navy NGAD program now includes at least two distinct efforts, Harris confirmed. Increment one is to study replacements for the Super Hornet, which remains the tactical backbone of the carrier air wing, while increment two is focused on a successor to the Growler. Increment two is also likely to take a family of systems approach, but Harris expects it will emerge as a combination of manned and unmanned systems. That suggests that while the attributes of a manned aircraft are acknowledged to be advantageous for the Super Hornet’s strike fighter role, the Growler’s mission set , which is primarily tasked with defeating hostile air defense systems would benefit from an unmanned platform, flying into harm’s way and perhaps incorporating stealthy and/or attritable design aspects. Meanwhile, the increasing focus on near-peer enemies outlined in the National Defense Strategy implies being prepared to take on the high-end air defense systems of China and Russia, for example. Attritable drones are, by their nature, comparatively low cost, ensuring that commanders are willing to use them in higher-risk scenarios from which they might not return. An EA-18G Growler, nearest camera, and an F/A-18E Super Hornet, prepare for launch on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan ., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Erica Bechard Overall, despite talk of a manned Super Hornet successor, the carrier air wing of the future is still likely to be dominated by unmanned platforms, Harris contended. He said the service is looking to move to a 40-60 unmanned-manned split, before transforming that to a 60-40 unmanned-manned split in the long term. Those aspirations make an interesting comparison with a depiction of a notional carrier air wing as of 2030 that the service has previously disclosed. As seen in the graphic below, in that previous concept, manned aircraft still vastly outnumber unmanned platforms in 2030, but that could still fit with the timeline for NGAD’s introduction. U.S. NAVY Whether that manned/unmanned ambition plays out will depend heavily on the fortunes of the Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone, which will be the Navy’s first operational, carrier-based unmanned aircraft. The MQ-25 will help prove concepts of operations, communication links, and more, that will help usher in more unmanned types into the carrier air wing. There will very likely also be a role for the E-2D in the introduction of more drones to the carrier air wing. Earlier this month the Navy announced plans to modify the Advanced Hawkeye’s mission computer so it can also serve as a drone controller, as part of a manned-unmanned teaming experiment. That would allow off-ship command-and-control of the MQ-25, and potentially future drones, too. Boeing conducts an MQ-25 deck-handling demonstration at its facility in St. Louis, Missouri., Boeing Regarding the timeline on NGAD, and when it might actually yield new aircraft for the carrier air wing, tentative plans call for replacement of the Super Hornet and Growler beginning in the 2030s . That ambitious plan could also be another reason to favor a manned replacement for the F/A-18E/F since it represents less of a technological challenge compared to a multi-mission carrier-based fighter drone. The aim of getting new platforms into service in the 2030s also puts a possible question mark over the status of the ongoing Super Hornet Block III and EA-18G Block II upgrade programs, which you can read more about here and here . The Super Hornet Block III upgrade, for example, which also includes a service life modification (SLM) effort, is projected to run through 2033. Lockheed Martin concept artwork showing a Sea Ghost UCLASS combat drone approaching a nuclear-powered carrier., Lockheed Martin In particular, Harris pointed to air-to-air combat as being a difficult hurdle for unmanned aircraft to master. He also referred to the challenges of introducing combat drones into existing rules of engagement, target verification, and battlespace awareness. Currently, according to USNI reports , the Navy NGAD program is in the “concept refinement phase,” with the service working with industry to study available and emerging technologies, including in the unmanned realm. While Harris has tipped a manned successor to the Super Hornet as the most likely route, a final decision on this can be expected in two or three years, he said. Whatever form the Super Hornet successor takes, it’s likely to offer more range than the F-35C , the carrier version of the Joint Strike Fighter stealth fighter that it will fly alongside. That aircraft has a combat radius of 700 nautical miles, while this is likely to increase to far beyond a thousand nautical miles via a new fighter. That would help in an Indo-Pacific scenario, for example, allowing the carrier to launch sorties while standing off far enough to be outside the heart of China’s anti-ship ballistic and cruise missile engagement envelope, as well as that of emerging hypersonic weapons. An F-35C carrier variant, assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23, launches from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS George Washington ., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Bryan Mai Harris provided little in the way of detail about the types of drones that could form part of the NGAD family. However, he described the potential use of a missile-carrying drone ‘weapons truck’ as “not a step too far, too soon.” That would potentially enable a manned fighter, like the Super Hornet or its manned successor, to increase its available ‘magazine capacity,’ with a drone launching weapons at a target designated by the crew of the manned jet. Similar thinking is also behind a program called LongShot , led by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, in which contractors are crafting designs for an air-launched missile-toting air-to-air combat drone. In that concept, a larger manned aircraft would fire this unmanned air vehicle, which could then fly to a certain area and engage multiple aerial threats with its own weapons. This, in turn, would extend the range of the launch platform and reduce its vulnerability to hostile aircraft or air defenses, among many other benefits. The Sea Avenger was the General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA‑ASI) pitch for the Navy’s abortive UCLASS program., GA‑ASI Harris also hinted at potentially adopting an approach somewhat similar to the Air Force’s ambitious ‘Digital Century Series,’ in which new technology is rapidly inserted into airframes, and even new fighter jet designs might be built at a rate of once every five years. Harris talked about open mission system architecture allowing new sensors to be added rapidly to platforms, avoiding the risks of “vendor lock” — when an established company has the entire responsibility for a particular system or set of systems. This can result in a platform being tied to a particular mission system that might be inferior and more costly than alternatives. A Boeing concept artwork for the F/A-XX next-generation carrier fighter., Boeing “We firmly believe that competition will give us a better reliability, lower sustainment costs, and lower the overall costs,” Harris added, before observing that he wanted to make more use of smaller companies to meet these aims. While the idea of small-deck aircraft carriers has been entertained in recent years—by analysts, lawmakers, and naval officers alike—Harris made it clear that he sees the various NGAD assets operating from traditional nuclear-powered supercarriers, like the latest Ford class . In the past, the Navy has conducted studies into aviation-focused versions of the America class amphibious assault ships as well as a “light” derivative of the new Ford class, among others. Thirteen U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs aboard the amphibious assault ship USS America as part of routine training in the eastern Pacific in 2019., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Juan Anaya Harris said he doesn’t see a requirement for small carriers and that this requirement is already adequately filled by the Navy’s amphibious assault ships , which routinely embark U.S. Marine Corps short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35Bs and AV-8Bs . Plans call for the latter type to have been entirely replaced by the F-35B by 2030 . Meanwhile, the Marine Corps has also been looking at options for transforming existing amphibious assault ships into so-called “Lightning Carriers,” which would involve deploying between 16-20 F-35Bs. Small-deck carriers, with conventional propulsion, would be cheaper than nuclear-powered carriers and potentially better able to project power in different parts of the globe as part of a more ‘distributed’ force posture. They would also be more flexible when it comes to deployability and less tied to programmatic maintenance. On the other hand, smaller carriers can be slower, have reduced and less capable air wings, and can’t carry as much fuel, weapons, and stores. They also are more dependent on underway replenishment. While a formal Navy study into options for light aircraft carriers and future supercarrier designs is due next year, Harris said he was “confident that over the long run, we’ll find that there’s not a compelling return on investment to make a smaller carrier.” An artist’s concept of Lockheed Martin’s MQ-XX proposal , which became the MQ-25 Stingray., Lockheed Martin Whatever route NGAD takes and whatever the makeup of the future carrier air wing, the plan to start fielding a successor to the Super Hornet and Growler in the 2030s, whether manned or unmanned, represents a significant challenge.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 11, 2021",Russian Armor Floods Toward Border With Ukraine Amid Fears Of An “Imminent Crisis”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Trains loaded with large amounts of Russian military hardware, including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles, as well as heavy artillery, appear to be streaming toward the country’s borders with Ukraine . There are unconfirmed reports that the scale of these movements is so significant that it has, to the dismay of Russian farmers, disrupted shipments of tractors and other agricultural equipment ahead of the spring harvest season. U.S. officials are now worried that a new major round of fighting between Russia and Ukraine may be imminent as a ceasefire is at risk of expiring tomorrow. It’s not entirely clear when the Russian buildup began, but video footage and other imagery reportedly showing armored vehicles and other military equipment on trains heading toward southwestern Russian has been appearing on social media since at least March 27, 2021. There have also been sightings of large ground convoys and groups of aircraft. 152mm Msta-S self-propelled howitzers loaded on a train reportedly seen recently in Kerch on the Crimean Peninsula., via Twitter This includes at least one clip of a trainload of 152mm 2S19 Msta-S self-propelled howitzers, BMP-3 infantry fight vehicles, and other military vehicles, crossing a bridge that now links Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, and footage of what appears to be the same train in the Crimean city of Kerch. Russian forces seized this region from Ukraine in 2014 and the Kremlin subsequently annexed it. Some military movements in the same general region had been observed earlier the month and appeared to be related to a previously announced exercise. However, there have now been reports that Russian forces that took part in those drills remained deployed after the training officially wrapped up on March 23. In addition, subsequent deployments had reportedly seen troops, including units not known to have been involved in the aforementioned drills, head out to locations outside of the publicly announced exercise areas. “We’ve reached out to Russia to try to gain a little more clarity on what’s going on,” top Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said on March 31. U.S. Army General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had reached out to his Russian counterpart, General Valery Gerasimov, on March 31, 2021, to ask about the troop movements, but it’s unclear what the Russian response was to those queries. Milley also spoke with Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Ruslan Khomchak about the developing situation. “The Russian Federation continues its aggressive policy towards Ukraine,” Khomchak had told his country’s parliament on March 30. “An additional concentration of up to 25 tactical groups is expected, which, together with the already deployed forces near the state border of Ukraine, poses a threat to the military security of the state.” Khomchak had also said that Russia has around 32,700 military personnel in Crimea, at present. Since annexing the territory in 2014, the Kremlin has significantly expanded its military presence there to include air, naval, and ground-based assets, including anti-ship cruise missile and surface-to-air missile batteries . Russia also oversees some 28,000 personnel in “separatist” units in areas of eastern Ukraine known collectively as the Donbass who have been fighting the government in Kyiv since 2015. Though the Kremlin denies it, the evidence is clear that a substantial portion of these forces is simply regular Russian military units deployed on Ukrainian soil. There are also strong links between Russia’s intelligence services and ostensibly “local” forces. A map provided by the multinational Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) showing the activities of its Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine that gives a general sense of the eastern Donbass region of the country. The red “line of contact” represents the de facto boundary between areas occupied by “separatist” forces and the rest of Ukraine., OSCE It’s not clear exactly how much additional Russian military hardware is actually heading towards the border with Ukraine, but there are reports that the deliveries are substantial enough to have disrupted the movement of other goods via rail, such as agricultural tractors, in the country, according to the Kommersant newspaper . The Russian Ministry of Defense did not respond to Kommersant ‘s queries on the matter and, interestingly, the outlet’s sources within the country’s defense establishment denied the claims that large numbers of flatbed railcars have been requisitioned from state railroad operators for military use. Though the new Russian military buildup is clearly at least a message meant for Ukrainian authorities, what the Kremlin’s exact plan is remains unclear. The Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, which includes representatives from Ukraine, Russia, and the multinational Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ), reportedly failed to agree on the terms of an extension of an existing ceasefire agreement in Donbass beyond April 1. The Ukrainian delegation pointed the finger squarely at the Russians for the breakdown in talks, according to reports. Both sides routinely accuse each other of violating the current ceasefire, regardless, with Ukrainian officials saying 26 of its soldiers have died in fighting this year already. The immediate concern is that major fighting in Donbass could resume after the ceasefire expires tomorrow. The New York Times reported today that U.S. European Command (EUCOM) had changed Ukraine’s status on an internal watch list from “possible crisis” to “potential imminent crisis,” the latter being the most serious level on the scale. It is important to point that there have been concerning spikes in Russia’s military activity near Ukraine in the past, but the timing of these developments around the expiration of the ceasefire seems particularly notable. The very visible massing of Russian forces in areas along Ukraine’s borders could simply be intended as a deterrent against a new Ukrainian offensive into Donbass. At the same time, if a new round of large-scale fighting were to erupt in eastern Ukraine, there is also the possibility that Russia might seek to change the status quo around areas presently occupied by “separatist” elements to put additional pressure on the government in Kyiv. The pressure resulting from any outburst of fighting in Ukraine could also apply to the United States. Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly responded in an unusually angry fashion to remarks U.S. President Joe Biden had made in an interview with ABC News’ s George Stephanopoulos. Biden had agreed with the characterization of Putin as a “killer” and said that he would “pay a price” for interference in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, something the Kremlin denies. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken did reiterate the U.S. government’s support for Ukraine’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity” in a call today with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. The United States, as well as most of the international community, does not recognize Russia’s occupation of Crimea or “separatist” claims in Donbass. However, Ukraine is not a NATO member or otherwise a formal American ally, though they are an important regional security partner , and it’s unclear how willing or able the U.S. government would be to prevent any new major incursion by Russia into Ukraine. Prompting some level of crisis with Ukraine could also help the Kremlin distract attention from domestic issues, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in Russia. Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin faced unusually large protests over the arrest of political dissident Alexei Navalny. Navalny is a long-time critic of Putin, as well as other Russian officials, and has headed up an organization dedicated to exposing government corruption in Russia. Navalny is now on a hunger strike in prison after being convicted of what he and his lawyers say were politically motivated charges in February. He was arrested immediately after returning to Russian from treatment in Germany following an assassination attempt last year involving one of a secretive family of chemical weapons referred to collectively as Novichoks . Whatever the exact goals of Russia’s new military buildup near Ukraine might be, it has already succeeded in provoking concerns about a new escalation in the conflict between the two countries.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2021",Air Force Shows Off Squadron Logo Highlighting Stockpile Of Nuclear Bombs In Belgium,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released a picture of a large 701st Munitions Support Squadron logo that hangs in a conference room within the unit’s facilities at Kleine Brogel Air Base in Belgium. It features an eagle holding what is almost certainly meant to be a representation of a B61 nuclear bomb . This highlights the 701st’s primary mission, which is overseeing a stockpile of B61s at Kleine Brogel that could be loaded onto Belgian F-16AM/BM fighter jets during a major crisis as part of a NATO nuclear weapons sharing arrangement . This is an unusual acknowledgment of the presence of the approximately 20 B61s at the base, which is an ‘open secret,’ but is something the Belgian government does not officially confirm or deny as a matter of policy. In addition to the nuclear-armed eagle, the circular logo also has a silhouette of Belgium filled in with representations of the American and Belgian flags, as well as the text “701 MUNSS” at the top and “Leading The Way” at the bottom. This is not the 701st’s official unit insignia , which also includes the phrase “Leading The Way,” but has a red lion, “an honorary symbol of dedication” that “reflects the unit’s link with its host location ,” placed over a star similar to the one in the official NATO logo at its center. A B61 bomb on a secure storage system next to an F-16 fighter jet inside a hangar at what could be Aviano Air Base in Italy or Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Hangars at Kleine Brogel Air Base in Belgium are likely configured in a similar way.  , DOD The official insignia of the 701st Munitions Support Squadron., DOD The photograph of the wall hanging at Kleine Brogel was posted on the U.S. military’s Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DIVDS) website, an online clearinghouse for official media materials, on March 31, 2021. It was included in an Air Force news story about the scheduling of maintenance activities within the 701st, which is a geographically separated unit that falls under the control of the 52nd Munitions Maintenance Group based at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. There are no U.S. combat aircraft based at Kleine Brogel. The nuclear bombs stored at Kleine Brogel and elsewhere in Europe are understood to be a mix of B61-3 and B61-4 variants, which are defined as “non-strategic” or “tactical” types. Both versions are so-called “dial-a-yield” designs that can be set to detonate with different levels of destructive force as desired. The B61-3’s reported yields ranging from 0.3 kilotons to 170 kilotons, while the B61-4s are said to have various settings between 0.3 kilotons and 45 kilotons. Both of these variants are among the members of the B61 family that are set to be replaced by the new B61-12, which you can read more about in detail in these past stories . A chart showing the variants of the B61, including the in-development B61-12, as well as related nuclear weapon designs. The red crosses indicate versions that are either out of service or were never produced at all., Hans Kristensen/FAS Kleine Brogel is one of six bases across Belgium, Germany , Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey where it is well established that the U.S. military keeps stores of B61s. The bombs in at Belgian, German, Italian, and Dutch bases are there as part of a nuclear weapons sharing agreement and could be loaded on those countries’ combat aircraft. The weapons at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey are solely for use on U.S. aircraft. As already noted, however, the Belgian government does not publicly confirm or deny the presence of U.S. B61 bombs at Kleine Brogel, going so far as to threaten to sue Google for not blurring parts of base in satellite images available through Google Earth, though officials sometimes get very close to doing so. The U.S. military also does not generally discuss any of the stockpiles of these bombs across Europe, either. A satellite image of Kleine Brogel Air Base available through Google Earth., Google Earth The 701st’s mission is “to receive, store, and maintain US munitions, and to provide custody and control of those munitions until receipt of proper authority to release them to the Belgian Air Force 10W TAC [10th Tactical Wing] (F-16 aircraft) in support of NATO’s Strike Mission,” is all an official directory of U.S. military units has to say on the matter. Still, the language regarding things like “custody and control” and “authority to release” all but publicly confirms the presence of the B61s at Kleine Brogel. A Belgian F-16AM fighter jet., USAF All of this underscores how unusual it is for the Air Force, even indirectly, to highlight its nuclear mission in Belgium or anywhere else within the territory of other NATO member states. The continued stockpiling of these weapons in Belgium, as well as in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey, is a controversial topic and often the subject of fierce domestic political debates in those countries. These debates have largely centered on security and environmental concerns , as well as general opposition to nuclear weapons. These issues are not always mutually exclusive, as was underscored in 2010 when anti-nuclear activists breached the perimeter of Kleine Brogel. They also often crop up in domestic U.S. politics, as well. In recent years, amid a significant chill in U.S.-Turkish relations, there have been growing calls to completely remove the stockpile of B61s from that country . With regards to Belgium, specifically in 2019, news that a draft report from the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, or NATO PA, specifically mentioned Alliance members that host B61s touched off something of a scandal in that country. The NATO PA is a consultative organization made up of lawmakers for NATO member states, but is separate from the Alliance. NATO officials subsequently stressed that, as such, the NATO PA report, which was later amended to remove any mention of nuclear weapons in specific countries, was not a formal alliance document. In January 2020, a proposed resolution calling for the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Kleine Brogel was knocked down , but only by a narrow margin, in Belgium’s parliament. As the logo in the 701st Munitions Support Squadron’s conference room makes clear, at least for the time being, American B61 nuclear bombs remain in storage at Kleine Brogel, ready to be loaded into Belgian F-16s should the need ever arise.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 7, 2020",Saab Has Begun Testing 3D Printing To Repair Battle-Damaged Fighter Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Swedish defense and security firm Saab has begun flight-testing of 3D-printed parts on its Gripen multirole fighter as part of a battlefield damage repair trial. Starting with a single exterior hatch on the jet, the company is confident that rapidly produced spare parts will eventually be able to allow battle damage to be temporarily fixed while these aircraft are deployed at remote locations, ensuring a high operational tempo can be maintained. Saab announced today that it has already completed a first test flight with a 3D-printed replacement exterior part. The trial at the company’s Linköping airfield on March 19 involved a two-seat Saab JAS 39D Gripen fighter with a replacement hatch fitted on the rear fuselage. Made of a nylon polymer called PA2200, the part was furnished using “additive manufacturing” — better known as 3D printing . A Swedish Air Force Gripen touches down on a Finnish runway during an exercise. 3D-printed spare parts are seen as a chief enabler for operations from dispersed sites like these., SWEDISH ARMED FORCES Saab has utilized 3D printing to produce parts for its aircraft in the past, but never for an exterior part like this. Meanwhile, the company’s Additive Manufacturing Group has been exploring the possibilities for 3D-printed parts in these kinds of battlefield damage repair scenarios for four years. “Post-flight initial inspection of the hatch was very positive and showed no visual structural changes had occurred from the flight,” said Håkan Stake, contract manager for support to Gripen C/D, and manager of the development project. “The potential of this approach means that maintenance personnel in the field can get access to individually fitted spare parts and you no longer have to resort to emergency fixes nor cannibalize other broken-down aircraft for their parts, while also further reducing the small number of parts brought on a deployment,” Stake added. “This also reduces the operational time lost in repairs.” In an operational scenario, the idea is that, with only minimal infrastructure and resources available, a replacement part could be scanned on-site — even at a dispersed airfield or austere highway strip — and then quickly printed, as an exact replica of the original, and attached to the jet. In this way, different types of battlefield damage could be addressed without the need to bring huge quantities of spares out “into the field,” reducing the deployed footprint. The first 3D-printed external panel to be flown on the Gripen fighter jet., Saab That could provide a huge advantage when deploying quickly to an unfamiliar location, whether for an exercise or a combat operation. In particular, structural parts take up considerable volume, most of which could be saved by shifting to a 3D-printed spare parts model. For example, the hatch used in the initial flight trials is repeatedly used to access parts of the chaff and flare countermeasures system on the Gripen and is prone to damage even in daily use. From a 3D printing perspective, this wasn’t the hardest item to print, but it proved the possibility of scanning an item without access to 3D modeling, fitting it to the aircraft, then taking to the air for another mission. Before the Gripen could fly with the hatch fitted, the component itself had to be exhaustively tested, to prove its strength and resilience to temperature. Meanwhile, multiple suction tests demonstrated that it would remain safely attached to the aircraft and not come adrift. While the Gripen has not flown supersonically with the hatch attached, officials from Saab’s Additive Manufacturing Group say they think this would be entirely possible. The Saab Gripen E. , Saab Saab officials stressed that the latest test is a proof of concept for the PA2200 polymer, but they think that other materials could be utilized for the same type of battlefield damage repairs, too, and also that larger parts could be produced, up to 3 x 3 meters, compared to the 60 x 60 centimeters possible today. After all, the new-generation Gripen E that’s in production for Brazil and Sweden already uses titanium structural parts that are made using 3D printing. Using other materials in the process also opens up the path to creating more complex parts, too. That could even extend into flight-critical parts, too, such as a Gripen elevon or canard foreplane. That, however, would require a more extensive program of testing to prove the strength and resilience of the end product. Overall, though, the potential benefits of this technology would seem to far outweigh the time and effort required to approve them for operational use. Not only does Saab expect 3D printing to reduce the total weight of the items being replicated, but also to trim production lead times, and even reduce cost by up to 60 percent. The company says it has already proven this using a 3D-printed version of a still-classified “highly complex airborne subsystem.” Saab told The War Zone that established Gripen customers see huge potential for 3D battlefield damage repair but would not name the particular countries that have expressed an interest. But with dispersed operations in mind, the company has come up with a container-based 3D “printshop” that could be taken on operations, like the highway exercises that the Swedish Air Force regularly practices . Under this concept, ordinary highways become austere operational airstrips, to serve as a complement to wartime main and reserve airbases. A Saab concept for a container-based deployable battlefield repair workshop., Saab A container operation printing polymer spare parts could be managed by perhaps just two operators, who would not require particularly intensive training, Saab officials claim. While the first test used a scan-print-fit approach, it might not always be possible to accurately scan a part that’s too badly damaged or perhaps missing altogether. In that scenario, a “print on demand” model might be used instead, with the required part called up from a database and then printed in the containerized workshop. The company is also still assessing just how resilient different kinds of replacement parts need to be. It might be that a 3D-printed replacement item only needs to be cleared for 10 to 15 flights, or maybe just one, keeping the aircraft in the mission loop while waiting for a factory-made replacement to arrive. That, in turn, would speed up the path to operational clearance for such parts. A Swedish Air Force technician works on a Gripen during an operation on a road base at the Vidsel test and training range in northern Sweden., Saab Saab’s first tentative steps into this kind of high-tech battlefield damage repair are focusing on parts likely to be damaged by handling or become worn out in everyday use. Before this kind of capability can be deployed in an operational scenario, additional testing is required. But it’s easy to see that, ultimately, the same kinds of techniques being pioneered here could be used to repair an aircraft returning to base with damage inflicted by enemy forces, too. Aircraft expected to work in particularly high-threat environments like the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Thunderbolt II or various attack helicopters would appear to be obvious candidates for this kind of technology, were it to become more widely available. While that may be some way in the future, the prospect of being able to produce spares on-site, at remote locations, is one that clearly has significant implications for air arms deployed away from their home bases for any length of time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",Watch A Saudi F-15 Fighter Swoop In Low To Blast A Houthi Rebel Drone Out Of The Sky,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen launching suicide drones , as well as ballistic and cruise missiles , at targets in Saudi Arabia has become a regular occurrence. Announcements about interceptions by Royal Saudi Air Force F-15 fighter jets , as well as Patriot surface-to-air missiles , very costly responses to these relatively cheap threats, have become equally routine. However, video footage has now emerged online offering a different kind of look at this ongoing duel as Saudi troops on the ground watch an F-15 swoop in a relatively low level to knock down a Houthi Qasef-series suicide drone. The video begins with individuals on the ground watching the Qasef flying along above, with its engine humming loudly. A missile is then seen flying in underneath the drone. The missile detonates after coming within a certain distance of the unmanned aircraft, causing it to fall out of the sky. An F-15, which looks to have launched the missile, then comes zooming into view. The Saudis operate a number of different Eagle variants and it’s not possible to tell at the distance the video was shot which version is seen in this case. It’s not clear what kind of missile was employed in this case, but based on what can be seen in the video, it might have been an active radar-homing AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). It’s unclear why this weapon would have been chosen over a missile that might have been better suited to engaging targets at shorter ranges like this, such as an AIM-9 Sidewinder . The target’s thermal or radar signature and aspect, as well as what weapons are available or in plentiful supply in terms of Saudi stocks, may have played a part in weapons selection. A still frame from the video clip, showing the missile fired at the drone, which could be an AIM-120 AMRAAM., YouTube capture In addition, there are no clear indications as to when or where this clip was shot, but, toward the end, it cuts to an individual wearing a uniform in what appears to be a camouflage pattern commonly associated with Saudi Arabia’s Border Guards. This camouflage uniform is distinct from the ones worn by members of the Royal Saudi Land Forces or the Saudi Arabia National Guard (SANG). That Saudi Border Guards would have witnessed this exchange is very reasonable given that many Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia target sites right across the country’s southern border with Yemen. The Houthis have also launched missile and drone strikes against facilities much deeper inside Saudi territory, or at least claims to have, in certain instances. The group said it was responsible for unprecedented drone and missile strikes against Saudi oil infrastructure in 2019, but the U.S. government subsequently blamed Iran directly for carrying out that operation. The Qasef-1 , a suicide drone derived from the Iranian Ababil-2, and the improved Qasef-2K, are Houthi staples that the Yemeni rebels have been actively using for years now. The exact differences between the Qasef-1, which has an estimated range of around 124 miles, and the Qasef-2K are not entirely clear. The remains of a Qasef-1 suicide drone., Conflict Armament Research The Qasef-series is also only one of a number of different suicide drone types that the Houthis now operate. Earlier this month, the group held a glitzy arms fair in which they showed off a wide assortment of drones, including fixed-wing and hexcopter types purportedly able to drop improvised munitions, as well as various ballistic and cruise missiles, naval mines , small arms, and other light weapons. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ly89pZ_l2gg As already noted, as time has gone on, the Saudis have become relatively proficient at intercepting Houthi drones, as well as the group’s missiles. However, the cost ratio for these engagements, even when they are successful, is firmly on the side of the Yemeni rebels. For instance, the Pentagon has estimated that the Air Force will pay $29,000 per flight hour to operate its new F-15EX fighter jets . The F-15EX is derived from the F-15QA for Qatar, which itself was based on the configuration of the Saudi F-15SA . In addition, each AIM-120C, the version of the AMRAAM that the Saudis use, cost around $1 million , while AIM-9X Sidewinders have average unit costs in the region of between $430,000 to $470,000. Houthi Qasef-series drones cost, at most, a couple of thousand dollars to produce. The video below is a montage of clips, shot from targeting pods on F-15s, that the Saudi government has previously released of interceptions of Houthi drones. Of course, this problematic cost differential is not new. In 2017, a U.S. Army general had publicly talked about this issue , describing how an unspecified U.S. ally, possibly Israel , had shot down a quadcopter-type drone of the kind anyone can purchase online for hundreds of dollars with a Patriot missile worth millions. More recently, U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, the current head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), has said on multiple occasions he believes that small drones represent a growing, outsized threat relative to their cost and that the U.S. military is presently on the “ wrong side ” of that equation. The U.S. military is very likely watching closely how Saudi Arabia deals with Houthi drones, as well as their cruise missiles, as it works to refine and expand its own capabilities to engage similar threats , especially in airspace over and around the United States . Those developments aside, the U.S. military, among many others, is still very much grappling now with how to counter these very real threats in a cost-effective manner. This, together with the relatively low monetary and skill barriers to the employment of lower-end drones, including hobbyist types modified to carry improvised munitions, to begin with, makes them very attractive to non-state actors , including terrorists and organized criminal enterprises . Spending millions of dollars to defeat a steady stream of drones that cost thousands of dollars is just not a sustainable proposition in the long term. This is certainly a reality that Saudis will only have increasingly contend with, especially as the Houthis have been notably stepping up drone and missile attacks on the Kingdom in recent months. Just last week, the group said it had hit various facilities belonging to Saudi Arabia’s military security forces, as well as oil and other energy industry-related sites, with a total of 18 drones . The escalating rebel attacks have also included the targeting of ships off the country’s coast using mines and remote-control explosive-laden boats . “We are prepared to carry out stronger and harsher military attacks in the coming period,” Yahya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman, wrote on Twitter after the mass drone attack last week. That statement came after the Iranian-backed group rejected a proposed Saudi peace plan. Continuing Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia, as well as inside Yemen, have also frustrated attempts by President Joe Biden’s administration in the United States to push for a diplomatic solution to the brutal conflict in the country, which has been raging since 2015. The U.S. government announced in February that it had stopped supporting Saudi-led “offensive” operations against the Houthis, which it also delisted as a designated terrorist group, as part of this effort . However, American officials did say that they would continue to help the Kingdom protect itself against the group’s attacks. In the meantime, the Saudis look set to have to continue to engage in this costly duel with the Houthis.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2021",Three New F-35 Squadrons To Be Based At Florida’s Previously Storm-Ravaged Tyndall Air Force Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, which was devastated by Hurricane Michael in 2018, is formally set to become a critical hub in the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighter enterprise, receiving three new squadrons of stealth fighters in the coming years. Plans, which first emerged just months after the storm ravaged the base, have been approved that will see 72 Lightning IIs get added to the base’s 325th Fighter Wing, beginning in 2023. The Air Force announced late yesterday that officials had formally chosen Tyndall to host the three F-35 squadrons. The advantages offered by the base, located on the Gulf of Mexico in the Florida Panhandle, include “infrastructure capability, quality of life for airmen, and airspace,” according to an official release from the service. An F-35A from Eglin Air Force Base taxis down the flight line at Tyndall Air Force Base, during an exercise., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Alex Fox Echols III “Adding F-35 squadrons at Tyndall ensures airmen will continue to have a strategic advantage as the 325th Fighter Wing enhances fighter training and combat readiness,” said Air Force Colonel Greg Moseley, the 325th’s commander. The base had originally been earmarked as a candidate location for the three squadrons after it was hit by Hurricane Michael. The devastation wrought by that storm required Tyndall’s aircraft — including its highly prized F-22 Raptors — to be dispersed to other bases across the country while a major renovation program began. That rework, which included replacing 100 percent of the base’s housing and infrastructure to support daily life, was done under the Pentagon’s Installation of the Future initiative, with the Florida facility becoming the flagship for this initiative. Although then Vice President Mike Pence tweeted in 2019 that F-35s would be based at Tyndall, the Air Force had remained quiet on the issue. Meanwhile, the redesign took into account the particular demands of F-35 basing, reflecting the fact that the stealth fighter requires its own specialized infrastructure and services. Despite that, officials still needed to wait on the results of a “thorough environmental impact analysis” as part of the National Environmental Policy Act before Tyndall could be green-lit for the Joint Strike Fighters. The addition of F-35s is certainly in-keeping with Tyndall’s Installation of the Future ethos, which even extends to the “robot dogs,” or Q-UGVs, that patrol the perimeters , the first of their kind to be used on regular Department of Defense operations. Meanwhile, the first F-35As for the 325th FW’s three new squadrons are scheduled to start arriving at Tyndall in September 2023. Each squadron is set to receive 24 aircraft in total, at which time full mission capability will be declared. An F-22 from the 325th Fighter Wing flies alongside an F-35A from the 33rd Fighter Wing over the Emerald Coast in northwest Florida., U.S. Air Force/1st Lt. Savanah Bray One of the huge benefits offered by Tyndall is its proximity to the Gulf Range Complex, which provides over 130,000 square miles of training airspace over the Gulf of Mexico. The range is among only a few in the United States that can handle large-scale air combat training and allows for supersonic speeds. “Direct access to this range is essential for fifth-generation fighter readiness and for live-fire testing and training,” the Air Force release stated, while Colonel Moseley described the airspace as a “national treasure.” He added: “The type of training conducted here integrates the [Department of Defense’s] most advanced aircraft and builds a dynamic force.” The training opportunities at Tyndal, now also include contractor-operated aggressor Mirage F1 fighter jets, flown by the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company , or ATAC. The first of these began to arrive at the base last December 14 . The detachment of around six aircraft is expected to fly more than 1,100 sorties to provide adversary air support, although one of the French-made fighters was involved in a landing accident last month. One of the ATAC Mirage F1Bs., CAULUN BELCHER IMAGES There will also be the potential for useful synergy, with F-35s at Tyndall and at nearby Eglin Air Force base, home to the Air Force’s main F-35 training unit, the 33rd Fighter Wing. The 33rd also presently supports the F-35 training activities of a number of foreign operators . Other factors, too, will have played into the decision to keep Tyndall open, and then to secure its future with the F-35. The base supports around 20,000 jobs in the communities surrounding it and pumps millions of dollars into the local economy each year. With this in mind, state politicians and Florida’s members of Congress campaign to keep the facility open. There remains a question, however, as to whether investing hundreds of millions of dollars into renovating this base for the demands of the F-35 makes long-term sense — after all, more storms hit Florida than any other U.S. state and the risk of another event like Hurricane Michael is undiminished. With the forthcoming arrival of the Joint Strike Fighter, attention will now turn to what happens to the other stealth jets at the base. The Air Force previously unveiled a plan to permanently reassign the F-22s from the 325th’s 95th Fighter Squadron, an operational unit, to other Raptor squadrons at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. Meanwhile, in March 2019, the Air Force formally designated Langley as its preferred future home of the 43rd Fighter Squadron, the F-22 Formal Training Unit (FTU). The incoming F-35 squadrons at Tyndall could help seal the deal on the move of the F-22s from the 43rd and 95th Fighter Squadrons to Langley. That base in Virginia would then become something of a Raptor “superbase,” since it already hosts two squadrons of the jets. Two F-22s sit on the ramp at Tyndall on March 1, 2019. These were the first Raptors at Tyndall since the Air Force evacuated the last of the jets from the decimated base in November 2018., U.S. Air Force With plans now in place to field three full squadrons of Joint Strike Fighters at Tyndall, the base’s remarkable recovery will continue and its future should be secured for years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 18, 2021",Russian Submarine Surfaced Beside Huge Hole Blown Open In The Ice Seen In Satellite Imagery,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery and space technology firm Maxar Technologies has released a fascinating image of an area where Russian submarines have been conducting drills as part of a larger Arctic exercise. Three submarines notably surfaced through the ice relatively close together last week, something you can read about more in our initial reporting on this drill. The new image shows a large hole blown through the ice, possibly by a torpedo, the purpose of which is unclear, but that might provide an opening for submerged submarines to quickly surface and fire ballistic or other missiles through during a time of war. On March 29, 2021, Maxar Tweeted out a composite of the satellite image together with a frame from a video that the Russian Ministry of Defense released last week showing the surfacing submarines and other scenes from the Umka-2021 Exercise , which is seen in full below. The image, which is dated March 27 and shows an area of ice south of Russia’s Alexandra Land Island , part of the Franz Josef Land archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, only shows one submarine, which the company identified as a Delta IV class ballistic missile type, as well as “hole in ice likely caused by underwater demolition.” The composite image of the Umka-2021 exercise area near Alexandra Land that Maxar Technologies released on March 29., Maxar Technologies A separate Maxar image, the date and location of which are unclear, but which is also from the Umka-2021 exercise area and that shows multiple points where submarines have surfaced through the ice, is also now circulating on social media. The Russian Ministry of Defense has yet to officially identify the three submarines seen in the video it released or say whether or not those are the only boats taking part in Umka-2021. Based on the official footage, seen below, it appeared that two of the submarines were Delta IV class types, while the third was either a Borei or Borei-A class ballistic missile submarine. Based on what can be seen of the submarines poking through the ice in the Russian Ministry of Defense’s video, as well other data points, H.I. Sutton, an expert on all things that travel underneath the waves, has now written that Knyaz Vladimir , the only example of the advanced Borei-A class submarine presently in Russian Navy service, has been one of the three boats participating in this exercise. Knyaz Vladimir was only commissioned in June 2020 after years of delays. The Borei-A class submarine Knyaz Vladimir ., Sputnik / Oleg Kuleshov In addition, Sutton said that one of the two Delta IVs appears to have been BS-64 Podmoskovye , which was lengthened and otherwise heavily modified as part of a conversion process that turned it into a special mission submarine. It is now capable of acting as a discreet mothership for the Losharik , a midget spy submarine. Losharik reportedly suffered a fire while attached to Podmoskovye in July 2019. You can read more about that incident, which led to the deaths of 14 Russian submariners, and the two submarines themselves, in these past stories . BS-64 Podmoskovye at the Russian Navy base in Severomorsk after the fire aboard Losharik in July 2019., TASS The Delta IV seen in the Maxar image from March 27 clearly shows the boxy superstructure behind the submarine’s sail that contains 16 launch tubes, each of which can be loaded with an R-29RMU Sineva submarine-launched ballistic missile. BS-64 notably lacks this feature. The Tula , a standard Delta IV class submarine, with the type’s distinctive boxy superstructure behind the sail., Russian Ministry of Defense As to the hole seen next to the submarine in the Maxar image, based on the width of the Delta IV design, it would appear to be around 80 feet wide. As to what created it, that is less clear. The Russian Ministry of Defense did previously disclose that a hole had been created in the ice as part of Umka-2021 that was related in some way to the firing of at least one torpedo by an unspecified submarine sailing under the ice. “According the [sic; to] the Russian MoD press reports a nuclear submarine used a torpedo to create a hole to surface through,” H.I. Sutton wrote . It’s not necessarily clear how such a maneuver would be performed, but it’s possible that a torpedo could be fired in an unguided mode at the underside of the ice by angling the submarine upward before launch. A wire-guided torpedo could potentially be manually steered into the ice, as well. Regardless, the hole seen in the Maxar imagery appears uniformly circular, which could have contributed to the company’s own assessment that it was the result of more deliberate “underwater demolition.” Personnel on top of the ice, or combat divers underneath, could have performed that task. A Russian TE-2 torpedo, a wire-guided variant of which is available., Rosoboronexport No matter how the hole was created, it could provide a space for a submarine to surface faster and more safely from beneath the ice to launch ballistic or other kinds of missiles . Otherwise, submarines would have to surface more completely through the ice, and then work to safely open their launch tubes. That is a process that would be slower and that would leave the boat more vulnerable, at least to some degree, even in the remote expanses of the Arctic. The video below shows a Russian Typhoon class ballistic missile submarine firing an R-39 Rif missile after surfacing fully through the ice in the Arctic. The actual launch is seen at around 3:38 in the runtime. Ballistic or guided missile submarines would still have to move out from under the ice to launch their weapons without surfacing. In general, the Arctic ice offers valuable protection for submarines that makes it especially difficult for opponents to spot them and track their movements. It is known that the Russians, among others, use the region to shield submarines, especially ballistic missile carrying types, on deterrent patrols, from prying eyes and prowling attack submarines. Artwork depicting a Delta series submarine firing a ballistic missile while surfaced in ice-filled waters., DOD Whatever the exact purposes of the hole, it only underscores that the submarine component of Umka-2021 has involved a number of notable tactics, techniques, and procedures, even if certain specific elements have been observed before. For example, Russian, as well as other countries’ submarines, especially those of the U.S. Navy , regularly conduct Ice Exercises (ICEX) in which they surface from underneath the Arctic Ice. However, the Russian Navy has already said that this instance involving the surfacing of the three large submarines through the ice together within a relatively small space, described as a circular area less than 2,000 feet in diameter, was a first for the service. Altogether, Umka-2021 appears to be a significant drill in this increasingly strategic region. The potential for competition and conflict has grown as global climate change has caused ice in the Arctic to recede, presenting access to new economic opportunities , including trade routes and largely untapped sources of natural resources, such as oil. Well before this particular exercise, Russia, among other countries, including the United States , had already been working hard to expand its ability to project military power, on and below the surface , as well as in the air , in the region. It will be very interesting to see what additional details about the submarine component of Umka-2021, as well as other aspects of this important drill, continue to emerge in the near future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Alerts from the Federal Aviation Administration strongly suggest that the U.S. Air Force’s first flight test of its AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic missile, or ARRW, is imminent. The recent arrival of the U.S. Army’s missile range instrumentation ship USAV Worthy in San Diego and of one of NASA’s WB-57F aircraft , which can be configured to help gather data from missile tests, at Naval Air Station Point Mugu outside of Los Angeles, also point to an impending launch. Air Force personnel work on an instrumented test article attached to a B-52H bomber ahead of an earlier captive-carry flight test in support of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) program, USAF The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a pair of Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) on March 27, 2021, regarding airspace restrictions in the Pacific Ocean near the Point Mugu Sea Test Range , itself situated to the southwest of Los Angeles, that would be off-limits on March 30. Then, today, March 29, the FAA put out another two notices describing identical airspace restrictions, but which would be in place on April 1. The block of restricted airspace described in the NOTAMs is what one would expect to see during a missile test and the existence of the second set of notices would seem to indicate an alternate test window should poor weather or any other issues force a delay.

NASA’s WB-57F with the U.S. civil registration code N927NA touched down at Point Mugu on March 26. Worthy is a modified Stalwart class ocean surveillance ship , which was originally built for the U.S. Navy as the USNS Worthy and transferred to the Army in 1995. The ship’s various large white domes contain radars that can track the movement of fast-flying missiles and other air vehicles and gather important telemetry data to assess their performance. NASA’s WB-57Fs have multiple payload spaces that can be relatively rapidly reconfigured to support various kinds of testing. The aircraft can notably be fitted with a nose-mounted turret containing electro-optical and infrared video cameras that can track and film missiles during launch. Images showing a NASA WB-57F with the sensor turret nose, at left, and a look at the displays for those cameras inside the aircraft, at right., NASA/Southern Research All of this comes after the Air Force announced on March 5 that the first AGM-183A flight test would take place “in the next 30 days” over the Point Mugu range. The service had previously said this launch would occur by the end of the first week of March and, before that, by the end of December 2020. Unspecified technical issues, together with impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have been cited as reasons for these delays . There have multiple captive-carry flight tests in support of the ARRW program, in which instrumented test articles remained attached to B-52H bombers . The U.S. military does conduct various testing in the waters off the coast of southern California. This includes missile and missile defense tests , such as routine launches of unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) from a silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base, situated some 140 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. California Environmental Protection Agency However, those types of longer-range tests typically are preceded by NOTAMs covering multiple, distinct areas where other stages of the missiles, or other debris, are expected to fall back to earth, which is not the case in this instance. The Air Force has already said that the first planned ARRW launch, formally known as Booster Test Flight 1 (BTF-1), will not be a test of the complete weapon system. The official March 5 news release stated: The ARRW BTF-1 will demonstrate the booster’s ability to reach operational speeds and collect other important data. In addition to booster performance, the test vehicle will also validate safe separation and controllability of the missile away from the carrier B-52H, through ignition and boost phase, all the way up to separation of a simulated glide vehicle. The simulated glider will not sustain flight, and will safely disintegrate soon after separation. The 412th Test Wing will conduct the ARRW BTF series over the Point Mugu Sea Range in California. The Point Mugu range and adjacent areas of the Pacific have also been used for hypersonic flight testing in the past, including those of the Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) and the Boeing X-51A Waverider . The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Air Force worked together on the HTV-2 and X-51A programs. ARRW is an outgrowth of DARPA’s Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) effort. The HTV-2 was an unpowered boost-glide vehicle similar in very broad respects to the one that the AGM-183A is designed to carry. Two tests of that design were carried out, one in 2010 and another in 2011, using ground-launched boosters fired from Vandenberg. The Worthy was also involved in those tests. A briefing slide providing an overview of the two HTV-2 tests, including the participation of the USAV Worthy , identified here as the USNS Worthy ., USAF The X-51A, in contrast, was an air-breathing hypersonic test vehicle, but one that was also launched via a B-52H. Four test flights were carried out of the X-51A between 2010 and 2013. A briefing slide providing details about one of the X-51A tests in which the vehicle was launched from within the Point Mugu range. The launch point and flight path of the vehicle align very well with the airspace that will be cordoned off tomorrow, according to the March 27 NOTAM., USAF With regards to the presence of the WB-57F at point Mugu, it’s also interesting to note out that NASA has been heavily involved in the Air Force’s Sky Range program , which has been working on developing new telemetry-gathering and other systems to support hypersonic testing that are set to be integrated onto modified RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-9 Reaper drones. At least one of NASA’s own Global Hawks is among those being converted into the new Range Hawk configuration, raising the possibility that its RQ-4 and MQ-9s will be at the core of the final Sky Range architecture. NASA Global Hawks have supported hypersonic testing in the past. However, there are no indications that any elements of the Sky Range system are in place for this apparent upcoming test, but it is a possibility that some of them could be used. An image the US Air Force released in 2020 of one of NASA’s RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, with the US civil registration code N874NA, after receiving modifications to support the Sky Range program. , USAF Sky Range is also just one element of substantial investments being made across the U.S. military, and elsewhere within the U.S. government, to support future hypersonic testing. ARRW is set to be the Air Force’s first operational air-launched hypersonic missile, but it is just one of many hypersonic weapons in development now across the services . “We’ve got some amazing [test] infrastructure, but it’s very old,” Air Force Major General Christopher Azzano, head of the Air Force Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California, told Air Force Magazine for a piece it published last week. “We’ve put sustainment money into it over the last few years, but it needs more.” Whether the forthcoming ARRW BTF-1 launch is successful or not, it will also be an important step forward for the service toward fielding hypersonic weapon capabilities it sees as critical for future conflicts, especially against near-peer opponents, such as China or Russia. “Hypersonics … will be the ‘break down the door’ weapon,” Mark Lewis, the Executive Director of the National Defense Industrial Association’s Emerging Technologies Institute, who left his post as the Pentagon’s Director of Defense Research and Engineering for Modernization in January, also told Air Force Magazine . As it stands now, all the pieces seem to be aligning for the first ARRW flight test to take place, possibly as soon as the next 24 hours.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The underside of a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighter was significantly damaged when a round fired from its underbelly 25mm gun pod exploded shortly after leaving the muzzle of the cannon mounted within. The accident, which occurred over the Yuma Range Complex in Arizona earlier this month, did not injure the pilot of the jet, who was able to bring the aircraft safely back to base. Military.com was first to report on the incident, which took place on March 12, 2021, during a close air support training sortie at night. The Marine Corps did not identify the unit to which the F-35B was assigned, but said it was among those based at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma , which is collocated with Yuma International Airport. This base is home to elements of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, including multiple squadrons equipped with F-35Bs, as well as other aircraft. A gun pod-equipped Marine F-35B comes in to land on the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Makin Island during operations off the coast of Somalia in December 2020., USMC “The mishap did not result in any injury to personnel, and an investigation of the incident is currently taking place,” Marine Corps Captain Andrew Wood, a spokesman for the service, told Military.com . Still, the Naval Safety Center, which also handles such matters for the Marines, categorized the accident as a Class A mishap. (Please see the update at the bottom of this piece) Class A is the most severe level in the U.S. military’s mishap scale, which covers incidents in the air and on the ground. For aviation accidents, Class A mishaps are defined as those resulting in at least $2.5 million in property damage, or the total loss of the aircraft, or one or more individuals being killed or permanently disabled. The specifics of how this particular mishap occurred are unclear. The F-35B, as well as the F-35C , can only carry the 25mm GAU-22/A Gatling-type automatic cannon in an underbelly pod, known as the GPU-9/A, while the F-35A has this weapon installed internally . The first live-fire tests of the gun pod took place in 2016 . Despite concerns about the accuracy of the weapon in the past, it has since been cleared for at least some level of operational use, notably being fitted to Marine F-35Bs supporting the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Somalia between December 2020 and January 2021. Military.com reported that the particular type of round that blew up underneath the F-35B in this incident was a PGU-32/B SAPHEI-T type . This stands for semi-armor-piercing high-explosive incendiary-tracer. When it functions properly, impacting a target triggers a fuze with a slight delay in the nose of the PGU-32/B’s projectile, which then sets off an incendiary element and a small explosive charge inside its main body. The resulting detonation then also spreads a small amount of zirconium, a compound that spontaneously ignites on contact with the air and burns at a very high temperature, causing additional damage. General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS), which, among other contractors, makes PGU-32/B ammunition, says on its website that these rounds have “inherent delay function for improved terminal effectiveness” and “improved graze sensitivity.” What this means is that the fuze in these rounds are designed to give the projectiles time to penetrate through some amount of armor or other “barriers” before detonating, for maximum effect, while the fuzes themselves are constructed in such a way to help ensure they go off even when they only glance a target, rather than hit it directly. A product sheet for the PGU-32/U round, which also provides a basic breakdown of the internal construction of the projectile., GD-OTS While we don’t know, an early detonation of the projectile could certainly point to a malfunction of some kind with the fuze. Of course, the investigation could well turn up other points of failure that led to this mishap, as well. It’s not clear right now if the round that exploded in this incident was even deliberately fired or if there might have been some broader weapons malfunction. Accidental discharges of aircraft guns are certainly not unheard of. In November 2020, the 30mm M230 cannon on a British Army AH-64D Apache went off during ground maintenance following an inflight weapons malfunction. Thankfully, the round in question was a practice type with an inert projectile. Any results of the investigation into that incident have yet to be publicly disclosed. In 2018, a Belgian F-16AM Viper fighter jet’s 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon let loose a string of rounds during an apparent inspection . That weapon was loaded with high-explosive ammunition and the incident left another F-16AM destroyed and a third damaged, as well as two ground crew personnel injured. Brand in Florennes ! pic.twitter.com/Uwu9gS04r3 — Tony Delvita (@ebcrew00) October 11, 2018 While the exact extent of the damage to the F-35B involved in this recent mishap remains to be seen, there may be a silver lining of sorts to this event in that it could provide useful information about the jet’s ability to withstand battle damage. As already noted, the jet was able to return to base after the round blew up. No matter what, thankfully the exploding cannon round did not injure the pilot or anyone else. UPDATE 3/29/21: The U.S. Marine Corps has informed us that this mishap was subsequently downgraded to Class C. This category covers incidents that result in between $60,000 and $599,999, or those that result in a nonfatal injury that leads to “loss of time from work beyond day/shift when injury occurred.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air F-35 Fighters Stealth"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",NORAD Fighters Are Using Arresting Gear For Year-Round Ops At Greenland’s Thule Air Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Royal Canadian Air Force CF-18 Hornet fighter jets have been operating in Arctic winter conditions at Thule, in Greenland, home of the northernmost U.S. airbase , an immensely strategic facility just 947 miles from the North Pole. The jets are helping prove the concept of year-round operations at the base in the High North, using the Mobile Aircraft Arresting System, which adds an important additional margin of safety for landing planes. The U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) announced recently that the U.S. Air Force’s 820th RED HORSE Squadron — the acronym standing for Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers — had installed the Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS) at Thule Air Base for use during the Amalgam Dart 21-2 air defense exercise. The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed that the MAAS was certified on March 21 via high-speed taxiing involving a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) CF-18. An RCAF pilot preflights their CF-18 Hornet at Thule Air Base., NORAD “The system slowed a CF-18 from 128 knots to a full stop in 1,000 feet,” NORAD added. “The MAAS ensures we can support fighter aircraft ops in high Arctic environments.” The MAAS is intended to be installed anywhere in the world where fighter operations may be required from short or icy runways or even those that have been damaged by enemy airstrikes . Similar equipment is also used to bring a fighter to a halt in an emergency situation . In the High Arctic environment, the MAAS gear reduces flight safety risks when recovering on runways that may be subject to snow, wind, and ice. At Thule, for example, winter temperatures can plummet to -47 degrees Fahrenheit, while winds reach as high as 100 knots. Thule Air Base, where day-to-day activities are currently overseen by the fledgling U.S. Space Force , first began to be constructed in 1950 and its existence was revealed to the public in late 1952. Thereafter it hosted interceptor jets, as well as Nike nuclear-armed surface-to-air missiles to protect it from potential attack and to defend against Soviet bombers that were expected to head to the United States if a war between the superpowers were to break out. The full story of this unique airbase is something that The War Zone examined in depth in this past feature . Since the Arctic winter at Thule presents more significant challenges to operations than most other airfields, concrete pads have also recently been installed there to allow rapid deployment of the MAAS throughout the year. When required, anchoring plates can be bolted into the concrete to then secure the MAAS. The 823rd RED HORSE Squadron installed and certified the Mobile Aircraft Arresting System for Amalgam Dart 21-2., NORAD According to the Air Force’s own manual on operating the system: “The MAAS is a pair of mobile units, each unit consisting of a BAK-12 arresting barrier mounted on a mobile trailer. The BAK-12 arresting barrier brake unit is an energy-absorbing type system. Prior to the development of the MAAS, a fixed BAK-12 based system was used for expeditionary type installations; these systems required more than 100 man-hours to install and stopped aircraft within 950 feet. The MAAS was originally developed and tested to accommodate the recovery of fighter aircraft that had to return to a battle-damaged airfield. In its unidirectional configuration with a 90- or 153-foot cable, the MAAS can be installed in as little as two hours and stop fighter aircraft in a 990-foot or 1,200-foot runout zone. Each trailer contains the basic components of a fixed BAK-12 based arresting system and all the tools and hardware necessary for installation and removal, except for installation on soils with alow bearing pressure. The system is air transportable.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpzh7q3H4Sk Amalgam Dart 21-2, which is running from March 20 to 26, is a wider Arctic air defense exercise involving the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and USAF at various northern locations, including Whitehorse in Yukon, Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, Edmonton in Alberta, Goose Bay in Newfoundland and Labrador, plus Iqaluit, Nun, and Thule in Greenland. Aside from the CF-18s from 3 Wing Bagotville, types taking part in the maneuvers include NATO E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), RCAF CP-140 long-range patrol aircraft , CC-130 search and rescue and tactical airlift aircraft, CC-150T tankers , and CH-149 Cormorant search and rescue helicopters; plus USAF F-16 fighter jets , KC-10 Extender , KC-46 Pegasus and KC-135 Stratotanker tankers, and C-130 and C-17 transport aircraft. An RCAF CF-18 Hornet on approach to Thule AB, Greenland, with a CH-149 Cormorant search and rescue helicopter in the foreground., NORAD The area of the exercise extends from the Beaufort Sea off the north of Alaska, to Greenland and then south down the Eastern Atlantic to the coast of Maine. The availability of the MAAS to provide year-round operations at Thule is significant. As we have discussed in the past , this airbase already serves as a vital outpost for early warning of a potential nuclear as well as providing a major logistical hub in a remote but strategically important region . MAAS-enabled fighter operations from Thule, within the context of Amalgam Dart, provides an additional operational node that helps expand the defensive bubble around the United States and Canada from aerial threats, even in the winter. NORAD officials have spoken of wanting greater situational awareness against various potential threats, including cruise missiles, and extending defensive coverage further out into the Arctic supports that aim. “We don’t want to be in a situation … where end game defeat is our only option,” Air Force General Glen D. VanHerck, commander of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month , referring to the growing cruise missile threat from Russia. A satellite image of Thule Air Base., GOOGLE EARTH Indeed, such is the strategic value placed on Greenland that President Donald Trump even said his administration was looking to purchase it from Denmark . That proposal, of course, was turned down by the Danish government, but the United States retains access to the strategic military outpost at Thule Air Base, now home to around 600 USAF personnel, civilian contractors, Danes, and Greenlanders. The U.S. military, in general, is becoming ever more interested in austere airfield operations, in Europe, the Indo-Pacific , and elsewhere. There may also be an argument that the CF-18 is better adapted to these particular kinds of operations than some other land-based fighters, thanks to its pedigree as a carrier-capable jet, built for the rigors of arrested landings . The same would apply to the F-35C carrier variant of the Joint Stike Fighter, which the U.S. Marine Corps is now also testing for arrested recoveries on land , as well as at sea. For its part, the ability to deploy detachments of fighters to the High Arctic, all year round, is a powerful counter to Russia’s increasing air and naval power in the region. Moscow, for its part, has been establishing new bases in the Arctic as well as stepping up its own fighter deployments to remote bases, including Rogachevo, in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, which hosted MiG-31BM Foxhound interceptors earlier this year . According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, 19 airfields of this kind have been repaired or reconstructed in the Arctic in recent years. A pair of RCAF CF-18s arrives at Thule AB., NORAD As well as being the likely route for a potential attack on Canada or the United States, the Arctic also has great significance for its natural resources and shipping routes, both of which are being expanded as the polar icecap continues to retreat in the face of climate change. For this reason, the United States is also forging increasingly closer links to strategic partners in the region, including Norway, which is currently hosting its first deployment of USAF B-1B Lancer bombers , and Iceland, where B-2 Spirit stealth bombers operated from last year. Thule Air Base can also serve as a stepping stone for offensive operations in Europe, especially in areas of Northern Europe just below the Arctic Circle. Thule could be a valuable base for land-based anti-submarine and other maritime patrol operations, as well, which could in turn benefit from having fighter cover during a major conflict. Previously, Russia was seemingly forging ahead when it came to expanding its military footprint in the Arctic. This latest exercise, however, with its promise of year-round fighter operations in Greenland, clearly points to America and Canada seeking to redress the balance. Correction: The original version of this piece incorrectly stated that the RED HORSE squadron involved in the exercise was the U.S. Air Force’s 823rd Squadron. In fact, the MAAS was installed by the 820th RED HORSE Squadron, out of Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sierra Nevada Corporation has revealed that one of the three A-29 Super Tucano single-engine turboprop light attack aircraft destined for Air Force Special Operations Command, or AFSOC, has received a special color scheme, recalling the command’s World War II heritage. It’s the first time we’ve seen official imagery of any of this trio of A-29s for the Air Force, which are due to be delivered to Hurlburt Field in Florida before the end of the year. The heritage color scheme is based on the patterns worn by the aircraft flown by the 1st Air Commando Group, an antecedent of today’s 1st Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, in the China, Burma, and India theater, or CBI, around 1944. Best-known among these were the P-51 Mustang and P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, but the scheme was also applied to transport, bomber, glider, and liaison types. All those aircraft wore distinctive diagonal white stripes around the olive drab fuselage, to aid identification and prevent friendly-fire incidents as they supported the British Chindit special operations forces on the ground. The second A-29 Super Tucano for Air Force Special Operations Command., Sierra Nevada Corporation Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) confirmed to The War Zone that the scheme, requested by Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will only appear on the second of the three aircraft. Painted at the request of AFSOC, the scheme will have special resonance with the Command, whose heritage continues to pay tribute to the 1st Air Commando Group’s exploits supporting the Chindits. I'm seeing that these are actually ALL Chindit references — Joseph Trevithick (@FranticGoat) April 7, 2016 The second aircraft arrived at Sierra Nevada Corporation’s (SNC) Centennial, Colorado, modification facilities on February 23, where it joined the first example, which wears a standard gray paint scheme, the same as that on Afghanistan’s A-29s. The third aircraft is meanwhile in final production at Embraer Defense & Security’s facilities in Jacksonville, Florida.

AFSOC will use the aircraft to support the training of CAAs, U.S. personnel who will then pass on their expertise by helping train allied air forces. The U.S. company will provide training and support for the Hurlburt A-29s continuing through 2024. A 711th Special Operations Squadron Combat Aviation Advisor watches a C-145 Combat Coyote as it approaches an unimproved runway near Eglin Air Force Base, Florida., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Dylan Gentile With so many nations around the world now operating the A-29, it makes a lot of sense for AFSOC to use this platform as the basis of the CAA program. According to the manufacturer, 15 air forces have selected the Super Tucano. One of the more recent customers is Nigeria , which is acquiring 12 examples via Foreign Military Sales channels, with the crew trained under the CAA initiative. The first examples of the Nigerian A-29 are due to be delivered in mid-2021. The decision to apply a special paint scheme to one of the AFSOC A-29s follows the unveiling of the Air Force’s first Beechcraft AT-6E Wolverine light attack aircraft last month, with that aircraft wearing a camouflage pattern inspired by a Cold War-era scheme known as European One . The Wolverines will be used to support the Airborne Extensible Relay Over-Horizon Network, or AEROnet, program, which aims to develop low-cost communications and data-sharing architecture to better integrate with allies and partners during coalition operations. The first U.S. Air Force AT-6E with its European One-inspired green-and-gray paint job, U.S. Air Force The Wolverine purchase came in the aftermath of the cancellation of the Air Force’s protracted and divisive Light Attack Aircraft (LAA) experiment, together with the three A-29s that are going to AFSOC. While the A-29s will be new equipment for AFSOC, the Air Force is already familiar with them, having established a unit, the 81st Fighter Squadron , to train Afghan pilots to fly them, as part of the Light Air Support (LAS) program. That effort has now been completed and the final aircraft recently transferred to Afghanistan, where a U.S. instructor pilot ejected from an A-29 in an accident last summer. The mission that the pilot was involved in is a good example of the kind of security missions CAAs might be called upon to undertake, as well.

The A-29s have been tested and evaluated by other U.S. services, as well, most notably during the Navy’s Imminent Fury project, which you can read more about here . The Super Tucano would also have been in the running for the Air Force’s Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) program, which ran in parallel to the aforementioned LAS effort and likely would have had a CAA support component, as well. An A-29 of the 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia., U.S. AIR FORCE Beyond the CAA mission, AFSOC has, for some years, been seeking to introduce an aircraft for light attack and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions that would be better matched to lower-end warfare, including counter-terrorism, flying in uncontested airspace, and requiring minimal support infrastructure. That program is known as Armed Overwatch , but Congress blocked a fiscal 2021 request for funds to begin buying the aircraft last year. It is still possible, however, that AFSOC may eventually get its hands on an Armed Overwatch platform. Earlier this year, the Command confirmed that it plans to undertake flying demonstrations of different platforms this year, with the aim of launching a procurement process in fiscal 2022. An Afghan Air Force A-29 from the Kabul Air Wing based at Hamid Karzai International Airport in the country’s capital, Kabul., U.S. AIR FORCE “I think we can do [Armed Overwatch] at relatively low risk based on what we’ve seen from the vendors who have indicated that they intend to bring platforms to demonstrate for us in the coming months,” said Lieutenant General James Slife , the AFSOC commander. At this stage, it’s too early to say what type, or types, might be procured, if Armed Overwatch proceeds as planned. Reportedly , SNC, Textron Aviation, Air Tractor, and Leidos have all expressed their interest. However, with the A-29 set to be established in AFSCOC in a training capacity before the end of the year, it could find itself especially well placed to become the Command’s next light attack/ISR aircraft, too.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. No fewer than 20 Chinese People’s Liberation Army aircraft flew within Taiwan’s southwest air defense identification zone today, in a significant expansion of activity within this area, which covers most of the highly volatile Taiwan Strait . In what seems like a deliberate escalation over other recent incursions, today’s mission included bombers and airborne early warning platforms, as well as the more familiar fighters and surveillance aircraft. According to Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft that entered the air defense identification zone (ADIZ) today comprised four H-6K bombers , 10 J-16 multirole fighters (Chinese-made derivatives of the Russian Su-30 Flanker ), two J-10 fighter jets , two KQ-200 anti-submarine patrol planes , one Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft, and a KJ-500 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft. An archive photo of a PLA H-6K bomber armed with KD-63 cruise missiles , released by Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense today., Taiwan Ministry of Defense Today’s incident appears to involve the largest number of PLA aircraft to have entered the southwest ADIZ since January 24, when 15 planes were involved in a major incident that The War Zone reported on in-depth at the time. That particular incursion involved six J-10s, four J-16s, two Su-30 multirole fighters, two Y-8 anti-submarine patrollers, and a Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft. In both cases, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense announced that “Airborne alert sorties had been tasked, radio warnings issues, and air defense missile systems deployed to monitor the activity.” Photos of the PLA aircraft types involved today were released by Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense, but all were archival images, including some from previous intercepts. As well as the sheer number of PLA aircraft involved today, the route they took also appears to be significantly modified, compared to previous occasions. During the major incursion on January 24, for example, the PLA aircraft headed out into the northeastern reaches of the South China Sea, in more or less a straight line, before turning around heading back to the mainland. Today, however, some of the bombers, as well as one of the anti-submarine Y-8s, continued their flightpaths further out into the South China Sea, before hooking around further behind Taiwan and then returning. This would seem to demonstrate the ability to approach the island on attack runs from the opposite flank. Currently, Taiwan’s defenses are focused mainly on repelling an attack from the southwest approach to the island, closest to the mainland. Composition and flightpaths of the January 24 incident., Taiwan Ministry of Defense Composition and flightpaths of the March 26 incident., Taiwan Ministry of Defense Beijing views Taiwan as a rogue province and the PLA is prepared to invade and seize control of the island by force if necessary, including if the island declares full independence. In his 2017 book, The Chinese Invasion Threat : Taiwan’s Defense and American Strategy in Asia , Ian Easton cited official Chinese military documents that indicated that, in time of war, PLA aircraft would focus their initial attention on “important command and control centers, early-warning radars, airstrips, and air defense batteries.” Taiwan’s immensely valuable Leshan radar station, which houses an AN/FPS-115 PAVE PAWS phased array early warning radar., VIA FAS.ORG Since the beginning of this year, the area around the northern end of the South China Sea has seen repeated, large-scale incursions by PLA aircraft. In January, there was a pronounced uptick in these activities as the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , and its carrier strike group, was in the region. The U.S. carrier was reportedly subject to mock attack runs by PLA aircraft. As the PLA busily expands its aircraft inventory, as well as its arsenal of air-, sea-, and ground-launched missiles for just this type of eventuality, Taiwan has accordingly sought to bolster its defenses. These range from F-16 fighter jets that are tasked with combat air patrols to meet potential intruders in the ADIZ, to fast-firing gun- and missile-based point-defense systems to defend critical military installations against a range of threats, from cruise missiles to small drones . Meanwhile, passive defensive measures on Taiwan’s part extend to military infrastructure, including Jiashan and Taitung Air Bases on the eastern shores of the island. The two hardened bases feature hangars and other facilities that are partially hidden inside granite mountains, to protect them from all kinds of air attack, including by conventionally armed ballistic missiles . A KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft., Taiwan Ministry of Defense In the past, installations on the eastern side of Taiwan were afforded a degree of protection from attack due to the fact that PLA ground-launched land-attack cruise missiles didn’t necessarily have the range to hit targets on the other side of the island. At the same time, Chinese sea- and air-launched platforms were less numerous or would have to be launched within the range of Taiwanese air and shore-based anti-ship defenses. This protection has increasingly been eroded, while a “hook” maneuver by PLA bombers armed with cruise missiles provides another option to attack objectives on the eastern side of Taiwan, or from two directions. Similar kinds of tactics seem to have been demonstrated in the past, too. In May 2018, PLA aircraft flew fighters and bombers in a route that effectively encircled Taiwan . A KQ-200 anti-submarine patrol aircraft., Taiwan Ministry of Defense Meanwhile, Beijing has not neglected the development of its military infrastructure on the western side of Taiwan Strait, too. Earlier this month, satellite imagery showed significant progress on the construction of what appears to be a huge new military heliport very close to the Taiwan Strait, only around 150 miles from Taiwan proper, and even closer to various Taiwanese-controlled islands. The new base occupies a commanding position to support any future operations to control the Strait or even invade Taiwan. As well as the status of Taiwan itself in Chinese military planning, all these activities point to the huge strategic significance, in general, of this part of the South China Sea, where it meets the bottom end of the Taiwan Strait , as well as the Philippine Sea and the broader Western Pacific, via the Bashi Channel, which has also been the scene of intense aerial and naval activity . The entire South China Sea is hotly disputed, with Beijing making claims to virtually all of it, a position that’s unsurprisingly rejected by the United States and most other countries. PLA aircraft are also making increasing use of a constellation of man-made island outposts in the South China Sea, many of which also include their own ground-based anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles. Last year, a photo emerged showing an H-6J cruise missile carrier on Woody Island , a Chinese island outpost in the northern South China Sea, for the first time One Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft was involved in today’s mission, seemingly a Y-8GX-8 electronic intelligence variant, based on this accompanying photo release., Taiwan Ministry of Defense As well as being crisscrossed by commercial shipping routes, the area is routinely patrolled by Chinese submarines , including ballistic missile boats , and has hosted large-scale maritime maneuvers by the PLA Navy, including the participation of the aircraft carrier Shandong and the service’s first Type 075 amphibious assault ship . “Taiwan is clearly one of [China’s] ambitions,” U.S. Navy Admiral Phil Davidson, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the top American military command in the Pacific region, told members of Congress recently. “I think the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact in the next six years,” he added. Continued large-scale PLA aircraft activity in the northern end of the South China Sea, and potential new attack routes, suggest Beijing has no intention of scaling back its show of resolve toward Taiwan. It also sends a powerful signal to other countries in the region, as well as to the United States, and other powers seeking to operate freely in the Western Pacific.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",The “Birth” Of A Chinook Is The Weirdest Helicopter Display You Will Ever See,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Think of memorable air show displays and the chances are you’ll recall some of the spectacular routines flown by thrust-vectoring F-22 Raptor stealth fighters , super-maneuverable Su-35 Flanker fighter jets , or perhaps one of the U.S. Air Force’s iconic heritage formations . This video, however, presents something completely different: a pair of Royal Australian Air Force CH-47 Chinook helicopters performing what can only be described as a formation courtship dance, with a rather literal — and totally unique — conclusion. The footage was taken during an air show commemorating the Diamond Jubilee, or 60th anniversary, of the Royal Australian Air Force, or RAAF, which took place at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland, near the country’s eastern coast, on April 5, 1981. Billed as “the most spectacular air show ever staged in Australia,” the event was presented as a 2.5-hour live telecast on the ABC-TV channel. Royal Australian Air Force CH-47C Chinooks during the Diamond Jubilee at their home base. , Facebook Screencap Perhaps with the thought in the backs of their minds that the hulking Chinook would have to compete with RAAF fast jets — this was the era of the mighty Mirage III and show-stopping F-111 — as well as dedicated display teams , the service’s rotary-wing specialists decided to take a very different approach to their display sequence. As the first export customer for the twin-rotor heavy-lift helicopter, they were clearly keen to make an impression. Whatever the thinking, the result is simply one of the most unusual air show routines you’re likely to see. The commentary, provided by ABC’s David Flatman, himself a former pilot, and Jeff Watson, helps, too, with the pair clearly in on the joke, and enjoying every moment of it. As the Chinook pair, led by Squadron Leader Chris Beatty, show off the big helicopter’s handling qualities, in a perfectly coordinated flight low over the runway, the mood takes a rapid change of direction. “I think they almost kissed there, Jeff,” remarks Flatman, before noting that the Chinooks in the two-ship routine were starting to resemble “a pair of brolgas [a type of Australian crane species] in some form of mating ritual.” That is exactly what the RAAF aviators have planned, of course, and the remainder of the display involves the helicopters approaching each other, turning tightly in formation, breaking and, what the commentators describe as “cuddling.” Finally, the “female” Chinook returns to the runway, escorted by a “medical vehicle.” You can probably guess what happens next, but it involves a “surgeon,” male personnel dressed in scrubs (and also in drag), plus a comically oversize nursing bottle. One of the RAAF Base Amberley Volkswagen Transporter vans, hastily converted into an “ambulance.”, Facebook Screencap The whole routine is something that, perhaps, could only have emerged in the 1980s. However, there was a more serious side in the demonstration of the Chinook’s capabilities, which have served the Australian Defense Forces so well. Today, the much more advanced CH-47F is flown by the Australian Army, rather than the RAAF, with 10 examples based at Townsville and used for airmobile, air assault, aeromedical evacuation, and amphibious operations. “Laughs aside, the technical coordination of that flying is seriously impressive,” Flight Lieutenant Andy Donovan a U.K. Royal Air Force Chinook pilot, who has also performed air displays in the type, told The War Zone , after watching the video. “The timing of their maneuvers is far more difficult than it is made to look when you consider the effects of wind on a large helicopter and the lack of visibility from the cockpit when it comes to tracking the other machine. No doubt a well-planned and rehearsed crew effort.” Facebook Screencap One thing that comes across in the video is the fact the Chinook is very fast for its size, in addition to its impressive high-altitude and other performance specifications. This has helped it to perform time and again in demanding operational scenarios and is part of the reason it has been a ubiquitous feature of most American military operations since the Vietnam War, as well as serving with numerous allies. Furthermore, the particular kinds of close-in maneuvering that Squadron Leader Beatty and his team present can also be seen in real-world scenarios, especially the Chinook’s impressive ability to perform pinnacle landings , something that The War Zone has also explored previously, here and here . A line of No. 12 Squadron Chinooks at RAAF Base Amberley in the 1980s., Firemanwill14/Wikimedia Commons In less than a week, the RAAF will mark its centenary, with a planned flypast over Canberra involving over 60 aircraft. That will, no doubt, be very different from how things were done 40 years ago. But the amorous Chinook pair remind us that the world of military aviation is always ready to spring a surprise of some kind. Hat-tip to Eamon Hamilton for bringing this video to our attention.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Three Russian ballistic missile submarines surfaced next to each other from beneath the ice near the North Pole as part of a recent major Arctic exercise. The head of the country’s Navy said that event was a first for his service. It also underscores the growing geopolitical competition in this highly strategic region . On March 26, 2021, the Russian Ministry of Defense released details , as well as imagery, about the submarine activity that has been a part of the Umka-2021 drills. So far, the Kremlin has not officially confirmed what submarines are taking part in the exercise, which began on March 20, and has also seen an unspecified nuclear submarine fire a torpedo underneath the Arctic ice. Three Russian ballistic missile submarines surfaced near the North Pole as part of the Umka-2021 Exercise., Russian MoD capture However, official video footage, seen in full later in this story, shows what appears to be at least two sails belonging to Delta IV class submarines, also known as Project 667BDRM Delfins . It’s possible that the third boat could be either a member of the Borei class , or the lone Borei-A class submarine presently in service, the Knyaz Vladimir . The Borei and Borei-A designs are Russia’s most advanced ballistic missile submarines. Both of these types can be loaded with up to 16 RSM-56 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles, each one of which can be armed with between 6 and 10 Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles (MIRV), depending on the type of nuclear warhead. The Delta IVs can be armed with up to 16 R-29RMU Sineva submarine-launched ballistic missiles, themselves capable of each carrying either 4 or 10 MIRVs, again depending on the warhead type. A pair of MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors , supported by an Il-78 aerial refueling tanker, also flew over the North Pole and troops have been conducting maneuvers on the ground in extreme cold weather conditions as part of Umka-2021. Average temperatures in the exercise area, at present, are ranging between -13 and -22 degrees Fahrenheit, with winds gusting up to just over 70 miles per hour, according to state-run media outlet TASS . “As part of the Arctic expedition, three nuclear-powered submarines surfaced from under the ice in a limited space with a radius of 300 meters [approximately 984 feet] for the first time in the history of the Russian Navy,” Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, Command-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, reported to President Vladimir Putin on March 26. “For the first time, a set of combat training, scientific research, and practical diverse measures is underway under the single design and plan in subpolar regions.” Russian Geographical Society has also been involved in Umka-2021, which has been taking place primarily in and around Alexandra Land Island in the Franz Josef Land archipelago, a group of Russian islands in the Arctic Ocean. It is known that Russian ballistic missile submarines conduct deterrent patrols under the protection of the Arctic ice , where is especially difficult to track their movements. They do, of course, still have to move out from under the ice to unleash their deadly payloads. It is also hardly the first time a submarine has pushed its way up through that ice as part of an exercise. The U.S. Navy notably conducts Ice Exercises (ICEX) each year in which submarines surface from under the ice , though not with ballistic missile boats. However, this particular drill is, nevertheless, a significant show of force and general demonstration of the Russian Navy’s strategic capabilities. The Delta IV class ballistic missile submarine Tula ., Russian MoD The Borei class ballistic missile submarine Alexander Nevsky ., Russian MoD The Borei-A class ballistic missile submarine Knyaz Vladimir ., Sputnik / Oleg Kuleshov Beyond that, submarine operations around the world typically occur with a certain degree of secrecy, and boats sailing on the surface outside of very mundane activities, such as returning to their homeport, often carry a message. For instance, the appearance of Omsk , an Oscar II class guided-missile submarine, also known as a Project 949A, on the surface in the Bering Sea off Alaska in August 2020 sent alarm bells ringing and prompted an unusual public statement from U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) that it was monitoring the situation. That notably followed the equally rare decision on the U.S. Navy’s part to publicize a visit to Norway by the highly-advanced and extremely secretive submarine USS Seawolf earlier that month. Seawolf and her two sister ships, including the larger and uniquely configured spy submarine USS Jimmy Carter , are all known themselves to be particularly capable when it comes to cruising quietly under the Arctic ice. In December 2020, the Navy also made a very public display of sending the USS Georgia sailing on the surface through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf a moment of particularly heightens tensions with Iran. Georgia is one of four Ohio class ballistic missile submarines converted into guided-missile submarines. They also received significant intelligence-gathering and command and control capabilities, something you can read about more in this past feature and that has made them some of the most in-demand boats in the Navy today. In the same way, it was taken as a message from the United States to China when three of the four Ohio guided-missile boats surfaced at virtually the same time , though at different locations in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, in 2010. That followed Chinese tests that sent missiles flying into the East China Sea. With regards to Umka-2021, all of this is magnified by the ever-increasing strategic significance of the Arctic and growing geopolitical competition there, as a result. Much of this has been driven by the emergence of new economic opportunities as global climate change has caused ice in the region to recede. This has made the prospect of sending commercial shipping via the Northern Sea Route more viable and offers the possibility of greater access to untapped natural resources, including oil and natural gas. Just this week, Russia’s state nuclear agency Rosatom has been promoting the Northern Sea Route as an alternative to traditional routes in light of the very serious situation in the Suez Canal. The container ship Ever Given , the world’s largest, has been preventing any maritime movement through that strategic chokepoint since it ran around on March 23. Rosatom is notably responsible for operating Russia’s unique fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers, which includes the Arktika , the largest ship of this type with any kind of propulsion in the world. With all this in mind, it’s interesting to remember that Russian Tu-142 Bear long-range maritime patrol planes buzzed a temporary camp established on an ice floe in international waters off Alaska as part of a U.S. Navy-led ICEX around this time last year. The Seawolf -class USS Connecticut and the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Toledo both took part in that training event, which included surfacing through the ice in close proximity to each other. The Umka-2021 drills come as Russia and the United States, among others , are working to expand their abilities to project military power into the Arctic. Russia has been working particularly hard to build new facilities and expand existing ones , especially air bases, in the region. The U.S. military, in cooperation with Canada, just recently demonstrated its ability to conduct more routine combat aviation operations out of the strategic Thule Air Base in Greenland, as well. “We’re in competition … and to be competitive with Russia and China, specifically in the Arctic, you have to be on the field,” U.S. Air Force General Glen VanHerck, who presently serves as both head of NORTHCOM and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), told members of Congress just last week. “And, so it’s crucial that we do that and we continue producing capabilities that will allow us to be in the Arctic.” The Russian Navy sending three ballistic missile submarines punching through the Arctic ice together in a row near the North Pole provides a very clear look at this competition and more such displays are likely to come as the geopolitical friction in the region continues to increase.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 15, 2021",North Korea Carried Out The First Known Test Of Its Newest Ballistic Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The ballistic missiles that North Korea fired into the Sea of Japan earlier today were of a new type that it had only shown publicly for the first time at a parade in January . This appears to be the first confirmed test of these missiles and the first test of a ballistic missile of any kind that the country has carried out since President Joe Biden took office in the United States earlier this year. An official statement from the regime in Pyongyang said that the weapon can carry a warhead weight up to two and a half tons and was based, in part, on previously developed missile technology . North Korean state media released the first official details about the launches, as well as pictures, early on what is already March 26 on the Korean Peninsula. Interestingly, Ri Pyong Chol, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, a member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau, and a secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, the official name of the North Korean Communist party, “guided” the test, rather than the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un. Ri Pyong Chol, at center in the peaked cap, with other North Korean officials during the test of the new ballistic missile., KCNA “The newly developed new-type tactical guided projectile is a weapon system whose warhead weight has been improved to be 2.5 tons with the use of the core technology of [a] tactical guided projectile that was already developed,” according to North Korean state news outlet KCNA , with “projectile” clearly meaning “missile” in this context given the accompanying pictures. “The two test-fired new-type tactical guided projectile[s] accurately hit the target set in the waters 600 kilometers [~373 miles] off the east coast of Korea.” Full KCNA statement on the ""new-type tactical guided projectile"" tested on Thursday. It discusses a 2.5-ton warhead and ""low-altitude gliding leap type flight mode."" pic.twitter.com/tFjhZfYw7w — Josh Smith (@joshjonsmith) March 25, 2021 It’s worth noting that an earlier statement from the Japanese government said that country had assessed that the one of missiles had traveled around 420 kilometers, while the other had flown some 430 kilometers, or almost 261 miles and just over 267 miles, respectively. South Korean officials said both missiles flew approximately 450 kilometers, or almost 280 miles. ""Hamju"" may refer to nearby Sondok or Yonpo Air Bases Both bases previously used in 2019 for Kim Jong Un supervised tests of large calibre guided MRLS (KN-25) pic.twitter.com/5p33oKIlKK — Joseph Dempsey (@JosephHDempsey) March 25, 2021 Two previous tests of KN-23 also had reported distance traveled of 420km and 430km (May 2019, August 2019) https://t.co/ruuPI9BvdJ — Sam Meyer (@SamAbuJorj) March 25, 2021 All of these ranges were in line with what had been seen in previous tests of a missile that North Korea unveiled in 2019 that is at least visually reminiscent of the Russian Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile. The official North Korean nomenclature for that weapon is unknown, but the U.S. government refers to it as the KN-23 . However, the pictures that North Korea released of this latest test show that that the weapon is not the KN-23, but rather appears to be a ballistic missile the country publicly debuted at a military parade in Pyongyang in January. This new weapon, the formal designation of which is unknown, as is the U.S. nomenclature, is notably larger, as evidenced by its 10-wheeled transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). The KN-23 TEL only has eight wheels. The TELs for both weapons each carry two missiles, side-by-side in a rear compartment. A picture of the moment of launch of one of the ballistic missiles fired in the recent North Korean tests, showing the 10-wheeled transporter-erector-launcher., KCNA 10-wheeled TELs and carrying examples of a previously unseen ballistic missile during a parade in Pyongyang in January 2021., North Korean state media A picture of a KN-23 launch from an eight-wheeled TEL in 2019., North Korean state media All of this, combined with KCNA ‘s report that this weapon is based on a “projectile that was already developed,” would seem to indicate that this new missile is an enlarged derivative of the KN-23. As for why North Korea, which has an expansive arsenal of longer-range ballistic missile types, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missile designs, developed this missile in the first place, the country’s military planning decisions are still influenced heavily by the potential for conflict on the Korean Peninsula with South Korea and its American allies, as well as Japan. Advanced ballistic missiles able to be launched along depressed quasi-ballistic trajectories and then maneuver in flight, capabilities that the Iskander-M reportedly has , for instance, present distinct challenges for opponents. Reports in 2019 raised concerns that existing South Korean air and surface-based radars had failed to spot the first tests of the KN-23 that year. Russia’s Iskander-Ms are also capable of carrying nuclear warheads, which raises the possibility that North Korea may be able to arm these missiles, as well as the smaller KN-23s, in that way, as well. The KN-23 and its larger cousin are both solid-fuel missiles , which are faster to prepare for launch, as well as just generally safer to handle and store, than liquid fuel types. All of this could combine to make this new design particularly difficult to detect and potentially preemptively target during an actual conflict, as well as attempt to intercept after launch. North Korea’s developments in this regard may be further driven by similar work being done in South Korea and the United States. In 2017, reports said that South Korea was seeking to develop its own new ballistic missile capable of carrying a two-ton warhead . Following the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the United States and Russia in 2019, the U.S. military promptly began developing new ground-launched ballistic, as well as cruise missiles, as well. That agreement had prohibited the fielding of land-based ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,100 miles. When it comes to the decision to test these new missiles now, that seems to be, at least in part, a message meant for President Joe Biden and his administration in the United States. Just last week, Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un’s sister and powerful confidant the North Korean leader, warned the U.S. government in what appeared to be Hermit Kingdom’s first official public remarks aimed plainly at American officials since Biden took office in January. “We take this opportunity to warn the new U.S. administration trying hard to give off [gun] powder smell in our land,” Kim Yo Jong said in the statement, which was primarily focused on chastising South Korean authorities over an exercise its military was conducting with the its American counterparts. “If it [the U.S.] wants to sleep in peace for the coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.” Kim Yo Jong, at right, and her brother, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in 2018., North Korean state media Biden has inherited extremely complex relations with the North Korean regime, which initially engaged with President Donald Trump and his administration on a worryingly hostile level , before entering into an extended period of detente with the United States. This included the first-ever meeting between a U.S. President and North Korean leader and an unprecedented degree of diplomatic engagement between the two countries, including two subsequent summits between Trump and Kim. However, the collapse of the second summit presaged a significant cooling in relations that included Pyongyang’s decision to end a self-imposed moratorium on major weapons testing. Prior to these latest ballistic missile launches, North Korea had fired a number of smaller weapons, believed to be cruise missiles, this past weekend . Cruise missile testing, unlike launching ballistic missiles, is not in violation of any of the various United Nations Security Council resolutions that the regime in Pyongyang is subject to. “According to the Defense Department, it’s business as usual, there’s no new wrinkle in what they did,” Biden told reporters when questioned afterward about those earlier tests. White House officials also said those launches weren’t an impediment to future talks between U.S. and North Korean officials. U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) had issued a statement about the new ballistic missile tests that underscored that the United States sees these launches as more serious. The command said that the North Korean activity “highlights the threat that North Korea’s illicit weapons program poses to its neighbors and the international community.” “Let me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested — number one, President Biden also said during a press conference on March 25. “We’re consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses — if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly.” “But I’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization,” he continued. “So that’s what we’re doing right now: consulting with our allies.” It remains to be seen how the Biden administration, in cooperation with allies, especially in South Korea and Japan, may respond more directly to these tests. At the same time, they underscore that, despite years of existing sanctions, North Korea continues to develop new and improved ballistic missile capabilities to challenge its opponents in the region and beyond.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 2, 2021",The Air Force Spent $134M To Repair 39 Hail-Damaged T-1 Jet Trainers It’s About To Retire,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force invested $134 million in repairs for 39 T-1A Jayhawk twin-engine jet trainers grounded after being severely damaged in a Texan hailstorm. That’s an average of $3.4 million per jet, part of a fleet of aircraft that the service is planning to retire in 2025. While the Jayhawks from the 47th Flying Training Wing were damaged when the hailstorm struck their Laughlin Air Force Base home in February 2016, the Air Force announced today that the last of the jets was repaired and then returned to service last December. An instructor pilot and student walk through a pre-flight inspection before a flight in a T-1A Jayhawk, last June, at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Anne McCready Air Education and Training Command (AETC) called upon the Mobility and Training Aircraft Directorate to repair the planes and get them back into service. “We deployed a team to Laughlin AFB, Texas to do a site survey, and we determined that the damaged aircraft would have to be sent to a depot-like facility to be repaired,” said Herman Brandon, Chief, Specialized Trainer Aircraft Branch, part of the directorate’s Legacy Trainer Aircraft Division. “From there, we established two repair lines which we knew would expedite getting the aircraft back into service.” The two repair lines were at an L3 Harris facility in Waco, Texas, and at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. The latter facility required special certification to repair commercial-derivative aircraft, the T-1A being a military version of the Beech 400A. It has been in use with the Air Force since 1993 and features some structural enhancements and an extra fuel tank, among other small modifications, for its role as a military trainer. The first Jayhawk from an initial batch of 11 arrived at the 309th AMARG from Laughlin AFB on August 1, 2017. Plans called for the remaining aircraft will cycle in and out of the AMARG over the following year. The initial concern was around the major external damage caused by the hailstones, with depot-level skin replacement expected to comprise the bulk of the repair work. However, more thorough inspections revealed many more problems. A T-1A Jayhawk arrives at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group on August 1, 2017, for hail damage repair., U.S. Air Force/Teresa Pittman “If you ever watched [the home improvement T.V. series] This Old House , well that’s what these aircraft were like,” Brandon added. “Once we removed the skins, we found additional over and above work was required.” Among the other items that needed to be addressed were copper corrosion in some of the aircraft, repairing frame cracks, and undisclosed “pressurization challenges.” Clearly, the work was important to bring the 47th Flying Training Wing back up to speed in their syllabus, which involves advanced training for students identified to go into airlift, tanker, or command-and-control aircraft. Having 39 aircraft sidelined from a fleet of 178 had an adverse effect on aircraft availability. However, $134 million is an immense expenditure of resources relative to the aircraft. While we can’t say for sure the exact cost for each jet, the average of $3.4 million is well over the threshold of $2.5 million that the Department of Defense defines as a Class A mishap — a major aviation accident. Hail damage on the wing of a T-1A Jayhawk at the 47th Maintenance Directorate at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, February 2016., U.S. AIR FORCE After all, a second-hand Beech 400A is relatively cheap to acquire and even a totally refurbished and upgraded example with new engines and advanced avionics—basically a brand new jet—isn’t much more than the price of the repairs. Currently, the most expensive Model 400A with its price listed on Controller.com would cost $1.39 million. Meanwhile, the cheapest Model 400A listed is priced at $590,000 . Looking at other high-end options, Nextant Aerospace offers the remanufactured Model 400XTi, with Williams FJ44-3AP engines and Rockwell Collins Pro Line 21 integrated flight deck. Even one of these nearly brand new jets can apparently be picked up for $2.3 million used or just under $4 million new. Ruben Luna, a 47th Maintenance Directorate T-1A Jayhawk aircraft worker, displays his commemorative work shirt of the 2016 hail damage at Laughlin Air Force Base, in April 2019., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman John A. Crawford The significant cost of the repairs is even more surprising given the fact that the Air Force plans to do away with the Jayhawk altogether before too long. Last August it was reported that the Air Force planned to phase out the trainers between fiscal 2023 and 2025. Instead, Air Education and Training Command will rely on a simulator-only syllabus for its new-look Air Mobility Fundamentals course. The control panel in the cockpit of the T-1A Jayhawk., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Anne McCready Beyond, that, it’s likely only a handful of the jets will remain in use with the 12th Flying Training Wing at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, to train combat systems officers. The hailstorm at Laughlin Air Force Base in February 2016 joins an inauspicious list of significant damage done to Air Force aircraft and installations by extreme weather events in recent years. In June 2017, a tornado ripped through Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, home of Strategic Command, resulting in two of the Air Force’s four E-4B National Airborne Operations Centers being damaged. Other examples include Hurricane Michael, which made a direct hit on Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, in October 2018, leaving immense destruction in its wake . Another tornado hit tore through the Dayton, Ohio area in May 2019, home to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, damaging dozens of houses in one of the base’s residential areas. As for the Jayhawks, while it’s possible the plan to retire them may not have been on anyone’s radar when the decision to repair the damaged aircraft was taken, it still seems remarkable that such a costly project was continued even after the full scope of the damage became clear. What’s more, the Air Force also spent around $156 million upgrading T-1A avionics in 2018. It can only be hoped that the Air Force gets the most value out of these training jets in what might be only a brief swansong in service. After that, it might be these renovated Jayhawks get sold off to commercial and private operators at rock-bottom prices. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"
Stephen Walker,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",Canada’s CF-105 Arrow Interceptor Is The Cold War Legend That Refuses To Die,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The CF-105 Arrow was a uniquely Canadian response to the Cold War threat of nuclear-armed Soviet bombers . The Arrow’s promised and demonstrated performance — as well as resplendent aesthetics — commanded attention around the world and garnered major excitement at home in Canada. This big interceptor, which was developed in the 1950s, never entered service but Canada’s emotional attachment to the plane still runs very deep. This combined with the program’s abrupt cancellation the better part of a century ago has created a bizarre breeding ground for wild rumors and conspiracy theories about a sort of secret second life for the jet after its official demise. As such, the Arrow has become something of the ghost of aerospace past that just won’t die. In the early 1950s, rapid advances in the Soviet Union’s bomber fleet were being observed with concern around the world. Canadian studies aimed at producing a jet to defend against Soviet bombers initially focused on dramatically improving the existing Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck , which was an indigenous, two-seat, twin-engine subsonic jet. The Canuck was a capable machine that gave Canada many years of service but was not designed for high-altitude, high-speed interception. Efforts to increase the top speed and performance of the CF-100 design led to diminishing returns and a reevaluation of the entire program. Canada instead decided to start from the ground up and indigenously develop an all-new advanced interceptor. The first prototype CF-105 Arrow on a test flight., PUBLIC DOMAIN — CANADIAN FORCES Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Specification AIR 7-3 was published in 1953. It outlined Canada’s true need, calling for a potent, cutting-edge machine capable of reaching a Mach 1.5 cruise at 50,000 feet five minutes after takeoff. Additional requirements were a paltry range of 300 nautical miles for a mission at normal speeds and a range of 200 nautical miles for a high-speed intercept. Operations from a 6,000-foot runway and a 10-minute turnaround time on the ground were mandated, as well. The RCAF surveyed British, French, and U.S. manufacturers, ultimately determining that no existing design could fulfill its requirements. Avro Canada went to the drawing board and the Arrow was born. The new plan was realized in 1957 with a rollout, and the two-seat Arrow’s first flight took place shortly after in 1958. The first Arrow, RL-201, achieved Mach 1.9 on its maiden flight. The promise had been kept. Rollout ceremony for the first Arrow, RL-201, on October 4, 1957. , PUBLIC DOMAIN — CANADIAN FORCES First flight of the Avro Canada Arrow, on March 25, 1958: Four aircraft, RL-201, RL-202, RL-203, and RL-204, were built and designated Arrow Mk 1. All the Mk 1 aircraft utilized Pratt & Whitney J75 engines and interim avionics. Ultimately, the design was intended to use the in-development Orenda Iroquois engine, an advanced turbojet of lighter weight and greater thrust than the J75. The Arrow Mk 1s flew a total of 66 times. RL-204 was the last of the four CF-105 Arrow Mk 1 prototypes, here with a CF-100 Canuck in the background., Dong Rogers/Wikimedia Commons Two Arrow Mk 2s were built, as well, RL-205 and RL-206. Both these were considered production examples and were fitted with the more advanced Iroquois engines. RL-205 only flew once and was grounded due to engine problems. RL-206 never flew. For many reasons, including the Arrow program’s prodigious price tag and the proliferation of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) no jet could stop, the program was canceled on February 20, 1959, by newly elected Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. A memorandum for Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, outlining the main points behind the “105 problem”., CANADIAN GOVERNMENT MEMO The news was not entirely unexpected, but it was heartbreaking to many Canadians. To thousands of Avro employees, the bad news came via company president Crawford Gordon Jr. He took to the factory’s loudspeaker and reportedly referred to Diefenbaker as “That fucking prick in Ottawa.” RL-204 landing. The first four aircraft were all powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney J75 engines., PUBLIC DOMAIN — CANADIAN FORCES The cancelation left 14,000 Avro Canada employees almost immediately unemployed. The fallout extended to another estimated 15,000 aerospace contractors who lost their jobs as a knock-on effect. Since then, the day has been referred to as “Black Friday” in aerospace circles. If the cancelation wasn’t harsh and abrasive enough, the order came two months later to destroy every part of the Arrow program, including the aircraft themselves. Nothing was supposed to escape the scrapper’s torch or shredder. The entire idea of the Arrow was to be liquidated, but that wasn’t quite how things turned out. A number of pieces of the aircraft and relics related to it did survive. Arrow Mk 2 RL-206 on the production line., PUBLIC DOMAIN Regardless, sixty years later, the decision remains highly controversial. Industry engineers and defense experts still claim it almost single-handedly eviscerated Canada’s ability to natively develop and produce advanced aerospace products. Officially, the story ends there. However, the Arrow morphed into a specter that lives on to haunt Canada. There’s an old Canadian joke that says the best thing that ever happened to America was the cancellation of the Arrow. America did benefit. A group of 32 engineers known as the “ Avro group ” took their knowledge and skills to NASA and ultimately served critical roles in the Apollo space program . Jim Chamberlin, chief of technical design for the CF-105, during his time at NASA., NASA The Arrow wouldn’t go away quietly. Far-reaching rumors began immediately. Canadian writer June Callwood lived near the Avro plant in Malton, near Toronto, as a child. She claims that the day after cancellation, she and thousands of others heard the unmistakable crackling roar of an Arrow departing the area. Hardly conclusive evidence, but, to explain how that could have happened, conspiracy theorists point to photographs of the Arrows’ destruction, illicitly obtained from the air. The early pictures, before the cutting work began, confirm all the Arrows present, but the pictures from later in the process don’t appear to depict RL-202 at all. RL-202 was an Arrow Mk 1 and so would not have been the obvious candidate for preservation. RL-205 and RL-206, with their Iroquois engines and fully equipped avionics suite, would have been more representative of the program’s final design goals. Avro Canada knew the program was in jeopardy and a plan to relocate an aircraft would have required immense planning. If a scheme to make off with an Arrow had existed, it stands to reason that a Mk 2 would have been chosen. Photographic evidence proves both Arrow Mk 2s were destroyed. Control column from a CF-105 at the Bagotville Air Defense Museum in Quebec., Imer/Wikimedia Commons These circumstances leave a sliver of space for the conspiracy about RL-202. RL-202 had just been repaired from a landing gear malfunction and had been readied for flying when the program was canceled. With all the employees laid off and expeditiously seeking gainful employment elsewhere, no one would have been around to modify RL-202 up to Arrow Mk 2 production standards, let alone continue to fly and service it for a meaningful period of time. Avro worked with Crown Assets and Disposal Corporation, which hired Lax Iron and Steel to handle all the scrap and residue. The owner, Samuel Lax, recalled strict controls in an undated interview. All scrapped parts were supposedly weighed and compared to the expected weights at Hamilton Scrap Yard. He also claimed RL-202, the specific jet conspiracies are predicated upon, was the first Arrow to be completely dismantled, which had occurred by June 24, 1959. The following August the RCAF was informed that the final melting down of component parts and remnant wreckage was complete, but some pieces still survived. The nose section of the unflown RL-206 on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. , Ahunt/Wikimedia Commons Not quite 10 years later, Air Marshal Wilfred Curtis, a World War II hero and head of the Arrow program, refused to answer in a 1968 interview if an entire Arrow had been spirited away. He suggested it was too soon to reveal the surviving Arrow’s location, and he needed to wait for a more favorable political climate. Curtis never spoke about the subject on the record again, and he died in 1977. Further rumors of a surviving Arrow came from the United Kingdom. In 2008, and again in 2011, Martin-Baker Mk 5 ejection seats built for the Arrow appeared for sale on eBay in England. In 2011, the head of Martin-Baker business development, Andrew Martin, generated a letter of authenticity for the seats, confirming they were indeed from an Arrow. Further, there is reasonable evidence that the seats were installed and flown in the jet. Chris Wilson, the managing director of Jet Art Aviation, which sells aviation collectibles, said in 2011 the two seats were a matched pair and likely came from an Arrow which escaped destruction and found a home in the United Kingdom. Wilson further claimed that a customer of his saw an Arrow at RAF Manston, in Kent. That claim is clearly problematic. Orenda PS.13 Iroquois turbojet, the intended powerplant of the Arrow Mk 2 on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa., Bzuk/Wikimedia Commons In the early 1960s, many aircraft were white, and many were shaped similarly. One prime example is the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) TSR-2 , which was both similar in planform and white. The TSR-2 first flew in 1964 and was canceled in 1965. If the sighting wasn’t completely fabricated, there’s a chance that’s what was seen. By any logic, the sightings aren’t attributed to defined, credible sources within the aerospace or defense industries and can’t be relied upon. Viewing the claim from an even bigger picture, the United Kingdom declassifies information at 30, 50, and 100-year intervals. The 30 and 50-year intervals have now passed. Not only was the Avro Arrow program public knowledge, both in development and defeat, but the United Kingdom had its own similar projects at the time, such as the aforementioned TSR-2. It’s unlikely an Arrow would have been of use to the United Kingdom. It seems highly unlikely that possessing an unclassified Canadian Mach 2 fighter would qualify as a national secret to be kept for 100 years; information that would have a grave effect on national security if compromised. Under the U.K. Official Secrets Act 1989, a confidential program such as one supporting an Arrow more likely than not would’ve been disclosed after 30 years. As for the ejection seats in the United Kingdom, seats of this kind contain explosive charges necessary for the pilot to clear and egress the aircraft being abandoned. As with many conspiracies, the simplest explanation is perhaps most likely. Ejection seats are among the first parts procedurally removed before an aircraft can be safely cut up and destroyed. Museum-bound aircraft receive inert ejection seats that have been permanently “safed.” A contemporary artist’s impression of the CF-105 in RCAF service., National Film Board of Canada In keeping with the orders to destroy everything, no complete Arrows were allotted to museums. Martin-Baker confirms that fewer than 20 seats were built for the Arrow program. The specific installed seats were removed before the aircraft began to be scrapped. There’s no verified chain of custody for these seats. We only know for sure that they came from an Arrow. Nothing beyond blind hope sprinkled with fantasy suggests they could’ve been removed in England from an airworthy aircraft. In 1998, 40 years after the Arrow’s cancellation, an organization that called itself Arrow Recovery Canada, led by Andrew Hibbert, started scouring Lake Ontario for one of nine 1/8th scale test models of the Arrow that were strapped to rockets and launched from Point Petre, Ontario, at supersonic speeds. They spent between 1999 and 2006 surveying the area. For three years from 2006 to 2009, they dived to investigate targets that had been detected by sonar but didn’t find what they were looking for. The wings of the third prototype Arrow survive at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum., Emdx/Wikimedia Commons They had zealous competition. Ed Burtt, a shipwreck diver, was looking for the models as well. In 2018, a third project looking for the same models — called Raise the Arrow — funded by the OEX Recovery Group, found, and recovered a delta-wing test model from the Arrow program. It wasn’t the 1/8th scale model they were looking for, but it was a celebrated find. That model was restored and put on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. The search for the models continued into 2020. On October 8 last year, Raise the Arrow announced they found the 1/8th scale model they had been looking for and needed to determine how to raise it. 2020 was a big year all around for the ghost of the Arrow. Blueprints surfaced in January, of the type believed to have all been destroyed. A senior draftsman for Avro Canada, Ken Barnes, defied the 1959 order, snuck them out, and kept them in his basement. He never spoke of them in his lifetime and forbade his kids from going into the corner in which his workbench sat. After his death, they were discovered by his son. The blueprints are currently on loan to the Diefenbaker Canada Centre (the same Diefenbaker responsible for canceling the Arrow) and can be seen by visitors. Also smuggled out were RL-206’s nose cone and some panels. Those are on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, alongside the delta test model recovered from Lake Ontario. In the meantime, a full-scale replica was even built and placed on display at the Canadian Air & Space Museum in Toronto. A full-size replica of an Arrow Mk 1 at the Canadian Air & Space Museum in Toronto., EyeNo/Wikimedia Commons In 2010 Bourdeau Industries submitted a bizarre proposal to Stephen Harper’s Conservative government to replace Canada’s aging CF-18 Hornet fighter jets with updated Avro Arrows, instead of the officially favored F-35 Joint Strike Fighters . Canada’s retired Major General Lewis Mackenzie championed the proposal and said that the Arrow’s basic design still exceeded that of any current fighter jet. Major General Mackenzie is a highly respected officer who was at one time the Chief of Staff of the United Nations peacekeeping force in former Yugoslavia, but his claim about the Arrow’s capabilities as compared to fourth and fifth-generation fighter jets as of 2010 is easily disputable. Canada’s Associate Minister of National Defense at the time, Julian Fantino, agreed, stating that the Arrow was not a viable option 50 years after its demise. As an impactful part of Canada’s history, the Avro Arrow is beyond reproach in its afterlife. It seems every last corner of its legacy has been explored and every known surviving part has been given the full artifact treatment. Even the depths of a great lake were laboriously scoured for 20 years to locate relics from the program. The reappearance of pieces, models, and plans and their placement in museums speaks to the fact that even though the program came and went almost a lifetime ago, it has been duly shown respect through commemoration. While fragments and mementos probably still exist in basements and warehouses throughout Canada, it doesn’t mean a jet is out there or ever was. Why has its legacy persisted? The myths that have carried the Arrow beyond its resting place are a common vein with aircraft that become the source of national pride. For the sake of comparison, the SR-71 program was one of the United States’ greatest technological achievements. Its fans and proponents never wanted to admit that time had passed the SR-71 by, they didn’t want it to retire , and when it did, they assumed it was still out there somewhere, flying in secret. The Arrow is similar in its own way. The dream of what could have been is a tough thing to let go of. Over six decades later, it may finally be time to lay the conspiracies and rumors surrounding the CF-105 Arrow to rest, but that doesn’t mean we can’t admire just how much of a technological marvel and a source of collective pride the aircraft could have been for Canada.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 2, 2020",American Special Operators Set To Get New Advanced Computerized Sights For Their Rifles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has hired Israeli firm Smart Shooter to develop an improved “smart sight” for small arms for U.S. special operations forces that could also find its way into the hands of conventional units. The optic’s design is based in part on the company’s SMASH 2000 system , which helps shooters spot threats and then quickly calculates the optimal point of aim, even if the target, such as a small drone , is moving. On March 24, 2021, Smart Shooter publicly unveiled the sighting system, which it has been working on for more than a year as part of the Individual Weapon Overmatch Optic (IWOO) program. The company said the Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate (IWTSD) had selected to develop the IWOO in February 2020 and that the system had passed a critical design review nine months later. The project is now moving into the prototype production stage. US troops in Syria train with M4A1 carbines equipped with Smart Shooter’s SMASH 2000 sighting system., US Army “We are very pleased with the progress Smart Shooter has made with the IWOO design” Michael Trexler, the Special Operation Forces Combat Support Coordinator / Program Manager at IWTSD, said in a statement. “We look forward to conducting operational testing and evaluation using the dual-capabilities of IWOO prototypes in 2021 against ground targets at increased ranges and to take-down drones.” The Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) was officially renamed IWTSD in February. Established in 1999 under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict, the office’s mission “is to identify and develop capabilities for DoD to conduct Irregular Warfare against all adversaries, including Great Power competitors and non-state actors, and to deliver those capabilities to DoD components and interagency partners through rapid research and development, advanced studies and technical innovation, and provision of support to U.S. military operations,” according to its website . CTTSO, and now IWTSD, has overseen the rapid development of various capabilities over the years, including weapons, such as a 120mm mortar mounted on a computer-assisted turret for forward base defense, and other technologies. It’s not surprising that it has been working with Smart Shooter on an advanced derivative of their SMASH product line in the last year or so, either. In June 2020, pictures emerged of personnel assigned to Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR), the top special operations command supporting the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, training with M4A1 carbines equipped with the SMASH 2000 system, which The War Zone was first to report on . It’s not clear what existing or future small arms IWTSD might be envisioning attaching the IWOOs to, either for testing or eventual operational use. US personnel at the At Tanf garrison in Syria train with the SMASH 2000 system installed on M4A1 carbines in 2020., US Army However, like SMASH 2000, “the IWOO system automatically detects, highlights, and tracks potential targets – including drones – using a see-through display, which enhances the user situational awareness,” according to Smart Shooter’s press release. “Built-in fire control processing continuously calculates the optimal firing solution to provide the user with clear, discreet guidance, firing only with the best chance of neutralizing the target.” The SMASH 2000 system also takes into account the movements of the shooter themselves, including involuntary motion due to fatigue or stress, something that should be carried over to the IWOO. The earlier system can also be configured in such a way that the trigger of the weapon it is attached to cannot fire until the crosshairs on the sight’s display line up with the designated point of impact, something Smart Shooter has said could help reduce the risk of accidentally shooting at innocent bystanders in the heat of the moment. From what has been disclosed so far, the biggest difference between the IWOO and previous SMASH series sights is that the new system has variable magnification between 1x and 8x. The older models used non-magnifying optics. The 8x magnification will allow shooters to make greater use of the IWOO’s other capabilities at extended ranges. This could also expand the existing ability of the system to be used in a secondary role as a surveillance tool. The feed from the built-in camera that SMASH 2000 uses to spot and track targets can be recorded, either in the form of video clips or still frames, for this purpose, as well as to assist with training, by helping troops to understand where they’re hitting and missing and why. The ability to better utilize the IWOO’s capabilities against targets further away could be particularly useful when dealing with hostile small drones, which could approach or retreat from friendly positions quickly or use altitude to their advantage. Diminutive unmanned aircraft, including hobbyist types, such as quad and hexcopters that can be modified to carry small munitions with relative ease, are threats American troops on battlefields around the world face right now and will only become an increasingly serious problem for the U.S. military , broadly , as time goes on. These are issues you can read more about in these past pieces . “These systems are inexpensive, easy to modify and weaponize, and easy to proliferate,” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), said in February , reiterating points he had already made on multiple occasions in the past . “They provide adversaries the operational ability to surveil and target U.S. and partner facilities while affording plausible deniability and a disproportionate return on the investment, all in our adversaries’ favor.” A member of the US military uses a SMASH 2000-equipped M4A1 carbine to engage a box suspended underneath a small quadcopter-type drone during training at the At Tanf garrison in Syria in 2020., US Army So, IWOO could become an important additional component of work being down now across the U.S. military on various tiers of counter-drone capabilities . In addition, its core ability to help improve a shooter’s accuracy, even against moving targets at extended ranges, will almost certainly be of interest to American troops, in general. While historically U.S. special operations forces have been among the main recipients of capabilities developed through CTTSO/IWTSD, various systems, including the aforementioned turreted 120mm mortar, have also eventually made their way to conventional units, as well as other U.S. government agencies outside of the military. The U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps are both already working on developing and fielding various new systems, including augmented reality-enabled visors and night vision optics with advanced sensor fusion capabilities , to improve the ability of individual soldiers and Marines to spot and engage threats. Active work across the services in computer-assisted targeting systems for small arms dates back at least to the 1990s . There have also other developments in the private sector, such as the smart sight that American firm TrackingPoint developed for its XS1 sniper rifle , which it unveiled in 2013. This is to say nothing of the experiments that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) conducted between 2008 and 2015 with precision-guided .50 caliber bullets as part of the Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) program. Smart Shooter says that its goal now is to deliver “the first functional [IWOO] system next Fall.” Depending on how testing goes this year, these highly advanced sighting systems could head downrange with American special operations forces and other units soon after that.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 16, 2021",Dozens Of AH-1Z And UH-1Y Helicopters Will Be Retired As Part Of The USMC’s Force Redesign,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps plans to put around 20 percent of its combined AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter and UH-1Y Venom armed utility helicopter fleets in long-term storage by the end of this decade. This is part of the service’s radical restructuring effort , known as Force Design 2030, which is scaling back or outright eliminating various traditional capabilities, such as the complete divestment of all of its M1 Abrams main battle tanks. The goal is to craft a more flexible Marine Corps with new capabilities, including various longer-range ground-based missiles and a greater emphasis on unmanned capabilities , that are better suited to the future distributed warfare concepts of operations that it is now developing . The Marine Corps plans to remove 27 AH-1Zs and 26 UH-1Ys from service as part of Force Design 2030, according to a statement The War Zone received from the service’s top headquarters today. At least two AH-1Zs are already headed for the Boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, as part of the inactivation of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 367 (HMLA-367) at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii. That unit is expected to stand down completely by the end of the 2022 Fiscal Year, as will Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 463 (HMH-463), as the Marines work to shutter all conventional helicopter units in Hawaii as part of Force Design 2030. An AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter, in front, along with a UH-1Y Venom armed utility helicopter, at rear, with their rotor blades folded onboard the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Bataan ., USMC “As a result of Force Design 2030 squadron divestments, and pending final disposition, the Marine Corps expects to induct 53 H-1s (27 AH-1Zs and 26 UH-1Ys) into long-term preservation and storage,” Marine Corps Captain Andrew Wood, a service spokesperson, told The War Zone . The exact size of the Marine Corps’ AH-1Z and UH-1Y fleets at present is not entirely clear. The 2019 Marine Aviation Plan, the last iteration of this annual report that the service has publicly released , said that the goal at that time was to have a total of 145 Vipers and 116 Venoms in both active-duty and reserve component units by the end of Fiscal Year 2022. The service had fully completed its transition from the UH-1N Twin Huey to the UH-1Y by that time, but was still in the process of transition from the AH-1W Super Cobra to the AH-1Z. The Marine Corps got its first Vipers in 2005, but the service only declared it had reached initial operational capability with them in 2011 . The first UH-1Ys that the Marines received are only slightly older. A number of AH-1Zs and UH-1Ys are also remanufactured AH-1Ws and UH-1Ns, respectively, a process that completely reset the airframes. Both fleets are, overall, still very young, on average. The Department of the Navy’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request, a public version of which came out last Spring and that also included requested funding for the Marine Corps, said the plan was still for HMLA-775, a reserve squadron, to swap its AH-1Ws for AH-1Zs during that fiscal cycle. That would have been in line with the 2019 Aviation Plan. A chart showing the Marine Corps’ plans for its AH-1Z and UH-1Y fleets, through Fiscal Year 2027, as of 2019., USMC If HMLA-775’s transition to the AH-1Z was completed as planned in 2019, the only remaining question is whether HMLA-773, the other Marine Reserve light attack helicopter squadron, has received its planned complement of Vipers. HMLA-773 did fly the last official Marine AH-1W sorties last year as part of a ceremony marking the formal retirement of the service’s Super Cobras. The Marines have also said in the past that, as part of Force Design 2030, two entire HMLAs will be inactivated, only one of which, HMLA-367, has been publicly identified, so far. Sending 27 AH-1Zs and 26 UH-1Ys to the Bone Yard would mean the Corps’ Viper and Venom fleets will shrink by around 18 percent and 22 percent, respectively, at least compared to the final totals outlined in the 2019 Aviation Plan. The combined “H-1” fleet, as the Marine Corps often refers to both types collectively, would be trimmed down by approximately 20 percent. UH-1Ys and AH-1Zs assigned to Marine Light Attack Helicopter Training Squadron 303 (HMLAT-303)., USMC It is worth noting that the Marines say that the “final disposition” of these helicopters has yet to be decided. This could mean that it retains some of the airframes as sources of spare parts, or even in a more complete state where they could be more readily returned to service to replace losses from combat or accidents . Any helicopters it does ultimately determine to be excess to its requirements could be made available for transfer to other entities with the U.S. government, such as the U.S. Forest Service, which operates demilitarized ex-U.S. Army AH-1s to support aerial firefighting operations . They could also be transferred to U.S. allies or partners abroad . The plan is already to sell off all of the retired AH-1Ws . There is the possibility that the remaining Marine light attack helicopter squadrons, or other activities, such as training bases, within the service, could receive some of these aircraft, as well. Two of HMLA-367’s UH-1Ys have already gone to unspecified units at Camp Pendleton in California, a major training and operational hub for the service on the West Coast, for instance. However, the Marine Corps has made clear that it is looking to make permanent cuts to more traditional aviation capabilities as part of Force Design 2030. For example, the service still plans to eventually have 18 squadrons equipped with F-35B and F-35C Joint Strike Fighters, but the total number of aircraft each one of these units will have is set to be reduced from 16 to as few as 10. “We may over time learn that 10 is the wrong number, it could be 11, it could be 12, I don’t know,” Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger, the service’s top officer, told reporters in April 2020. “But right now the target is good at 10.” If the 53 “H-1s” that the Marines are planning to send to long-term storage end up being removed from service for good, it will represent a significant cut to its more conventional rotary-wing capabilities, especially when it comes to close air support and other armed missions. Both the AH-1Z and UH-1Y can carry various types of ordnance and the Venom can also be equipped with a version of the Intrepid Tiger II , a powerful podded electronic warfare system. Plans to give the Corps’ MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors expanded arsenals that include forward-firing weapons have yet to become an operational reality. A UH-1Y helicopter equipped with an Intrepid Tiger II electronic warfare pod., USMC At the same time, Force Design 2030 places more emphasis on unmanned platforms, including larger types, such as the MQ-9 Reaper , capable of carrying munitions. The Reaper has far greater range and persistence than the AH-1Z and UH-1Y, something that could also be found in future large drone designs. Other new long-range strike capabilities, including various ground-based land-attack and anti-ship missiles , are also part of the overarching force structure concept. While something like an MQ-9, or even a much more advanced unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), would not be able to completely replace the capabilities offered by either the AH-1Z or the UH-1Y, especially the Venom’s passenger and cargo carrying abilities, its extended reach would make it differently valuable for supporting future Marine Corps distributed operations, especially across the wide expanses of the Pacific. This is the argument the Marines have made for why they are closing out their conventional helicopter units in Hawaii. The service is now planning to send at least some number of KC-130J Hercules tanker-transport aircraft to take their place at MCAS Kaneohe Bay to support extended range MV-22B operations. All told, the final configuration of the Marine Corps’ various combat aviation fleets at the conclusion of the Force Design 2030 process very much remains to be seen. Still, the new details about the service’s plans for AH-1Zs and UH-1Ys only further underscore that big changes are coming as the decade progresses.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 1, 2021","Now The UK Wants To Add Combat Drones To Its Aircraft Carriers, But Is It Really Feasible?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A naval combat drone could be headed to the decks of the U.K.’s two aircraft carriers in the future. Under the recently revealed Project Vixen, the U.K. Royal Navy is studying the potential for adding a large unmanned aerial vehicle that could undertake missions including aerial refueling — like the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray — as well as strike, potentially in loyal wingman-type role, networked together with its F-35B Lightning stealth fighters. Naval Technology was first to report on Project Vixen, which, for the time being, is a conceptual project that won’t necessarily lead directly to hardware. Together with aerial refueling and strike, the study will also examine the use of the fixed-wing carrier-based drone in surveillance and electronic warfare missions. HMS Queen Elizabeth , the Royal Navy flagship and the lead ship of its class, underway during Group Exercise 2020 last October, with F-35Bs and Merlin helicopters on deck., Crown Copyright While Project Vixen may not, itself, lead to an actual carrier-launched drone capability for the Royal Navy, the service is already looking at the options for operating an unmanned aircraft “as a complementary platform” to manned aircraft from the decks of its Queen Elizabeth class carriers, according to Naval Technology . This would indicate that at least one line of effort that could emerge from this initial project is a loyal wingman that would operate alongside the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B as part of the U.K. carrier air group. The aspiration to have a large-size unmanned aircraft operate from the decks of the two Queen Elizabeth class ships doesn’t come altogether out of the blue. Last month, a request for information (RFI) for “aircraft launch and recovery equipment” appeared on the U.K. government’s public sector contracts website. That RFI stated that the U.K. Ministry of Defense is seeking information on the assisted launch and arrested recovery “for a range of air vehicles, which would be suitable to fit a vessel within three to five years.” This is part of the development work for the Future Maritime Aviation Force (FMAF) and, intriguingly, the RFI noted that the launch and recovery equipment could be used for “both crewed and un-crewed air vehicles.” “The Authority intends to use the responses to this RFI to inform future decision making regarding potential air vehicle choices,” the document stated. Currently, the Queen Elizabeth class carriers do not have catapults for launching aircraft, nor arrester wires for recovering them. It would make sense that the RFI relates to Project Vixen, at least to some degree, which would clearly benefit from some kind of launch and recovery system to operate from the Royal Navy’s carriers; indeed, depending on weight and other specifications, it might be prerequisite. While the specific ship or ships in mind for the “cat and trap” systems is not mentioned in the RFI, the Queen Elizabeth class carriers are the only realistic option within the timeframe, with the U.K. Ministry of Defense requiring information on “solutions which are sufficiently technically mature to be fitted to a suitable ship from 2023.” By contrast, the U.S. Navy hopes to reach initial operational capability with its first large-size carrier-capable drone, the MQ-25, in 2024. The U.S. Navy MQ-25A Stingray will be that service’s first operational, carrier-based unmanned aircraft., BOEING The RFI also provides some clues as to what sizes of vehicles may be under consideration as part of Project Vixen. The document specifies an electromagnetic catapult able to launch vehicles up to a maximum weight of 55,000 pounds and arrestor solutions that can recover vehicles at a maximum of 47,000 pounds and a minimum of 11,000 pounds. The upper limit of 55,000 pounds compares to the F-35B’s maximum takeoff weight of around 60,000 pounds and is greater than the U.S. Navy’s experimental X-47B unmanned aircraft that weighed a little over 44,000 pounds during tests. While the lower limit suggests something substantially smaller than the X-47, the upper limit could point to the Royal Navy looking at plans for operating large-size drones with considerable capacity for fuel, ordnance, or sensor payloads. The Northrop Grumman X-47B developed for the U.S. Navy., U.S. Air Force As well as developing and procuring the aerial vehicle itself, the various hardware upgrades required for the carriers to operate them, including mastering electromagnetic launch technology , come with a hefty price tag, presuming they are even technically feasible. Then there are the control stations and data links that need to be developed to ensure the drones can be safely and effectively integrated within the carrier air group. The safety point is of particular concern since the British carriers do not have angled flight decks, which are typically required to cope with heavier, jet-powered conventional takeoff and landing aircraft, with a separate runway angled away from the centreline to permit simultaneous launch and recovery and simplifying deck movements. In addition, the Queen Elizabeth class warships are currently outfitted with “ski jump” takeoff ramps for their STOVL F-35Bs and it’s unclear if these would be suitable for catapult launch of drones, too. Also worth bearing in mind is the fact that the U.K. has looked at switching its carriers to “cat and trap” operations in the past, too, and there are lingering doubts as to whether the decision to stick with STOVL was the right one. The government decided to refit catapults and arrester gear on a single operational carrier and procure F-35C variants to equip it, as part of its 2010 Strategic Defense and Security Review (SDSR). At the time it was noted that the F-35C would offer longer range and carry more weapons than the F-35B — while the F-35B’s weapons bay is sized for 1,000-pound weapons, the F-35C accommodates 2,000-pound weapons. “Crucially, [the move] will allow our carrier to operate in tandem with the US and French navies, and for American and French aircraft to operate from our carrier and vice versa,” the SDSR stated. However, the decision was overturned two years later, on cost grounds. Instead, two STOVL carriers would be put into service. Project Vixen also parallels the U.K. Royal Air Force’s Team Mosquito project, part of the Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) initiative. Naval Technology reports that the Royal Navy and RAF are working together to study potential platforms for Mosquito and Vixen, suggesting that a broadly common drone could eventually be fielded for both land-based and carrier applications. Digitally generated concept artwork of a British loyal wingman design flying alongside an F-35B, and through to represent the Project Mosquito technology demonstrator, or a follow-on production version. , U.K. Ministry of Defense Back in January, we reported on the U.K.’s plans to have a prototype low-cost combat drone for the RAF flying by 2023, with Spirit AeroSystems now contracted to design and manufacture a prototype of what is formally termed an “uncrewed fighter aircraft.” Project Mosquito also seeks to develop unmanned aerial vehicles capable of working together semi-autonomously with manned aircraft, which The War Zone discussed in detail last year . Project Mosquito also won’t necessarily lead to an operational combat drone, but a production decision will be made after the technology demonstrator has been tested. The RAF project is expected to demonstrate how a combat drone could potentially work together with the service’s Eurofighter Typhoons and F-35B Lightnings, as well as the Tempest stealth fighter jet that’s also now under development. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has said it expects Project Mosquito to “fly at high speed alongside fighter jets” and carry “missiles, surveillance and electronic warfare technology.” The aircraft will be expected to target and shoot down enemy aircraft and “survive against surface-to-air missiles.” All these capabilities are likely to be examined under the naval Project Vixen, too. Plans call for start flight testing of a full-scale Project Mosquito vehicle by the end of 2023. Project Mosquito is a significant endeavor in itself and only a few countries have, so far, made serious progress in developing loyal wingman-type combat drones. Introducing those same kinds of capabilities into the carrier aviation environment is trickier still. Notably, even the United States has scaled back its carrier-based drone ambitions, watering down its Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) initiative, and shelving the experimental X-47B, in favor of a refocused aerial tanker drone program, now the MQ-25. While Project Mosquito and Vixen are set to examine how combat drones can work alongside manned fighters, for the Royal Navy, in particular, a future carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle has particular resonance. Since the government has so far only committed to buying 48 F-35Bs by 2025, the possibility of a large-size unmanned complement to the Lightning could be very welcome. The U.K. government’s Integrated Review Command Paper, the concluding part of its two-part defense review , published this week, committed to increasing the F-35B fleet size beyond the 48 already ordered, but didn’t provide any more details on numbers and there is a tacit acknowledgment that the planned 138-aircraft figure has been abandoned. Yesterday, the First Sea Lord, Admiral Tony Radakin, reportedly said that the U.K. eventually planned to buy “around 60” and potentially “up to around 80” F-35Bs. An F-35B pilot aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth during operational testing off the U.S. east coast in 2019. , Crown Copyright There have been repeated warnings that a force of 48 would not allow both carriers to sail with the jets simultaneously, once training and maintenance, and not least all the force’s other frontline commitments, are taken into account. Speaking to the U.K. Parliament’s Defense Committee last September, Nick Childs, Senior Fellow for Naval Forces and Maritime Security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said he considered that 60-70 jets would be reasonable to meet the ambition of 24 jets available for Carrier Strike, taking into account training and other demands. That, however, is only the Carrier Strike portion of the U.K. F-35B’s remit, not taking into account the various land-based missions that are envisaged for it, too. Even a fleet of around 80 F-35Bs could be stretched to meet all of its commitments with the RAF and Royal Navy. Most importantly, as well as boosting “combat mass,” and boosting capabilities, a carrier-capable loyal wingman drone could also offer significant savings in terms of acquisition and operating costs. Leveraging unmanned technology to increase and enhance combat fleets is something that has been at the center of discussions around LANCA and the Australian Airpower Teaming System (ATS), for example. So far, Project Vixen is a study only, as is the proposal to configure Royal Navy warships with “cat and trap” systems. Ultimately, the U.K. may decide that a better way of operating drones from its warships is by using vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) types, paralleling thinking in the U.S. Marine Corps. That service has also been looking to field a new drone, much larger than its existing unmanned aircraft , from the decks of amphibious assault ships. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, for example, has worked on the Vertical Takeoff and Landing VTOL Advanced Reconnaissance Insertion Organic Unmanned System (VARIOUS), a stealthy combat drone which you can read more about here . With the two services already working closely together on the F-35B , there could be scope for future collaboration in combat drones, too. Whatever route is taken, expansion of the carrier air group through adding combat drones could bring enormous benefits for both the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. But there remain many and significant challenges ahead before we see might get to see a British combat drone integrated on the country’s carrier decks.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 16, 2020",British Armed Forces Poised To Make Big Cuts To F-35 Plans And More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the United Kingdom Armed Forces brace themselves for the government’s next defense review, signs point to significant cuts to the Royal Air Force and the British Army, including a potential reduction of the planned F-35B stealth fighter fleet by around two-thirds. At the same time, the forthcoming document promises to outline a wide-ranging modernization of the armed forces, among them new space and cyber capabilities. While we don’t know for sure what the review, formally titled Global Britain in a Competitive Age , will contain, a preview was provided in The Times yesterday , citing sources within the U.K. Prime Minister’s office, commonly referred to as No. 10. The review itself is set to be officially unveiled in two parts beginning on March 16, followed by further details of the defense modernization effort on March 22. An F-35B on the flight deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth as part of the WESTLANT 19 exercise off the coast of the United States., Crown Copyright Although a major U.K. defense review normally occurs every five years, the last — the Strategic Defense and Security Review (SDSR) — was in 2015. According to the report, the document is likely to stress cutting-edge capabilities, including the RAF Space Command, whose first commander was announced last month , as well as a National Cyber Force, plus new artificial intelligence (AI) research facilities. In keeping with the high-tech focus, the prime minister has also recently spoken of both unmanned aircraft and directed-energy weapons as part of the new strategy. We already know that the defense review will bring a major funding increase for the first time since the end of the Cold War. Last November, Johnson unveiled plans to add almost $22 billion to the defense budget over the next four years. Among flagship projects mentioned by the prime minister at the time were a new class of warships, known as the Type 32, and the continued development of the Tempest stealth fighter . You can read more about the aspirations covered by that promised investment in this previous War Zone story . However, all this new investment has to be balanced by spending reductions elsewhere in the military and we now have a better understanding of what’s likely to be cut from the armed forces. Royal Air Force Long seemingly under threat , it now seems as if the ax will finally drop on the U.K. government’s plans to buy 138 F-35B short takeoff and landing (STOVL) versions of the Joint Strike Fighter. The fledgling F-35 fleet is operated by a joint force of RAF and Royal Navy personnel, but which are based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, England when not embarked aboard one of the two Queen Elizabeth class carriers . The Times reports that a full 90 aircraft will be cut from the planned F-35B total buy, eventually providing a force of just 48 aircraft. To date, the United Kingdom has committed to buying 48 Lightning jets by the end of 2025, but previously the U.K. Ministry of Defense steadfastly held to the 138-aircraft figure in its communications. Officials have said that 24 F-35Bs need to be embarked on the ship for a “credible complement” in the core Carrier Strike role. However, a force of 48 would not allow both carriers to sail with the jets simultaneously, once training and maintenance, and not least all the force’s other frontline commitments, are taken into account. In fact, it might not even be sufficient for one carrier. Speaking to the U.K. Parliament’s Defense Committee last September, Nick Childs, Senior Fellow for Naval Forces and Maritime Security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said he considered a number “significantly higher” than 48 F-35Bs would be required to meet the ambition of 24 jets available for Carrier Strike. Taking into account training and other demands, a figure of 60-70 jets would be reasonable, Childs contended. In the past , there was unofficial speculation that the United Kingdom might opt for a split buy of STOVL F-35Bs and conventional take-off and landing F-35A models. There have been long-standing rumors that this is the long-term option preferred by the RAF, but with a force of just 48 Lightnings, the case for a split buy would become irrelevant. The Typhoon multirole fighter is also projected to take a hit, with a decision to retire the 24 oldest examples, which are in the basic Tranche 1 configuration. This had also been the plan in the past before the SDSR of 2015 declared that the single-seat Tranche 1 jets would actually be retained for air defense duties as well as specialist aggressor work . These older jets had been expected to be operated until around 2030. Where this new decision, if it comes to pass, leaves the Typhoon’s aggressor role remains unclear. An RAF Typhoon FGR4 aircraft forward-deployed at Royal Air Force Akrotiri in Cyprus., Crown Copyright The savings made on the F-35B and Typhoon should free up funds for the Tempest, although this is still in its very early stages and there are plenty more hurdles to pass before ambitions of putting a new-generation stealthy fighter jet into service by 2035. The question of just how relevant Tempest will be if it even joins the fleet in nearly a decade and a half is also up for debate. Also requiring funding is the program for a loyal wingman-type unmanned aircraft, which the United Kingdom expects to begin flight testing by 2023. Earlier this year, the RAF announced that Northern Ireland-based Spirit AeroSystems would design and manufacture the prototype “uncrewed fighter aircraft” in its new role at the head of Project Mosquito, an effort to develop drones capable of working together semi-autonomously with manned aircraft, which The War Zone discussed in detail last year . After the recent standdown of the Sentinel intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, it seems this platform will not be directly replaced, and nor will the smaller Islander and Defender surveillance aircraft, which it seems are also slated to be withdrawn this year. In total, 11 manned ISR aircraft are rumored to be slated for retirement. More cuts are proposed beyond that, too, with the order for E-7 Wedgetail airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft likely to be reduced from five to just three. Cuts are expected to be made to the RAF’s transport capacity, too, with the reported loss of all 14 C-130J Hercules transports, which serve primarily in a special forces support role. This will leave the A400M Atlas as the mainstay of the tactical transport role, although there have been concerns these aircraft are not best suited to special forces missions. A Royal Air Force C-130J Hercules., Crown Copyright The sources also say that the BAe 146 jet transports used, among other things, for transporting key members of the Royal Family will be replaced by leased aircraft. However, the BAe 146s had already been put up for sale, which you can read about here , although they enjoyed a comeback when two examples were adapted for emergency medical transport of COVID-19 patients last year The RAF’s rotary-wing transport fleet is said to be set for a 41% reduction in numbers, for a total of 45 helicopters to be withdrawn. It’s not clear what these might be, but removal of an entire fleet is a possibility. The obvious candidate would be the Puma HC2 , which, although it has been upgraded, dates back to the early 1970s. Twenty-three Pumas currently serve alongside 60 Chinooks, although the oldest of the Chinooks date back to the early 1980s . As recently as last month, the service had revealed it was planning to replace its Pumas with a new type via its New Medium Helicopter (NMH) requirement, although this is still in its very early stages. There is also the possibility that cuts could be made elsewhere in the rotary-wing fleet, with unconfirmed reports that the British Army may lose its aging Gazelle utility helicopters as part of a planned reduction. British Army The British Army is expected to have to make cuts to its personnel strength, traditionally a barometer of overall defense capabilities. The Times says that troop numbers could be cut by 12,500, primarily by reducing recruitment. This is expected to result in a reduction of 10,000 troops by 2024, with another 2,500 following by 2030. This will bring the overall size of the British army to 70,000, a figure that has been discussed in the past, too. Indeed, in 2015 the ruling Conservative party committed to not reduce the army below 82,000, while this had been dropped two years later. Instead, the 2015 election manifesto stated: “We will maintain the overall size of the armed forces, including an army that is capable of fielding a warfighting division.” In fact, although the army currently has a required size of 82,000, today it’s already below this, at 80,000. In terms of structure, it’s envisaged that the aforementioned “warfighting division” — one of three such formations in total — will be cut from four to two armored brigades, while 23 battalion-sized units will either be reduced in size or disbanded entirely. A British Army Warrior infantry fighting vehicle during training in Oman., Crown Copyright As well as being smaller, the Army will have to give up some of its equipment, the No. 10 sources reveal. A planned upgrade for 600 Warrior infantry fighting vehicles is set to be scrapped, saving around $2 billion. Although not stated specifically in the article, it is likely that resources will instead be directed toward the efforts to field the new General Dynamics tracked Ajax reconnaissance and Artec Boxer wheeled infantry vehicles. Indirect-fire capabilities are also apparently due for a radical overhaul, with the AS90 155mm self-propelled howitzer, Multiple Launch Rocket System , and undisclosed older artillery to be replaced “late in the decade” by unspecified combat drones and precision-guided rockets. These future unmanned aerial vehicles may involve the kinds of swarming drones that the U.K. Ministry of Defense mentioned would be developed for the RAF using money from a “Transformation Fund,” planned to help speed up the development of new and advanced capabilities across the armed forces as a whole. The RAF has already established a dedicated unit to explore both loyal wingman and swarm concepts, No 216 Squadron , although the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed its expansion . Royal Navy At first glance, it would seem that the “Senior Service,” with its promised new warships, might escape the worst of the likely cuts. However, a serious capability gap looks likely . The Times states that “in the middle of this decade a third of the Type 23 frigate fleet and half the nuclear attack submarines will have to be retired on safety grounds” before planned replacements are available. The reduction in available frigates and submarines once again raises the question of whether the Royal Navy will have sufficient escorts for its aircraft carriers, an issue that The War Zone has highlighted on numerous occasions . The Royal Navy has, in the past, been repeatedly targeted for cuts, primarily to pay for its aircraft carriers. In particular, this has included dramatically reducing its amphibious warfare capability . However, according to the report, the current major shipbuilding programs are secure. These are expected to yield an unspecified number of Type 32, eight Type 26 , and five Type 31 frigates , as well as the future solid support ships that will supply the Carrier Strike Group, plus new multirole research vessels. The bow of the Royal Navy Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland ., Crown Copyright Fit for the future? Should all these reported cuts be included in the upcoming defense review, there will no doubt be opposition from various different sides, but they will have to be seen in the context of plans for a new approach to British foreign policy after Brexit — it’s notable that increased overall defense spending is counterbalanced by major cuts to overseas aid, for example. One pillar of the new defense strategy is based on research and development with the aim of boosting local industry with contracts to build warships and, in the future, the Tempest fighter. While the government seems to have embraced the promise of new technologies in defense, the country is also poised to demonstrate its military power with a forthcoming Far East cruise for the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth — to be joined by F-35Bs from the U.S. Marine Corps . Another naval task force deployment is planned to the Polar North, reflecting the growing strategic significance of the Arctic region . This is all part of a new strategy that is supposed to reinvigorate the UK armed forces’ role globally. Clearly, it will not be easy to strike a balance between revolutionary technologies and global maritime force projection on the one hand and a smaller, more flexible military on the other. After all, the big-ticket items that are likely to be prioritized within the defense review remain enormously expensive. Last January , the National Audit Office, which scrutinizes public spending on behalf of the U.K. government, said it had identified a “black hole” in the armed forces equipment budget as high as $24 billion. Alarmingly, that was without factoring in the full costs of Tempest, a new nuclear-powered attack submarine successor to the Astute class of submarines, RAF Space Command, and other flagship projects. Despite the additional funds that have been pledged by Johnson, cuts would still have to be made elsewhere, the watchdog warned. While we can probably expect the new defense review to be billed as “right-sizing” the military for future threats, it does raise questions about how relevant the United Kingdom will be as an independent military power outside of a larger coalition. Time will tell what areas of defense will see the inevitable cuts and, meanwhile, whether ambitious new projects are realized on time and on budget and how they actually end up fitting within this wider strategy.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has recovered an MH-60S Seahawk helicopter from the bottom of the sea off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, from a depth of 19,075 feet. The salvage effort, according to the Navy, sets a new record for aircraft recovery by the service’s deepwater recovery specialists. While the MH-60S was retrieved from the Pacific Ocean last week, details of the impressive feat were revealed last night by Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), whose Supervisor of Salvage and Diving (SUPSALV) was responsible for bringing up the helicopter, which emerged looking to be in surprisingly good condition. The CURV-21 deepwater remotely operated vehicle used to retrieve the MH-60S from the Pacific floor., U.S. NAVY The Seahawk, operated by Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 12 (HSC-12), the “Golden Falcons,” had crashed into the Philippine Sea 92 nautical miles east of Okinawa on January 25 last year. At the time, the helicopter was conducting operations from the amphibious command ship USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19). No lives were lost in the accident, the five crew members managing to escape the MH-60S before it sank. The crew members were rescued by U.S. and Japanese forces. Two were taken back to the Blue Ridge by another Navy MH-60S from the ship and the other three flown by a Japan Air Self-Defense Force UH-60J helicopter to Naval Hospital Okinawa for evaluation. The MH-60S is the Navy’s multirole variant of the Seahawk family and is responsible for a variety of missions largely centered around the utility mission-set. These include vertical replenishment, general logistics, search and rescue/combat search and rescue, special warfare support, and anti-surface warfare, among others. An MH-60S from HSC-12 delivers supplies from the aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN-73) to the Military Sealift Command dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Washington Chambers (T-AKE-11) during a replenishment-at-sea., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Bryan Mai Last spring, U.S. Pacific Command Fleet requested that SUPSALV find the sunken helicopter and then document whatever was left of it using side-scan sonar and photography. This January, SUPSALV returned to the site on the orders of the Navy Safety Center. The team brought with them a 6,400-pound Cable-controlled Undersea Recovery Vehicle, CURV-21 . This is a specialized deepwater remotely operated vehicle, which can undertake salvage operations down to a depth of 20,000 feet — the edge of the hadal zone, the deepest part of our oceans. After embarking on a contractor-operated salvage vessel in Guam, SUPSALV readied the CURV and began a five-day transit to the location of the helicopter. Recovery operations began on March 17 and the following day the MH-60S was brought to the surface and loaded aboard the contractor’s vessel. The Seahawk will now be taken back to Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, from where it will be offloaded for transport back to the United States. Once there, the airframe will be carefully examined by accident investigators to try and determine what went wrong in the first place. What will happen to the helicopter after that is unclear, but it is in surprisingly good shape considering its water landing and time spent at the bottom of the ocean, under the rigors of immense pressure. The results of an earlier SUPSALV/CURV-21 recovery effort in the Philippine Sea, which brought to the surface the wreckage of a U.S. Navy C-2A Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft., U.S. Navy Securing potentially sensitive U.S. military hardware has long been a priority mission for the deep-diving salvage teams. It was a predecessor of CURV-21 that successfully raised a Mk 28 hydrogen bomb after the Palomares incident in 1966 when an Air Force B-52 bomber collided with a KC-135 tanker over the Mediterranean Sea. CURV-1 raised the 1.45-megaton bomb from a depth of 2,900 feet. The Mk 28 bomb involved in the Palomares incident onboard the USS Petrel after its recovery by CURV-1., U.S. Navy In 1976 , the U.S. Navy nuclear research submarine NR-1 located and recovered a live AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missile in the North Atlantic off the coast of Scotland, preventing it from falling into Soviet hands. It is unlikely, however, that the MH-60S would fit into the same category of classified military hardware. After all, the “Sierra” is mainly a utility platform, in contrast to its stablemate, the MH-60R, that carries comprehensive mission equipment for its anti-submarine warfare role. Still, there are sensitive technologies onboard. More important, though, than the recovery of the Seahawk itself, was the opportunity for SUPSALV to demonstrate how quickly it can recover items from some of the deepest parts of the world’s oceans rapidly, should the need arise. Deep ocean search and recovery capabilities are critical for rescuing stricken submariners, for example, as well as bits of hardware. CURV-21 is offloaded from an Air Force C-5M Galaxy transport aircraft at Comodoro Rivadavia Airport, Argentina, in 2017, to support the Argentinean Navy search and rescue efforts for the missing submarine ARA San Juan ., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Christopher Lange The ability to recover things from the seabed also points to the potential to conduct intelligence-gathering operations, like the famous salvage of a portion of the Soviet Golf II class ballistic missile submarine K-129 from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in the 1970s. For that operation, the Central Intelligence Agency employed the Hughes Glomar Explorer recovery ship. In the recent past, The War Zone examined the possibility of the U.S. recovering a batch of advanced Russian-made surface-to-air missiles, that seem to have been lost overboard from a container vessel. In dragging up this helicopter from an unprecedented depth, the Navy at large has shown that it’s still very much up to the challenge of seriously demanding deep-sea salvage operations.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Three crew have been killed in an accident today involving a Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bomber at Shaykovka airbase in the Kaluga region, western Russia. The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that the crew lost their lives due to an “abnormal operation” of the ejection seats . Russia’s state-run media outlet RIA Novosti said the incident occurred while the Tu-22M3 was being prepared for a training flight at Shaykovka, while its counterpart TASS specified that the ejections were initiated when the bombers’ two engines were started on the ground. It remains unclear whether the seats were activated deliberately, or whether the ejection sequence was unintentional. A fourth crew member reportedly survived the accident and was taken to a medical facility, but it’s not known whether they ejected or remained aboard the aircraft. A Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-22M3 returns to Shaykovka in December 2017, after taking part in operations over Syria., Russian Ministry of Defense An account from TV Zvezda , the official television station of the Russian Ministry of Defense, said that the three crew members were killed since there was insufficient height to safely deploy the parachutes after ejection. The crew of four in the Tu-22M3 consists of two pilots seated side-by-side in front, with the navigator and weapons system officer seated behind them. All the crew members are provided with KT-1M ejection seats and the aircraft commander is also able to initiate the ejection sequence for the other crew members — according to Interfax , this was the case in today’s incident. However, these seats require a minimum speed of 80 miles per hour for safe ejection at altitudes below 200 feet. The Tu-22M3 has a typical takeoff speed of 230 miles per hour. This would be in line with the aforementioned reports suggesting the ejections occurred after the engines had started but while the bomber was stationary. Even if the aircraft were taxiing, it would not have been moving fast enough to ensure the safe extraction of the crew. Modern combat aircraft are typically fitted with “zero-zero” ejection seats , which have no minimum speed or altitude criteria for safe use. Among those killed in this mishap were the regiment commander, who was taking part in the planned mission as an instructor, a source told TASS . No one else on the ground was injured. Unconfirmed reports say the commander was Colonel Vadim Beloslyudtsev, head of the 52nd Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, who was well known for his aerial photography and video work, examples of which you can see in the Tweet below and on this aviation photo website. While the Tu-22M3 is a nuclear-capable bomber , Russian media outlets reported that there were no nuclear warheads onboard the aircraft at the time of the incident. There are unconfirmed reports that the damage to the bomber is limited and that it may be possible to return it to service after repairs. The Russian Aerospace Forces have sent an investigation team to the airfield to determine the causes of the accident, which followed a series of exercises involving Tu-22M3 squadrons in the Kaluga region earlier this week.

Note the Kh-22 cruise missile under the wing of the nearest aircraft., Alex Beltyukov/Wikimedia Commons Tu-22M production took place between 1969 and 1993, producing over 500 examples. Today, Russia’s long-range bomber force includes around 60 Tu-22M3 bombers at three operational bases — Belaya, Olenyegorsk, and Shaykovka — plus additional examples at the Ryazan training base. Shaykovka is home to two squadrons of Tu-22M3s under the 52nd Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, which has operated the Backfire since 1982. The regiment makes occasional deployments to a reverse base at Soltsy, in the Novgorod region, while its aircraft have also taken part in the Syrian campaign , flying missions from Mozdok Air Base in North Ossetia. The last fatal accident involving a Tu-22M3 occurred on January 22, 2019, during a landing in blizzard conditions at Olenegorsk airfield in the Murmansk region. On that occasion, three crew members were killed and one survived. You can read more about that incident in this previous War Zone article.

The experiments were part of Phase 1 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, focused on exploring how AI and machine learning may help automate various aspects of air-to-air combat. DARPA announced recently that it’s halfway through Phase 1 of ACE and that simulated AI dogfights under the so-called Scrimmage 1 took place at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) last month. So far, the Air Combat Evolution has focused on virtual dogfighting, but that’s due to change later this year., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Using a simulation environment designed by APL, Scrimmage 1 involved a demonstration of 2-v-1 simulated engagements with two blue force (friendly) F-16s working collaboratively to defeat an undisclosed enemy red air (enemy) aircraft. In the words of DARPA, the ambitious ACE program aims to develop “trusted, scalable, human-level, AI-driven autonomy for air combat by using human-machine collaborative dogfighting as its challenge problem.” The February AI dogfight tests were the first since APL’s AlphaDogfight Trials that took place last August. On that occasion, a competition pitted eight teams who provided AI systems to fly simulated F-16s in 1-v-1 dogfights. The team with the winning AI then flew another five simulated dogfights against an experienced F-16 fighter pilot in a simulator, beating the human 5-0 in a significant demonstration of AI’s potential that you can read more about here . “Our biggest focus at the end of Phase 1 is on the simulation-to-real transition of the AI algorithms as we prepare for live-fly sub-scale aircraft scenarios in late 2021,” said Colonel Dan “Animal” Javorsek, the program manager in DARPA’s Strategic Technology Office. “Managing this transition to the real world is a critical test for most AI algorithms. In fact, prior efforts have been brittle to just these types of transitions because some solutions can be over-reliant on digital artifacts from the simulation environment.” Compared to the AlphaDogfight Trials, which were gun-only, Scrimmage 1 introduced new simulated weapons, in the form of a “missile for longer-range targets.” “Adding more weapon options and multiple aircraft introduces a lot of the dynamics that we were unable to push and explore in the AlphaDogfight Trials,” Javorsek added. “These new engagements represent an important step in building trust in the algorithms since they allow us to assess how the AI agents handle clear avenues of fire restrictions set up to prevent fratricide. This is exceedingly important when operating with offensive weapons in a dynamic and confusing environment that includes a manned fighter and also affords the opportunity to increase the complexity and teaming associated with maneuvering two aircraft in relation to an adversary.” A pilot takes on an AI opponent during the AlphaDogfight Trials., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP So far, ACE has demonstrated advanced virtual AI dogfights involving both within-visual-range (WVR) and beyond-visual-range (BVR) multi-aircraft scenarios with simulated weapons, plus live flying using an instrumented jet to measure pilot physiology and trust in AI. Throughout the ACE program, which began last year, DARPA has stressed the importance of establishing human pilots’ trust in AI, allowing it to conduct the actual combat maneuvers while the human concentrates on overarching battle management decisions. The process of “capturing trust data” has seen test pilots fly in an L-29 Delfin jet trainer at the University of Iowa Technology Institute’s Operator Performance Laboratory. This aircraft has been adapted with cockpit sensors to measure the pilot’s physiological responses, giving an insight into whether or not the pilot trusts the AI. In these missions, the L-29 has been flown by a safety pilot in the front seat, who makes flight control inputs based on AI decisions. However, for the pilot whose responses are being evaluated, it is as if the AI is flying the jet. Test pilots in an L-29 Delfin jet trainer assess the pilot’s physiological responses to AI-generated flight commands., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP ACE Phase 2, planned for later this year, will add dogfights involving live subscale aircraft, both propeller-driven and jet-powered, to ensure that the AI algorithms can be moved out of the virtual environment and into real-world flying. Meanwhile, Calspan has also begun work on modifying a full-scale L-39 Albatros jet trainer to host an onboard AI “pilot” for Phase 3, a set of live-fly dogfights scheduled for late 2023 and 2024. The L-39 Albatros will serve as the mount for an onboard AI “pilot” under Phase 3 of ACE., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Once this concept is proven, DARPA plans to insert the AI technology developed in loyal wingman-type drones , like Skyborg , working collaboratively alongside manned fighters. In this way, the drones would be able to conduct dogfights with some autonomy, while the human pilot in the manned aircraft focuses primarily on battle management. Ultimately, this AI could be crucial in realizing the dream of a fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) capable of air-to-air combat, as well as air-to-ground strikes, something The War Zone has explored in great depth in the past. While a UCAV would be able to perform many of the same functions as manned aircraft, its AI “brain” would be able to make key decisions faster and more accurately, taking into account much more information in a shorter period of time, without any concern about being distracted or confused by the general chaos of combat. The same algorithms could also be adapted to enable drones to be networked into swarms that work cooperatively to maximize their combat effectiveness, with decisions being made far quicker than a human-piloted formation. A slide from a DARPA presentation showing the planned phases within ACE., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The same AI technology, however, also has applications as a “ virtual co-pilot ,” the kind of concept that’s being developed under R2-D2, a program run by the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Autonomy Capability Team 3 (ACT3). In this way, software and other systems that emerge from ACE could potentially provide new kinds of automated assistance to the crew of manned aircraft. Clearly, ACE has the potential to feed into a variety of different Air Force programs in the realm of autonomous and semi-autonomous unmanned aircraft capabilities, as well as providing another layer of rapid decision-making for manned types. While the ability of AI algorithms to win out in virtual dogfights has now been proven, later this year we should get the chance to see how this technology translates into live flying, too.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 30, 2022",Top U.S. General In Afghanistan Is Carrying A Heavily-Modified Glock With A Compensator Attached,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have written about U.S. Army General Scott Miller, America’s top officer in Afghanistan and a Delta Force alumni, and his penchant for carrying unique sidearms. A competitive shooter, Miller’s choice of carrying a full-sized 1911 drew our interest in the past . He has also been known to carry a Glock, which is a very popular series of sidearms in the U.S. special operations forces community, replete with a small red dot sight and extended magazine. Now, it seems that the General’s Glock has gotten some new upgrades, including a flared magazine well for easier reloading and a big compensator, like those sometimes used in shooting matches, fixed at the end of the weapon’s threaded barrel. This is a feature we have only seen used for combat in far-fetched action flicks. We’re looking at you, John Wick and Lara Croft! The latest images of Miller’s unique sidearm come from the recent visit by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Afghanistan, where the two men met this month to discuss a path forward for the war-torn country after two decades of a constant American military presence there. Previous images , including those from when the General met with citizens on the streets of Kabul in February 2020 (one is seen below), show what could very well be the same gun, but without the compensator attached to its barrel or the flared magazine well. It isn’t clear exactly what Glock model it is, although it is a Gen 4/5. The 9mm G19 is the most popular in the U.S. military, but this could possibly be a G17, or even a G22 chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson. DoD Miller’s sidearms have made news in the past, not just for their uniqueness, but because the General actually drew his 1911 during a brazen insider attack in Kandahar in 2018 that killed controversial Afghan National Police Lieutenant General Abdul Raziq and wounded two Americans. Miller was not among the casualties. In addition, the introduction of Sig’s Modular Handgun System (MHS), consisting of the full-size M17 and compact M18 pistols, which are set to replace the majority of the Beretta M9 pistols across the services , has grabbed headlines in recent years. However, Glock continues to expand its reach across the U.S. military, especially among some of its most elite units. Delta Force, which General Miller was a part, among other U.S. special operations units, has largely transitioned to Glocks , namely the 9mm G19, as the units’ primary sidearm. Glocks fitted with the Leupold DeltaPoint Pro miniature red dot sight have been increasingly seen in the hands of American special operators, as well. DoD With that in mind, it isn’t too surprising that Miller would also carry a Glock, although the latest modifications to his pistol seem, well, unique. The heavy compensator, designed to counteract the upward movement of the gun during firing and make it easier to put multiple rounds on the same target quickly, is something we’ve never seen before on a U.S. military sidearm in a war zone. John Wick and Lara Croft both famously wield H&K pistols with compensators, which look great for the camera, but in real life they make a weapon heavier and less ergonomic for carrying, among other issues while also offering some reduction in muzzle flip., Lionsgate/Paramount As the civilian market has become flooded with every accessory and modification you can imagine for Glocks, and especially for the top sellers in the Austrian company’s product lineup, it isn’t a big surprise to see some of them show up on service pistols belonging to the special operations community. But the compensator is pretty weird. In fact, the advantages of a compensator like this, which is from Zev Technologies , are debatable, although they do look cool. Hollywood has already given a verdict on that! The video below offers a good look at a similarly configured Glock with the same comp and addresses its pros and cons: One thing is certain, General Miller loves his pistols and adding custom features to them, as there is little left to add to his Glock at this point. Considering he serves in a place where friends can become enemies in an instant and he is literally the top U.S. target in the country, whatever works, right? UPDATE: We have some great feedback already on this post. It turns out, that this unique tricked-out configuration of a Glock (specifically the G19) is called a “Roland Special” or a “Gunfighter Special.” It supposedly traces its roots to a member of the U.S. Army special operations community— Chuck Pressburg now of Presscheck Consulting . Still, the exact definition of it is quite the contested subject in the always lively firearms community. Some say there is only one true Roland Special, the one offered by ATEI Guns , while others seem to use the term more loosely, as anyone can configure their Glock similarly and the general concept can be adapted to other Glocks models than just the G19. You can read a bit more about exactly all that goes into the Roland Special here . It isn’t clear exactly who set up the General’s Glock in its Roland Special configuration, so we can’t say just yet where it sits in the grand universe of Glock, but it is definitely an established configuration. One firearms instructor tells The War Zone it is sort of “the all-in ‘operator special’ of Gucci Glocks.” So take that as you may.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 10, 2020",Did An RC-135 Spy Plane Really Make An Unprecedented Run At Chinese Airspace Near Taiwan?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force RC-135U Combat Sent electronic intelligence aircraft flew a mission over the Strait of Taiwan this morning, supposedly approaching nearly 25 nautical miles from the coast of mainland China. The Beijing-based SCS Probing Initiative claims that today’s flight came closer to the Chinese coast than any other previously recorded, based on publicly available data, but the story may not be so straightforward. The RC-135U, serial number 64-14849, which was visible using online flight-tracking websites under the transponder code AE01D5, had been preceded by a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and an EP-3E Aries II intelligence-gathering plane operating in the South China Sea, all in the course of March 22, the SCS Probing Initiative noted in a Tweet . One of two RC-135U aircraft currently operated by the U.S. Air Force., U.S. Air Force The RC-135U, of which the Air Force has just two, is specifically configured to gather electronic and signals intelligence, with a particular focus on collecting data regarding adversaries’ radars and air defense networking nodes. These aircraft collect information about electronic signatures to help commanders build so-called “ electronic orders of battle ” detailing the disposition of an opponent’s air defenses. This includes detecting and classifying threat emitters, and pinpointing their locations, among other electronic intelligence-gathering capabilities. The reported flightpath is a fairly familiar one, routing through the strategic Bashi Channel , which runs from the southern end of Taiwan to the northern tip of the island of Luzon in the Philippines. The spy plane then apparently headed directly toward the Chinese coast, in the airspace close to the border between the provinces of Fujian in the north, and Guangdong to the south. The aircraft then seems to have turned away, headed back to Kadena Air Base, in Okinawa, Japan . This has all the traits of a typical Cold War-style reconnaissance maneuver, stimulating radar emitters of interest to “light up” so that onboard analysts can gather critical data before the aircraft leaves the scene. U.S. surveillance flights in the wider South China Sea area are a regular occurrence, of course, with an abundance of potential items of interest for their sensors to analyze. What made this RC-135U flight so notable, according to the SCS Probing Initiative , which is hosted by Peking University in Beijing and is one of the most active entities tracking American military aviation activity, was its proximity to the People’s Republic. The same source stated that the closest the RC-135U got to the Chinese coast was 25.33 nautical miles. However, U.S. military surveillance aircraft are generally permitted to fly a minimum distance of 20 nautical miles from the coast, although a 40-nautical-mile limit is often used by planners to ensure there is no possibility of a radar misidentifying the exact location of the jet, potentially sparking an international incident. The primary platform sensors (PPMS), the RC-135U’s main intelligence-gathering sensors, are located on the nose…, Robert S. Hopkins III …on the tail…, Robert S. Hopkins III …and on each wingtip., Robert S. Hopkins III That last point raises another possible problem with the analysis, based on its accuracy — or lack of it. Flight-tracking available in the public domain is inherently imprecise, meaning that using it for calculations of this kind is not of definitive value. Whether the aircraft actually remained well outside the 20-nautical-mile zone or even encroached it, cannot be determined from this kind of data alone. A more reliable source would be required to confirm the exact flight path, such as radar plots, like those released by the Japanese Ministry of Defense during incursions of their airspace. Representatives from our favorite open-source flight data website ADS-B Exchange told The War Zone that the information presented by the SCS Probing Initiative likely came from multilateration data, or MLAT, in which there are “tons of variables depending on [radio frequency] propagation.” Using this method, it would be hard to determine the position of the RC-135U with any certainty, suffice to say it was broadly in this area. MLAT, the representatives explained, is a “mathematical calculation based on the time different receivers in the area get the signal, kind of like triangulation. But tons of factors can affect it and the fewer receivers in the area the less accurate it is.” This becomes abundantly clear when you notice how the track jumps around while the Combat Sent likely flew in a straight line. While today’s RC-135U flight could appear provocative, and, as the Tweet below shows, some observers took it to mean as such, the available flight-tracking data from publicly available sources is not enough to go on. Furthermore, the information that it does provide actually seems to reflect a continuation of established practices and patterns flown by U.S. spy planes in international waters ever since the Cold War. Any wider significance comes from the status of the Taiwan Strait, which has played host to tensions between China and the United States , as well as between China and Taiwan . For its part, China has been increasingly flexing its military muscles in this hotly disputed region since the beginning of the year, sending fighter jets , maritime patrol, and surveillance types into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ at the northern end of the South China Sea. For its part, Taiwan has been busy beefing up its military assets standing guard over the strait, including upgraded F-16 fighter jets , ready to intercept potential threats to the island, and cruise-missile-toting warplanes that would be tasked with defending against a possible Chinese amphibious invasion force . What we can say with some certainty, is that it looks as though the U.S. Air Force RC-135U made a run at the Chinese mainland, which is an established air defense stimulation tactic, but exactly how close this one got to the coast cannot be precisely established with the information we have to hand. If this becomes part of a new pattern of operations, we may be able to better define it as a change from the status quo, but for not, we will just have to wait and see.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 24, 2021","Marines Test Javelin Missile Teams In Rubber Rafts “Like Somali Pirates, But Better Armed”","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Teams of Marines armed with Javelin anti-tank guided missiles riding in small inflatable boats trained to engage enemy naval forces for the first time as part of a major recent exercise on and around the Japanese island of Okinawa. The development of these waterborne tactics was influenced, in part, by lessons learned from responding to Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden in the past two decades or so. This follows a smaller exercise earlier this year, in which Marine Corps forces in that same region practiced employing Stinger shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADS, from rubber rafts. The use of Javelin teams in small boats was a component of Exercise Castaway 21.1, which wrapped up on March 20, 2021. The main scenario centered on the establishment of a simulated Expeditionary Advance Base (EAB) on Japan’s Ie Shima island, which is situated less than five miles off the coast of Okinawa. Though led by the 3rd Marine Division, which is forward-deployed in Japan, other Marine units, as well as Air Force and Army elements, including special operations forces, also took part in Castaway 21.1. The main task for the Marines in small boats was “littoral defense,” consisting mainly of keeping watch for any attempts by enemy naval forces to land on Ie Shima and uproot the EAB and being positioned to help respond to any attacks. A Marine Javelin team operates from a small inflatable rubber boat during Exercise Castaway 21.1., USMC “The guy on the offense gets to choose where he lands, right?” Marine Captain Jonathan Kohler, a company commander with 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, who was in charge of the littoral defense operations, told The War Zone in an interview from Japan. “So, this gives us the ability to kind of react to wherever that happens.” “Boats are kind of like a waterborne observation post,” he continued. “They give us a lot of push farther out, really over the horizon is what they’re able to see. I can see where a ship is or what it’s doing.” The current type of small inflatable rubber boat, which is propelled by an outboard motor, that the Marine Corps operates has a v-shaped hull that makes it better able to operate further from shore compared to earlier flat-bottom types. “It gives us a little more range in the water, like 20 to 30 nautical miles on it, and it’s a much smoother ride for the guys in the boat,” Captain Kohler explained. When it comes to putting Javelin teams in those boats, “there are no concerns with firing” them on the water, Marine Captain Nicholas Royer, a spokesperson for 3rd Marine Division, also told The War Zone . “It’s a recoilless weapon so the accuracy won’t be significantly impacted, and the boat itself is small and low-profile, so ensuring the backblast area is over the water and not the boat is easy. The safety aspect of it is actually easier than firing it on land as we don’t need to worry about things being kicked up by the backblast, even, although we’ve fired them from a number of ground platforms and on foot without incident.” Javelins can be employed in one of two modes of operation, a direct fire option and another that sees the missile execute a pop-up maneuver before it dives onto its target. Against tanks and other heavy armored vehicles, the latter mode is particularly useful since it sends the weapon into the top of the vehicle in question, which is typically very vulnerable, even on types with advanced defenses, such as active protection systems. That method of attack can also be used to engage threats behind cover. The entire weapon system, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , includes a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) that has a thermal imaging system capable of 12x magnification, giving it a valuable secondary surveillance capability. The video below gives a general look at the Javelin’s modes of operation. However, during Castaway 21.1, the concept of operations envisioned the boat-borne Javelins being used against maritime threats to the EAB, rather than those on land. “I think the main thing would be targeting ship-to-shore connectors,” Captain Kohler said, referring to things like landing craft and amphibious vehicles ferrying troops from larger vessels to the beach. “So, after they offload of the main [amphibious] ship, kind of interdicting those landing craft as they come ashore.” The Marines are not the only ones to have explored the use of anti-tank guided missiles against landing craft and other similarly-sized maritime threats. Finland, for instance, has dedicated coastal defense units armed with Spike-ER missiles from German firm Eurospike , which produces multiple variants of this Israeli-designed weapons family . In Finnish Defense Forces service, the Spike-ER is actually known as the Rannikko-ohjus 2006 (RO2006), or Coastal Defense Missile 2006. Putting those teams in small boats, rather than in positions ashore, is a more novel application of this concept. It’s also one that the Marine Corps sees as being applicable to offensive, as well as defensive operations, as part of the service’s new Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) concept of distributed operations, which you can read more about in detail in this previous War Zone story . At its core, EABO involves planning to have relatively small groups of Marines quickly establishing bases of operation in forward areas, especially small islands. This distributed concept of operations also envisions them being able to then rapidly reposition themselves, as necessary. The general idea is to use these flexible, responsive ground forces to help control littoral areas, and even surrounding “seaspaces,” to deter opponents in situations short of an actual conflict, and then, if that fails, be well-positioned to engage enemy forces. “We’re not just going to take and hold the island, but looking beyond the island to the seaspace,” Captain Royer said. “That’s what a lot of these small boat type operations let us do.” Marines in an inflatable rubber boat during Exercise Castaway 21.1., USMC “If it’s just transport ships, they’re most vulnerable when they’re loading troops,” Captain Kohler added. “That’s a time when Javelins can be used against the actual ship, even targeting helicopters sitting on the deck of a ship.” That latter notional scenario is very interesting to envision given the notable employment of anti-tank guided missiles against helicopters, on the ground and in flight, as well as other targets beyond armored vehicles, in various conflicts around the world in recent years. This tactic has been used to particular effect by rebel groups in Syria opposed to dictator Bashar Al Assad. “Think of like Somali pirates, but better armed,” Captain Kohler added. For years, pirate groups operating from Somalia routinely attacked very large commercial vessels from small skiffs using various small arms, including rocket-propelled grenades. Counter-piracy efforts have significantly curtailed, but not eliminated such criminal activity in that region. Experiences from Millennium Challenge, a controversial exercise that the now-defunct U.S. Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) conducted in 2002, have also had an important impact in the Marine Corps’ thinking about small boats, Captain Kohler said. As far back as 2017, the Marine Corps had also publicly highlighted a desire to make greater use of “itty bitty boats,” especially in future distributed operations. Small boats, in general, offer a valuable and discreet means of getting around, especially at night, enabling hit-and-run-type raids, as well as more sustained operations, in littoral environments. “Simplicity is the advantage. They’re hard to spot, quick to set up, quick to operate, you can easily train someone to operate them,” Captain Royer said. “It allows us to kind of exist behind enemy lines, on small islands especially,” according to Captain Kohler. “So, I can be moving around a lot and not just limited to one small piece of terrain. I can bounce island to island in the middle of the night.” A Marine on a small boat aims a Javelin missile launcher at night during Exercise Castaway 21.1., USMC “You can fit these on a helicopter , right?” he continued. “You can land somewhere and push a couple off the back and leave some Marines for really an extended period of time.” “We’re not going to be beholden to having to have your larger, more traditional kind of shipping to get somewhere,” Captain Royer noted. In 2019, the Marine Corps first revealed its intention to get away from its reliance on traditional amphibious warfare ships and the service is now working with the Navy on the acquisition of at least one new class of lighter vessel, the Light Amphibious Warship (LAW), to support its future operational plans. When it comes to attacking larger ships with small boat swarms, Captain Kohler acknowledged that “it would be difficult if they have naval escorts, to kind of punch through that.” Still, “at the end of the day, it’s a lot harder to see some of Marines in a boat with a Javelin coming than it is to see destroyer coming your way,” Captain Royer pointed out. “And you can definitely field a lot more of those boat teams with a lot more Javelins.” Issues surrounding the survivability of small boat teams when targeting larger, more traditional naval assets would not necessarily preclude the Marine Corps from employing swarms of small boats with Javelins, as well as other weapons, as part of a larger EABO campaign. Operations against any opponent, including near-peer competitors, would include many tiers of long-range strike and other capabilities applied in various contexts, not all of which would necessarily be high-risk. Castaway 21.1 itself included High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), TOW anti-tank missile -armed 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles , and other light forces using all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, among other things, all contributing to the complete littoral defense picture, as well as other tasks. US Army Special Forces soldiers, including one a motorcycle with a Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle, in position in front of a Marine Corps High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). , USMC A TOW missile-armed Marine Corps 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle., USMC Marines also demonstrated an ability to engage maritime targets using mortars and Captain Royer explained that the Corps was looking to eventually employ that capability from amphibious ships, as well. Of course, unguided mortar rounds would be of more limited utility against faster-moving threats at sea, whether they were engaging them from the shore or afloat. The Marines, among others, have been looking into precision-guided mortar rounds over the years, which would definitely help make this particular tactic more effective. All of this is “letting us set up the bubble of observation and fires well in excess of what you might traditionally think of a company or platoon-level outfit is able to create and influencing a much broader seaspace around a piece of land, which obviously opens up some interesting possibilities with coordinating with the Navy to determine where we might want to funnel an adversary or where we want to deny the adversary freedom of movement,” Captain Royer told us, talking more broadly about the concepts explored during Castaway 21.1. “A lot of this capability allows us to create that denial in a way this very very compressed time scale, low-notice, and very low signature, as well.” “We’ve got a lot of things for your lower-intensity, counter-insurgency-type fights and we have a lot of things for your sort of very high-end, peer-peer competitor-type fights,” Captain Royer added. “Some of the stuff we’re experimenting with here today gives us the opportunity to work in kind of that wide spectrum in between, whether that’s still smaller vessels that don’t rise to the level of the formal navy being used in an offensive capacity by an adversary.” That latter point is especially important given that many potential adversaries now employ forces that are commonly referred to as occupying a “gray zone” that exists outside of an outright conflict. Good examples of this are the small boat fleets that Iran , as well as its proxies in the Middle East possess, which are capable of conducting swarming operations or engaging in missions that are virtually indistinct from terrorist attacks . China’s Maritime Militia, a paramilitary force of fishing boats that is often employed to harass foreign commercials interests as a sideshow to various maritime boundary disputes, particularly in the South China Sea , also fits into this category of malign activity. In a new tri-service naval strategy released earlier this year, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard highlighted how they expect monitoring and documenting incidents short of an outright war to be a major component of routine operations in the future. Modified commercial or commercial-type vessels are also often used by many countries for intelligence gathering and the insertion or extraction of special operations forces or intelligence operatives. “I’ve got snipers in a maritime hide site, basically observing what fishing boats are going out, when are they going out, how can I discern in those patterns that may tip me off for something happening,” Captain Kohler added while talking about the more general aspects of the Castaway 21.1 exercise. Captain Kohler and Captain Royer both stressed that the kinds of small boat concepts of operation that the Marine Corps is exploring now would be applicable outside of the Asia-Pacific region and potential conflicts there, especially with China, which the Pentagon says is presently the “ pacing threat ” for overarching defense planning decisions . “I can think of many pieces of terrain in Europe, near Turkey , in different places” Captain Kohler said. “There’s small islands everywhere , right?” “The ability to reach difficult places on short notice, that could be useful in a humanitarian situation, that could be useful in counter-piracy, counter-terrorism,” Captain Royer added. How future Marine Corps small boat operations continue to evolve in the near term very much remains to be seen, as well. Captain Kohler explained that the Marine Corps was looking at new boat capabilities, “definitely larger than what we’ve got,” as part of the development of its new Marine Littoral Regiment force structure plans, which are part of a larger, radical redesign of the Marine Corps structure, as a whole. You can read more about those plans, known as Force Design 2030, in this past War Zone piece . It’s interesting to note that Marines conducting a separate exercise in the Philippine Sea in February conducted the first-ever launches of Stinger missiles from Navy Mk VI patrol boats . That comes amid indications that service is looking to divest all of those boats in the very near future, a story The War Zone broke . It’s possible that, if the Navy’s plans go ahead, the Mk VIs could be transferred to the Marine Corps to support its expanding use of small boats. A Marine fires a Stinger missile from a Navy Mk VI patrol boat during an exercise in the Philippine Sea in February 2021., USMC In the meantime, the Marines are pushing ahead with their development of new small boat tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as other capabilities to support future distributed operations. “It’s about innovating with what we have available and kind of looking to some of the future capabilities we might get and laying the groundwork now,” Captain Royer said. “We’re not waiting for technology to catch up with our ideas.” It’s all about developing “a more flexible, scalable force with a mix of very old concepts that we’re revamping and then new stuff,” he added. Small boats, carrying teams armed with Javelin missiles and more, look set to only be an increasingly important part of that force mix going forward.

Yes, this is the great War Zone pre-impact weapons collage! I have always found images, usually frames pulled from high-speed cameras, of the very endgame moments of weapons tests absolutely fascinating.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 18, 2021",Belgian Cops Tasked With Guarding NATO Headquarters Still Wield The Iconic Uzi Submachine Gun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though unquestionably iconic, the original Israeli Uzi submachine gun is an increasingly uncommon sight among Western security forces. However, recently released pictures show that Belgian Federal Police tasked with guarding NATO’s main operational headquarters in Brussels still have access to these guns. The U.S. military released the images of the Belgian Federal Police personnel training with their Uzis at an indoor range at the Training Support Center at Chièvres Air Base. Chièvres is situated around 12 miles from NATO’s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), home of the Alliance’s Allied Command Operations (ACO), in the city of Mons. A Belgian Federal Police officer cocks their Uzi submachine gun while training at an indoor range at Chièvres Air Base., US Army The pictures also show officers training with their Smith & Wesson M&P9 pistols. The American gunmaker won a contract to supply these 9mm handguns to the Belgian Federal Police in 2011. A Belgian Federal Police officer aims their Smith & Wesson M&P9 pistol., US Army The full-size Uzis are definitely the more eye-catching weapons. These particular examples are guns that were license-built in Belgium by the equally famous small arms company Fabrique National , more commonly referred to simply as FN. https://youtube.com/watch?v=l6_e7yXxRnk German-born Uziel “Uzi” Gal began work on this 9x19mm weapon shortly after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 and the first prototype was completed in 1950. Gal personally did not want the gun, which entered service with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) four years later, named after him. The standard Uzi, which weighs just under eight pounds, was one of the first submachine guns to feature a so-called telescoping bolt. What this means is that a substantial portion of the bolt carrier, a key component of the gun’s internal mechanism, is situated in the front of the gun and slides back and forth around the barrel. In many preceding designs, as well as subsequent ones, this component is positioned entirely behind the barrel. Doing this allows for a more compact weapon that still has a relatively long barrel. The original standard Uzi, which had a fixed wooden stock, had a barrel just over 10 inches long and an overall length of just over 25-and-a-half inches. By comparison, the M1 Thompson submachine gun, another iconic weapon, has a 10-and-a-half-inch-long barrel, but is nearly 32 inches long. A standard Uzi submachine gun with a fixed wooden stock., Swedish Army Museum A version of the standard Uzi with a folding stock, as seen on the Belgian examples at Chièvres, was subsequently introduced. With this stock extended, the gun’s overall length is just slightly shorter than it would be with the fixed wood stock installed. Despite the political complexities many countries faced, and that many still do, in dealing with Israel, the Uzi quickly became a gold standard for submachine guns worldwide. Iran under the Shah was among the importers of these guns and they remain in use in the current Islamic Republic, even though it is opposed to the very existence of Israel as a matter of policy. Large quantities of licensed copies and unlicensed clones were produced in various countries. Iranian special forces personnel armed with Uzis with sound suppressors., Borna News Agency Through its ubiquity, including with major military and other security forces, the gun achieved iconic status, both in real life and in popular media. Robert Wanko, as well as other U.S. Secret Service agents, famously drew his Uzi during the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981. US Secret Service agent Robert Wanko, at left, unfolds the stock on his Uzi submachine gun in the immediate aftermath of the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981. A briefcase, in which an Uzi, either the one held by Wanko, or one wielded by another agent somewhere else at the scene, had been concealed, is seen in the street to the right., NARA Uzis also saw use with U.S. military special operations forces, including U.S. Navy SEAL teams and the U.S. Army’s Special Forces, and they remain in arms lockers within the American special operations forces community for foreign weapon familiarization training. Other federal government agencies, such as the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service and predecessor organizations, issued Uzis to their personnel, as well. Students assigned to the Army’s JFK Special Warfare Center and School fire Uzis, as well as other submachine guns, during a foreign weapons familiarization training course.  , US Army A special agent from what was then the US State Department’s Office of Security, armed with an Uzi, is seen at left in this picture of then-US Ambassador to El Salvador Thomas Pickering, in the foreground, and then-US Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick, at right, in El Salvador in 1984., Public Domain At the same time, Uzis also became popular with terrorist groups and criminals. The robust and compact design combined with the sheer number of these guns in circulation worldwide – Israel alone manufactured more than 1.5 million of them – increases the chances that they will continue to find their way into the hands of malign, non-state actors. This was all quickly translated to the big screen in movies such as 1986’s The Delta Force , starring Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin. The list of movies, as well as television shows, in which the Uzi is a prominent feature, including other big-name blockbusters, such as 1984’s The Terminator , with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular Terminator, is far too long to post here in full. Videos games and other popular media also routinely feature Uzis. After more than seven decades, the Uzi continues to see significant use by military units and state security forces to this day – including with the Belgian Federal Police. However, it is now certainly a dated design that is relatively heavy for its size and has a rate of fire, 600 rounds per minute, that is decidedly slow for a weapon of this type, even if it makes it more controllable and, as a result, accurate. A compact derivative weighing six pounds and with a rate of fire of 950 rounds per minute, called the Mini Uzi, was introduced in 1980. This was followed six years later by the even smaller and faster-firing Micro Uzi, which, while visually similar, is a substantially different design. A stockless Micro Uzi “pistol” with a slightly shorter barrel came soon thereafter. Semi-automatic versions were also produced, including types with longer barrels necessary to comply with various laws regarding civilian ownership, especially in the United States. A 1980s-era advertisement showing all the models in the Uzi family at that time., Public Domain “Old technology has to be phased out at some point,” Iddo Gal, son Uzi Gal, told The Baltimore Sun in 2004, two years after his father died at the age of 79. “There are very few weapons that held on for so long.” Still, just like its operational use, production of the Uzi persists. In 2010, Israeli gunmaker IWI even unveiled a new type, the Uzi Pro , a derivative of the Mirco Uzi featuring an all-new lightweight polymer lower receiver, among other changes, and various modern trimmings, such as accessory rails for mounting things like optical sights, lasers, and tactical lights. A semi-automatic “pistol” version, initially with no stock , but now available with an arm brace , was also introduced, again aimed primarily at civilian markets, particularly gun enthusiasts in the United States. However, even when it first appeared more than a decade ago, the Uzi Pro was entering a market flooded with newer, more modern submachine guns , which have increasingly overtaken other iconic, but dated types, such as the Heckler and Koch MP5 series , as well. Military forces, in general, have long been moving away from guns of this general type, as well, in favor of compact assault rifles that fire rounds with better ballistic performance and reach. That same trend has also been apparent in many police and security forces around the world, in no small part due to concerns about the proliferation of more capable guns and body armor among criminal groups. A newer class of guns, known as Personal Defense Weapons or PDWs , tries to make the best of both worlds by offering a compact and highly controllable package with a deep magazine depth that fires what can be described as miniature rifle rounds that are capable of penetrating body armor. These offerings have also degraded the sub-gun’s attractiveness in some instances. The HK MP7 is a highly popular PDW used by military and police forces around the globe., SRI Tactical/wikicommons That being said, submachine guns, in general, do continue to see service with major military and other security forces, though often in niche roles. For example, in 2019, the U.S. Army officially selected a version of the B&T USA AC9 PRO series as a new weapon specifically for VIP security details, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . How long the Belgian Federal Police will ultimately hang on to their Uzis remains to be seen, but, at least for now, they remain part of the arsenal available to officers protecting one of the key headquarters of what is arguably the most significant military alliance on the planet.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Mar 17, 2024",Russia Is Jamming Royal Air Force Transport Aircraft Flying Out Of Cyprus: Reports,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Repeated attempts have been made to jam the GPS navigation systems used by U.K. Royal Air Force aircraft operating from an airbase in Cyprus, the east Mediterranean island that serves as a hub for the service’s efforts in the anti-ISIS campaign in Iraq and Syria. Two British newspapers have concluded that Russia is behind the actions and, in the past, that country has also launched electronic warfare attacks against U.S. drones in Syria , and probably also against U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunships . Reports today in The Times and Telegraph newspapers cite “military intelligence sources” who say that the electronic warfare efforts targeted the GPS systems of RAF A400M Atlas C1 transport aircraft departing RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, while troops were on board. GPS systems of this type are widely used for accurate aircraft navigation, increasing safety and efficiency, with most aircraft having backup systems if the GPS is lost. Unnamed intelligence sources say that RAF A400M Atlas C1 transports have been targeted by GPS jamming — but RAF Typhoon fighter jets have not., Crown Copyright The same sources cite Russia as being the only “hostile state” able to jam GPS signals in this way in the region and that doing so would be in keeping with its “sub-threshold activity,” referring to warfare that involves confrontation while avoiding open armed conflict. The Atlas C1 is the RAF’s latest fixed-wing transport, having entered service in 2014, with tactical and strategic oversize lift capabilities that complement the older C-130J Hercules and the larger C-17 Globemaster III . Since then, the Atlas has also taken on other roles, including maritime surveillance , and is expected to completely take over tactical and special forces transport tasks from the Hercules, the retirement of which is widely anticipated to be announced next week “The attacks could have prevented the pilot from knowing where the aircraft was or the direction it was flying in and potentially resulted in casualties,” The Times described. Each Atlas can carry up to 116 fully-equipped troops, although a mixed load of personnel and cargo is more common. However, the same account noted that none of the attempts were successful. It is also unclear what, if any, effect the attempted jamming has had on civilian aircraft operating over Cyprus, but it appears that relevant notices to airmen (NOTAM) — notices filed with an aviation authority to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards — have drawn attention to degraded GPS signals in the region in the past. “This is an example of another state being hostile and reckless for no apparent reason,” the unnamed source added. “These are transport aircraft bringing in spare parts. It’s not like they are fighter jets.” This suggests that efforts have not been made to interfere with the GPS or other electronic systems used by the RAF’s Typhoon fighter jets that are deployed to Akrotiri to take part in combat operations in Iraq and Syria. In recent weeks, these jets launched, for the first time, Storm Shadow cruise missiles to attack hardened ISIS targets in Iraq, which you can read about here . An RAF No 6 Squadron Typhoon on the runway ready to fly a sortie from RAF Akrotiri., Crown Copyright As to the source of the GPS jamming, the Telegraph reports that it thought to be either from Syrian territory or possibly by agents on the ground in Cyprus. Alternatively, the electronic warfare equipment could be installed in aircraft or on ships at sea. Perhaps significantly, the reports of GPS jamming against RAF aircraft in Cyprus come three days before the release of the second part of the U.K.’s new Integrated Review of Security, Defense, Development and Foreign Policy, a defense review covering the years through 2025. The review determines that Russia is “the most acute direct threat to the U.K.” and will be “more active around the wider European neighborhood,” while the document also makes explicit reference to hybrid threats of this kind, as well as nuclear and conventional ones. The second part of the review is expected to outline plans to address hybrid and “grey zone” warfare between peace and war. The U.K., of course, has direct experience of this kind of warfare on its soil, most notably the Salisbury attack that you can read more about here and here . U.K. first responders in hazmat suits walk away after having placed a protective tent over a bench that may have been contaminated after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England., ANDREW MATTHEWS/PA WIRE/PRESS ASSOCIATION VIA AP As for the situation in the eastern Mediterranean, while this is the first time that reports point to direct actions of this kind attempted against U.K. military aircraft, it fits with previous tactics that have also been attributed to Moscow. As well as jamming the GPS receivers and other data links on small drones over Syria, Russian military aircraft have been harassing their American counterparts over the country in this way to some degree for years, which The War Zone was among the first to reveal . Similar electronic warfare activities have been reported in Ukraine , where the Kremlin is actively supporting an insurgency against the government in Kyiv, since 2014. There have been claims that Russian troops, and pro-Russian separatists, disabled those drones with electronic warfare assets before downloading video footage to reveal Ukrainian positions. The video below shows Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine showing off a captured RQ-11B Raven drone that they claimed to have brought down using an electronic warfare attack. While jamming against U.S. drones back in 2018 was said to be having an “operational impact” and that the Russian equipment was sophisticated enough to break through a number of existing countermeasures, the reports state that the RAF Atlas transports have not been adversely affected. However, it is likely that the drones in question were catapult- and hand-launched smaller types, without the robustness or redundancy of the kinds of communications systems found on manned aircraft. It could also be the case that the U.K. has taken proactive measures to protect at least some of its aircraft from GPS jamming. In the past, The War Zone has reported that the U.S. Army was adding anti-jam equipment to a fleet of discreet special operations spy planes in response to operational requirements in the Middle East. Anti-jam GPS is meanwhile being deployed on many platforms, including U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18 fighter jets , for example. In 2018, U.S. Special Operations Command did admit that U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunships operating in Syria had been subject to electronic warfare by unspecified opponents, almost certainly Russian or Russian-support forces. At the time, U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas described Syria as “the most aggressive EW [electronic warfare] environment on the planet from our adversaries. They’re testing us every day, knocking our communications down, disabling our AC-130s, etcetera.” A U.S. Air Force AC-130U gunship from the 4th Special Operations Squadron., U.S. Air Force For its part, Russia has a wide array of man-portable and vehicle-mounted electronic warfare systems that are reportedly capable of jamming transmissions and even feeding false information into networks, including “ spoofing ” GPS signals and potentially sending parties and vehicles off their intended course. “Spoofing” an aircraft would potentially be far more dangerous than a simple GPS loss since the crew could be led to believe they were in a different location. Russia has also publicized its use of these assets, including claims in 2018 that it had been able to neutralize drones attacking Khmeimim airbase and Tartus naval base in Syria using electronic warfare systems . A Russian Krasukha-4 mobile electronic warfare system. It is reportedly able to target spy satellites, ground-based radars, and airborne early warning systems., Russian Ministry of Defense There is a possibility, too, that Russia is deliberately limiting the potential level of disruption caused by its jamming of manned aircraft like the RAF Atlas. While the destruction of unmanned aircraft is a relatively low-risk proposition for Russia, especially in a theater of war. Destroying a manned aircraft, especially one full of troops, and operating in international airspace, would likely result in a major escalation. With that in mind, it could well be that the activities in Cyprus are intended to be seen as Moscow sending a signal to the U.K., showing that it is capable of interfering with British and allied operations in the region with relative impunity, should it so desire. Whatever the thinking behind it, and whatever the U.K. chooses to do to counter it, the episode points clearly to the growing threat of jamming and other non-kinetic attacks in the region and in general .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 2, 2021",Navy Wants Triple-Packed Hypersonic Missile Modules On Its Stealthy Zumwalt Destroyers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is now officially looking into what it would take to arm its Zumwalt class stealth destroyers , also referred to as DDG-1000s, with hypersonic missiles . The service has also now disclosed that it is looking to field these missiles loaded into an Advanced Payload Module, or APM, that has “a three-pack configuration.” The Navy’s Strategic Systems Program (SSP) office issued the so-called “ sources sought notice ” on March 18, 2021. This kind of announcement is intended to get companies to submit proposals in order to see what kind of options might be available to meet certain requirements, but is not automatically a prelude to a formal contract. SSP is better known as being responsible for managing the development, acquisition, and sustainment of the Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile and the service’s Ohio class ballistic missiles submarines , or SSBNs, as well as work on the forthcoming Columbia class SSBNs. The USS Zumwalt fires an SM-2 Block IIIAZ surface-to-air missile during a test., USN “SSP is currently assessing the means to implement the goals set in the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to integrate hypersonic technologies with the Zumwalt class destroyers,” the Navy’s contracting notice says. “SSP is seeking input from industry to determine if there are sources with the facilities and proficiency required for executing the following capabilities.” The requirements include integrating the various components of the Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) weapon, including the triple-packed APM and the necessary fire control systems, onto the service’s DDG-1000s. Contractors also need to submit proposals for how they would support expanding production of IRCPS components, as well as related items that are common between those weapons and the U.S. Army’s Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW). The Army and the Navy have been working on IRCPS and LRHW together as a joint-service effort and the missiles that both systems will fire are effectively identical. It’s not clear how long the weapons are, but the missile bodies are reportedly 34 and a half inches in diameter. Each one carries a single unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, also known as the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB), in its nose. An Army infographic showing the components of its Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon that are common between it and the Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike weapon system, as well as the single-round canister that it will use together with trailer-mounted launchers., US Army Unpowered hypersonic boost-glide weapons use large rocket boosters to get the vehicle to the desired speed and altitude, after which the booster falls away and the glide vehicle flies back down toward its target along a relatively unpredictable trajectory, which differs significantly from that of traditional ballistic missiles during their flight. This capability, combined with hypersonic speed, defined as anything above Mach 5, makes these kinds of weapons ideal for penetrating through dense air and missile defense and presents significant challenges for opponents to respond effectively or even try to run and hide. The Navy’s present plan is to field IRCPS first on its future Block V Virginia class submarines, each of which will have four large-diameter multi-purpose vertical launch tubes, very similar to those on Ohio class boats, in an additional hull section known as the Virginia Payload Module (VPM). The service has also already conducted at least one test involving the firing of a missile carrying a prototype C-HGB from one of its Ohio class boats. There has been at least one ground-based test of the boost-glide vehicle, as well, but testing of full prototype IRCPS/LRHW missiles is not set to begin until later this year. A briefing slide with details about the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) that will be added to the Block V Virginia class submarines., USN It’s not entirely clear from the contracting notice whether the APMs are specifically related to discussions about integrating IRCPS to the DDG-1000s or have already been in development for use in launching those weapons from submarines, but there strong indications that point to the latter. Based on the basic description of the APM, it would seem to be related to, if it is not a direct outgrowth of work on what was known as the Flexible Payload Module (FPM), which was designed to fit inside an Ohio class launch tube. The FPM was developed around the same time that the Navy began the process of converting four Ohio class submarines into what were subsequently categorized as guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs. In actuality, these boats are highly-specialized multi-purpose platforms that launch cruise missile attacks, carry special operations forces, and act as underwater command and control and intelligence fusion centers, all of which you can read more about in detail in this past War Zone feature . At least two versions of the FPM were developed and tested, the first of which had two 20-inch diameter launch tubes, as well as 10 smaller 14-inch ones. The second iteration had three larger diameter tubes, a configuration that sounds similar, if not identical to the new APM for use with the IRCPS hypersonic weapon. A briefing slide with a computer rendering of the first Flexible Payload Module configuration with the two 20-inch and 10 14-inch launch tubes., General Dynamics Electric Boat Another briefing slide with a picture of a second version of the Flexible Payload Module that had three larger-diameter launch tubes compared to those found on the first model., General Dynamics Electric Boat If the FPM and APM are indeed related, it would also strongly suggest that it would only take limited effort to integrate IRCPS onto Ohio class boats, either SSBNs or SSGNs, as well as the Columbia class submarines and possible future Large Payload Submarines. The Large Payload Submarine is an SSGN-like design concept the Navy has been exploring in recent years. If nothing else, the APMs would allow each Block V Virginia to carry up 12 IRCPS missiles at a time. There has been discussion since at least last year about integrating the IRCPS onto the Zumwalt class destroyers, but it has been unclear how this might work given that these weapons are substantially larger than the dimensions of the existing Mk 57 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells on these ships. The disclosure in the contracting notice that the planned installation would be expected to use the APMs would indicate that the general idea, at least right now, is to try to find space on those destroyers for at least one launch tube of a similar size to the ones found on the Ohios , as well as those planned for the VPM on the Block V Virginias . With that in mind, a logical course of action could be to install tubes in the space presently occupied by one or both of the two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) on each DDG-1000s. The AGSs are autoloading and linked to large magazines that extend well below the deck line, all of which would no longer be necessary if these weapons were removed. In 2016, the Navy notably decided not to buy any ammunition for these weapons, rendering them effectively dead weight and prompting discussions, including here at The War Zone , about possible replacement options. IRCPS could certainly be one alternative, though there has also been work on the development of hyper-velocity projectiles that would work with the AGSs . Of course, the debate about the future armament of the DDG-1000s is just one part of the saga of those three ships, one of which, the USS Zumwalt , is technically in service now, with the other two, the USS Michael Monsoor and future USS Lyndon B. Johnson , are in various phases of their final fitting-out. The Navy originally expected to buy 32 of these ships, but those plans were significantly scaled back in the face of cost growth and delays due to various factors, including the complexity of the basic hullform , as well as other advanced technologies, including a unique combat management system and associated radars , developed to go into it. There have been continued debates over the years about what the expected roles and missions of the Zumwalt class destroyers should be in the end. At present, the plan is to assign all three to a development unit that will be primarily focused on exploring new tactics, techniques, and procedures related to naval surface warfare. They are expected to deploy operationally and the Navy insists that they will be important frontline combat assets. It’s also worth noting that there has been talk about possibly adding IRCPS, or some other future hypersonic weapon, to the arsenal of the Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyers, as well. “This capability will be deployed first on our newer Virginia class submarines and the Zumwalt class destroyers. Eventually, all three flights of the Arleigh Burke class destroyers will field this capability,” then-Trump administration National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien had said in a speech in October 2020. If these ships, as well as the Zumwalts , do not ultimately end up armed with IRCPS, they could still eventually be able to fire other future hypersonic weapons, including air-breathing cruise missile designs and other types. The future SM-6 Block IB missile is expected to reach hypersonic speeds . Many of those weapons would likely fit into existing VLS cells, which would make their integration much easier. The Navy’s contracting notice does not say when it might make a decision about whether or not to proceed with plans to arm the DDG-1000s with hypersonic weapons. However, it does say that any proposals need to be submitted very soon, no later than April 2. Whatever ships and submarines ultimately end up being armed with IRCPS, it is now clear that the Navy plans to pack them into launch tubes three at a time.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 10, 2021",High-Performance Target Drone Washes Up On Florida Beach (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Beachcombers in Florida’s Palm Beach County had the chance to uncover something very unusual that washed up with the tide early this morning, a U.S. Air Force BQM-167A target drone. The 20-foot-long high-performance aerial target was found on the waterline at the north end of Ocean Ridge Hammock Park, south of West Palm Beach. After a member of the public raised the alert, the local police secured the area while the relevant authorities were notified. The area of the beach was then made secure, while Air Force personnel began the process of removing the drone, according to a report from the local news outlet WPTV . A BQM-167A is launched from Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida., U.S. Air Force/Bruce Hoffman An Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT), the BQM-167A is produced by drone manufacturer Kratos and is used for the test and evaluation of new air-to-air weapons as well as for training pilots during live-fire exercises. It has been in use since 2007. “The primary role of the BQM-167A is to provide the U.S. Air Force aviators with the world’s most realistic and comprehensive end-to-end weapons-release training,” according to the manufacturer. Powered by a MicroTurbo TR 60-5 turbojet engine producing 1,000 pounds of thrust, the BQM-167A can fly at speeds up to Mach 0.91 and at altitudes between 50 feet and 50,000 feet. It’s also agile, being able to maneuver at up to 9G. The drone can also be reconfigured for the type of mission required, including radar augmentation to present a larger target, or infrared “plume pods” for luring heat-seeking missiles and IR sensors. Other options, both internal and external, include scoring systems, identification friend or foe (IFF), and chaff and flare countermeasures to spoof missiles and sensors. The basic design of the BQM-167A has also been used as the basis for the UTAP-22 Mako , the first low-cost loyal wingman drone to be made available for sale. The UTAP-22 can fly as high as 50,000 feet and can carry 350 pounds of stores internally and 200 pounds externally for three hours or nearly 1,500 miles. A highly modified UTAP-22 has also been used for experiments with air-launching from an F-15C fighter, a program that you can read more about here . Four BQM-167s rest on their launch rails, positioned toward the Gulf of Mexico, prior to launch from Tyndall Air Force Base. This subscale target is used for live weapon system evaluations and testing., U.S. Air Force/Sara Vidoni After taking off from a rail launcher on land, using a rocket booster before the turbojet takes over, the drone can be recovered by a parachute recovery system either from land or water — providing it hasn’t been shot down first. Florida is a hotspot for BQM-167A drone activity, with regular exercises and evaluations in which the targets, operated by the 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron out of Tyndall Air Force Base , are blasted out of the sky over the Gulf of Mexico. Indeed, the Air Force has a handful of 120-foot boats, the only vessels in its service, to help recover drones after they are shot down during live-fire exercises , or otherwise need to be recovered from these waters. The boats are operated by a contracted crew from Florida Offshore and retrieve around 100 of the drones each year. A crewmember keeps a BQM-167 drone model steady with a rope as their colleague directs the crane movements to lower it onto the boat’s cradle after a recovery demonstration in the waters off of Tyndall Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Samuel King Jr. While its job is relatively unknown to the wider public, the BQM-167A plays a vital role in proving the reliability of in-service weapons systems, as well as proving out cutting-edge technology before it’s fielded. For example, when an F-16C fighter demonstrated the suitability of using a laser-guided 70mm rocket for shooting down incoming cruise missiles in 2019, it was a BQM-167A that served as the simulated cruise missile threat . Initial imagery of the drone on the Florida beach today suggested that it was mainly undamaged and since it’s intended to be reused, and comes with a price tag of $570,000, it is probable that this particular BQM-167A will live to fly, and fight, another day. In the meantime, we will update this story if and when more details emerge. Update: 7:00pm CET Some additional photos of the Florida beach drone have emerged, now showing it much more up close. These were clearly taken before the police secured the area around the BQM-167A since in several of the images a person can be seen sitting atop it. Also noteworthy — and a very good reason not to sit on the drone — are the ejection tubes in the upper forward fuselage for chaff and flare cartridges, which seem to be at least partly loaded.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has taken an important step toward the establishment of its first operational hypersonic missile unit with the delivery of two inert canisters for training purposes. These canisters are of the exact same design of the ones that will eventually hold live examples service’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon , or LRHW, and will give troops an opportunity to begin practicing handling them as they would during real operations. The Pentagon released pictures of the pair of canisters on March 17, 2021, but the metadata says that they were taken on March 10. Army Lieutenant General L. Neil Thurgood, head of the Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, had said in an interview with Defense News in February that he would personally oversee the delivery of these training aids on March 8. Individuals stand next to the two Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) training canisters after their delivery., Defense Media Activity “Later in 2021, the Army will deliver all additional ground equipment for the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) prototype battery,” according to a generic caption accompanying all of the pictures of the delivery of the training canisters. “LRHW battery fielding will complete in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 with the delivery of live missile rounds.” The Army has not yet disclosed the official nomenclature of this initial LRHW unit or even where it is based. The pictures of the delivery of the training canisters only say that they were taken inside the United States. The heavy secrecy surrounding the establishment of this battery is further underscored by the fact that none of the individuals seen in the photographs are wearing unit patches and some of them do not even have name tapes on their uniforms. It is slightly difficult to read, but it appears that the sides of canisters say that they weigh 20,500 pounds “loaded” and 4,200 pounds “spent.” This could indicate that the LRHW itself is around 16,300 pounds. A close-up look at one of the pictures the Pentagon released of the delivery of the two training canisters showing individuals not wearing unit insignias or name tapes. The weight markings on the canisters themselves are also visible., Defense Media Activity Regardless, the arrival of these canisters is an important achievement and puts the Army just one step closer to fielding the LRHW, which is set to be its first operational hypersonic weapon, not counting more conventional ballistic missiles that were phased out decades ago. The service has been developing the LRHW as part of a joint-service effort with the U.S. Navy . The designs of the Army’s missile and the Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) weapon are effectively identical, though the launch canisters they will sit in will be different, and they will both be tipped with the same conical unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, also known as the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB). A US Army infographic showing the basic components of the LRHW, as well as a notional firing battery. As noted the missile itself and the boost-glide vehicle on top are a common design that the Navy will also use in its Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) weapon system., US Army The compete LRHW and IRCPS weapons both use large rocket boost to loft the C-HGB to an optimal speed and altitude. After that, the vehicle glides back down toward its target along a relatively level flight trajectory at hypersonic speeds, which are defined as anything above Mach 5. The Pentagon has previously said that the C-HGB will be able to “strike targets hundreds and even thousands of miles away” and reach a peak speed of Mach 17. The combination of this speed together with the vehicle’s ability to make more unpredictable movements, compared to traditional ballistic missiles, while following a largely atmospheric flight profile, make hypersonic weapons extremely hard, at best , to defend against and makes it difficult for an opponent to otherwise respond to incoming strikes, either by relocating critical assets or otherwise seeking cover. The LRHW promises to give the Army “a new capability that provides a unique combination of speed, maneuverability, and altitude to defeat time-critical, heavily-defended and high value targets,” according to the captions on the pictures of the delivery of the training canisters. Dynetics, part of the Lockheed Martin-led team developing both of these weapons, has been in charge of the C-HGB design, which is derived from work previously conducted by the Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories. Defense News reported that this the first hypersonic boost-glide vehicle to be produced entirely within the U.S. industrial base, rather than in part at U.S. government facilities. You can read more about the earlier Sandia Winged Energetic Reentry Vehicle Experiment (SWERVE) and the initial phases of this joint-service project, which the Air Force was also involved in until it dropped out last year , in this past War Zone story . “Transitioning production technology is not as easy as people might perceive it to be,” Lieutenant General Thurgood, the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office boss, had told Defense News earlier this year. “Production, especially high-end production, is part engineering and part art; and so the engineering piece you can learn through drawings and those kind of things, but the art of it is always the hardest part, so that’s why we chose an in-person, face-to-face, leader-follower [strategy] — that institutional knowledge that everybody has in every profession that’s never written down.” Flight tests of the C-HGB have already occurred, but joint Army-Navy testing of actual prototype LRHW/IRCPS missiles is only set to begin this year. However, the Army’s prototype battery is not set to take part in any such tests until the 2022 Fiscal Year. This makes the canisters all the more important since it will give soldiers a way to begin getting a certain amount of hands-on training now ahead of those tests. The additional equipment that the prototype battery is scheduled to receive this year will likely include the trailer-mounted launchers for the missiles, as well as other equipment needed for the unit to be able to go through all of the procedures that would be involved in the actual employment of the missiles. Defense News had reported that the canisters, among other equipment, would be used for what it described as “end-to-end kill chain training.” An artist’s conception of an LRHW being fired from a trailer-mounted launcher, with the components of a full firing battery seen in the background., Lockheed Martin All of this is made more important given that the Army hopes that the prototype battery will provide at least a limited operational capability when it is fully established, a process that it expects to complete in the 2023 Fiscal Year. At that point, the unit might also begin taking part in exercises as the service explores how it will integrate these capabilities in future operations, including those with elements from other branches of the U.S. military, as well as foreign allies and partners. New ground-based long-strike capabilities, including hypersonic weapons, are a notably important component of a strategy U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) has proposed for containing China in the Western Pacific region. You can read more about what is known now about the Pacific Deterrence Initiative in this past War Zone piece . All told, it may seem like a relatively small thing, but the delivery of these training canisters is a big step for the Army toward making its hypersonic weapons plans a reality.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2021",Germany’s Unwanted Euro Hawk Drone Has Finally Become A Very Costly Museum Exhibit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The story of Germany’s Euro Hawk surveillance drone — a planned Europeanized version of the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk — has finally come to its sorry end. The ill-fated RQ-4E unmanned aerial vehicle is headed to a museum in the German capital, after plans to sell the one-off aircraft to Canada collapsed. A report on the German-language Augen geradeaus! defense website confirmed that the final resting place of the Euro Hawk will be the Bundeswehr Military History Museum at Berlin-Gatow Airfield . The Euro Hawk completed its first flight on June 29, 2010, at Northrop Grumman’s Palmdale, California, manufacturing facility. , Northrop Grumman Responding to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, the Ministry of Defense confirmed that, under an agreement signed in October 2019, spare parts, ground service equipment, test equipment, and special tools would be transferred to the NATO Support and Procurement Agency, which will presumably use them to support its fleet of five RQ-4D Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) drones, also based on the Global Hawk. The cost of the deal was not disclosed. The remaining equipment, namely the single RQ-4E aircraft itself, plus the ground control stations will go to the aforementioned museum, being put on show as part of its permanent exhibition in 2022 at the earliest. The RQ-4E airframe ending up as a museum exhibit was not what the German Defense Ministry expected when it launched the program, intended to field five examples of the signals intelligence (SIGINT) platform to replace the German Navy’s small fleet of specially configured manned Breguet Atlantic aircraft that had served in the same role — ranging mainly around the Baltic Sea — until 2010. The drones would have carried an Airbus-developed SIGINT system known as ISIS. As it turned out, the Euro Hawk program was an unmitigated disaster. European aviation authorities repeatedly refused to certify the giant drone to fly over the continent. Fears that the unmanned aircraft could put civilian air traffic at risk in congested European airspace meant that European Aviation Safety Agency certification was only available for flights over unpopulated areas, and there was no guarantee that this would change in the near-term. With that in mind, the German military would not be unable to operate the aircraft from its own bases for either training purposes or operational missions. Combined with major cost overruns and long delays, Berlin decided to scrap the program in 2013 after spending a total of $793.5 million. Amid the embarrassing fallout, the German Minister of Defense Thomas de Maizière defended his position under political pressure before stepping down from his position the same year. Northrop Grumman Stripped of all military and mission equipment, the RQ-4E ended up in mothballs at Manching Air Base in Bavaria. A possible sale to Canada failed to materialize after Ottawa submitted a formal bid for the aircraft, despite not having any other similar drones in its inventory. It was reported in the Canadian media that Canada could have returned the drone to airworthiness and used it to monitor oil spills, ice levels, and marine habitats in the increasingly contested Arctic region . Exactly why this deal fell through is unclear, but, as The War Zone observed at the time, the drone lacked essential components, including its navigation and flight control systems, which rendered it unflyable without significant intervention and expenditure. As for the German Armed Forces, they now pin their hopes on an all-new SIGINT platform, being pursued under the Persistent German Airborne Surveillance System program, or Pegasus . Northrop Grumman De Maizière’s successor as defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen had originally wanted another unmanned platform based on the U.S. Navy’s MQ-4C Triton drone — yet another Global Hawk derivative — that could enter service after 2025. Unlike the RQ-4E, the MQ-4C was developed from the outset for civil certification. Those plans changed last year when the ministry of defense instead opted for a manned solution, the Pegasus based on the Global 6000 bizjet. For the time being, however, no budget has been allocated to integrate the required SIGINT payload. Originally, Germany’s Luftwaffe expected to get its hands on a first RQ-4E under the Euro Hawk program in 2012. Now, it looks like Germany is going to have to wait a little longer for its successor.

Kevin Noonan,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020",The Navy Experimented With Turning Its Attack Jets Into Submarine Hunters 50 Years Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Each time I manned my S-3A Viking , back in 1987, I walked past A-6E Intruders and A-7E Corsair IIs parked in various spots on the flight deck of the USS Nimitz . If you had been walking with me and told me that these classic tactical air, or TACAIR, aircraft had once dropped sonobuoys in the hunt for submarines , I would have stopped, given you a sideways glance with a dumbfounded look, and laughed. Thirty years later, had you been sitting across the table from me, you would have laughed at that astonished look I got when I first read about Intruders, Corsair IIs, Hawkeyes, and Electric Intruders doing Anti-Submarine Warfare, or ASW. It was true. And it was all a part of a period of great turbulence and adjustment that forced the US Navy to rethink how to effectively utilize the aircraft carrier and the aircraft that flew from her deck. The year was 1971 and summer was just arriving amid an onslaught of change that was occurring across the U.S. military. The Vietnam War remained the central focus of the nation as ‘Vietnamization’ of the conflict was underway and incremental U.S. troop withdrawals were being realized. Congress, reeling from domestic turmoil, had been seeking ways to pay the exorbitant bill incurred from the unpopular war and found them through reduction of the unpopular military’s annual budget. Unnoticed by the press and the general public, an aircraft carrier battle group (CVBG) slipped its moorings and set out from Mayport, Florida to fight another battle in that other war being waged around the globe: the Cold War. On June 7th, 1971, the USS Saratoga (CVA-60), along with her escorts and support ships, first made their way into the North Atlantic before turning south and then east into the Mediterranean Sea for what would be a very odd and special deployment – a four-month experiment that would test a new concept in ASW and introduce a remodeled way of thinking about what “aircraft carrier” could mean to the United States Navy. It turns out, these tests may very well have been decades ahead of their time. U.S. Navy tugs maneuver the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CVA-60) into her berth at Mayport, Florida (USA), circa 1971. , USN A Very Brief History Of A Changing Concept In the first full year after the United States declared war on the Axis in December 1941, the U.S. and British navies conceptualized the use of small escort carriers (CVE) and their handful of aircraft as a consistent solution to fill the “air-gap” in the U-boat-infested mid-Atlantic and provide desperately needed air defense for convoys fighting the relentless attacks by the Luftwaffe along the run to the Soviet port of Murmansk. Just as this approach was being fully fleshed out in early 1943, the United States changed its strategy. While the British chose to keep their escort carriers with the convoys, knowing the U-Boats would come to them, the American Navy decided to build hunter-killer groups around the CVE and venture off into the broad expanse of the Atlantic Ocean in search of the notoriously elusive prey. The U.S. Navy, hoping to capitalize on the successful efforts of the codebreakers and exploit German submarines’ over-reliance on excessive communication with their naval commands, rolled the dice in an offensive gambit to catch the U-boats at their most vulnerable moments. By the war’s end, both navies felt their use of the CVE was the better option. Surfacing after a depth charge attack, this Nazi submarine, which tried to sneak into the midst of an Atlantic Convoy, has had its conning tower blasted open by gunfire., AP As the post-war adversarial relationship with the Soviet Union was fully realized, the need for a dedicated ASW aircraft carrier task force grew as a counter to the perceived “1,000 submarines” the Russians were believed to be building. The Navy decided its war-time concept of a hunter-killer group, once again centered around a CVE, was the only solution. With North Korea’s crossing of the 38th Parallel on June 25th, 1950, the Navy felt it was ready to counter the anticipated Soviet submarine operations against allied aircraft carriers deployed to Korean waters. The handful of escort carriers still in service, each loaded down with a squadron of the newly minted Grumman Guardian team of the AF-2W ‘hunter’ and AF-2S ‘killer’ aircraft, were deployed to meet the threat. However, the Russians never showed. The U.S. Navy anti-submarine “hunter-killer-team” of the early 1950s: A Grumman AF-2W Guardian “hunter” (with APS-20-radar, in the foreground), and an AF-2S “killer” (background), both from Anti-Submarine Squadron 25 (VS-25)., USN The Guardians were off-loaded in Japan and F4U Corsair fighters were embarked to fly close air support missions in support of U.S. Marine Corps operations for the remainder of the war, primarily off the west coast of Korea. Although ASW missions were still flown by a small handful of aircraft patrols from the decks of the larger allied fleet carriers, no confirmed subsurface threat materialized. After the Armistice was signed in 1953, the “baby flattops” were returned to reluctant ASW aircrews who were in the process of exchanging their two-ship Guardians for the Grumman S-2 Tracker that singularly embodied both hunter and killer. However, the twin-engine aircraft’s unfolded wings spanned 72 feet in contrast to the Guardian’s 60-foot span.  The pilots and enlisted aircrew complained that the slow, aging, and diminutive CVEs could not truly accommodate this new aircraft and effectively engage the once-again worrisome Soviet submarine threat. USS Block Island (CVE-106) in 1953 with Grumman AF-2W and AF-2S Guardian hunter-killer teams on deck., USN Facing the realities of limited wars that required conventional forces, the advent of the supercarrier, the inevitable merging of nuclear power with both U.S. and Soviet submarines, and the concerns of the ASW aircrews, the Navy was forced to reconsider its beliefs about what an aircraft carrier should be. The solution? Simply add some letters after the “CV” designation and work out the complicated, but essential changes that those additional letters would bring to the aircraft carrier. The “attack carrier,” or CVA, would embark the fleet’s fighter and attack aircraft, while the “anti-submarine carrier,” or CVS, would continue the much-loved hunter-killer concept and embark both fixed-wing and rotary-wing ASW aircraft.  The CVEs were decommissioned and 19 of the battle-hardened Essex class aircraft carriers would be converted to the anti-submarine role. Three Essex class boats would retain their fighter and attack aircraft and be included in the redesignation of the Midway and Forrestal class carriers as CVAs. The High Cost And Evolution Of Concepts In the absence of fiscal restraint and in light of its increasingly complicated role as leader of the free world that marked the 1950s and early 1960s, Washington found many uses for its growing carrier fleet. To counter Soviet expansion, two attack carrier battle groups and at least one anti-submarine carrier battle group (CVSG) maintained an influential presence in the Mediterranean Sea to support U.S. diplomatic strategies and respond to varying flashpoints as the land and seascape of the Cold War world drastically changed. The 7th Fleet maintained a wary eye on a stirring China and a growing Soviet Pacific Fleet as both communist countries played the Southeast and Central Asian chessboard. At least one CVBG and one CVSG checked the clever and aggressive communist moves. Then, once again in Asia, the Cold War turned hot. The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga (CVA-14) refueling from the fleet oiler USS Ashtabula (AO-51), while operating off the coast of Vietnam, circa in January 1966., USN Amid technological arrogance, governmental fear, and micromanagement, the Vietnam War drained the national purse and bled the military of its trust in unlimited resources, its certainty of containing the Communist threat, and its tenuous faith in the single-mission weapon system. The era of the multi-role aircraft, warship, and aircraft carrier fell into the Navy’s lap as it no longer made sense to have two carriers where one would do. When America’s war in Vietnam really kicked off in 1964, the Navy had around 24 aircraft carriers available from the Essex , Midway , Forrestal , Kitty Hawk , and Enterprise classes. However, as it progressed and the purse strings tightened, the Navy had no choice but to once again rethink what an aircraft carrier should be in the face of continuing action in Vietnam, the growing blue water threat of the Soviet Navy, and the simple fact that it cost an enormous amount of money to build, maintain and operate a carrier battle group. S-2E Tracker display of weapons and sonobuoys, USN In the mid-to-late 1960s, one major cost-cutting solution enacted was to begin decommissioning the Essex class aircraft carriers. Another cut came with the decision to replace and eventually retire the aging and increasingly ineffective S-2 Tracker. The emergence of Soviet anti-ship cruise missile submarines (SSGs) and the development and deployment of this lethal weapon system combined with nuclear power (SSGNs) a few years later, the Tracker quickly became obsolete. In the mid-1960s, the Navy proposed a jet-powered replacement, initially referred to as the VSX. This stood for “fixed-wing, carrier-based, anti-submarine warfare, experimental” aircraft – what would eventually become the S-3 Viking . At the time, the Navy had planned to fly the VSX aircraft from the Essex class CVS, that was, until fiscal priorities targeted these legacy carriers. The Past Is Prologue Sergey Gorshkov, Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union, most likely didn’t blink with the announced decommissioning of the Essex class carriers. While his primary focus for his naval forces had shifted to the detection and destruction of NATO and French ballistic missile submarines and the protection of his own, he still felt the aircraft carrier to be a threat of major proportion. And much to his liking, I’m sure, his deployment of second-generation Charlie and Papa class SSGNs and the relatively new Juliett class SSGs did nothing to ease the furrowed brows of U.S. Navy admirals. In light of this threat that simply wouldn’t go away, the worried admirals had to figure out a way to protect the remaining CVA supercarriers, find a suitable home for the ASW aircraft and crews orphaned by the dying CVS concept, satisfy the number crunchers in Washington and appease a TACAIR community that would have to live with their solution. What was that solution? Simply remove a letter from the “CVA” designation and work out the complicated, but essential changes that one less letter would bring to the aircraft carrier. The multi-role carrier, or “CV,” would fit nicely into the definition of the Navy’s latest buzz-phrase: Sea Control . The lone example of the carrier-killer Papa class SSGN ever built, which, to this day, holds the record as the world’s fastest submarine., USN “The sea control concept is based on ‘generalized’ Fleet task units capable of conducting any type of combat operation required to maintain control of the seas, whether against surface, air, or submarine threat. This tactical reorientation from more specialized ships and task units provides greater flexibility of naval forces and more naval power for defense dollar spent.” From the “Notebook” in USNI Proceedings , September 1973. Certainly, ASW was not the only focus of the multi-role carrier and sea control, but it was to be its most significant focal point of change for the CVAs and their air wings. Making Space For New Ideas And The Ugly Stepkid As any sailor knows, one of the greatest difficulties on any ship is finding space for new ideas. Carving out deck space for large, ungainly ASW aircraft would require the sacrifice of other aircraft normally used by an Attack Carrier Navy focused on putting bombs on land-targets and missiles into the tailpipes of MiGs. They needed all the aircraft they could get to perform and support those missions. The loss of their precious commodities would be a painful change in mindset and practice for everyone involved. What would it cost a TACAIR-centric air wing to add ten S-2 Trackers and up to eight additional SH-3 Sea Kings , their crews and squadron members, squadron offices and maintenance shops, squadron berthing, larger aviation gas (AVGAS) storage tanks, anti-submarine torpedoes, depth charges and sonobuoys aboard the newly conceptualized CV? According to Norman Friedman, in his US Aircraft Carriers: An Illustrated Design History , the expensive price paid would be four F-4 Phantom IIs from the two fighter squadrons and four attack aircraft from the two A-7 squadrons. SH-3 Sea King ASW helicopter and its dipping sonoar., Public Domain Worse still, the carrier would have no strike reconnaissance aircraft essential to accurate planning and assessment of combat missions. The RA-5C Vigilante , the primary reconnaissance asset at the time, was too large to remain on the flight deck and would have to fly from a shore base, severely limiting its usefulness to the CVBG. But finding space above and below deck wasn’t the only dilemma. Room had to be made in the TACAIR mindset for ASW to fit, be accepted, and be successful. The Trouble With Sexy ASW is not fast. ASW is not popular. And, this being a most important point to many in Naval Aviation, ASW is not sexy. Unlike the constant subsurface threat to the aircraft carrier during World War II, the TACAIR jocks enjoyed almost three decades of progressively diminishing awareness of what a submarine could do to their home on the sea. Why worry about something they could not see, feel, taste or smell? Such ASW geekery was left to the escorts and the CVSGs. Unfortunately for the jocks, Admiral Gorshkov and his submarine skippers continued to consider the CVA a primary target. Thankfully, senior US Navy officers, including older and wiser jocks, realized this. Sexy or not, it would be TACAIR that played a major role in developing what, at first, was offered as a possible final air-ASW solution for the multi-role carrier. An F-4 launches of the deck of the USS Roosevelt . The fast-jet community within the Navy has always dominated the conversation. , USN An Unlikely Someone Had Already Thought The Thought In January of 1967, a short article was published in Proceedings, written by an S-2 Tracker pilot who also happened to be the commanding officer of Air Anti-Submarine Squadron 35 (VS-35). Commander Robert Harlow expressed concern that the VSX program aircraft being developed was in danger of becoming a miniature version of the P-3 Orion. In a drip of carrier-based sarcasm, he wrote that “The VS concept can be killed by simply allowing the [VSX] specifications to grow to patrol plane proportions; the VSX will not fit or P-3 Orions would be practicing carrier landings.” He went on to suggest discarding VSX altogether and going to a “VA/S” concept: “The A-6 Intruder is the aircraft: the A-6 has a favorable load factor, reasonable weight, excellent deck cycle time, outstanding range, adequate speed, slow carrier approach, wing store stations and all weather capability…” Harlow’s idea turned out to be rather prophetic. Ready Or Not, Here Come The Jocks! In the ASW role, the CV concept imagined using the latest version of the Airborne Early Warning Hawkeye , the E-2B, and the combat-proven Electronic Warfare EA-6A ‘Electric Intruder’ to generate a submarine contact. Once a line-of-bearing, or a much more desired fix , was established, properly configured A-6 and/or A-7s would be sent out to lay a sonobuoy pattern and act as signal relay platforms. If the acoustic data confirmed the presence of a submarine, the TACAIR aircraft would be instructed to drop more sonobuoys to begin tracking the target until ASW aircraft could arrive on the scene. A “properly configured” Intruder and Corsair II required them to mount a sonobuoy pod similar to the Aero 2A Sonobuoy/Flare Dispenser carried by the early 1950s-era Douglas AD Skyraider and Grumman AF Guardian hunter-killer teams. The pod carried by the A-6 and A-7 could easily be mistaken for a 300-gallon fuel tank. A relatively large number of sonobuoys could be stored in a pod that size and both attack jets had several hard-points where multiple pods could be mounted. A drawing of an Aero 2A Sonobuoy/Flare Dispenser used by the AD Skyraiders and AF Guardians., USN/NAVEDTRA Ordnance Manual The pod was a clever way to carry the primary or complementary loadout of acoustic sensors. So much so that the concept would be resurrected in the 1980s and again in the 21st Century. Before the P-8 Poseidon, the first proposed replacement for the P-3 Orion was the Lockheed P-7A Long Range Air Anti-submarine warfare Capable Aircraft (LRAACA). In an effort to bring many more sensors to the hunt, a single P-7A would mount sonobuoy pods on several hardpoints and increase the number carried to an astounding 300 standard-sized buoys. Today, the unmanned ASW concept aircraft being developed uses externally mounted sonobuoy pods in a similar fashion. You can read all about this here . Another aspect of the “properly configured” TACAIR ASW aircraft required the sending of sonobuoy data back to the ship for analysis. Because the A-6 and the A-7 could not internally process or analyze the acoustic signals sent from the sonobuoys, another pod would be required to relay the data back to the aircraft carrier or one of the escorts. With a flip of a switch in the cockpit, the pilot applied power and the data would go automatically to an Anti-Submarine Classification and Analysis Center (ASCAC) aboard the carrier and possibly some of the escorts. Analysts in the ASCAC would then determine whether or not the contact was a submarine. A U.S. Navy Grumman A-6B Intruder (BuNo. 149957) of Attack Squadron 75 (VA-75) “Sunday Punchers” on the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CVA-60) in the summer of 1971 , USN Finally, a natural benefit of having the Intruder and Corsair II take part in ASW was their remarkable weapons loadout capacity. The multiple hardpoints on both aircraft not only allowed them to drop sonobuoys and relay data, but they also provided the aircraft with the means to carry the weapons needed to disable or sink a first-generation Echo II SSGN or any variation of the Soviet SSG, all of which could not launch their anti-ship missiles without first surfacing and exposing themselves to attack. It’s worth adding that to my knowledge, no one had considered hanging ASW torpedoes on either aircraft. At the end of June, 1971, the Navy decided to try out this re-imagining of the carrier and its air wing and the Saratoga battle group entered the Mediterranean Sea carrying the dream of a multi-role aircraft carrier with it. The Dream Becomes A Reality Although details of the evaluation of the TACAIR ASW aspect of the CV concept are extremely limited, there are two sources that shed the best light on how the missions were performed. An excellent overview can be found in an article in the March 1972 issue of Proceedings: “The ‘CV’: Capable Vigilance or Continued Vulnerability,” written by Navy Lieutenant James Coogan, the Intelligence Officer of the S-2 Tracker squadron (VS-28, the Gamblers ) embarked aboard the Saratoga during the experiment. Another important source could be found in the book Intruder , written by Mark and Rick Morgan, offering a real-time glimpse into the carrier-level operations of this very odd mission set. Once the Saratoga relieved the USS Forrestal (CVA-59), which had been on her Mediterranean deployment since January, work began in earnest to flesh-out the CV concept. Planned ASW exercises were conducted to evaluate whether or not the addition of TACAIR aircraft could contribute to the successful detection, classification, tracking, and destruction of a submarine. If the exercise submarine raised its periscope or other masts to obtain targeting data, an E-2B from the Screwtops of Airborne Command and Control Squadron 123 (VAW-123) would be looking for a “radar pop-up.” If the presence of the masts were missed, then any energy sent by the submarine’s radar, even a single sweep, was at risk of being captured by a USMC EA-6A Electric Intruder that had joined the experiment utilizing their state-of-the art electronic support measures (ESM) suite. An EA-6A Electric Intruder from Marine Composite Reconnaissance Squadron Two (VMCJ-2), the “Playboys,” aboard the USS America (CVA-66) in 1974., USN Initially deployed on the Forrestal , the Playboys of Marine Composite Reconnaissance Squadron Two (VMCJ-2) cross-decked their small detachment of EA-6As to the Sara when she entered the Med. ASW was nothing new to the Corps, they just hadn’t flown regular patrols against a submarine since they hunted U-boats in their Douglas SBD Dauntless over the Caribbean Sea and Imperial Japanese Navy submarines in their PBJ Mitchell’s over the Pacific. In fact, even today, the USMC is developing plans to join the hunt for Russian and Chinese submarines. If an Intruder from the Attack Squadron 75 (VA-75), the Sunday Punchers , or a Corsair II from either the VA-37, the Bulls, or the VA-105, the Gunslingers, were airborne with a sonobuoy and communication pod, they would be vectored to a radar fix or suspect ESM hit line-of-bearing. Controlled by the ASCAC, an A-7, for example, would fly out to the possible submarine location, also known as a datum . The Corsair II pilot would receive expanding search coordinates for the sonobuoy pattern on a secure voice link and enter each point of data into his Navigation/Weapons Delivery System (NWDS). This flight computer could also display these fly-to-points (FTPs) on the A-7’s revolutionary Heads-Up Display (HUD) , aiding the pilot in capturing each FTP and automatically releasing a sonobuoy in the best geographic position for detection. An A-7E Corsair II from VA-105, the Gunslingers , aboard the USS Saratoga (CVA-60)., USN Once the pattern was laid and no visual indication of a submarine was present, the A-7 pilot would climb up to an altitude that would allow the sonobuoy signals to be relayed to the ASCAC through the communication pod and acoustic analysis would begin. Once a contact was obtained, airborne ASW assets would be vectored to the datum. If not airborne at the moment, then the alert submarine-hunting aircraft would be launched. The Outcome In Lieutenant Coogan’s 1972 Proceedings article, he warned against drawing “hasty conclusions,” while alluding to “the release of a fully detailed study…” I’m sure that study was classified and might still be. I hope, one day, to get my hands on it for my research so we can understand just exactly what did and did not occur. Coogan did provide some hints that there were measured successes. He also clearly addressed inherent deficiencies that came to light as a result of the experiment. The first is one I’ve touched upon above, but let me let you hear it in his expert voice: “Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the evaluation was the inability of the S-2E to successfully convert a submarine datum [into contact] with any degree of predictable confidence. The venerable S-2, long the backbone of the anti-submarine carrier force, proved far too slow to provide a reasonable ‘time-late’ arrival at the submarine datum. With a maximum of three S-2 aircraft airborne for a particular operational cycle, there was not the necessary coverage for quick conversion of a datum that it required for a successful localization and hold-down tactic .” During the different exercises that the Saratoga participated in, problems in planning and communication presented themselves in ways that none of the ASW professionals could have foreseen because, as Coogan wrote, “US destroyers [escorting the CVA] have had little opportunity to work with carrier air wings in a coordinated ASW role.” F-4s waiting to launch and an A-7 blasting off the Saratoga ‘s deck., USN As for the fixed and rotary-wing ASW assets now flying from the attack carrier’s deck, they had to shift to a defensive ASW mentality whose sole mission was to keep cruise missiles or torpedoes from ever being fired against the carrier. An even larger problem reared its ugly head: the carrier battle group admiral and carrier captain enjoyed the added rotary-wing logistical assets and used them excessively for duties other than ASW. During my time aboard the USS Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt , the Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Nine (HS-9) aviators would express their frustration at having to haul cargo, VIPs, and chaplains around while their ASW skills atrophied. In his article, Lieutenant Coogan recommended that utility helicopters (SH-3G models) be utilized to handle all logistics and SAR/plane guard duties. Obviously, as history shows, the common sense of such a smart idea was lost on the Pentagon and Capitol Hill. In their book Intruder , the Morgans provide insight into a real-time problem faced by the Saratoga during this period of operations: “…while anchored off Athens the Sara started taking water through a massive failure of a gasket in the No. 3 Main Machinery Room (MMR). The ship went to General Quarters and was able to stop the sea’s inrush, although the ship reportedly took up to 49 feet of water before it was stopped.  Ten aircraft were launched from anchor to lighten the ship, which had assumed a nasty list, and at least one F-4J almost went into the water…Ten days later, the No.4 MMR flooded in a similar fashion, and for a period the ship was limited to only one-screw ops out of four…Despite the problem – particularly in gaining adequate wind over the deck – Saratoga continued the ASW operations on a limited basis through the remainder of the deployment.” An F-4B launches from the USS Ranger (CVA-61) while moored in Yokosuka, Japan in 1963. While not a photo of the Saratoga incident, it’s a depiction of how fixed-wing fighters can launch even while the carrier is pier-side, let alone at anchor., USN. Robert L. Lawson Photograph Collection via Peter Greengrass. With thanks to Tommy Thomason Just An Interim Solution The TACAIR ASW experiment came to an end with the arrival of the S-3 Viking in 1974. On the 30th of June, 1975, all Navy aircraft carriers were redesignated “CV.” As the final two decades of the Cold War made clear, the multi-role carrier concept was a crucial success in performing the ever-widening range of missions assigned to it, including attack and ASW. Today’s Carrier Strike Groups, limited by the over-utilized helicopter squadrons and the uncertain coverage provided by the land-based P-8 Poseidon , seem to hearken back to this turbulent time of inadequate budgets and barely acceptable ASW assets. There simply isn’t enough money or platforms available to adequately maintain control of the sea in the face of a resurgent Russian Navy and the much more troubling rise of the formidable Chinese Navy. One might be tempted to ask: should we consider placing sonobuoy pods on Super Hornets or the new MQ-25 Stingrays and introducing the F-35C Lightning II to ASW? Come to think of it, the Stingray could not only drop sonobuoys, but also relay the acoustic data back to the carrier and her escorts. This is definitely the concept of operations that is emerging for some existing land-based and even sea-based unmanned aircraft . The MQ-25 Stingray with its refueling pod during a flight test. , Boeing Perhaps history does repeat itself. These new distributed ASW ideas are strikingly similar to those tested aboard the Sara 50 years ago. Since there is no long-range ASW aircraft currently flying from our aircraft carrier decks and if we’re not going to introduce an ASW version of the MV-22 Osprey (which we should seriously reconsider), then maybe it’s time to go back to the future and have TACAIR do ASW once again. The Q-9/Predator-B series of aircraft are being tested for distributed ASW operations that are remarkably similar to what the Navy tested with manned tactical aircraft in the early 1970s. , General Atomics Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com Kevin Noonan Contributor A-6 Air Attack"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2021",Massive New Chinese Military Heliport Taking Shape Right Across From Taiwan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery shows significant progress on the construction of what is, by every indication, a massive new military heliport in China very close to the Taiwan Strait. Continued work on the facility, which is around a half a mile from the water’s edge, only some 150 miles from Taiwan proper, and even closer to various islands that Taiwanese authorities control, comes amid a surge in charged rhetoric between officials in Beijing and their counterparts in both Taipei and Washington. This makes it strategically positioned to support any future operations to control the Strait or even invade Taiwan. Twitter user @detresfa_ , an independent open-source intelligence analyst who has worked as a consultant to The Intel Lab , an independent intelligence analysis group, first highlighted the recent developments at the facility in Fujian Province’s Zhangpu County last week. Work began at the site, the official name of which is unknown, sometime between May and June 2019, based on imagery The War Zone reviewed from Planet Labs. A general view of the new heliport under construction in Fujian Province’s Zhangpu County. A processing error in Google Earth has resulted in parts of the northeast end of the base being obscured by older imagery., Google Earth At present, the heliport has a single runway that is around 2,140 feet long, including a circular turnaround at its eastern end, as well as an adjacent flightline that is just under 6,000 feet in length, but relatively narrow. A satellite image, dated Feb. 18, 2021, which is available through Google Earth, seen above, shows 18 hangars, as well as nine more in various states of construction, along the ramp. Also visible are 10 helipads in an area to the northeast of the runway, as well as 17 additional spots marked by large squares painted on the tarmac, along the flightline. The latter boxes could be designated areas for starting-up helicopters, according to @detresfa_ . What appear to be three Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip-type helicopters, variants of which China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are known to operate , including in support of special operations forces , are seen parked at the base. A closer look at the runway, flightline, hangars, and helipads at the heliport as of Feb. 18, 2021. Three Mi-8/M-17-type helicopters are visible on the ramp., Google Earth Chinese special operations forces personnel load onto an Mi-17 helicopter during a parachute training exercise in 2019., China Military Online The exact operational state of the base is unclear. What appear to be various administrative buildings, barracks, and similar structures to the southwest of the main heliport are clearly still very much under construction. Particularly apparent in the Feb. 18 image is the lack of any substantial, improved roadways linking that part of the facility to the flightline. A closer look at other supporting infrastructure at the base, as of Feb. 18, which is clearly very much still under construction., Google Earth At the same time, the runway is fully marked and appears to be available for operational use, at least to some degree. Planet Labs’ archive includes multiple low-resolution images taken in the past four months alone that show varying numbers of small dark spots on the flightline, which could be helicopters. Images from December 2020 show what could be as many as 20 helicopters at the facility at once. Even with limited operational flightline facilities, this new heliport in Zhangpu County could be a valuable training site, as well as an intermediate staging point for actual operations around the Taiwan Strait. The base’s overall strategic location is obvious when put into context of its distance from Taiwan proper, as well as various outlying islands that authorities in Taipei maintain control over. The heliport is only around 150 miles from Taiwan itself. It is just under 50 miles southwest of Kinmen County , a pair of islands administered by the government in Taipei, which is extremely close to the Chinese mainland, to begin with. The base is also just over 110 miles from Penghu County , another set of islands in the Taiwan Strait that officials in Taipei oversee. It is around 240 miles northeast of the Dongsha Islands , situated in the northern end of the South China Sea , which are themselves of extreme strategic significance to the government in Taiwan. A map showing the general location of the new Chinese heliport, marked in red, in relation to the Kinmen County (to the northeast), Penghu County (to the east in the Taiwan Strait), and the Dongsha Islands (to the southwest), as well as Taiwan itself., Google Maps From the facility in Zhangpu County, the PLA could launch large airmobile operations involving dozens of helicopters directed at any one of these locations, including as part of a broader campaign to take control of Taiwan or any of the outlying areas that authorities there control, on relatively short notice. The facility could potentially support other types of helicopters, as well. For example, it could give anti-submarine types a particularly useful base of operations on land from which to conduct operations out of the Taiwan Strait, as well as the northern tip of the South China Sea. Taiwan is currently in the process of modernizing its submarine capabilities . In addition, while the work on the runway appears to be largely finished, its existing size, as well as the associated flightline facilities, could also be sufficient for supporting operations involving various longer-range drones now in PLA service, too. The location of the base would be well-positioned for launching unmanned aircraft to conduct more persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions in and around the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese media reports have suggested that the base might grow to support large, manned fixed-wing combat aircraft. However, @detresfa_ , the open-source intelligence analyst, told The War Zone that it is unlikely that the base is suitable, at least in its present configuration, for combat jets or other manned fixed-wing planes. The runway, in particular, lacks large turnarounds and other support features typically associated with the operation of those kinds of aircraft. Regardless of what kinds of missions the base might be designed to support, and even though construction began two years ago, the steady work there, plus the indications of increasingly routine helicopter activity already, are significant developments. This all comes at a time when friction between Chinese authorities and their counterparts in Taiwan, as well as between Beijing and Washington, is at a notable high point. “I worry that they’re accelerating their ambitions to supplant the United States and our leadership role in the rules-based international order, which they’ve long said that they want to do that by 2050. I’m worried about them moving that target closer,” U.S. Navy Admiral Phil Davidson, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the top American military command in the Pacific region, told members of Congress last week. “Taiwan is clearly one of their ambitions before then. And I think the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact in the next six years.” It’s no secret that China is prepared to invade and seize control of Taiwan, which officials in Beijing view as a rogue province, by force if authorities on the island attempt to declare total independence from the mainland. Zhurihe Training Base, one of the PLA’s premier training centers, situated in Inner Mongolia, has expansive urban training facilities, some of which are clearly surrogates for actual government buildings, including the Presidential Office Building, in Taipei. You can read more about Zhurihe in this past War Zone feature . An image showing Chinese troops assaulting a structure at the Zhurihe Training Base that is clearly meant to simulate the Presidential Office Building in Taipei., Chinese State Media Tensions have already been ratcheting up following Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen’s election victory in January 2020. After securing this second term as the island’s top elected official, she declared plans to pursue changes in Taiwan’s constitution that could be seen as pushing toward formal independence. Since then, China and Taiwan have carried out a multitude of tit-for-tat exercises in the air and at sea in and around the Taiwan Strait. The United States has also stepped up military activity in the region , prompting additional Chinese responses . The U.S. government does not officially recognize the government in Taiwan as independent, but reserves the right to engage with it diplomatically and support its military , including through the approval of major arms sales , until the final status of the island is formalized. Li Keqiang, the Premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, decried what he called “collusion” between Taipei and Washington while speaking at the start of an annual meeting of the country’s parliament earlier this month. “We will remain highly vigilant against and resolutely deter any separatist activity seeking Taiwan independence.” Chinese Premier Li Keqiang speaks before the country’s parliament in March 2021., AP/Andy Wong In line with statements like that and other signals emanating from Beijing, experts and observers have notably raised concerns recently about the possibility that the Chinese government might seek to test American resolve by seizing the outlying Dongsha Islands from Taiwan. Areas southwest of Taiwan proper, separating it from the Dongsha Islands, have seen a significant increase in PLA air activity , as well as maritime maneuvering , in recent months. “The top uniformed soldier in China, chairman of China’s Central Military Commission, stated that war with the United States is inevitable,” U.S. Army Major General Richard Coffman, head of the service’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team, said at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies last week. “If you are the head uniformed general in the Chinese military and you say ‘it’s inevitable,’ what does that mean? I think that means that you are willing to strike first because, if it’s inevitable, why would you wait for your adversary to strike first?” It’s worth noting that Coffman was referring to People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) General Xu Qiliang, the Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, warning about the need for the PLA to be prepared for a “Thucydides Trap,” a term used to describe inevitable conflicts between rising and established powers, during the aforementioned annual meeting of China’s parliament. Xu does not appear to have mentioned the United States specifically, though it is hard to see who else he could have been implying a conflict with as a result of a Thucydides Trap. It’s also not clear whether the PLAAF officer believes that such a situation, and the implicit inevitable conflict, exists right now between Beijing and Washington, or is simply a potential future risk the Chinese military needs to be on guard for. General Xu Qiliang, the Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, during a visit to Russia in 2015., Office of the President of Russia Whatever the case, the United States and China are clearly in the midst of a period of immense geopolitical friction over a host of issues , including Taiwan, but also having to do with territorial disputes, especially in the South China Sea , as well as disagreements over international trade issues and simmering tensions over the matter of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its origins . Taiwanese officials, as noted, are increasingly butting heads with their counterparts in Beijing, as well. The expanding size and scope of PLA capabilities, as well as associated infrastructure, such as the highly strategic heliport now in the latter stages of construction in Zhangpu County, and the response to those developments, only seem to be pushing the parties toward further escalation, at least in terms of rhetoric and military signaling, in the near-term.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 12, 2021",Taiwan’s Upgraded F-16V Fighter Jets Poised To Start Standing Alert Along The Taiwan Strait,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan, the first operator of upgraded F-16V fighter jets , has reportedly declared an initial combat capability for the aircraft and has already begun actively training with them. The upgrade program is now well underway, with more than 22 modernized F-16Vs said to have been delivered to the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Chiayi Air Force Base in southwest Taiwan, where the jets are reportedly close to being placed on active alert duty, ready to intercept potential threats to the island. According to a recent report from Taiwan’s NOWNews , officials from the country’s air force, which is officially called the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF), have said they will host a ceremony later this month to mark the introduction of the F-16V into service. That ceremony is scheduled to be attended by President Tsai Ing-wen, but in the meantime, the F-16V has already been deemed ready for limited combat operations. It is a significant step toward the modernization of the ROCAF, the F-16 being by far the most capable fighter asset in its current inventory and helping the far smaller air force to keep technological pace with Beijing’s own rapidly developing airpower capabilities . A two-seat ROCAF F-16B during a highway exercise in Taiwan., AP The ROCAF reportedly now plans to start using the F-16s — alongside F-CK-1 Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDF) — for air defense missions in the southwest of the country, where they will be tasked with intercepting Chinese People’s Liberation Army aircraft entering its southwest Air Defense Identification Zone , or ADIZ. ROCAF F-16B (foreground) and F-CK-1 fighters., ROCAF The 4th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) has now upgraded more than 60 percent of its fleet. Originally, Taiwan planned to convert 142 of its existing F-16A/B jets to the much more capable F-16V standard, a number since reduced by one through attrition. Indeed, accidents have curtailed the operations of the non-upgraded F-16 fleet in the recent past, including a fleet-wide grounding last November after one of the jet was lost during a training mission. Taiwan’s plans to upgrade its F-16s date back over a decade and the U.S. Congress was first notified of a planned Foreign Military Sale back in September 2011, then valued at an estimated $5.3 billion. Among the new equipment specified were active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, the Link 16 tactical data link, new mission computers, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), and night-vision goggles (NVGs). In October 2012, Lockheed Martin received a $1.85-billion contract for the upgrade work and the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) was chosen the following year. The project was struck a blow, however, when the U.S. Air Force abandoned its parallel Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES) program to upgrade its own F-16s, forcing Taiwan to take on additional test-related costs. Lockheed Martin upgraded the initial two ROCAF F-16A/Bs, the first of which took to the air in October 2015, and these served as prototypes, while subsequent modernization work has been undertaken in Taiwan by the Aerospace Industry Development Center (AIDC). The domestic upgrade effort has not proceeded as quickly as hoped, with software testing delays meaning that AIDC only began work on the first four F-16s in early 2017, with a first test flight the following year. Since then, the previous Trump administration in the United States has approved the sale of an additional 66 new-build Block 70 F-16C/D jets , which have a similar general configuration to the F-16V, to Taiwan. This deal was among a raft of other defense sales to the island nation that were part of efforts to expand the U.S. government’s relationship with authorities in Taipei. Taiwan’s plans to acquire more new-build F-16s actually date back even further than the F-16V upgrade program, with a request to Washington as long ago as 2006. This and other requests were turned down, until the Trump administration finally consented in 2019, approving a package worth an estimated $8 billion. An infographic showing a supposed new-build F-16 Block 70 for Taiwan configuration, including conformal fuel tanks. , ROCAF While the first of the new-build Block 70 F-16C/Ds are scheduled to arrive in 2023, in the meantime, the ROCAF’s upgraded F-16Vs (which it refers to as the F-16A/B Block 20 MLU) are set to play a vital role, not only for air defense but also for a range of offensive missions, including anti-shipping, for which they can be armed with the AGM-84 Harpoon missile . The importance of airpower assets to patrol Taiwan’s ADIZ is reflected by the recent intense activity here, including a notable uptick in Chinese military aviation movements in this area of the northern end of the South China Sea just earlier this year. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense announced that eight Chinese aircraft, including fighter jets , maritime patrol, and surveillance types, had flown into the southwestern corner of the ADIZ in a two-day period, from January 31 to February, an episode that you can read more about here . A ROCAF F-16A escorts a People’s Liberation Army Air Force H-6 bomber., ROCAF The strategic backdrop to this is Beijing’s continued claims on Taiwan, which it sees as an integral part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened military action if officials there declare full independence from the mainland. Meanwhile, the United States has officially pursued a “one China” policy that falls short of recognizing Taiwan’s independence, but which includes engaging with its officials and supporting the Taiwanese armed forces. Should there ever be open conflict between China and Taiwan, the respective aviation elements would be expected to play a major role, with the far smaller ROCAF expected to try and use its airpower alongside coastal defense cruise missiles, multiple rocket launchers, and attack helicopters to counter a potential invasion force. Air defense operations by the ROCAF would seek to protect the critical command and control infrastructure, early-warning radars , airstrips , and air defense batteries that would likely bear the brunt of China’s offensive operations. While the South China Sea is itself hotly contested, with Beijing making expansive claims over most of this body of water, the situation is also made more complicated by Beijing’s establishment of man-made island outposts in the area, many of which include ground-based anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as part of a wider anti-access and area denial posture. The challenges involved in defending Taiwan are clearly enormous, but the fielding of the upgraded F-16V — and the forthcoming arrival of new-build aircraft of the same type — will at least ensure that the country’s air force can continue to modernize in the face of a growing military challenge from Beijing.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bombers joined a pair of B-1B Lancer bombers for a mission off the coast of Iceland yesterday, taking part in what the Air Force described as “long-range integration in the High North.” The Spirits had flown from their base in the United States to the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic, before joining up with the Lancers that are currently on a first-time deployment to Norway, also a NATO member, which you can read all about here . The three B-2s from the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, arrived at Lajes Field in the Azores, an important mid-Atlantic staging post, on March 16. From there, after a “hot pit” refuel and crew swap, they met up with the B-1Bs from the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas. These Lancers are currently operating out of Norway’s Ørland Main Air Station, but have also ventured further north in that country, visiting Bodø Main Air Station above the Arctic Circle for the first time earlier this month. A B-1B assigned to the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron takes off from Ørland, Norway, on March 14, for a previous Bomber Task Force training mission., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Colin Hollowell At least some of this latest Bomber Task Force (BTF) mission was flown under the cover of darkness, allowing the B-1B and B-2 crews to practice “the skills necessary to fly effective night operations in a new environment,” according to an Air Force press release . “Bomber Task Force missions are critical to maintaining our global competitive edge,” Air Force Lieutenant General Stephen Basham, the Deputy Commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), said. “The importance of providing airmen the opportunity to train in unique environments can’t be overstated.” It also seems that the Air Force plans to make more use of Lajes Field for distributed bomber operations in the future. While this is not the first time the stealth bombers have been there, “the B-2s will rely on the strategically-located Lajes Field to perform mission-essential tasks during several upcoming BTF sorties,” the service confirmed in a press release. The wider job of BTF missions is to make visible the United States’ commitment to the NATO alliance as well as signal to potential enemies the U.S. capability of extended deterrence — described as “a commitment to deter and, if necessary, to respond across the spectrum of potential nuclear and non-nuclear scenarios in defense of allies and partners.” In the context of the High North, the choice of two different aircraft types on a BTF mission was likely selected as a signal to Russia, not only across the strategically vital and increasingly contested Arctic region, but also in the Baltic and along Russia’s northwest borders in Eastern Europe, including the heavily militarized enclave of Kaliningrad . Although the four bombers remained a long way from Russian territory or key installations, their route did take them through the so-called Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom (GIUK) gap, a critical gateway between the North Atlantic and the Norwegian Sea that has been of considerable interest to the major powers in the region since the Cold War. Russian Navy ships , submarines , and long-range patrol aircraft routinely pass through here and Russian Aerospace Forces bombers also fly similar routes when headed toward Western Europe or the Mediterranean. A Cold War-era map showing the GIUK gap., CIA During their current deployment to Ørland, the B-1Bs have already conducted maneuvers with U.S. special operations forces Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTAC), as well as their counterparts from Norway and Sweden. Previous integration with other types has included operating with four JAS 39 Gripen fighter jets operated by Sweden, a key partner in the region, but one that is, unlike Norway, not a NATO member. One of the Lancers also made a debut visit to Poland , landing at Powidz on March 12 for another “hot pit” refueling, and integrating with more Swedish Gripens, plus Polish and Danish F-16s. As we have discussed before, the fact that B-1Bs are operating out of Ørland, although located around 300 miles from the Arctic Circle, is a significant development in BTF posture in itself, with detachments previously having used RAF Fairford in England, which serves as a dedicated bomber forward operating location in Europe. Having bombers in Norway brings them much closer to the Arctic region and also exploits the advantages of distributed operations , making the bombers less vulnerable and their missions less predictable. A crew chief assigned to the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron marshals a B-1B at Ørland on March 14., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Colin Hollowell As for the B-2, although the aircraft has deployed to Iceland in the past , back in 2019, amid efforts to increase the number of operating locations in the region for U.S. bombers, putting both types up together for a joint mission is a new development in the region. A B-2 escorted by 48th Fighter Wing F-15C Eagles from RAF Lakenheath in the U.K. during an Icelandic Air Policing mission in March last year., U.S. Air Force All this is happening against the backdrop of the Air Force’s Arctic Strategy that was unveiled last summer and which seeks to increase its footprint in the High North as a means to counter what’s perceived as the growing Russian threat in the region. As climate change brings with it opportunities to exploit natural resources, as well as new maritime trade routes, the Arctic region’s importance is only growing and, with it, the potential for confrontation between the relevant powers. Russian military activity in the region is now coordinated by the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command that was set up in 2014, and which covers operations in the Arctic, North Atlantic, and Scandinavia. Its most potent assets are the submarines and warships of the Northern Fleet, based on the Kola Peninsula, although Russian military aircraft, too, are now making more use of forward-located airfields in the High North. A Russian Northern Fleet MiG-31 interceptor at Rogachevo airbase, above the Arctic Circle , earlier this year., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE The combination of the B-1B, which offers long-range conventional strike capabilities using the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile , or JASSM, and the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile , or LRASM, together with the stealthy and nuclear-capable B-2 sends a very powerful message. Even in a non-nuclear role , the B-2 is still a key tool for the U.S. military to conduct very-long range strikes in denied areas, and being able to operate them from a diverse array of bases only increases the possibilities of how and where they could be used. Meanwhile, although the Air Force is now beginning to retire 17 of its B-1Bs, this aircraft, too, has an important place in future plans, not least in the context of carrying new hypersonic weapons . Having B-1Bs and B-2s operate together in the High North makes it abundantly clear that the United States is willing to bring some of its most powerful air assets to bear in the region should it have to confront Russian operations in these areas in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army and Air Force have offered new details about a test involving an AH-64E Apache attack helicopter firing an Israeli-made Spike-NLOS missile off the coast of Florida last month. The War Zone was first to report that this over-water launch had occurred in the course of our efforts to confirm a separate U.S. Navy Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile test . The Apache, flying from Eglin Air Force Base and with support from the 96th Test Wing there, successfully fired the Spike-NLOS — this acronym standing for non-line of sight — at a stationary boat approximately 20 miles away in the second week of February. A subsequent test to demonstrate the ability to engage a moving watercraft was canceled due to adverse weather conditions. An Army AH-64 Apache armed with a Spike-NLOS missile during earlier testing in 2019., US Army capture “We were excited to test a new weapon system here at Eglin,” Amanda Hargett, a test engineer with the Air Force’s 780th Test Squadron, said in a statement released today . “Our team worked closely with the Army to make sure everything went smoothly and the demonstration was successful.” “Modifications were made to the aircraft and the weapon was set up,” three days before the actual test launch, according to the Air Force. “Testers checked all flight and ground systems to make sure they were working correctly and with the weapon and any test telemetry added to the aircraft.” A Spike-NLOS missile on display with its pop-out wings in their deployed position, as it would appear after launch., Matti Blume via Wikimedia “The test teams went through rehearsals and performed practice shots” in the days leading up to the over-water test, the service added in its official release. “This benefited the pilots and test support teams to make sure everyone knew where to be and what would most likely happen during the actual test. It also ensured all systems were working in flight and allowed the team to plan for any unforeseen emergency procedures.” The Army has fired these missiles from AH-64s on multiple occasions since 2019 . Some of the service’s personnel had traveled to Israel that year to gain experience with these weapons while flying in Israeli Apaches, which have been employing Spike-NLOS operationally for years now. The test in February does appear to be the first for the Army involving a target in a maritime environment and came just over a year after the service formally announced its plans to integrate the weapons onto its AH-64Es. An Israeli AH-64D, known in that country by the name Saraf, with launchers for Spike-NLOS under its right stub wing., Oren Rozen via Wikimedia The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reportedly first began using the first generation of Spike-NLOS missile in 1981, but its existence was not publicly disclosed until decades later. It has since been exported to multiple other countries . In June 2020, Rafael announced it was developing a fifth-generation version of the weapon, with a maximum range of 20 miles. The previous iteration could only hit targets out to around 15 and a half miles away. Spike-NLOS’s most notable feature is its guidance system, which has two modes of operation. One of these allows it to simply strike fixed targets at designated coordinates. The other mode, however, is a so-called “man-in-the-loop” type in which an operator can make fine adjustments during the missile’s terminal phase of flight thanks to a video feed transmitted from an infrared camera in the weapon’s nose. This gives Spike-NLOS incredible accuracy, even against moving targets, and enables it to find its mark in bad weather or in parts of the battlefield obscured by smoke and dust, which could disrupt traditional laser or imaging seeker systems. As the weapon’s name implies, it also offers a way for the launch platform to engage targets beyond-line-of-sight, while also remaining as hidden as possible, especially when coupled with targeting information from off-board platforms. It also offers the operator a greater ability to more significantly shift the weapon’s point of impact, even very late in flight, should circumstances on the ground change, such as the sudden appearance of innocent bystanders in the target area. The weapon can even be used to search for an kill targets of opportunity far from where the launch platform is located. Regardless, the missile offers the launch platform huge flexibility and a big boost in survivability. The Army has already demonstrated the potential value of these capabilities in earlier testing. In August 2019, an Apache hiding on one side of a 1,600-foot-tall mountain at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona hit a surrogate for a Russian-made Pantsir-S1 point air defense system on the opposite slope with a Spike-NLOS. The helicopter remained largely concealed from and out of range of this simulated threat the entire time. An unspecified unmanned aircraft was used to first spot the target and then observe the strike. This would have been an impossible task for an AGM-114 Hellfire missile, the present primary longer-range weapon employed on the Army’s AH-64Es, as well as its successor, the AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM). The reported maximum ranges of the latest iterations of the Hellfire and the JAGM are between five and six miles, depending on the launch envelope. “The Spike-NLOS missile is employed differently than the Hellfire, which is one of the missiles the Army currently uses,” Army Chief Warrant Officer Five Sean Merrill, the Army’s lead test pilot and primary shooter during the August 2019 demonstration, said in a statement afterward. “I attended three training sessions at varying intervals leading up to the demonstration to learn these techniques and keep current on the methods.” The use of a boat as the target for this latest Army Spike-NLOS test is also notable and underscores the potential contributions of the service’s AH-64Es in a maritime context. For years now, the Army, in cooperation with the Navy, has been conducting exercises involving Apaches operating from various kinds of naval vessels . Using these helicopters to help defeat hostile small boat swarms, a very real threat, has been a major focus of this kind of training. The latest Version 6 configuration of the AH-64E already incorporates various upgrades meant to improve the helicopter’s maritime capabilities, among others, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Spike-NLOS, with its extended range and precision, would only expand the Apache’s capabilities in this regard, especially against small boats. It’s very possible that these missiles could find their way onto other Army helicopters , as well as other platforms , as time goes on and they could also be of interest to other services that are now looking for longer-range air and surface-launched munitions. It is important to note that the Army does not see Spike-NLOS as a replacement for either Hellfire or JAGM. The service envisages the weapon as complementary to those missiles and as a stepping stone to a planned future Long-Range Precision Munition (LRPM) that will arm future helicopters acquired as part of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) initiative. The Army’s FVL plans also include developing a family of air-launched unmanned platforms capable of performing various functions, ranging from intelligence-gathering to acting as loitering munitions , while operating as autonomous swarms . You can read more about that effort, known as the Air Launch Effect (ALE) program, in this past War Zone piece . ALEs configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions could be very useful for finding targets for AH-64s, or other platforms, to then engage with Spike-NLOS or the future LRPM. In the near-term, Spike-NLOS looks set to make the Army’s Apaches more lethal against targets on land and at sea.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 2, 2021",Pentagon Unveils Details On Effort To Equip Its Services With Massive Swarms Of Deadly Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has announced that one of its offices has completed planned research and development work on a number of unmanned swarming technologies and has now turned them over to the U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps to support various follow-on programs. The systems in question are the Block 3 version of Raytheon’s Coyote unmanned aircraft and an associated launcher, a jam-resistant datalink, and a software package to enable the aforementioned drones to operate as an autonomous swarm. These developments give us a glimpse into what has been a fairly opaque, integrated development effort to field lower-end swarming drones across the services that leverages common components. All of these technologies were developed under the auspices of the Low-Cost Cruise Missile (LCCM) effort, led by the Pentagon’s Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program office. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Office of Naval Research (ONR) were also directly involved in the project, which dates back at least to 2017. While Raytheon led the development of the Coyote and its launcher, L3Harris was the prime contractor for the datalink, and the Georgia Tech Research Institute at the Georgia Institute of Technology headed up work on the “autonomy software module.” A graphic depicting the sequence of a Coyote Block 1 drone deploying from a launcher on a ship., Raytheon “This successful transition shows the great value of the JCTD program,” Jon Lazar, Acting Director of Prototypes and Experiments within the JCTD, who is also the head of the Rapid Reaction Technology Office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, said in a statement released on March 16, 2021. “By working closely with our industry partners and combatant command operators, we delivered needed capabilities that will enhance the warfighter’s ability to accomplish their missions.” Readily available details about the LCCM project are limited. It “provides a decentralized autonomy capability for low-cost, conventional air-launched cruise missiles that will enable joint access and maneuver in the global commons,” according to the Pentagon’s 2019 Fiscal Year budget request “It will be capable of conducting networked integrated attacks, in-flight dynamic retargeting/reallocation and synchronized cooperative/saturation attacks.” “Flight demonstrations will be conducted using surrogate weapon platforms and will provide residual leave-behind payloads for transition to a full weapon system development program,” it continued. “FY 2017 funds were used to begin production of LCCM air vehicles.” The bulk of entry on the Low-Cost Cruise Missile project from the Pentagon’s 2019 Fiscal Year budget request. The entry briefly continues onto the following page to say that the “FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement” is “None.”, DOD The press release regarding the transition of the technologies says that multiple “flight tests and operational demonstrations” were conducted at the U.S. Army’s Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona in 2018 and 2019. “In the final operational demonstration in 2020, multiple cruise missiles were pneumatically launched in a matter of minutes,” it adds. “The swarm of LCCM vehicles then dynamically reacted to a prioritized threat environment while conducting collaborative target identification and allocation along with synchronized attacks,” the release continues. “The LCCM project also enabled significant improvement in understanding the relationship between communications and autonomy in collaborative vehicles.” Given that the earlier budget document says that at least some testing would be conducted using “surrogate” systems, it’s unclear how much of this testing involved the Block 3 Coyote design, as well as the iterations of the datalink and autonomy software, which have now been transitioned to various branches of the U.S. military. It’s also worth noting that the exact configuration of that unmanned aircraft is unclear. The Block 2 type, which Raytheon publicly unveiled in 2018, has a completely different planform and propulsion system from the original Block 1, which first flew in 2007. You can read more about these two earlier versions, both of which can be configured to serve in a wide variety of roles, in this past War Zone piece . Calling any variant of the Coyote a “cruise missile” is certainly interesting in itself and highlights the often blurry distinction between certain unmanned aircraft designs and traditional missiles . A Block 1 Coyote drone., Raytheon A Coyote Block 2., Joseph Trevithick The Pentagon has only provided a few details about how the technology developed will now be leveraged Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. For instance, the press release just said that the Block 3 Coyote would form “the baseline for numerous follow-on activities and programs within the Navy, Air Force, and Army.” We do know what at least one of these other projects is thanks to a contracting announcement the Navy issued in February, which called for the acquisition of Block 3 Coyotes configured as loitering munitions, commonly known as “suicide drones,” that could operate in swarms after being launched from unmanned surface and undersea vehicles , or USVs and UUVs. You can read more about what we know about that project in this previous War Zone piece . We also know that ONR has experimented with swarms of Block 1 Coyotes as part of its Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology program, or LOCUST , and that the Air Force has also tested those drones, including in an air-launched environment from AC-130 gunships . In 2018, the Army also announced it would buy Block 2 Coyotes for use as counter-drone interceptors . The video below of a LOCUST demonstration that ONR conducted in 2016 is the source for the image used at the top of this story. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo The Pentagon’s description of the LCCM project also raises questions about its possible relation to other ONR efforts, including various “Super Swarm” experiments. Last year, that Navy office disclosed it had conducted a “record-setting effort [that] simultaneously launched 1,000 unmanned aerial vehicles out of a C-130 and demonstrated behaviors critical to future super swarm employment” known as the “Close-in Covert Autonomous Disposable Aircraft super swarm.” Similarly, the Army is now looking to develop an entire family of air-launched swarming drones with various capabilities as part of its Air Launch Effects (ALE) program. Coyote Block 3, coupled with the other technologies developed under LCCM, certainly sounds like it could have the potential to meet many of the ALE requirements . In 2017, the same year the Pentagon says work began to build actual air vehicles for the LCCM project, AFRL also initiated its own low-cost swarming cruise missile program, called Gray Wolf . That Air Force effort was canceled in 2019, with the focus shifting toward a related AFRL program, known as Golden Horde , which is developing technologies to enable various munitions to operate as networked swarms. Golden Horde flight tests , which began late last year , have been demonstrating capabilities that sound virtually identical to the LCCM’s stated objectives of exploring “networked integrated attacks, in-flight dynamic retargeting/reallocation and synchronized cooperative/saturation attacks.” This is perhaps not surprising since the Pentagon says that this Air Force program will be one of the beneficiaries of the datalink and the autonomy module from the LCCM effort. An F-16D Viper fighter jet drops modified GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs during a Golden Horde test earlier in 2021., USAF The datalink will also be used in “several spiral development programs,” according to the Pentagon. The autonomy software “will transition to the Marine Corps Long-Range Unmanned Surface Vehicle Program of Record and MITRE ’s Simulation Experiments along with several Air Force and Navy spiral development programs,” the press release added. In January, the Marines choose Louisiana-based shipbuilder Metal Shark to develop the Long-Range Unmanned Surface Vehicle (LRUSV), which the company described as a “tiered, scalable weapons system [that] will provide the ability to accurately track and destroy targets at range throughout the battle space,” in a press release. “While fully autonomous, the vessels may be optionally manned and they will carry multiple payloads, which they will be capable of autonomously launching and retrieving,” it continued, adding that loitering munitions would be part of the LRUSV’s arsenal. That specific element of the LRUSV effort sounds very similar in many respects to the Navy’s aforementioned plans to acquire Block 3 Coyotes configured as suicide drones for employment from other unmanned platforms. It’s certainly no secret that the U.S. military, as a whole, is increasingly interested in unmanned swarming capabilities of various kinds, well beyond even the various programs mentioned already in this piece. Swarms, which are also gaining traction among military forces around the world , inherently have the ability to overwhelm, disorient, and confuse opponents. This makes swarms of drones particularly ideal for targeting enemy air defense networks, but they are just as applicable against other ground targets and in maritime environments , where they could potentially knock out the ability of warships to continue the fight. Swarms also present novel ways to potentially reduce costs, since not every unmanned vehicle within one would have to be configured in the same way with the same capabilities. Certain platforms might be equipped with sensor packages to locate targets, while others could carry other payloads, such as electronic warfare packages or high-explosive warheads, to actually engage those threats. Advanced autonomous capabilities, supported by developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning , would enable the various elements of a swarm to apply their individual capabilities in the most effective manner and rapidly shift their focus to respond to pop-up threats and other changes in the battlespace. All told, even from the limited information we have about this Pentagon project, it underscores the scope and scale of swarming programs across the rest of the U.S. military and looks to be an important link between many of them. A multitude of existing and future programs now look set to leverage the technologies developed under the LCCM effort as future unmanned swarms continue to take shape across the services.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Rainbow Canyon, also known by its nickname “Star Wars Canyon,” or the Jedi Transition — its designation on flight maps—was a mecca for military aircraft of all types and photographers that loved capturing them in action. The steep crevasse located near Death Valley in California gave pilots an ideal and exhilarating funnel to drop down into and maneuver in before being spit out in the Panamint Valley. Over the years, before the route was restricted due to a deadly crash of a Super Hornet that slammed into the canyon’s southern wall in 2019, we saw some spectacular runs . While fighter jets got the most attention , other types also made jaw-dropping runs, including C-17 Globemaster airlifters. Case in point these crazy photographs . Now, for the first time, at least to our knowledge, we get to see what the Star Wars Canyon looked like from inside the big cargo jet’s cockpit. The video would have been shot before the July 2019 crash that led to the low-level run being effectively shut down by lifting its minimum altitude far above the canyon walls. It shows the C-17, from a unit out of Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, approaching the canyon before diving into it in a steep left bank, then the pilot maneuvers hard, nearly on the knife-edge, inside the canyon’s snaking ravine. The video really does offer a new sense of just how ‘sporty’ Star Wars Canyon was. You can see how close the terrain was off the cargo hauler’s right side towards the end of the run. The continuous altitude and sink rate warnings are also an ominous touch. The same poster also provided a dramatic video shot from the ground along the canyon’s rim as the C-17 drops into it. Most people probably don’t realize that C-17s do a lot of low-level training, but the Jedi Transition was a bit of a ‘unique’ e-ticket ride. This video is now a relic of a time gone by. While there has been some chatter that the 1,500-foot altitude restriction will be lifted over the canyon, that hasn’t come to pass and likely won’t for the foreseeable future. At least we have awesome videos like this to remember the place by! Hat tip to @PaintingSurfer for the heads up.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 14, 2021",Parachute Snag Leaves Russian Soldier Dangling Perilously From Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a scenario that will make nightmarish viewing for anyone for whom jumping out of an aircraft already doesn’t seem like a good idea, a parachutist became entangled with the helicopter they were leaping out of, high above an airfield in Russia. Fortunately, in this case, the helicopter seems to have safely returned them to the ground. Videos began to circulate today showing the immediate aftermath of the parachutist’s ill-fated jump from the Russian Aerospace Forces Mil Mi-8 Hip helicopter , by which time both their main parachute and the pilot chute used to deploy it were already seemingly snagged somewhere around the rear door, as they dangled helplessly below. It is unclear if the soldier was using a static line method, in which the parachute opens automatically, or if they were attempting to jump freefall, in which they would initiate the pull sequence. Other personnel gather around on the airfield as the paratrooper returns to the ground, still dangling from the helicopter., via Telegram According to an account by a user who posted one of the videos to the Russian Telegram social media site, the incident took place at around 10:30 AM local time today. Video of the Mi-8 helicopter landing the parachutist whose parachute became entangled on the helicopter. 3/ https://t.co/aZ1DEADhlh pic.twitter.com/8RZxHpWrLH — Rob Lee (@RALee85) March 16, 2021 “I look up and see a chopper 2,000 meters [around 6,500 feet] above the ground, but very strange — with a line and a dot at the end,” the same account continues. “The speed of the chopper is about 200 kilometers per hour [124 miles per hour]. Outside is minus 20 degrees Celsius [minus 4 Fahrenheit] for sure, and this is serious frostbite.” Exactly how the incident happened is unclear, since the parachute should not start to open until the parachutist is well clear of the aircraft. It is even conceivable that the unfortunate parachutist might have jumped from one of the side doors at the front of the cabin, rather than from the rear, before becoming entangled somewhere around the rear fuselage. It could also have been the case that the pilot chute became snagged on leaving the aircraft, a scenario you can see occur in this video , also involving a Mi-8, but with multiple parachutists. It was, in fact, probably very lucky that they did get entangled on this occasion, since their parachute was likely no longer operable once it had become caught up with the aircraft. It is unclear if it was good fortune alone that kept them attached as the helicopter slowly made its descent to the airfield, or if there was some other way of securing them, perhaps using the bridle — the cord used to connect the pilot chute to the canopy. Since they would presumably have had a back-up parachute, it would suggest that they were so firmly entangled that there was no way of releasing themselves and using an alternative canopy. A parachutist in Chita got his parachute snagged on the tail of a Mi-8 helicopter after he jumped. The helicopter safely brought him to the ground. https://t.co/c5Oec9c1Hv pic.twitter.com/FLl5uuUw1M — Rob Lee (@RALee85) March 16, 2021 Certainly, however, the incident could have been much worse. In one tragic Indian Air Force Mi-17 accident in 2007 a parachute used to deliver a cargo load came adrift and became entangled in the rotors, leading to a crash that killed all seven soldiers on board. Today’s incident occurred in Chita, in Zabaykalsky Krai, in the Russian Far East. Chita Cheryomushki Air Base, also known as Chita Northwest, is home to the Russian Aerospace Forces’ 112th Independent Helicopter Regiment that operates two squadrons of the latest Mi-8AMTSh assault transport helicopters and another squadron of Mi-24P Hind attack helicopters . However, the helicopter involved in the incident appears to be an older Mi-8 model, lacking the characteristic “dolphin nose” of the Mi-8AMTSh. Mi-8s and Mi-17s of all types regularly used by both military paratroopers (as seems to be the case here) as well as private skydiving clubs around the world. With capacity for up to 32 parachutists, the Mi-8 is a popular choice for this kind of activity and is regularly used for delivering airborne troops and special forces paratroopers in Russia, although the latter also use other, less conventional means of delivery , too. While an investigation will now surely be taking place to find out exactly what went wrong in this scenario, we should be thankful that the parachutist apparently escaped serious injury and the helicopter crew was able to return them to the ground before anything much worse might have happened.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Mar 15, 2021",The UK Says It Could Now Use Nuclear Weapons Against Threats From “Emerging Technologies”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United Kingdom has unveiled a revised strategic posture, which includes potentially using its own submarine-based nuclear deterrent in response to not only threats presented by weapons of mass destruction but also by other threats from “emerging technologies.” The shift was announced today by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who also confirmed plans to increase the upper limit on U.K. warhead numbers, as The War Zone has previously discussed . The U.K.’s Integrated Review of Security, Defense, Development and Foreign Policy, subtitled Global Britain in a Competitive Age, was published today as the first of a two-part defense review covering the years through 2025. As well as the fact that the country’s stockpile of nuclear weapons is set to increase for the first time since the Cold War, the report provides insight into intriguing changes to the country’s nuclear posture. An officer of the watch aboard the Royal Navy nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine HMS Vanguard ., Crown Copyright The review states that a previous ambition to reduce the overall nuclear warhead stockpile ceiling from not more than 225 to not more than 180 by the mid-2020s “is no longer possible” due to changes in the security environment, “including the developing range of technological and doctrinal threats.” As a result, the U.K. will, in the future, have an overall nuclear weapons stockpile of no more than 260 warheads to arm the Trident missiles used aboard its four nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), one of which is always on patrol. On the other hand, and contradictorily, the U.K. remains officially committed to Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 1968 (NPT), an international agreement that aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology. Some experts and observers have raised questions about whether the U.K. plans actually violate the country’s commitment to the NPT. Regardless, the Integrated Review points to the continuing threat posed by major nuclear-armed states, emerging nuclear states, and state-sponsored nuclear terrorism. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0FZYeVM7ucY “Some states are now significantly increasing and diversifying their nuclear arsenals ,” the report reads. “They are investing in novel nuclear technologies and developing new ‘warfighting’ nuclear systems which they are integrating into their military strategies and doctrines and into their political rhetoric to seek to coerce others.” On top of these previously identified risks to the U.K., the review also mentions “potentially disruptive technologies” as an additional threat to strategic stability and to the U.K. itself. The Vanguard class submarine HMS Victorious ., Crown Copyright With this in mind, the U.K. confirms it will “not use, or threaten to use” nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear-weapon state party to the NPT Treaty. However, this assurance does not apply to states in material breach of NPT obligations. Furthermore, the U.K. says it will “reserve the right to review this assurance if the future threat of weapons of mass destruction, such as chemical and biological capabilities, or emerging technologies that could have a comparable impact, makes it necessary.” This signals a change compared to previous stated U.K. nuclear policy, which was restricted to use against states using or threatening to use weapons of mass destruction (WMD) — or nuclear, radiological, chemical, or biological weapons. In 2002, the government asserted that it would be prepared to use nuclear weapons against “rogue states” if they were to employ WMD against British troops. In terms of rhetoric, that was apparently aimed at Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the run-up to the invasion of that country in 2003, although Iran, Libya, and North Korea were also identified as “states of concern.” At this time, however, it is notable that the government did not consider that any terrorist group had access to WMD. Only weeks before British troops entered Iraq, the then U.K. Minister of Defense Geoff Hoon reiterated that Saddam Hussein could “be absolutely confident” the United Kingdom was willing to use nuclear weapons “in the right conditions.” “We have always made it clear that we would reserve the right to use nuclear weapons in conditions of extreme self-defense,” Hoon added. The Trident missile tubes on the SSBN HMS Victorious ., Crown Copyright Under the current Conservative administration in the United Kingdom, the issue of employing the nuclear deterrent has at times been more politically charged. The party has used the reluctance among some of its Labour Party rivals to commit to a “first strike” option as evidence of their lack of suitability to govern. The then Minister of Defense Michael Fallon said in 2017 that the then Prime Minister Theresa May would be willing to launch nuclear weapons as a “first strike” if necessary, under “the most extreme circumstances,” even if the U.K. itself was not under nuclear attack. Fallon did not discuss the circumstances in which a pre-emptive nuclear strike may be an option, pointing instead to the importance of leaving “uncertainty in the mind of anyone who might be thinking of using weapons against this country.” When pressed again on the matter in parliament by Caroline Lucas, leader of the Green Party, in 2017, Fallon said that the U.K. “has neither a first use nor a no first use policy for our nuclear weapons.” Officers of the watch maintain a compass on HMS Vanguard ., Crown Copyright Again, up to now, all talk of the use of the United Kingdom’s nuclear weapons has been based on either a nuclear or WMD threat, against which a “first strike” has been considered a potential option. Now, with the latest review, this list of threats has been expanded to include “emerging technologies.” Although there is no explanation as to what these might consist of, the statement likely refers to cyber, artificial intelligence (AI), and space threats. Of these, cyber and AI threats, in particular, are widely seen as among the preeminent strategic issues of our age, and it is likely that the review is referring to these, albeit obliquely. Cyber attacks could include anything from illicit finance or coercive economic measures to disinformation or electoral interference and, potentially most damagingly, attacks against critical infrastructure. AI, for its part, might eventually encompass threats posed by autonomous machines and the introduction of warfare dictated by machines that can far outpace the decision cycles of their human counterparts. Space-based threats also feature prominently in the review. In the past, The War Zone has, for example, looked at the threats posed to satellites in low Earth orbit by nuclear weapons within the reach of states like North Korea . However, conventional capabilities could also present major threats to space-based assets, of the kind that the U.K. is now beginning to develop . The debris cloud left after an Indian anti-satellite test in 2019 provides an indication of the kind of threat that could emanate from a non-nuclear attack on space assets. Lucy Fisher, the Deputy Political Editor for the Daily Telegraph cites an unnamed government source who states that those “emerging technologies” include cyber , artificial intelligence, encryption, and laser directed-energy weapons , although it is not immediately clear how all of those would pose an existential threat worthy of nuclear brinkmanship, let alone nuclear relation. Like the circumstances in which the United Kingdom might deem the use, or threatened use, of nuclear weapons appropriate, the wording around the revised list of threats is deliberately ambiguous. For that reason, too, it is potentially concerning since “emerging technologies” is a very broad category. On the other hand, the review states that the United Kingdom would only use nuclear weapons “in extreme circumstances of self-defense, including the defense of our NATO allies.” Therefore, whatever “emerging technology” was being used to threaten the United Kingdom, or attack it, would have to be as potentially damaging as a nuclear or another type of WMD attack. By the same token, it is not stated that any attack on a NATO ally of the United Kingdom would necessarily result in the use, or threatened use, of nuclear weapons by way of response. Clearly, the United Kingdom has revised its nuclear posture to deter what it sees as current and emerging threats, although equally, it has made great efforts to ensure “deliberate ambiguity.” Indeed, the review states that the U.K. will no longer release numbers relating to its operational stockpile, deployed warheads, or deployed missile numbers, to “complicate the calculations of potential aggressors.” With all that in mind, it remains very unclear when, and how, the United Kingdom would ever be drawn to using its nuclear deterrent in the future, either as a bargaining tool or as a weapon in its own right.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 2, 2021",Air Force Wants To Give Its F-15s Game-Changing Cognitive Electronic Warfare Capabilities,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking to add new “cognitive” capabilities that leverage artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning, into electronic warfare systems now in development for various versions of the F-15, a concept known broadly as cognitive electronic warfare. Though the service has not identified any particular electronic warfare suites it is looking to improve in this way, the forthcoming Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS , for its existing F-15E Strike Eagles and new F-15EXs would appear to be the most likely candidate. Cognitive electronic warfare, as a general concept, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , seeks to automate and otherwise speed up various aspects of electronic warfare, including the rapid development of new countermeasures, possibly in real-time. The Air Force Life Cycle Manager Center (AFLCMC) at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio issued the contracting notice relating to adding cognitive electronic warfare capabilities onto F-15 variants on March 11, 2021. The F-15 Program Office is interested in “cognitive (artificial intelligence/machine learning) EW [electronic warfare] capabilities … that can be fielded in the next two years and incrementally improved upon and integrated into EW systems currently in development for the F-15,” according to that announcement. A US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle equipped with EPAWSS links up with a KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tanker during an exercise., USAF This aligns well with the schedule, as we know it now, for the development and fielding of EPAWSS , which will eventually be standard on Air Force F-15E and F-15EX aircraft. Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) of EPAWSS is set to begin in 2023, which is then expected to lead to a decision about whether or not to begin full-rate production of those electronic warfare suites the following year. EPAWSS is an all-digital self-protection system intended to replace the existing AN/ALQ-135 Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) found on the F-15E. While its exact capabilities are highly sensitive, we know that the new suite can detect, categorize, and geolocate various kinds of electromagnetic emissions, including those from hostile radars. It can then prioritize which ones present the biggest threats and then employ its jammers and other countermeasures against them. “Providing both offensive and defensive electronic warfare options for the pilot and aircraft, EPAWSS offers fully integrated radar warning, geolocation, situational awareness, and self-protection solutions to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats in signal-dense contested and highly contested environments,” according to the manufacturer , BAE Systems. EPAWSS “takes advantages of today’s computing, receiver and transmitter technologies to provide a quicker, smarter response to the threats and better actionable information to the pilot,” Ed Sabat, the Project Development Lead and Civilian Director of Operations at the 772nd Test Squadron, said about the system in 2020. By every indication, EPAWSS already functions in a highly automated manner. This would make it ideally suited to the integration of cognitive electronic warfare capabilities. “Cognitive electronic support and electronic attack technologies will investigate/resolve challenges of adaptive, agile, ambiguous, and out of library complex emitters that coexist with background (signals that are not the primary signal of interest) signal challenges,” the AFLCMC’s contracting notice said. “The government is also interested in cognitive technologies which provide rapid EW reprogramming capability or leverage the interplay and accumulation of knowledge for improved system performance.” What this means in layman’s terms is that the Air Force wants to use AI and machine learning to enable electronic warfare systems, such EPAWSS, to be better able to perform its core functions even if the exact signals it picks up aren’t in its pre-programmed database or are being received in a confusing manner, possibly because they are being sent out in a new or unusual way or are just jumbled together with other more benign electromagnetic emissions. The idea is that advanced algorithms would be able to automatically respond, at least to some degree, to those challenges, working to at least categorize novel signals based on existing data or spot threatening ones in the clutter, all in real-time. When it comes to aerial electronic warfare packages, the issue as it stands now is that they can only work with the information they have programmed inside them. This inherently presents the risk that they may be less effective when presented with previously unseen threats, such as a new radar , during any particular mission. Even after such a new enemy system is uncovered, intelligence analysts and engineers typically need a not-insignificant amount of time to gather information about it and then update existing countermeasures to be able to respond to it. A graphic giving a very basic overview of the electromagnetic “domain” as it applies to US Marine Corps operations. This is broadly applicable to the US military, as a whole, and underscores the density just of friendly electromagnetic emissions present in operational environments now. Things are only likely to become more cluttered as time goes on., Williams Foundation Cognitive electronic warfare presents a path to fundamentally change that process. The hope is that this technology will eventually allow for the ability to quickly transform any new information an electronic warfare system scoops up about previously unknown signals into all-new countermeasures or other capabilities. This is the “rapid EW reprogramming capability” that the AFLCMC contracting notice is talking about. One early version of this capability could involve a suite like EPAWSS identifying novel signal data by itself, doing some initial analysis automatically, and then passing it along via various networks to personnel on the ground. Those individuals could then immediately begin to further analyze the information and, if necessary, start working out possible ways to respond to the new threats. “In the near term, proven EW platforms within the land, maritime, air, and space domains would host cognitive EW capabilities as part of their detection and identification suite. Onboard these platforms organically collected and off-board feeds would provide spectrum domain awareness and emitter characterization to these platforms hosting cognitive EW toolkits,” Air Force Major John Casey wrote in an article discussing future cognitive electronic warfare concepts of operation last year. “Forward and remote operators aided by cognitive EW toolkits would scrutinize the EMS [electromagnetic spectrum] feeds off the sensors to rapidly characterize the spectrum and when necessary, immediately start the development [of] countermeasures.” The absolute “holy grail” of this concept is electronic warfare suites that can do all of this internally by themselves in real-time. With regards to a system on an aircraft, this would mean that in the middle of a sortie, if an all-new electronic threat were to pop-up, the equipment onboard could immediately begin working on reprogramming its jammers to respond in the most effective way possible. With all this in mind, it’s very important to point out that the AFLCMC’s contracting announcement calls for technology that it could start to field now and then expand the capabilities as time goes on. With regards to EPAWSS specifically, BAE Systems has already done some amount of work on cognitive electronic warfare capabilities as part of the separate Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) project, which the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) ran. “In Phase 2, we successfully demonstrated the ability to characterize and adaptively counter advanced threats in a closed-loop test environment,” Louis Trebaol, BAE’s ARC Program Manager, said in 2016 after the company received a contract to proceed to Phase 3 of that effort. “We will now continue to mature the technology and test it against the most advanced radars in the U.S. inventory in order to successfully transition this important technology to the warfighter.” A graphic the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency made to go along with its Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) program., DARPA It is also worth noting that, in addition to the need to develop the kinds of algorithms to enable this kind of capability, this would demand significant processing power to work on any kind of truncated timetable. There is already separate work being done on the development of more compact computers that are still capable of high-volume processing, with a specific eye toward running AI-driven systems . The possibility of using networks to leverage off-board processing capacity for various purposes is something the Air Force, in cooperation with Lockheed Martin, is now exploring now, too. In addition, there’s the definite possibility that the Air Force could look port whatever cognitive electronic warfare capabilities it acquires for use on its F-15s, which will be largely software-defined, into similar systems on other aircraft, so long as they have or can accommodate the necessary hardware. In the same vein, there’s the potential for any such development to support work on advanced electronic warfare systems designed for platforms other than aircraft and for roles outside of self-protection. No matter what, the Air Force has laid out a clear desire to start giving all of its future F-15s these game-changing electronic warfare capabilities in the near-term.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Late last week, a curious alert appeared in the Federal Aviation Administration’s database of Notices to Airman, or NOTAMs, which, among other things, alerts aviators to chunks of airspace that are temporarily off-limits. The details strongly point to the comings or goings of a high-flying aircraft between either Area 51 , also known as Groom Lake, or the Tonopah Test Range Airport , two of the U.S. military’s most closely-guarded flight test facilities, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest of San Francisco, California. The NOTAM, which was first pointed out by users of the Dreamlandresort.com message board, was issued on March 12, 2021, but was only active between 5:45 PM and 8:15 PM local time the following day. This is a very odd time when military aviation training and test activity is usually at a minimum. The notice outlined a path 20 nautical miles wide and 426 miles long at an altitude between Flight Level 450 and Flight Level 600, or 45,000 to 60,000 feet. The exact route, defined by a series of named waypoints, can be plotted using tools available on the website ForeFlight , as seen below. A look at the entire route as defined in the NOTAM, ForeFlight If one starts in the west, the route consists of a stretch 104 nautical miles long between the Pacific Ocean and the waters southwest of San Francisco. The next leg runs 54 miles south to an area just west of Monterey, California, before turning inland over a relatively sparsely populated route across California and into western Nevada for the remaining portions. The flight path ends right at the edge of a parcel of restricted military airspace in Nevada referred to as R-4807A, which is part of the U.S. Air Force’s sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range . To the north of R-4807A is R-4809, where Tonopah Test Range (TTR) and its associated airport lie. To it south is R-4808N, inside which sits R-4808A, also known as “The Box.” That is the heavily restricted airspace around Area 51. The official posting reads: !CARF 03/165 ZOA AIRSPACE STNR ALT RESERVATION DEFINED AS 10NM EITHER SIDE OF A LINE FM BEBOP TO PIRAT TO CYPRS TO CANDA TO RUSME TO LIDAT TO TPH168031. FL450-FL600 2103140145-2103140415 This restriction is called a stationary ALTRV, standing for Altitude Reservation Approval Request. In this case, it appears to have offered a sanitized bridge between the NTTR and the Pacific for a high-flying aircraft. This aircraft would not have to communicate or turn on its transponder during the flight through the ALTRV. A source familiar with standard air traffic control procedures tells The War Zone the following in regards to such a restriction: There’s plenty of ops that never talk on the radio or turn on a transponder, they just call on the phone to activate airspace, then call when they’re done, the airspace is protected. The aircraft doesn’t need [to] talk or squawk while it is out there. A close-up of where the route’s eastern end, also showing various restricted airspace areas within the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR). KTNX is the code for the Tonopah Test Range Airport. KXTA is Homey Airport, an official name for Area 51., ForeFlight A map of the entire NTTR, as well as other adjacent restricted airspace. Area 51’s airspace, also known as “The Box,” is 4808A. , USAF The route itself is interesting for a number of reasons. It is very similar to ones The War Zone has seen outlined in previous NOTAMs a handful of times in recent years, all transiting between the NTTR and areas off the California coast. The most recent one a number of months ago began from right near Creech AFB and extended over central California and out to sea. Also of interest is that one airplane tracker recently mentioned to The War Zone that transiting in the vicinity of Monterey was a way secretive aircraft have been moving from desolate ranges in the west out to the Pacific. All told, these types of temporarily restricted pieces of airspace appear to provide secure, high-altitude corridors between the NTTR, and top-secret facilities within, and various off-shore U.S. military test ranges in the Eastern Pacific . It could also be a way to get a clandestine aircraft outside of the CONUS as efficiently as possible and recover them in a similar manner for long-duration missions that reach far beyond the eastern Pacific. It’s also important to note that an aircraft using the corridor in question does not have to be manned. In fact, such a route could exist because it is an unmanned clandestine asset that needs to transit out to sea as easily as possible. As to what aircraft this could be, the RQ-170 is a possibility . While a test variant has been flying in and out of Palmdale as of late, it does so with a chase aircraft that also communicates, at least in part, for the drone and also escorts it through normal airspace. We also know the RQ-170 has spent a lot of time over the Pacific ranges for testing. The even more shadowy and much larger ‘RQ-180’ is another possibility, but the truth is, it could be anything with a fairly high ceiling, and it certainly isn’t new that secret aircraft use the ranges off the California Coast. In this case, they would be venturing there alone, without a tanker nearby , and even possibly during a time of day when it is still somewhat light out. Plane spotters who religiously monitor radio chatter around the NTTR for hints about movements to or from sites such as Area 51 and TTR did not hear anything that appeared relevant to movement along that route at that time on air traffic control channels. It is possible the aircraft’s mission was scrubbed, or this could very well be a feature of such a mission. In the past, when we saw similar postings, no word ever came of any odd radio traffic or tracking info from spotters. In other words, the aircraft is probably very good at not being seen or heard.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 25, 2021",Marines Reportedly ‘Decommissioning’ AH-1Zs As They Shutter Helicopter Operations In Hawaii (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Marine Corps has begun a process that will see the inactivation of all units operating conventional helicopters in Hawaii by the end of next year. At least two relatively young AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters are reportedly in the process of being “decommissioned” as part of the plan. The decision to stop flying AH-1Zs, as well as CH-53E Super Stallions and UH-1Y Venoms , at Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay is a part of a broader, radical force structure redesign the service unveiled last year that also includes the elimination of its entire fleet of M1 Abrams main battle tanks, among other things . Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Kaneohe Bay is slated to see the departure of 35 helicopters, in total, by the end of the 2022 Fiscal Year, as a result of the inactivation of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 367 (HMLA-367) and Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 463 (HMH-463), Marine Captain Colin Kennard, a spokesperson for III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF), told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper . HMLA-367 and HMH-463 are both presently assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 24 (MAG-24), part of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. MAG-24 also has two squadrons flying MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors , as well as one operating RQ-21 Blackjack drones . One of HMLA-367’s AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters., USMC “While the airframe-specific personnel and equipment associated with HMLA-367 and HMH-463 will depart, Marine Aircraft Group 24 will gain a KC-130 squadron in the years following the deactivations,” Captain Kennard explained to the Star-Advertiser . That additional squadron, plus increases in the personnel assigned to other units in Hawaii as part of the service’s larger restructuring plan, known as Force Design 2030, “will result in [total] manpower remaining relatively unchanged,” he added. As many as 15 KC-130Js tanker-transports could eventually call MCAS Kaneohe Bay home, according to III MEF. In the meantime, the Marines have already started removing helicopters from the base. Earlier this month, U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III cargo planes flew two CH-53Es from Hawaii to join Marine units on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Two UH-1Ys have gone to Camp Pendleton in California. Marines unload a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter, which had previously belonged to HMH-463, from a C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on the Japanese island of Okinawa on March 4, 2021., USMC Most notably, a pair of AH-1Zs “were sent to be decommissioned,” according to the Star-Advertiser . The exact disposition of those helicopters now is unclear. The last public inventory of aircraft at the U.S. military’s central boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, which was released just today, does not list any Vipers among its holdings. We have already reached out to III MEF for future clarification. However, if this refers to the impending retirement of these, and potentially more, AH-1Zs, that is a significant development. The Marine Corps only received the first of these helicopters in 2005 and the service declared it had reached initial operational capability with the type in 2011 . HMLA-367 at Kaneohe Bay only received its first Vipers in December 2017 , as it transitioned from the older AH-1W Super Cobra. The very last AH-1Ws were only retired for good last year. Note that, at least as of 2019, the Marine Corps did not yet have a clear projected out of service date for the AH-1Z, or the UH-1Y, though the CH-53E is slated to be supplanted by the new CH-53K King Stallion by the end of this decade. Marine light attack helicopter squadrons typically have 15 AH-1Zs, according to the 2019 Marine Aviation Plan . If HMLA-367 had that many Vipers initially and they are all bound for early retirement, that could mean the Marines are now looking at divesting some 10 percent of their entire AH-1Z force in the next year and a half or so, at least. The Marine Corps’ outlook for its AH-1Z and UH-1Y fleets through the 2029 Fiscal Year, as of 2019., USMC The Marine Corps primary argument for shuttering its conventional helicopter units in Hawaii is that the MV-22B’s speed and range, together with aerial refueling support from KC-130Js, which are now set to become organic to MAG-24, make the tilt-rotors better suited to operations across the broad expanses of the Pacific. “This capability has been utilized multiple times during Osprey trans-Pacific flights between Hawaii and Australia’s Northern Territory ,” Captain Kennard, the III MEF spokesperson, told the Star-Advertiser . In addition, the Marine Corps says that Force Design 2030, as a whole, including inactivating HMLA-367 and HMH-463, will help free up approximately $12 billion that it can then reinvest in various critical new capabilities, such as unmanned aircraft and long-range, ground-based anti-ship and land-attack missiles . New longer-range strike capabilities for the Marines are essential components of the service’s future concepts of operation that go along with restructured force. All of this is intended to enable distributed expeditionary operations utilizing smaller groups of more mobile Marines , especially in the Pacific region, where the main goal is to deter potential Chinese aggression , and then be better positioned to respond if an actual conflict erupts. At the same time, the current plan would leave Marine Corps aviation elements in Hawaii with no organic platforms focused primarily on close air support and similar missions in support of forces on the ground. The AH-1Z has a three-barrel 20mm Gatling-type cannon in a turret in its nose and can carry various weapons, including AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, and rocket pods capable of firing 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II ( APKWS II ) laser-guided rockets. The UH-1Y can also be armed with 70mm rocket pods, as well as door-mounted .50 caliber machine guns and 7.62mm Miniguns . An AH-1Z and a UH-1Y, both from HMLA-367, fly together over the Pacific Ocean., USMC Efforts to arm the service’s MV-22Bs with more robust, forward-firing weapons have, so far, failed to translate into a widespread operational capability and there are only a limited number of roll-on/roll-off kits, known as Harvest Hawk , to turn KC-130Js into close air support aircraft. Of course, the Marines have already stated their position that the effort it takes to deploy AH-1Zs and UH-1Ys, as well as CH-53Es, from Kaneohe Bay inherently limits their utility. Experts and observers have also raised concerns that the removal of all conventional helicopters from Hawaii will make it more difficult for Marine ground elements there to regularly train with those types, which they will still be expected to work with during future operations. “One of the hard things Gen. Berger has to do is make the hard calls today to ensure his Marines have the tools they need tomorrow, and I think this is one of those tradeoffs,” retired Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Frank Hoffman, now a Distinguished Research Fellow with the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the National Defense University and a member of the Board of advisors at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told the Star-Advertiser . The Marine Corps has already faced somewhat similar questions around its decision to eliminate its M1 tank force, even as calls elsewhere build for more heavy armored vehicles to ensure the U.S. military is prepared for a potential conflict with China in the Pacific. Last month, Lieutenant General Eric Smith, the Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration, said that 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles armed with unspecified “lightweight” weapons had demonstrated an ability to engage enemy armor at ranges 15 to 20 times that of an Abrams tank, but provided no specifics regarding the exact parameters that went into that assessment. “We can kill armor formations at longer ranges using additional and other resources without incurring a 74-ton challenge trying to get that to a shore, or to get it from the United States into the fight,” Smith said during an online talk put on during the International Armored Vehicles Conference. “You simply can’t be there in time.” The Marine Corps clearly believes that hard choices, including the early retirement of at least some of its AH-1Zs, are necessary to realize the service’s new vision for how it will fight in the future. The end of Marine helicopter operations in Hawaii looks very much to be the beginning of a larger, significant transformation in the service’s aviation components. UPDATE 3/16/21: III MEF has confirmed that two of HMLA-367’s AH-1Zs, both of which were remanufactured AH-1Ws, were sent on their way to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base on March 12. It remains unclear how many AH-1Zs the Marine Corps may ultimately remove from service in the near term as a result of force structure changes stemming from Force Design 2030.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020",British Typhoons Have Used Storm Shadow Cruise Missiles For The First Time In Combat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. UK Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 fighter jets have employed the conventionally armed Storm Shadow cruise missile for the first time in combat. The missile was used recently to attack ISIS targets concealed within caves in northern Iraq as part of the UK’s Operation Shader that’s being waged against Daesh in Iraq and Syria. The UK Ministry of Defense confirmed the Typhoon airstrike against the cave complexes southwest of Erbil. While the weapon was previously used in combat by the Royal Air Force’s (RAF) now-retired Tornado GR4 strike aircraft , this is the first use by the RAF Typhoon. An RAF Typhoon being prepared for a sortie over the Middle East for Operation Shader. The aircraft is armed with two Storm Shadow cruise missiles below its wings., Crown Copyright For the mission in question, which took place on March 11, the Storm Shadow was selected as “the most appropriate weapon for the task,” after Iraqi forces identified “a significant number” of ISIS fighters in the caves. Two Typhoon FGR4s, forward-based at RAF Akrotiri on the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean, were tasked with the airstrike, which was in support of the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) ground forces. The raid was preceded by surveillance of the area by the CTS on March 10, to confirm there were no civilians at risk, and, following the Storm Shadow mission, the “weapons were confirmed to have struck their targets precisely,” according to the defense ministry. There were also follow-up attacks made on March 11, in the same remote, mountainous area, this time with two RAF Typhoons employing six 500-pound Paveway IV dual-mode precision-guided bombs against ISIS fighters at two other locations. A different group of caves then came under attack on March 12, with Typhoons employing eight Paveway IVs, and again two days later, using six of the same weapons. “On each occasion, our aircrew have exercised their utmost care in checking there were no signs of civilians in the area before conducting the strikes and subsequent surveillance to ensure their successful completion,” the defense ministry said. RAF Weapons Technicians loading a Storm Shadow cruise missile onto a Typhoon., Crown Copyright A Typhoon departs for a sortie with Storm Shadow cruise missiles., Crown Copyright A Typhoon is marshaled back to its parking slot after an Operation Shader sortie over the Middle East., Crown Copyright These latest missions confirm that, although the pace of U.K. offensive air operations in the Middle East has diminished, the RAF is still very much on call and active when required. It is also telling that, by employing the Storm Shadow, the Typhoon has now well and truly assumed the mantle from the swing-wing Tornado GR4, the retirement of which, back in 2019, you can read about here . To allow the withdrawal of the Tornado, the U.K. first had to ensure that the Typhoon was able to employ the key air-to-ground weapons that had been used by the Tornado, under a program codenamed Centurion. As well as the Storm Shadow — which was first used by the Tornado during the opening phases of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and then subsequently during the air campaign over Libya in 2011 — the Typhoon was cleared to use the Brimstone precision anti-armor missile . Paveway IV was already available to the RAF Typhoon. Two Typhoons, both armed with Storm Shadows, depart for a sortie over the Middle East., Crown Copyright A Typhoon is prepared for a sortie on Operation Shader., Crown Copyright A Typhoon FGR4 carries Storm Shadows ahead of a sortie against ISIS., Crown Copyright Centurion modifications actually began to reach the RAF Typhoon front line in early 2018, beginning with the Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile , then the Storm Shadow, under the Phase 2 Enhancement (or P2E). Brimstone was then added subsequently under P3E and first used in combat by RAF Typhoons in early 2019 . Considering the Storm Shadow has been available to the RAF Typhoon for around three years now, it might seem surprising it’s not previously been used in combat. However, this standoff weapon is, as manufacturer MBDA stresses, “designed to meet the demanding requirements of pre-planned attacks against high-value fixed or stationary targets.” The missile has a range of over 155 miles and its BROACH warhead is of the tandem type, ensuring penetration of hardened targets, like bunkers or even some cave complexes. The warhead uses a precursor charge to punch through hardened structures followed by the main change that can be fuzed for penetration mode when required, meaning it detonates after breaching the target. The missile guidance system combines an inertial navigation system, GPS, and terrain referencing.

However, it was used by Tornados during the coalition missile strikes against sites connected to the Syrian government’s chemical weapons arsenal, in April 2018, which you read more about here . Indeed, when it comes to hardened targets or those that are heavily defended, requiring the launch aircraft to remain at standoff range, the Storm Shadow is the weapon of choice for the RAF. For a target like the Erbil caves there are currently no heavier (1,000- or 2,000-pound) Paveway guided bombs available to the Typhoon, and no other bunker-busting alternatives . The Brimstone, for its part, offers a low-collateral, high-precision strike capability. The Storm Shadow has also been used in combat by Saudi Arabia during its campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to the then U.K. Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, speaking in 2016. However, this would have involved Royal Saudi Air Force Tornados and it’s not known if Saudi Typhoons have also used it in anger since then. Weapons Technicians using a weapon loading vehicle to load a Storm Shadow onto a Typhoon., Crown Copyright An RAF Typhoon taxiing back to its parking slot after a sortie over the Middle East., Crown Copyright A Typhoon takes off with a twin Storm Shadow payload., Crown Copyright It should be noted that France’s version of the Storm Shadow, the SCALP, has also been used in combat, and has been exported to countries including Egypt and India . A naval version of that same weapon has also been developed for launch by surface warships and submarines . Not in the least thanks to a unit costs of over $1 million , the Storm Shadow is likely to remain a niche weapon for the RAF Typhoon Force in Operation Shader. However, the fact it’s now being used in combat further reinforces the jet’s multirole credentials and its status as the backbone of the UK’s fast jet fleet.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An F-22 Raptor stealth fighter suffered a nose gear failure at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida earlier today. The pilot, who landed the plane after suffering an unspecified in-flight emergency, was subsequently taken a medical facility on base to be evaluated, but their exact status is unclear. The mishap occurred at around 3:30 PM local time and an investigation is underway into the exact cause or causes, according to a press release from the 96th Test Wing, the main unit at Eglin. The F-22 involved in the accident was assigned to the 325th Fighter Wing, which is technically based at Tyndall Air Force Base, also in Florida. However, the 325th’s Raptors have been flying from Eglin , as well as other bases around the country, since Hurricane Michael devastated Tyndall in 2018. An F-22 Raptor stealth fighter belonging to the 325th Fighter Wing lands at Eglin Air Force Base., USAF “The F-22 experienced an in-flight emergency,” the press release from the 96th Test Wing read, according to Northwest Florida Daily News . “The aircraft landed safely. There was one person on board. Fire crews responded immediately and the pilot was transported to flight medicine for an evaluation.” A picture reportedly showing the jet nose down on the runway with its canopy open, along with two crash trucks behind it, subsequently emerged on the unofficial “Air Force amn/nco/snco” Facebook page. This comes nearly two months after another F-22 suffered a very similar-sounding mishap due to an unspecified landing gear issue at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. This is not the first mishap an F-22 has suffered since the jets began flying out of Eglin in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael. In May 2020, one of the 325th’s Raptors crashed near the base . The pilot was, thankfully, able to safely eject. It’s also not the first time an F-22 has suffered a mishap that has involved its fuselage scraping against the ground. In two separate incidents in 2018, one at Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada and one at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, Raptors ended up belly up on the runway. That same year another one of the fighters suffered a catastrophic engine failure while flying out of Tyndall. If the photo now circulating on social media does show the F-22 involved in this latest mishap, it thankfully does not appear to be a total loss. The Air Force only has a total of around 185 of these stealthy jets, 125 or so of which are combat-coded at any given time. The remaining jets are tasked with training or test and evaluation duties. Many of these jets would require extensive upgrades to make them as capable as their combat-coded counterparts Still, even a nose gear failure can lead to damage that is expensive and time-consuming to fix on these jets due to their specialized skin coatings , heavy use of specialized composite materials, and complex internal structures, all of which help them maintain their stealthy signatures. The cost to repair an F-22 involved in another incident in 2012 in which the jet went skidding along the runway at Tyndall was eventually pegged at $35 million . Hopefully, the damage to this particular aircraft will turn out to be less severe. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Citing unnamed sources within the government as well as a leaked copy of the report, the Guardian newspaper has claimed that the U.K. is planning to potentially boost the numbers of warheads available for its UGM-133 Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), with a new upper limit of 260 warheads . This is a significant about-face, since, as of last December, the government still outlined an aim of reducing the warhead total from 225 to “no more than 180 warheads” by the mid-2020s. At the same time, the number of operationally available warheads was to be trimmed down to 120. HMS Vigilant , one of four Vanguard class SSBNs, alongside a berth at HM Naval Base Clyde., CROWN COPYRIGHT It is not clear exactly why the U.K. is now looking to expand its nuclear stockpile which, after peaking at around 500 warheads in the late 1970s, has steadily declined in numbers since the end of the Cold War. “If this [increase] is confirmed, this would be a highly provocative move,” David Cullen, the director of the Nuclear Information Service told the Guardian . “The U.K. has repeatedly pointed to its reducing warhead stockpile as evidence that it is fulfilling its legal duties under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.” Ever since introducing an SSBN-based nuclear deterrent with the Polaris SLBM in the late 1960s, the U.K. has relied upon U.S. technology for its nuclear weapons, although the warheads themselves are produced in the U.K. and tailored to local requirements, the exact details of which are a closely guarded secret. Trident missiles currently arm the U.K. Royal Navy’s four Vanguard class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) which entered service in the 1990s and are due to be replaced by a similar number of new Dreadnought class SSBNs from the early 2030s at a total estimated cost of around $43 billion. The earlier class of British SSBN has 16 missile tubes, but in practice, only eight are used, to comply with treaty regulations, and the new Dreadnoughts will feature 12 tubes each. A maximum of 40 warheads is currently carried on board the Royal Navy SSBNs when on deterrent patrol, each Trident missile being able to carry multiple warheads, or multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). While each Trident can theoretically carry 14 MIRVs, depending on the type, 40 warheads on each patrol amount to approximately five per missile. Currently, the Royal Navy’s Vanguard class SSBNs go to sea with Trident armed with a version of the U.S. W76 warhead, which dates back to the 1970s, and is known locally as the Mk 4/A. An unarmed Trident II SLBM fired from HMS Vanguard during an at-sea test., Crown Copyright In February 2020 the U.K. government confirmed that a program to replace the nuclear warheads was underway, but it will still likely face a vote in parliament. In 2016 members of parliament already voted in favor of developing the Dreadnought class, but the costs of the warhead replacement are not included in the $43 billion earmarked for the submarines themselves. The U.K. is now hoping to replace the W76-derived warhead with the W93, which you can read more about here , and the government has recently been pushing the U.S. to support initial spending on the new warhead, amid Democrat opposition to funding the program, especially in the run-up to the Biden administration’s first Nuclear Posture Review. Complicating matters further, the U.S. Navy doesn’t require a new warhead until the late 2030s, after the Vanguard class is scheduled to have become operational with the Royal Navy. The U.K. needs the Vanguard and modernized Tridents to maintain its continuous at-sea deterrence, which has one of the SSBNs always on patrol out of HM Naval Base Clyde — also known as Faslane — on the west coast of Scotland. Since the U.K. Royal Air Force’s last air-launched nuclear bombs were retired in 1998, the Royal Navy’s SSBNs have provided the country’s sole nuclear weapons capability. You can read all about the practicalities of the U.K. “doomsday mission” in this previous article . The Vanguard class submarine HMS Victorious ., Crown Copyright The revised warhead total, which will reportedly have an upper limit of 260, will arm the Trident IIs that have been selected to arm the Dreadnought class. The exact power of the British Trident warheads is an official secret, but, in contrast to U.S. Navy Tridents, they apparently have a selective yield , with a reported maximum of 100 kilotons. The U.K.’s strategic nuclear forces were originally tailored to deter the Soviet Union and Russia’s rapidly modernizing long-range arsenal could be a driver behind the possible increase in U.K. warheads. Although as of March last year Moscow possessed a total of 1,362 strategic warheads declared under the New START Treaty alone, using multiple delivery systems, even a modest increase on the U.K. side would have more than symbolic value, bearing in mind the destructive power of these weapons . It is worth noting that the figure for Russian warheads includes certain caveats, including a single strategic bomber counted as one warhead . On the other hand, Russia’s activities, both overt military , and covert, including on British soil , have also become a more serious concern to the U.K. in recent years, such that the U.K. Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter, described it as “the most complex and capable security challenge we have faced since the Cold War.” The Weapons Engineer Officers Tactical Trigger used to launch a Trident missile aboard the Vanguard class SSBNs., Crown Copyright Another potential reason for the increase, as put forward by the Guardian , is that it’s designed to demonstrate its commitment to the United States, which the U.K. wants to co-fund the development of the aforementioned W93 as a replacement warhead for the Trident, to arm the forthcoming Dreadnought class. As well as lobbying for the W93, the U.K. is also working closely with the U.S. on the design of the warhead, according to the BBC , which has described it as a “a bi-national warhead project.” Clearly, the U.K. is heavily committed to the W93, not least because it’s the only realistic option to replace its existing warheads. Furthermore, it’s been reported that the cost alone of modernizing the Aldermaston facilities in England where the U.K. warheads are produced could reach almost $14 billion over the next 15 years. “Our warheads have to match theirs exactly, in terms of flight performance, in order to remain certified,” an unnamed source close to the U.K. nuclear deterrent program told the BBC . On the other hand, the reason for the potential increase in U.K. nuclear warheads could be more pragmatic. Dmitry Stefanovich, a Research Fellow at the Center for International Security, IMEMO RAS, has suggested that a growing stockpile could simply reflect the coming period of transition between the old W76 and new W93 warheads, as the former works up to operational deployment and the latter is progressively withdrawn. Since the U.K. will have determined the minimum number of warheads required for a credible deterrent it will also have to ensure that a given number is also ready for use at all times. The idea of keeping at least some W76s in the stockpile during the transitional phase would therefore make good sense. In addition, it takes time to decommission warheads. While it may be relatively simple to remove them from a deployed status, it might not be so easy to actually write them out of the stockpile, depending on existing policies that are in place and the speed with which the warheads themselves can be decommissioned. Even in the U.S., where the nuclear weapons stockpile is somewhat more transparent, it is not always easy to determine what is actually available for deployment . Tomorrow, perhaps, we may learn more about the proposed expansion of the U.K. nuclear weapons stockpile. On the other hand, considering the veil of secrecy that surrounds the U.K. nuclear deterrent, it may still be some time before we learn exactly how many warheads will be provided for the new Dreadnought class SSBNs.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As British armed forces await the official outcome of the forthcoming government defense review and possible cuts to the UK’s F-35B procurement plans, the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy are jointly gearing up for a massive global deployment that will be spearheaded by the fledgling UK Lightning Force. Group Captain Jim Beck is the current Station Commander of RAF Marham, the home base of the British Lightning Force. He is a pilot who has flown the F-35 during some of its most exacting operational evaluations. Few people are better positioned to understand and explain the intricacies and challenges of growing a cadre of operators and aircraft to form a brand new stealth fighter force. Ahead of the high-profile deployment, Beck sat down with The War Zone to explain some of the critical issues in re-establishing Britain’s carrier strike force. The UK’s F-35 Lightning Force will undertake its first sustained operational tasking this spring as it deploys aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth as part of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) for CSG21, a combined operation with the U.S. Marine Corps. A large UK/U.S. complement of F-35Bs will embark the Royal Navy’s new flagship aircraft carrier for an operational deployment that is likely to include periods in the Mediterranean and the Indo-Pacific region. British F-35Bs alongside examples from the USMC during the Groupex exercise in 2020., Crown Copyright The CSG21 deployment is a major milestone in the British F-35 program. It is a manifestation of the deep UK/U.S. defense and security relationship, and it represents the rebirth of British carrier strike capability just over a decade after Joint Force Harrier was dramatically axed in 2010. Group Captain Beck has been at the center of the joint Royal Air Force/Royal Navy Lightning Force in recent years, having been the first commander of the UK F-35 Operational Evaluation Unit, No 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron, at Edwards Air Force Base in California. “This is going to be the most potent combat air platform of all time,” he told The War Zone in an exclusive interview. The UK Lightning Force completed a huge “Groupex” deployment aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth in October 2020, which you can read all about here . It included the U.S. Marine Corps’ VMFA-211 “Wake Island Avengers ,” the exact same unit that is planned to return to the U.K. in the spring for CSG21. The Marine unit worked alongside the first British frontline Lightning unit, “The Dambusters” of No 617 Squadron. “When I walked through the squadron during Groupex, you couldn’t differentiate who was doing what,” says Group Captain Beck. “The two units were blended together with absolute lethality. In fact, the commanding officer of VMFA-211 said that his squadron was closer to 617 now than they are to any other squadron, due to Groupex. It was the exact same team that will deploy together for CSG21, and that was done by design. It could not have been more successful.” The success of Groupex led to the Lightning Force declaring Initial Operating Capability for the F-35B in the maritime environment, on schedule, at the end of 2020. During Groupex, VMFA-211 and No 617 Squadron collectively deployed 15 jets aboard the British carrier and trained together in preparation for the larger Carrier Strike Group deployment this year. Britain’s F-35 plan evolves The UK is the sole non-U.S. Tier 1 partner in the System Design and Development phase of the Lightning II program and its official program of record calls for a total of 138 F-35s. To date, the UK has taken delivery of 21 F-35Bs from Lockheed Martin at Fort Worth, Texas, with 18 aircraft now at Marham, and three attached to No 17 TES at Edwards. According to Lockheed Martin, Britain’s participation in the F-35 program has resulted in significant economic value to the country. It advertises a headline figure for British industrial involvement that roughly equates to 15% by value of every F-35 produced worldwide, however this figure has been questioned and will be detailed in an independent economic impact assessment by KPMG International Limited. Some of this F-35 work is conducted by British-owned companies that are outside the UK, such as elements of the Rolls-Royce Lift-Fan system used in the F-35B, which are assembled in Indianapolis, Indiana. The British carriers use a “ski-ramp” on the bow of the deck to assist the launch of F-35Bs., Crown Copyright To date, 48 F-35Bs have been funded by the British government. The aircraft are being procured under a “block buy” approach through the U.S.-led Joint Programme Office (JPO). The UK has actually ordered 35 aircraft so far, and procurement of the next 13 has commenced, according to a statement in 2020 by Jeremy Quin, Minister of State, Ministry of Defence. “These will be delivered through the “Block Buy 2” program [in production Lots 15-17].” “The current agreed F-35B Lightning procurement profile will see the UK reach 48 aircraft in quarter four 2025,” Quin added in a written statement in November 2020. “This delivery schedule has been developed to support the F-35B Lightning Force generation build profile and Carrier Enabled Power Projection (CEPP) milestone requirements. In December 2023, when Full Operational Capability (FOC) carrier strike is scheduled to be declared, the Lightning Force will have a total of 37 aircraft which will support two frontline squadrons and the Operational Conversion Unit. The full complement, of 48 aircraft, will be available when the CEPP FOC milestone is reached in 2026.” This figure includes the three test aircraft at Edwards AFB. One of the three British F-35Bs assigned to No 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron, currently based at Edwards AFB., Jamie Hunter It has become increasingly unclear, if not outright unlikely, whether the UK will purchase as many as 138 aircraft , although there is a wide consensus that more than 48 F-35Bs are required to properly equip the two new British aircraft carriers. Indeed, reports ahead of the Integrated Review suggest that the number could be capped at 48 . Speaking to a British Parliamentary Defence Committee on December 8, 2020, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Military Capability) Air Marshal Richard Knighton stated: “The 48 aircraft are those that we have ordered and [have] funding set aside for, and are due to be delivered over next five or six years. We know from our analysis that in order to sustain the F-35 capability and the carrier capability we do need to increase the number of F-35s that we buy. And that we will want to do that over the period beyond 2025 when this next batch is brought into service.” Overall British F-35 procurement plans have butted up against the emerging Team Tempest Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and the preferred means by which to replace the RAF’s Eurofighter Typhoons after 2040. The full analysis of this complex requirement is being undertaken over the next few years, and is regarded as being too complicated and too early in the assessment phase to be included in the forthcoming Integrated Review due to be published by the Ministry of Defence. “The precise number and the shape of that [F-35B] profile is to some extent dependent on our analysis around the overall Future Combat Aircraft System,” explained Knighton. “So, while we know we need to increase the number of F-35Bs to support the carrier right the way through to its out of service date, the precise number will depend a bit on the work we do and the investment we are making in the FCAS. So we expect to be able to make definite judgments around the total future fleet in the 2025 timeframe. It could be up to the 138, it could be less than that, but we need to do that analysis and that work.” During a further hearing by the British Parliamentary Defence Committee on February 4, 2021, Air Marshal Knighton went further, stating: “Our expectation is that we will buy more F-35s in the second half of the next decade to improve the capacity.” This suggested the UK may not procure any more F-35s until after 2035! Lockheed Martin currently projects that F-35 production will continue until 2046. British F-35Bs aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth in June 2020., Crown Copyright Preparing a stealthy force Despite having one of the world’s most advanced air arms, the F-35B marks the UK’s first foray into the world of operating a low-observable (stealthy) aircraft. Partnership with the U.S. has been critical, with personnel having been assigned to exchange postings flying American fighters well ahead of the commencement of domestic F-35 operations. Others have been assigned to U.S. Navy units as a measure designed to retain a core of corporate knowledge around maritime aviation operations. Having an operational test squadron embedded as part of the joint U.S., Australian, and Dutch test team at Edwards AFB has also enabled Britain to stay at the leading edge of capability implementation. It has also been critical to the UK regarding bespoke capabilities and trials that have been required to enable effective integration with the two Queen Elizabeth class carriers — both of which are designed specifically with Lightning Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing ( STOVL) operations in mind. Getting to the point of deploying for CSG21 has taken a huge amount of effort. RAF and Royal Navy pilots and maintainers initially trained and grew the force alongside the USMC at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina. Meanwhile, RAF Marham was being completely redeveloped as the UK F-35 hub, and it received its first jets from the training detachment at Beaufort on June 6, 2018, as No 617 Squadron “Dambusters” returned to Norfolk. Part of the brand new F-35 operational facility at RAF Marham., Jamie Hunter “No 617 Squadron is still quite a small unit,” says Jim Beck. “We are all about making sure we are a balanced, tuned, force, as we look ahead to Full Operating Capability, which is still a few years away. But these things take so long to grow correctly.” Availability rates for the F-35 in U.S. service have been under intense scrutiny recently. The 2020 report by the Office of the Director Operational Test and Evaluation said: “’Low utilization rates continue to prevent the services from achieving their full programmed fly rates, which are the basis of flying hour projections and sustainment cost models. For the 12 months ending in September 2020, the average monthly utilization rate for the whole U.S. fleet was 19.6 flight hours per aircraft per month. For the F-35A, it was 20.6 flight hours; the F-35B was 14.6 flight hours; and the F-35C was 23.1 flight hours. This compares to service plans from 2013, which expected F-35A and F-35C units to execute 25 flight hours per aircraft per month and F-35B units to execute 20 flight hours per aircraft per month to achieve Service goals.” Responding to a question about British F-35B availability rates, the RAF provided the following comment: “The United Kingdom’s Air Vehicle Availability is comparable to other F-35B users at a similar level of maturity, providing sufficient availability to meet our operational, training and force growth outputs.” F-35Bs under the weather shelters at RAF Marham., Jamie Hunter While numbers of pilots tend to be a yardstick to gauge squadron progress, Beck says that it’s the maintainers that are the fundamental factor when it comes to the F-35. “Manning is a challenge because it takes so long to train a full-up engineer [on the F-35]. The engineering evolutions we do on this jet are very different from other fighters. While it’s fifth-generation in terms of its warfighting capabilities, it’s a fundamentally different jet to maintain as well. We simply don’t undertake routine maintenance in the same way we used to do it.” “For example, with a car I know when it will need to go back to the dealer for an oil change, and I can predict when that’s going to happen based on my average mileage. It doesn’t work that way with the F-35. It will cough when it needs something. It adapts, it has smart analysis of its own biometrics.” Beck says ongoing analysis of the required manning to support F-35s will “drive” how many aircraft are sent on CSG21. “The calculus isn’t the number of engineers [we send], it’s how we make sure we keep enough quality back at Marham to continue to grow the force while CSG21 is underway.” Maintainers greet a pilot returning from a mission., Jamie Hunter “When an individual completes an engineering evolution on the jet, he or she will go to ALIS [Autonomic Logistics Information System] and manipulate what they’ve done — add the information and that then forms a data picture, which presents the health status of the jet. A small tweak in one area can generally make a big difference and improvement — from the low observable side to the engine or the undercarriage.” Beck says that it takes at least a year for a new maintainer to be sufficiently qualified and experienced. Pilot training No 207 Squadron was established in summer 2019 as the domestic training center for the F-35B in the UK, essentially assuming a mirror role that VMFAT-501 “Warlords” at Beaufort provides. So far, the squadron has graduated the new commander of No 617 Squadron CDR Mark Sparrow, and an Executive Officer, both on crossover courses from other types. In December 2020, the first two brand new students graduated from a full conversion course. “The full course takes around eight months,” explains Beck, adding that more courses are currently underway at Marham. The British Lightning Force shares a pool of aircraft between No 617 Squadron and the Operational Conversion Unit., Jamie Hunter The use of synthetic training is central to the way the UK plans to tutor new aviators and maintain readiness. “On the Lightning Force we no longer use the word simulator,” explains Beck. “It’s fundamentally a mindset change for everybody and the word simulator is actually quite unhelpful, because it’s saying that you are merely trying to mimic the live environment. With this jet, we actually go to war in the synthetic environment and we actually then simulate the synthetic environment in the live environment. In my days on the Tornado, we used the simulator to train for our emergencies, because we couldn’t do it in the live environment. Today, you can take that to all levels of warfare across multi-domains. Synthetic training is becoming increasingly important and the Lightning is at the vanguard of those pushing that mindset.” “We have to rely on the simulators because there are no two-seat F-35s. Every time a student pilot goes to live fly, or more importantly comes to some of the STOVL activity — which is considered to be the more demanding element of flying — fortunately, the Flight Management Software is the same in the actual aircraft and in the simulator. Our synthetic devices have the same software loads as the jet, particularly in the flight sciences domain. The first time I hovered the F-35B I commended our synthetic environment — it set me up perfectly.” Group Captain Beck at the controls of an F-35B near Edwards AFB., Jamie Hunter The UK purchased four full-motion simulators and four cockpits that are included in two Deployable Mission Rehearsal Trainers (DMRTs). Each DMRT is housed inside an ISO container, with two cockpits per container. The DMRTs feature the same cockpit layout and Flight Management System software as the full-motion simulator, but with slightly reduced visual acuity. The UK is pushing towards a blend of live versus synthetic training that leans heavily towards time in the simulator. “There are certain things in the live environment that you can’t replicate. G-force, vibration, noise, the smell,” Beck says. “The jet does react differently in the live environment to how it does in the synthetic, we’ve just haven’t modeled everything yet. A great example is how 6G affects the sensor systems. As society develops, the synthetics need to adapt.” Inside an F-35 simulator., Lockheed Martin Notably, the Lightning Force has moved away from only using hourly targets as a means to measure proficiency, instead referring to pilots as being “safe to fly” and “proficient to operate.” Explaining how this works, Beck says: “There was a month when I was at Edwards where I didn’t actually fly the jet at all. But I’d “flown” the simulator 16 times. I had never been so proficient to operate. Safe to fly is more about the live environment, so we track both of these factors. We track how safe a pilot is, how many hours they have, and also look at warfighting competency — both in terms of live flying and synthetics.” High-end training Large exercises such as Red Flag at Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada, have underlined the impressive capabilities of the F-35 and how its pilots need to be stressed in training by suitably potent and numeric opposition. These large-force exercises appear to offer a fidelity of training that still cannot be attained in a simulator. “We have found that when there is a human-in-the-loop, machines struggle to punish people as much as we have found historically in the live environment,” Beck explains. “A great example is Red Flag when you go up against professional aggressors . Those aggressors will punish any mistakes — they are probably the most capable adversaries we will ever go up against — which is why we go to Red Flag. We have found in the synthetic environment, when you add a human into the Red Air loop, the human dynamic moves everything up a level. It’s something we are really keen to pursue here — not just Red Air modeling, but also having humans in the loop.” Beck says that the current air-to-air live flying that is conducted from home station is designed to “stretch the pilot on timeline,” essentially having an adversary that puts them under pressure. “In the live flying environment, we carefully orchestrate profiles which validate what we have explored in the synthetic. This isn’t simply free for all warfare — we are carefully exploiting each mission, like experimental test points in the air. If it’s a young student, we will expose them to the maximum number of training points in carefully-orchestrated presentations. Where we add the variation will most likely be in the synthetic environment, because we have to extract the maximum value for money.” A No 617 Squadron F-35B flies with a USMC example., Jamie Hunter “Every presentation is valuable to us, because we have to be so far away from each other to do it. In the Tornado days the engagement ranges were such that you just had to lose sight of the opponent, then turn in and “pull the wings off the jet” — those days are long gone. The F-35 “sees” in its rear hemisphere for tens of miles! So to stress the jet and the pilot you’ve got to use virtually all of the UK’s airspace, so we’ve got to make these measured, calculated, presentations, and that’s what we’re doing. It’s not a big, marauding Red Air in a Red Flag-type scenario — it’s actually a bit more scientific than that.” “The vast majority of the work in this jet is Beyond Visual Range [BVR], but we have a BFM [Basic Fighter Maneuvers, close-range] ability, and we train for it. But with fifth-generation, that’s not the intent. We are so capable at such long ranges, and we will fight to our strengths. The UK is at the front edge of pushing synthetics. We are a small force with limited resources and will cut our cloth accordingly. We truly understand the value of synthetics and are really comfortable exploring that environment and pushing it.” Beck says the Lightning Force is working closely with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) to adapt synthetic environments rapidly to reflect the contemporary world. “We need to be able to rapidly program what the theater looks like and train in it,” he says. “That’s what the future of synthetics looks like, accurate environmental modeling of what the world looks like in the information domain.” Group Captain Beck at the controls of an F-35B during his time as Officer Commanding No 17 TES., Jamie Hunter CSG21 and beyond. While the forthcoming carrier deployment is clearly a focus for the British F-35 team right now, Jim Beck is keen to underscore that the Lightning Force is not tied to the carrier. “We are as focused on joint operating bases as we are on operations from the ship. We are capable of doing both, or a hybrid. No 617 Squadron has already successfully deployed on operations from RAF Akrotiri [in Cyprus] and is now preparing for the CSG21 operational deployment. But with the assets we have available as this young force grows, it remains under careful management to ensure we hit our obligations to defense. This will continue to build towards full operational capability, with the further aircraft deliveries from our orders and the creation of a second frontline squadron.” Official policy around the new British aircraft carriers was to be able to deploy one carrier at any given time, with an ambition to position 36 F-35Bs on a ship. The Ministry of Defence is yet to set an exact date on the establishment of 809 Naval Air Squadron, the UK’s second frontline F-35B unit, however, training enough manpower — particularly engineers — is clearly a critical factor in ensuring the Lightning Force is able to deploy sufficient numbers of aircraft aboard the carriers. With just 18 F-35Bs currently delivered to RAF Marham, and with some undergoing deep modification work, Beck acknowledges that there are “preferential” aircraft to send to the carrier for CSG21. This clearly has an impact on how many British F-35s will join the forthcoming deployment. He also points out that the UK will operate a single standard of aircraft in terms of rolling upgrades, “no jet will be left behind at the moment,” he says, underlining how precious each individual asset is. While much of the current attention within Ministry of Defence circles relates to the level of impact Tempest will have on the British F-35s — the UK will have to wait a long time before any more than the initial 48 jets are ordered and arrive on UK shores, with a stark reality that 48 could very well be the total buy. However, a prolonged procurement strategy shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. The carriers have a service life of 50 years and the F-35Bs are currently the only combat jet able to operate from them. Infrastructure is also among the most critical factors facing the British Lightning Force right now, as indeed it is for the Marine Corps. “It’s not just about the jets,” Beck asserts. “We also need cyber engineers for example, with the bandwidth required for the access needed to mine and manage data, that’s as important as the jet itself! It’s got to be the whole package, and that’s exactly what we are trying to do.” An F-35B on the flightdeck of HMS Queen Elizabeth ., Crown Copyright The CSG21 deployment is all about bringing that whole F-35B package together as part of an entire Carrier Strike Group, which includes critical support elements such as the new Crowsnest Airborne Early Warning and Control System, for what looks set to be an impressive deployment on a global scale. The Royal Navy has recently signed a Maritime Security Arrangement with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JMSDF) as part of a deepening relationship. Indeed, CSG21 is designed to enhance defense relations between the two nations, according to a recent Ministry of Defence news release . Japan is looking to expand its Lightning concept of operations by using its planned new F-35Bs in a similar model to that of the UK, flying them from its two Izumo class helicopter carriers . This too could present a vital partnership for the UK as it seeks to enhance its ability to leverage partnerships with fellow international F-35B operators to maximize interoperability and operational effectiveness of Britain’s new F-35 air combat force. All told, as the F-35 saga continues to unfold on an international stage, the UK’s F-35B emerging force is working hard to control its own destiny, regardless of if it ends up getting anywhere near the airframes it was originally promised.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Air Force single-ship demo teams and a gaggle of eclectic warbirds descended on Davis Monthan AFB last week for the annual Heritage Flight Conference . It is here that the solo demo teams perfect the Heritage Flight program alongside various warbirds that they may meet up with at airshows across the United States. The Heritage Flight pairs a USAF demo jet with a fighter or attack aircraft from the USAF’s past. Often times the unique formations are tacked onto the back of a jet team’s demo and offer a poignant remembrance of airmen who made the Air Force what it is today, many of which sacrificed heavily in doing so. This year, one particular Heritage Flight training sortie was like no other ever and resulted in the incredible mind-twisting image you see at the top of this piece. The Heritage Flight cross-training occurs every year in Tucson before the airshow season. This year the A-10 Demo Team has a newly painted Warthog that sports a Southeast Asia scheme reminiscent of the Vietnam War era. This is in addition to the team’s other Warthog, which wears a WWII-inspired scheme. Pro aviation photographer Larry Grace was there to catch an incredibly unique moment in which both specially painted A-10s performed the “Heritage Break,” a stunning crossing maneuver that serves as the apex of the Heritage Flight program. Usually, the A-10 would be breaking with a P-51 or other warbird, not another A-10, and especially not one wearing another nostalgic paint scheme. The one-of-a-kind moment when both of the A-10 Demo Team’s specially painted Warthogs flew the Heritage Flight program, including the iconic Heritage Break. , Larry Grace Photography Here’s a bit from Larry Grace, which goes by the handle @Larrygracephoto on Instagram, about the circumstances surrounding his amazing image and how he snapped it: This year the newest demo pilot and team leader for the A-10 Demo Team is Capt. Haden “Gator” Fullam. Capt. Fullam, along with last year’s team leader and demo pilot Maj. Cody “ShIV” Wilton, flew a demo with the two specially painted A-10 demo aircraft. They finished their demo with the Heritage Break. This was and will be the only time both specially painted A-10 aircraft will fly together. With Maj. Wilton returning to the Heritage Flight Conference to assist in training, a special Heritage Flight formation was put together with both A-10 flying alongside an A-1 Skyraider, the warbird being flown by Stuart Milson. Then the A-10 and A-1, both in Vietnam camouflage, flew a Heritage Flight demo training flight. Afterward, the two A-10s rejoined and flew a special one-time-only flight. At the end of the demo flight, the aircraft did the traditional Heritage Break. Knowing that this was going to take place, I set up, and as the aircraft flew over I tracked and followed them and got ready to capture the moment. It wasn’t until I reviewed the images from the day did I realize I captured this special moment in such a unique way.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 8, 2021",Israel Could Be Waiting For Surplus U.S. Air Force F-15s Instead Of Buying New Advanced Eagles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s about-face in its steadfast commitment to only buying 5th generation fighters via the F-15X procurement initiative has changed more than many would like to admit. In fact, the reverberations of seeing this program come to fruition will be felt for years to come and will reach beyond this one service. One secondary impact may be on the long-anticipated choice of the Israeli Air Force, or IAF, to procure advanced F-15s alongside more F-35s , largely as part of a massive aid deal financed by the United States. In fact, the F-15EX’s own success stateside may have actually curtailed Israel’s push to acquire similar jets, and for what some would argue is a very logical reason. Possible evidence of this has come in the form of Israel’s recent major procurement announcement that included orders for more F-35s, but no word of advanced F-15 Eagles. I have written extensively on Israel’s amazing ability to adapt the F-15A/B/C/D “Baz” to its specific needs, a phenomenon that goes back to not long after the jet entered service with the IAF nearly a half-century ago. Israel turned its ‘not a pound for air-to-ground’ Eagles in long-range strike assets replete with conformal fuel tanks long before the F-15E Strike Eagle was a thing . As the years went by, the aircraft became even more ‘Israeliszed,’ with the Baz 2000 upgrade package being especially extensive. Today, these aircraft serve as true multi-role fighters, capable of slinging U.S. and Israeli weaponry over great distances. The B/D two-seat models, in particular, are of immense value to the IAF. They have been modified to an even more extensive degree, working as networking and satellite communications hubs and as command and control assets, among their more traditional roles. An F-15 Baz readies for a mission during an overseas training opportunity. , USAF Over the decades, surplus F-15s from U.S. Air Force stocks have trickled into Israel to keep its Baz fleet as fresh and ready as it can be. In more recent years, the IAF took delivery of surplus F-15Ds specifically, as these two-seat models are truly national assets and can serve in very unique support roles, which would be absolutely critical during say an air campaign against Iran. The IAF didn’t just receive these aircraft—which were the oldest D models around—and slap a star of David on them before shoving them into service. Instead, they carefully deconstructed them and rebuilt them, incorporating major modifications so that the aircraft could serve for many years to come. These revamped D models then took the place of worn-out single-seat models. You can learn more about this intricate and proprietary process and why the IAF puts such a high premium on the two-seat Baz in this past piece of ours . Israeli engineers work to drastically overhaul one of the oldest F-15Ds ever built. , IAF So, what does all this have to do with the IAF buying or not buying new F-15s? Before the USAF suddenly decided to buy at least 144 F-15EXs, which will replace a major portion of its F-15C/D fleet, of which around 210 are still in service, 178 of them, the cream of the crop, were slated to be kept flying for decades to come under the Golden Eagle roadmap. Some of the oldest of the lot would likely need new wing sections towards the end of the 2020s, a costly affair, that, along with a number of factors, including force mix concerns and the missions these aircraft would be primarily tasked with— homeland defense and hypersonic missile trucks —pushed the Air Force to buy the F-15EX instead of upgrading its older F-15C/Ds. It’s also worth noting that about a couple dozen or so of the air superiority Eagles still flying with the USAF today are two-seat F-15Ds. Upgraded F-15D Baz climbing into the air., USAF So, with the emergence of the F-15X initiative, all of the sudden, the prospect of over 200 later-production F-15C/Ds, and specifically a couple dozen D models, being designated surplus by the USAF became a very palpable reality. Now that the F-15EX is being officially procured, it is even far more likely at least some of the Air Force’s unwanted F-15s will soon become available. Seeing as the last F-15Ds transferred to Israel cost nothing beyond the upgrades, free is a very good price. This is especially true when a new F-15EX will cost upwards of $80-90M and will take time to move through production. The first F-15EX takes to the skies. , VIKING AERO IMAGES/ALEX FARWELL While Israeli’s pocket force of 25 F-15I jets (based on the Strike Eagle) still is a key element of Israeli’s air combat capability, the introduction of the F-35 and various new forms of standoff weaponry, may have put less emphasis on acquiring brand new 4th generation jets with all the bells and whistles, and more emphasis on procuring weapons trucks and networking platforms that can be tailored by Israel to its exact specifications and loaded with indigenously-developed hardware. If you can get 80% of what you absolutely need out of additional F-15s for 20% of the cost by acquiring second-hand jets, that may be a very hard proposition to pass up. One of the 25 F-15I Strike Eagle derivatives Israel operates today. , USAF In addition, the F-35I, which Israel is also capable of modifying , would be better suited for deep strike missions and operating in highly contested airspace during the opening days of an air campaign, anyway. The F-15 as a rear-echelon long-range tactical support aircraft and weapons truck, capable of carrying far-reaching standoff weapons and providing network connectivity and command and control for other elements, including F-35Is, would still represent a very potent capability at a very attractive price. This is in addition to the F-15C/D’s legendary air-to-air chops. The era of manned- unmanned teaming via ‘loyal wingman’ drones is also drawing near. The two-crew and heavily upgraded F-15D would be an ideal asset for such a capability. F-35I Adirs., IAF There is an even bigger play here potentially. Israel could also pick up around a few dozen late-build F-15Cs to replace its single-seat Baz force, or a portion of it, as well. Most of the USAF F-15Cs are now equipped with the AN/APG-63(V)3 active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar, the most powerful air-to-air fighter radar on earth. This is a multi-million dollar upgrade per jet that the Air Force has already paid for and would likely remain intact in a transfer deal. A newly installed AN/APG-63V3 radar on an F-15C of the 142nd Fighter Wing. , Author/Tyler Rogoway This is not to say that the IAF may not still choose to procure a squadron or two of F-15EX derivatives in a similar way as they procured 25 F-15Is over two decades ago. There are certainly many arguments as to why doing so would be prudent, including the fact that it is very hard to compete with the reliability and longevity of a brand new jet, and the new capabilities of the F-15EX are undeniable. Still, considering their burgeoning indigenous F-15 Baz upgrade program and how far they have gone to restore the oldest D models the USAF had to offer, I have a feeling the role of the F-15 in their mind is more in line with this than with the F-15EX’s advanced capabilities. This way they can add F-15 inventory depth (totally around 50-55 F-15A-D Baz and 25 F-15I Re’am today) where they really need it and buy more F-35s at the same time—there wouldn’t be a heavy tradeoff. In the end, the USAF looks set to put its entire “air superiority Eagle” fleet out to pasture to make room for the F-15EX, which may have presented the IAF with an opportunity they could only have dreamed of just five years ago. If its proprietary F-15 Baz configuration is enough to satisfy its 4th generation heavy fighter needs, and ample stocks of those jets will be becoming available for very low to no cost in the not so distant future, the F-15EX may have become a luxury the IAF no longer needs to pursue, at least at this time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 7, 2021",Behold The Air Force’s Updated F-15 Eagle Family Portrait Including The New F-15EX,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-15EX advanced Eagle has officially arrived. The first of its kind was accepted by the Air Force yesterday and was subsequently ferried from Boeing’s historic St. Louis plant to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida where it will undergo testing. The gravity of the moment cannot be understated. This is the first F-15 to be delivered to the Air Force in 17 years and marks a major shift in fighter procurement that some of us had been begging for, seemingly on deaf ears when it came to the Department of Defense, for many years. The War Zone broke the F-15X story two and a half years ago. While many couldn’t believe it, that original piece, which was very in-depth, remains totally accurate to this day, minus a designation change—the aircraft is now called the F-15EX. You can read all our exhaustive coverage on the program and its aircraft’s looming role within the USAF’s ranks by clicking here and here. We just reported on it today , in fact. There really isn’t much more to say that hasn’t already been said, but the pictures that the USAF has just released are well worth a look. It is truly a back-to-the-future moment for the service’s Air Combat Command and it is the first time we have seen examples of all three current USAF Eagle types, the F-15C/D, F-15E, and F-15EX, side-by-side. Beyond being far more capable than its predecessors, this latest iteration of the Eagle has a 20,000-hour airframe and is likely to be in the inventory for half a century to come—or even longer. The Air Force is focusing on ordering at least 144 to replace the aging F-15C/D fleet, but that could grow. In fact, I bet it will. Now let’s get to the photos: U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 18, 2022",Drunken Ukrainian Air Force Officer Smashed His Volkswagen Into A MiG-29 Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged on social media reportedly showing the aftermath of a collision earlier this week between a Volkswagen Touran and a Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum . A drunken Ukrainian Air Force officer was at the wheel when the accident occurred, which sparked a fire and caused significant damage to the fighter jet. The Ukrainian Air Force’s Air Command Central publicly announced the basic details of the incident shortly after it happened on March 10, 2021, but images showing the damaged MiG-29 and Touran only emerged online today. The accident took place at Vasylkiv Air Base in central Ukraine, which is home to both the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade, to which the Fulcrum belonged, as well as the headquarters of Air Command Central. A picture reportedly showing the rear of the MiG-29 after the accident earlier this week., via Twitter The remains of the Volkswagen Touran after the collision., via Twitter The MiG-29 was being towed at the time of the accident and there was no pilot on board, according to an official statement on Facebook, seen in its original Ukrainian below. The driver suffered injuries, but was in a “satisfactory” condition after receiving first aid. An investigation was immediately launched into the incident. Law enforcement authorities have since disclosed that the Touran was the personal vehicle of a 47-year-old Ukrainian Air Force Captain, whose name does appear to have been released, that was under the influence of alcohol when the accident took place. A new criminal investigation has now been opened into the incident. The pictures reportedly from the scene of the accident that have now appeared on social media, see earlier on in this story and below, align well with official statements that the Touran slammed into the rear of the MiG-29 as it was being towed along the taxiway. The fighter jet’s right engine exhaust nozzle, as well as the tail fin and rear stabilizer on that side of the aircraft, look to have sustained significant damage. There is charring elsewhere on the rear of the aircraft from the subsequent fire. via Twitter via Twitter via Twitter The pictures of the Touran show substantial damage to its front end, which is also consistent with reports that the driver sustained injuries to his face and chest. How long it might take to repair the MiG-29 and return it to service now is unclear. There are unconfirmed reports that the aircraft has been determined to be a total loss, which seems quite likely. The Ukrainian Air Force presently has around 35 MiG-29s in service, including a number of two-seat trainer variants , which, along with a similarly sized force of Su-27 Flankers , form the backbone of the country’s combat aviation capabilities. The country has been in the process of upgrading these aircraft with new and improved radars, defensive systems, navigation suites, and avionics in recent years as part of a two-step modernization effort . A Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 Fulcrum., USAF Alcohol, as well as drug abuse, is hardly a new issue within the Ukrainian military, as well as the rest of the country, at large. These issues have reportedly been exacerbated by increased conscription to meet the demands of the simmering conflict with separatists , backed by actual elements of the Russian military , in the eastern portion of the country. Ukrainian journalist Dmitry Gordon said one individual fighting in a pro-Ukrainian government volunteer unit in 2014 had told him that “our first enemy is separatists and Russian mercenaries, the second one is Ukrainian high command, the third one is alcohol, it is almost impossible to fight against it.” One government advisor described individuals mobilized during the initial phase of the war in 2014-2015 as “alcoholics and [draft] dodgers, drug addicts and morons,” according to John Andrew’s 2016 book The World in Conflict : Understanding the World’s Troublespots . There were also sensational reports in 2015 about at least one Ukrainian unit resorting to using a metal cage as an open-air drunk tank to discipline its soldiers. Ukraine, of course, isn’t the only country to be faced with substance abuse issues within its military. Last October, a video emerged on social media showing drunken Russian troops driving a BMP-3 armored fighting vehicle through a concrete wall along the perimeter of an airport. In 2018, a member of the Virginia Army National Guard went on a drug-fueled joyride in an M577 armored command vehicle, ultimately leading to a bizarre police chase. That individual, former Lieutenant Joshua Philip Yabut, was subsequently found not guilty of various charges by reason of insanity . What charges, and subsequent punishments, might await the Ukrainian Air Force Captain who slammed his Touran into this MiG-29 remain to be seen, as does the final fate of the aircraft itself.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Mar 23, 2021",Modular Solar Generators Could Be Key In Helping Power Remote Bases During A Major Conflict,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While most discussions about defense technology tend to center on weaponry and transportation, one of the most pressing technological concerns for any military operation is energy. It takes quite a bit of energy to power an operating base of any size, especially expeditionary ones that might be in remote areas or locations without sufficient existing energy infrastructure. The Department of Defense is the largest single user of fuel in the world and accounts for 76% of the United States federal government’s total energy usage. Energy costs account for billions of dollars of the DOD’s budget each year, and reducing energy costs and boosting both efficiency and sustainability is a key part of its current energy strategy , but it may also be critical to the success of its future operations. While many new potential energy solutions have been introduced within the Department of Defense (DOD) recently, including beaming energy down to Earth from space and developing new forms of mobile nuclear reactors , the next big revolution in mobile energy production and storage will likely be in the form of solar energy. With that in mind, numerous private companies and DOD-funded organizations are researching and developing methods to leverage the solar system’s largest fusion reactor – the Sun – to provide energy for forward operating bases and other expeditionary operations. Solar panels being installed on top of containerized living units at Camp Lemonnier in the country of Djibouti in East Africa., U.S. Navy As it is now, fuel needs are one of the most significant logistical challenges for sustained military operations. A typical U.S. Army combat brigade has between 3,000 and 5,000 individuals, hundreds of vehicles, as well as equipment and infrastructure to support those assets. Many senior military leaders have in recent years bemoaned the fact that U.S. forces have become too reliant on existing logistical networks and fixed bases of operations, which could be worryingly vulnerable during a major conflict. With this in mind, in 2018, the Army declared it wanted its brigades to be able to operate for up to a week without resupply. At present, three days remains the expectation. So, clearly, there is a lot of work to be done, and it needs to be done fast based on the strategic realities looming on the horizon. The cost of transporting fuel to its endpoint also adds significantly to the cost-per-gallon the Department of Defense pays for fuel. In 2015, the DOD was paying between $25 and $35 a gallon for fuel supplied from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar to forward operating bases in Iraq and Syria. To help mitigate or reduce those costs, the DOD’s Fiscal Year 2021 Operational Energy Budget Certification Report states that every branch of the U.S. armed forces is researching new methods to harness solar power in order to “increase warfighter capability.” At times, though, there has been conflict at the highest levels of government over how much investment the DOD should make into renewable energies. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, solar power currently accounts for close to sixty percent of current planned DOD renewable energy addition. Since most of the current innovation in energy production is occurring in the private sector, as is the case with many emerging technologies, it’s likely some of these commercial technologies could soon show up on the battlefield. As an example of what might soon be deployed, one Poland-based company, MOVEit.tech , has developed highly modular mobile units designed specifically for armed forces applications. Their self-unloading solar systems that fit inside a standard 20-foot and 40-foot ISO shipping container and have been described as a “perfect solution to supply energy to all sorts of military bases and conflict zones.” Aside from uses aimed at expeditionary military use, the company also intends their modular solar units to be used for applications such as irrigation, humanitarian aid, construction sites, and remote oil and gas exploration. According to their blog , MOVEit.tech offers several configurations of its solar power systems, which are designed to run indefinitely without any need for resupply. Coupled with high-capacity battery systems, all packed in the same container, such a mobile solar power plant could supply a forward operating base in sunny areas, such as the desserts of the Middle East or islands in the Pacific, with a near-constant source of renewable energy. The units can be opened up either automatically or manually using hydraulic actuators that unfold the array in minutes. Several of the MOVEit.tech systems possess sensors that can track the sun’s movement automatically to ensure peak power output. It literally is a ‘drop it in and deploy’ solution. MOVEit.tech’s smallest unit, the SunBOX 35a, can produce up to 13.5kW at peak output. One of the most common diesel generators used by the DOD, the MEP-12A, by contrast, can produce output upwards of 700kW, but consumes around 55 gallons of fuel per hour . Clearly, any larger installation depending on these mobile solar plants would require multiple units. Still, eliminating some of the need to transport and constantly be resupplied with gobs of fuel could make such mobile solar units a viable, if not a critical option for expeditionary energy needs. MOVEit.tech is far from the only group that is developing solar energy harvesting technologies aimed at armed forces use cases. Companies such as Simpliphi Power , OK Solar , and SunWize are all developing systems intended specifically for military expeditionary forces. SimpliPhi Power develops mobile and modular systems for the Marine Corps and U.S. Army., SimpliphiPower.com There are plenty of solar research and development projects housed within the DOD, as well. The Air Force Research Laboratory has been developing a concept known as the “complete expeditionary microgrid system” composed of silicon solar panels placed on the tops of tents, along with batteries and a command, control, and communication software package that can supply on-site, mobile energy for expeditionary forces. A test of the complete expeditionary microgrid system at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas., USAF/Jason Goins In a 2017 DOD press release , Air Force 1st Lieutenant Jason Goins, project engineer for the expeditionary microgrid system, said that the concept was intended to be self-sufficient and easy to set up rapidly. “We demonstrated feasibility and where to go next in terms of making complete microgrid systems. Pieces of individual equipment have been demonstrated separately, and by combining them into a microgrid we learned how well they worked synergistically. We are taking what we learned and applying it to a rapidly deployable system,” Goins said. “We are looking at something that will be set up and deployed in an hour. If you can power a shelter in 30 minutes with affordable solar and wind, that’s spectacular.” Similar systems have been tested on expeditionary bases in East Africa by the U.S. Navy within the last decade and a 2012 Marine Corps case study conducted in Afghanistan found that solar panels reduced diesel demand by 50% at forward operating bases. This is an absolutely remarkable reduction to comprehend when you consider the logistical footprint of moving that much fuel to these forward positions. It’s not even about being able to power everything, either. Just being able to keep critical systems, such as command and control, communications, defensive systems, and medical facilities online for a period of time if logistics become disrupted could be absolutely essential, if not life-saving. This is especially true when fighting a near-peer state actor in a theater, such as the Pacific, where access to huge amounts of diesel will be less assured than pretty much anytime during the Global War On Terror. Considering the services’ emerging plans to rapidly set up bases in austere locations , operate for a short period of time, and then move to a new location quickly, being able to deploy entire solar farms in a shipping container that has very minimal manpower requirements to set up and run would be hugely advantageous. In fact, it may be absolutely necessary. Furthermore, as electricity demands at austere locations grow, with new directed energy weapons , next-generation sensors, and advanced communications systems hitting the front lines, additional and redundant power generation capabilities will be needed. With all this in mind, there seems to be an opportunity for the U.S. military to embrace solar more deeply as part of a cocktail or alternative energy solutions in order to make its expeditionary operations dreams a reality and to rely less on supply lines that could very well become deeply disrupted during a peer state conflict.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 7, 2021",Israel Has Been Launching Clandestine Attacks On Iranian Shipping: Report (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report says that Israel has been conducting a clandestine campaign of attacks on Iranian ships carrying oil , as well as weaponry, to Syria for more than a year. If true, this would raise a host of new questions about other incidents, including an alleged attack on an Israeli-owned cargo ship and an oil spill off the coast of Israel, both of which have been blamed on Iran. This also follows reports of an explosion or fire on board an Iranian container ship in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea yesterday, though the exact details about that incident, which remains unconfirmed, are murky. The Wall Street Journal dropped its exclusive story on these reported Israeli attacks on March 11, 2021. The outlet reached to Israeli and Iranian officials, none of whom would respond to the claims. The newspaper said that Israel’s campaign against Iranian shipping began in late 2019 and has targeted at least 12 ships using “weaponry including water mines.”Â A picture Iranian authorities released after an alleged attack, which Israel may have carried out, on the country’s oil tanker Sabiti in the Red Sea in October 2019., National Iranian Oil Tanker Company The ostensible goal of the reported Israeli campaign is to put economic pressure on Iran, which regularly sends oil to Syrian refineries in that country’s coastal city of Baniyas. This serves the interests of these countries as Iranian oil exports and Syria’s refineries are both the target of significant international sanctions , including from the United States and the European Union. This also means that the attacks would have a secondary impact on Syria’s economy. U.S. officials have also said that Iranian ships believed to be carrying weapons throughout the region have also been targeted, according to the Wall Street Journal . This would mean the attacks could also be intended to disrupt the flow of support from Tehran to various proxy groups across the Middle East. No Iranian ships have been sunk in any of these attacks and there have been no reported casualties. However, sources within Iran’s shipping industry said that at least two tankers have been forced to return to the country after sustaining significant damage, according to the Journal ‘s report. The story did not identify any of the ships that have suffered attacks directly, nor did it say where or when any such attacks had occurred. None of these incidents appear to have been publicly announced by Iranian authorities. “We are trying to keep a low profile,” one Iranian shipping professional told the Journal . â€œIt would look like a sign of weakness.â€ The report did include pictures, seen earlier in this story, of the Sabiti an Iranian oil tanker that was rocked by two explosions while sailing in the Red Sea in October 2019. That incident, which resulted in a spill of approximately 100,000 barrels worth of oil, has remained largely unexplained since then. New information indicates that Israel attacks Iranian #oil tankers, raising major red flags. In particular over environmental pollution caused in international waters. This includes the SABITI tanker, causing a 100k barrel large oil spill in 2019 1/x https://t.co/u5jplBg1QL pic.twitter.com/8KtrDYLEz6 — Wim Zwijnenburg (@wammezz) March 11, 2021 At the time, Iranian officials said that the incident was an “attack” and Iranian state media outlets said the ship had been hit by a pair of missiles. Pictures that were subsequently released showed damage more consistent with limpet mines , which attach to the side of ships using powerful magnets, and can be placed by combat divers or personnel in small boats , which would be in line with this new report. This is a tactic, ironically, that Iran and its proxies have employed in their own attacks on tankers across the Middle East in recent years.Â Just today, still unconfirmed reports emerged about an incident of some kind that occurred onboard the Shahr E Kord , an Iranian-flagged container ship sailing in the Eastern Mediterranean on its way to Syria, on March 10. Pictures subsequently appeared on social media that could show an attack or an accident of some kind. https://t.co/YOmIJy0FMK additional photos of the vessel show the green/yellow paint scheme shown in the unconfirmed photos in the previous tweet, so they appear to align with the vessel. — Aurora Intel (@AuroraIntel) March 11, 2021 This particular ship suffered a cargo fire while sailing in the Red Sea in July 2019 and some observers have raised the possibility that the pictures may be from that incident, rather than from any new one. Maritime risk intelligence firm Ambrey did Tweet out that online ship tracking software showed that “the vessel did slow and deviate while underway,” which suggests that something did indeed happen. The Wall Street Journal said that it could not determine immediately if this event was in any way related to the Israeli anti-shipping campaign detailed in its report. #ISRAEL ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡±: Reports that the Iran-flagged container ship SHAHR E KORD suffered an incident yesterday morning in the Eastern Mediterranean remain unconfirmed.

At that time, Syria’s state-run SANA news agency had released pictures it said showed holes in these pipelines, which authorities said were caused by explosive charges. Images that Syrian officials claims showed the aftermath of attacks on pipelines linking refineries in Baniyas to offshore mooring points., SANA News Agency If the Wall Street Journal ‘s reporting is accurate, this also brings up the possibility that a pair of recent maritime incidents, which Israel has blamed on Iran, could possibly have been in direct retaliation for the attacks on Iranian ships. Sometime between Feb. 1 and 2, 2021, an oil spill occurred that resulted in balls of tar washing up along approximately 90 percent of Israel’s 118-mile-long Mediterranean coastline. This the worst environmental disaster in the country in many years and “there are fears it will take months, or even years, to clean up the tar,” according to a report from the BBC . Some Israeli officials have since blamed the oil tanker Emerald , which is flagged in the Marshall Islands and was previously owned by Libya’s state-run General National Maritime Transport Company, but may now be linked to Iran, for the spill. In addition, “we think the leak that affected us was not during the transfer of oil from Emerald to smaller ships, but either a deliberate leak â€“ that is to say terror â€“ or an accident,” Rani Amir, the Director-General of Israel’s Environmental Protection Ministry said at a press conference earlier this month. It is worth noting that the Israeli media outlets, citing unnamed intelligence and defense officials, subsequently reported that it was unlikely that this was a deliberate act of environmental terrorism, whether or not Emerald was the source. Separately, on Feb. 25, 2021, the Israeli-owned, by Bahamian-flagged cargo ship Helios Ray , sailing in the Gulf of Oman at the time, suffered what Israeli authorities have since alleged was an attack carried out by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Iranian authorities have responded by accusing Israel of carrying out a false flag attack on the ship in order to smear Iran.

This includes largely unacknowledged airstrikes against Iranian-backed groups in Syria and Iraq , as well as explosions and fires at various sites in Iran, including at a key facility supporting the country’s controversial nuclear program. Israel is also widely believed to have been responsible for the assassination of top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in a brazen attack last year on the car he was riding in, which may have involved the use of a gun mounted on a remotely-operated turret concealed inside another vehicle. The Wall Street Journal ‘s report also comes as U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration are seeking rapprochement with Iran and are looking to negotiate America’s return to a controversial multi-national deal with Tehran over its nuclear program. Then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from this agreement in 2018. Iranian authorities have steadily violated more and more of the terms of the deal themselves since then in order to put pressure on the remaining parties, especially U.S. allies France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his administration , as well as a number of U.S. legislators , are opposed to this diplomatic engagement with Iranian officials, as well as any discussion of relaxing American sanctions on the regime in Iran. The Biden administration has made clear that it will not offer sanctions relief to get Iran back into compliance with the deal or as a precondition to negotiations about America’s return to the agreement. The public disclosure of this reported Israeli campaign against Iran’s oil tankers and other commercial ships could put a certain new pressure on Israel, which will now be faced with the likelihood of new, potentially more overt responses from Iran and its regional proxies. These could certainly translate into more obvious retaliatory attacks, which could beget further tit-for-tat Israeli reactions. At the same time, this report, if true, would certainly underscore Israel’s willingness to take matters into its own hands to stymie Iran from carrying out various levels of malign activity, or simply cut it off from critical funding streams, if it feels that to be necessary to protect its national security. UPDATE 3/12/21: Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line (IRISL) Group, the operator of the container ship Shahr E Kord , has now publicly claimed that the incident onboard the vessel earlier this week was a “terrorist” attack, but has not provided hard evidence to substantiate this allegation. As such, it remains unclear if the incident, which appears to have involved an explosion and subsequent fire inside one of the containers on the ship, is actually related to Israel’s clandestine campaign against Iranian shipping. Regardless, IRISL said that the damage was minimal and that the ship was continuing on to its final destination.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 31, 2021",Northrop Grumman Reveals Sky Viper Chain Gun And New Suicide Drone For Future Helicopters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman is working on a new loitering munition , a type of weapon also commonly known as a “ suicide drone ,” as well as other technologies, to meet requirements the U.S. Army has outlined as part of its Air Launch Effects program , or ALE. The company is also developing a 20mm derivative of the 30mm M230 chain gun , dubbed Sky Viper. All of this is related to the Army’s Future Vertical Lift effort, or FVL, which is seeking various types of new rotary-wing aircraft with advanced capabilities to replace various existing helicopters that the service operates now. The Virginia-headquartered defense contractor provided information about the suicide drone and automatic cannon during a media roundtable on March 10, 2021. Northrop Grumman is not, at least at present, leading the development of an actual aircraft to meet any existing FVL requirements. The two major programs underway now are the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), a new armed scout helicopter , and the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA), a replacement for the UH-60 Black Hawk family. A UVision Hero 400EC loitering munition. Northrop Grumman’s new air-launched suicide drone is based in part on the Hero 400 design. , UVision However, the company’s various divisions are working with the Army in relation to a host of new and existing systems that could be added to any future helicopters the service acquires. This also includes radars, directional infrared countermeasures systems (DIRCM), navigation and communications systems, and networking capabilities, as well as an open-architecture mission systems “backbone,” known as the Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA), to bring all of that together. The loitering munition that Northrop Grumman is pitching for the ALE program’s requirement for a “lethal” system is a hybrid design that blends technology it has developed with components of the Hero 120 and Hero 400 suicide drones from Israel’s UVision . The resulting system is called the Hero ALE and will be built in the United States, along with other Hero-series designs, by UVision USA, a wholly-owned, U.S.-based subsidiary of UVision. The Hero 120 is the largest offering in UVision’s “tactical” line of loitering munitions, weighing around 27 and a half pounds, including a 10-pound warhead. It uses an electric motor to drive a propeller at the rear and has a maximum endurance of around 60 minutes. UVision offers two Hero 400 designs, both of which are part of its “operational” line, meant for engaging targets outside of an immediate tactical environment. The standard Hero 400 , which uses a gasoline-powered engine, and the electrically-powered Hero 400EC , weigh just over 88 pounds. The Hero 400EC is effectively a scaled-up version of the smaller Hero drones, while the Hero 400 has a distinctly different planform. Loitering munitions , which Israeli companies pioneered and continue to be leaders in the development of , are, in general, a sort of hybrid between traditional missiles and small unmanned aircraft. Many designs are recoverable, as well, allowing for their refurbishment and reuse if they do not find a target during the course of their flight. They often feature a man-in-the-loop-type control system that allows an operator to see what the drone sees through its onboard sensors, offering surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as strike capabilities. Each design in UVision’s Hero family has a sensor turret in the nose with both electro-optical and infrared cameras that can be used for surveillance, as well as zeroing in on a target. This arrangement also allows the user to make finely-tuned course adjustments right up until the moment of impact, offering added accuracy, even against moving targets. In addition, it means that a strike can be more readily aborted, almost at the last possible moment, should circumstances change, such as the sudden appearance of innocent bystanders. Loitering munitions can also be equipped with guidance packages that allow them to autonomously or semi-autonomously engage targets, including ones in motion, using various kinds of sensors. They could be directed to strike a specific fixed location, as well. They can also be designed to zero in on electromagnetic emissions , such as those from radars or communications nodes, something that has made them particularly useful for suppressing and destroying enemy air defenses, missions collectively referred to as SEAD/DEAD. This is one of the mission sets that the Army has already outlined for its future ALEs. An “Operation View” (OV) showing how the Army sees “lethal” ALEs, as well as other air-launched drones and advanced weapon systems, fitting into its future combat aviation plans., US Army It’s not clear which Hero 400 type Northrop Grumman is leveraging for the Hero ALE, but UVision says that both the Hero 400 and Hero 400EC have a maximum range of just over 93 miles. However, the Hero 400 has a significantly longer endurance, at up to four hours of flying time, compared to the Hero 400EC’s ability to stay aloft for no more than two hours. However, Northrop Grumman did say that it would compatible with the Army’s existing M299 and M310 missile launchers . These are four and two-rail launchers, respectively, that the service primarily uses at present to fire Hellfire missiles , though they are compatible with other weapons, including the new Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM). Currently, these launchers are most commonly associated with the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, though they are also used on the elite 160th Special Operations aviation Regiment’s (SOAR) MH-60L/M Black Hawks in the armed Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) configuration. U.S. Marine Corps AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters and U.S. Navy MH-60R and MH-60S Seahawks , among other types worldwide , also use them, again primarily to launch Hellfires. A US Army AH-64 Apache with M299 missile launchers on the inboard pylons on its stub wings. One of the launchers has a single Hellfire missile loaded onto it., US Army UVision’s website says that the Hero 400EC can be employed from an unspecified “rail launcher,” as well as a fully-encapsulated launch canister. The launch options for the Hero 400 are only described as “launcher/canister.” Northrop Grumman did not offer any details about the Hero ALE’s expected performance or other capabilities, but did say that minimum launch altitude would be determined by how powerful the launching aircraft’s rotorwash is, which would push the drone down, at least to some degree, as it leaves the rail. To help compensate for this, the Hero ALE will have a small rocket booster to immediately accelerate it to a speed of 120 feet per second for a short time to get it out from under the rotorwash. The Army’s ALE requirements, which you can read more about in detail in this past War Zone piece , also call for a heavy emphasis on swarming capabilities. Those swarms could also include air-launched drones with non-kinetic payloads, as well. During the media roundtable, Northrop Grumman also disclosed that it is providing a payload called Small Wonder as part of the development of other ALEs to fulfill the program’s requirements for systems able to “detect, identify, locate, and report” on targets and act as decoys. Details about Small Wonder are limited, but the company said that it has electronic support measures (ESM), electronic attack , and anti-radiation homing capabilities. Electronic warfare, in general, including as a capability for swarming drones , is a growing area of interest across the U.S. military, as well as other armed forces around the world . Details about the Sky Viper chain gun are also limited at present. The weapon is, as already noted, based on the larger M230 design, which is most notably the primary weapon on the AH-64 Apache. Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, previously Orbital ATK, does offer a lighter-weight, low-recoil M230LF version , but the Army has a requirement for a 20mm weapon as part of its FARA program. Another computer-generated view of the Sky Viper chain gun., Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman says that its focus during the development of Sky Viper has been on increased accuracy, as well as lighter weight and lower recoil. The company says the gun will have a higher rate of fire than the M230, which spits out shells at a rate of around 625 rounds per minute, which could help make it more accurate. A faster firing gun means projectiles would leave the barrel in more rapid succession, limiting their exposure to recoil forces during relatively short, controlled bursts. A high degree of accuracy could also mean that any helicopter armed with Sky Viper might not need to carry as much ammunition, since it would be able to use the rounds it does have more effectively and efficiently. This argument, coupled with the compact nature of the gun itself due to its lightweight, low-recoil design, could make it very attractive for FARA designs, where available physical space and payload capacity, which could be limited due to stealthy design features, will also be needed for the integration of various other advanced systems. Northrop Grumman also says it will be developing a new family of 20mm ammunition to go along with Sky Viper. This includes work on rounds optimized for engaging small drones, which is already a real and growing battlefield threat. The company has already tested 30mm air-bursting rounds in the counter-drone role in the past. More details about both the Hero ALE and Sky Viper are likely to emerge in the coming months. Northrop Grumman says it is looking to demonstrate the loitering munition’s capabilities in September. It has also done risk reduction work on non-firing prototypes of the chain gun and is now building its first fully-functional prototype. With regards to Sky Viper specifically, it’s important to note that the Army is presently planning to use the XM915 , a three-barrel Gatling-type cannon from General Dynamics, as part of the testing of prototype FARA designs from Bell and Sikorsky , the latter of which is now a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. However, Northrop Grumman says it is coordinating the development of its cannon with the Army as a possible competing offering on whatever helicopter the service ultimately chooses as the winner of the FARA competition. Sky Viper, as well as the work Northrop Grumman is doing in support of the ALE effort, could be of interest to other U.S. military services, as well as foreign customers, as well. The U.S. Marine Corps has expressed interest in FLRAA in the past and is running a separate program, called the Attack Utility Replacement Aircraft (AURA), seeking possible replacements for its AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters and UH-1Y Venom armed light utility helicopters. Earlier this year, the U.S. Navy also announced the start of its search for possible replacements for its MH-60R/S Seahawks, as well as its MQ-8B/C Fire Scout drone helicopters. All of these efforts are likely to be informed by the Army’s FVL initiative, as well as the various subsystems being developed to support that program, at least on some level. We will definitely be keeping our eyes out for new details about the Hero ALE, Sky Viper, and other projects that Northrop Grumman, and others, are working on as part of the broader and rapidly developing FVL initiative.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 12, 2020",The Pentagon Is Once Again Considering Early Retirement For One Of Its Aircraft Carriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon is reportedly revisiting the idea of retiring the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman early, after having abandoned the very same proposal only a few years ago in the face of massive pushback from Congress . This renewed debate is part of larger review of the service plans for its future carrier fleets and overall shipbuilding priorities within the context of the upcoming Fiscal Year 2022 defense budget request. USNI News first reported the development yesterday, citing two unnamed sources “familiar with the discussions.” This comes ahead of the Fiscal Year 2022 budget submission to Congress, President Joe Biden’s first, which reportedly seeks to trim the previous Trump administration’s base budget proposal from $722 billion down to no more than $704 billion. The new budget is reportedly expected to be unveiled in May. USS Harry S. Truman. , USN The USNI News story also describes how House Armed Services Seapower and Projection forces ranking member Congressman Rob Wittman asked U.S. Indo-Pacific Command commander Admiral Phil Davidson yesterday if he thought it would make sense to remove a carrier from the Navy’s 11-strong fleet. “There is no capability that we have that can substitute for an aircraft carrier in my view,” Admiral Davidson responded. A Wittman spokesperson later told the publication that the question was hypothetical and reflected earlier moves to reduce the carrier fleet. Deleting a carrier is, however, just one option seemingly under consideration as the Pentagon weighs up its entire shipbuilding plans under the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), a wide-ranging review of the future shape of the fleet that also considers alternative carrier studies. Indeed, according to USNI News , shipbuilding is the top priority when it comes to the FY 2022 budget request. While you can read more about the implications of CAPE in this previous story , one of the options is to look again at the potential offered by a new class of light aircraft carriers , or CVLs. In the recent past, the Navy has considered designs based on the aviation-focused America class amphibious assault ships as well as a “light” derivative of the Ford class supercarriers, among others. A smaller carrier would be cheaper than the Ford class and, perhaps, could offer other benefits too, as The War Zone has explored in detail in the past. Moreover, they could be a way of retaining the 11-carrier fleet — or expanding to an even larger carrier force — that would also help meet the ambitions of the Navy’s Battle Force 2045 proposal, which you can read about in these previous War Zone pieces . In fact, the studies for a fleet of 500-plus ships that went into Battle Force 2045 recommended, in some cases, cutting the total number of supercarrier hulls in favor of CVLs. The America class amphibious assault ship could potentially serve as design a starting point for a new light carrier., U.S. Navy Back in 2019, the Trump administration looked at taking the Nimitz class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75). Under the proposal, the carrier would have been retired early sometime in the mid-2020s and the money saved, it was argued, would have helped fund another two ships (the third and fourth) in the follow-on Ford class . But the plan to retire Truman was abandoned the same year. “I am overriding the Decommission Order of the magnificent aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman , built in 1998 (fairly new), and considered one of the largest and finest in the world,” Trump tweeted out in May 2019. “It will be updated at a fraction of the cost of a new one (which also are being built)!” In fact, there was no “decommission order” to rescind, but, for whatever reason, the Trump administration shelved the idea. Now, according to those same sources, the proposal to retire Truman is back on the table. In practice, that would likely mean the carrier would be withdrawn from service after around 25 years of use, instead of completing the carrier’s planned mid-life rehab process , also known as Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), that would have made it fit for service through 2048. The aircraft carrier USS George Washington begins the transit to Newport News, Virginia, to undergo a Refueling and Complex Overhaul., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Alora R. Blosch In 2019, The War Zone looked in detail at why the proposal to retire the Truman early was unlikely to proceed, not least due to opposition from a Congress that has enshrined in law a requirement for the Navy to have at least 11 carriers in service at any time. That still holds true today. With plans to commission the next Ford class carrier, the future USS John F. Kennedy , in 2024, decommissioning Truman could end up with the Navy breaking the law. Meanwhile, the Navy itself has also consistently campaigned for more carriers, not fewer. Back in 2016, for example, the Navy determined that the optimal number was 12 . The future USS John F. Kennedy (CVN 79), procured in 2013 and, as of last year, calculated to cost $13 billion., MC2 RIDGE LEONI/U.S. NAVY There is also the very real concern that the available carrier fleet is already being pushed close to its limits. Last December, the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt left port to begin its second operational deployment of the year, while the crew of its sister ship USS Dwight D. Eisenhower prepared to do the same. Known as “double pump” deployments, these are driven by increasing demand for aircraft carriers to support U.S. military operations around the world, at a time when a significant number of flattops are tied up undergoing maintenance and major overhauls. For its part, the lead ship of the class, USS Nimitz , returned to its homeport last month after a grueling 10 months at sea; in the process of that deployment, there was a period when the Navy had no aircraft carrier in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. USS Theodore Roosevelt sails alongside its sister ship, USS Nimitz, in the South China Sea earlier this year., U.S. NAVY/MASS COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST 3RD CLASS ELLIOT SCHAUDT Meanwhile, all the other same arguments that were made against decommissioning in 2019 remain relevant today. Prominent among these is the lack of evidence that removing a carrier from the inventory earlier than planned is good value for money. Back then, it was said that $3.4 billion would be needed to keep Truman operational for another 25 years, a relative bargain compared to buying a new Ford -class aircraft carrier over the same period. Ultimately, the debate over Truman ’s future may have been more about attempting to secure additional funding from Congress, rather than about cutting costs. As it turned out, the Ford block buy, used as an argument in favor of retiring Truman , was approved anyway. In addition, the process of actually decommissioning a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is costly in itself, with a price tag of $2.5 billion back in 2014 . The effort to decommission the USS Enterprise , the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, has been notably costly and complicated, a saga you can read about here . It is worth bearing in mind, too, that a similar proposal to off another carrier, USS George Washington , in 2014 under President Barack Obama, met a similar fate, although in that case, the battle with Congress dragged out for nearly a year . USS George Washington (CVN 73) steams in the Indian Ocean in 2011. Three years later, the supercarrier survived proposals calling for its retirement., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2rd Class Adam K. Thomas Whatever the next defense budget request brings, it is perhaps surprising that consideration is again being given to retiring Truman early, only a few years after Congress crushed the very same idea.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 2, 2021",F-15EX’s Future Role As A Hypersonic Missile Truck Touted Officially By The Air Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has officially accepted delivery of its first F-15EX fighter , the first new F-15 of any kind it has acquired in years, which is now headed to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida to begin testing. At the same time, the service appears to have confirmed that these aircraft will have roles beyond air-to-air combat, notably as launch platforms for future hypersonic missiles . Boeing, the manufacturer of the F-15EX, formally turned the first jet over to the Air Force at its facility in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 10, 2021. The aircraft, which has the serial number 20-001, was spotted flying in that area in its full Air Force paint scheme, including Eglin Air Force Base tail codes, last month, just weeks after its first flight . The service hopes to eventually buy at least 144 of these aircraft to replace its aging F-15C/D Eagles and there have also been discussions about acquiring more of them to supplant its F-15E Strike Eagles , as well. The first F-15EX fighter jet for the US Air Force., Viking Aero Images “This is a big moment for the Air Force,” Air Force Colonel Sean Dorey, the F-15EX Program Manager at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Centerâ€™s Fighters and Advanced Aircraft Directorate, said in a statement . “With its large weapons capacity, digital backbone, and open architecture, the F-15EX will be a key element of our tactical fighter fleet and complement 5th-generation assets.” Derived from the F-15QA Advanced Eagle that Boeing developed for Qatar, the F-15EX is the most advanced version of the jet presently in production, as you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces . In addition, while the Air Force’s primary focus is on replacing its F-15C/D jets, which are exclusively used in air-to-air combat roles , the F-15EX’s payload capacity inherently opens a path for the aircraft to take on other mission sets. ðŸ‘‹ Farewell to the first #F15EX for the @USAirForce ! This fighter is ready for its new home with @TeamEglin . pic.twitter.com/cqOLt02hJX — Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) March 11, 2021 “In addition, itâ€™s capable of carrying hypersonic weapons, giving it a niche role in future near-peer conflicts,” Colonel Dorey, the Air Force’s F-15EX Program Manager, said in his statement. This role has been hinted at by both the service and Boeing in the past and was something that we here at The War Zone posited could be a secondary mission set for the aircraft when we broke the F-15EX story back in 2018. This does appear to be the first official confirmation that it is, at least, actively being explored as a role for these new aircraft. It’s not clear what, if any, specific hypersonic weapon the Air Force might be looking at integrating onto the F-15EX already, but there are a number of possible options, including multiple air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles , in various stages of development now. Boeing, in the past, has said that the F-15EX’s centerline pylon can accommodate weapons up to 22 feet long and that weigh up to around 7,000 pounds. It has shown off a model with a notional 7,300-pound hypersonic missile previously, as well. Whatever weapons the F-15EXs might carry in the future, the hypersonic launch platform role only underscores that these aircraft will not simply replace older F-15s, but will also give Air Force units equipped with them significant new capabilities. The F-15EX’s range and payload capabilities make it one of, if not the best available choice for a tactical jet to carry hypersonic missiles, especially over longer distances. For the Air Force, having this added capacity to employ hypersonic weapons at extended ranges is only becoming more important, especially as concerns about the peer-state threat in the Pacific from China are growing.Â Testing of various kinds will be necessary before any F-15EXs can enter operational service in any role. A second test jet is also in the latter stages of construction and the Air Force expects to take delivery of it next month. The service says it expects to receive four more examples in the 2023 Fiscal Year. However, it’s very possible that the delivery of all of these Lot 1 jets could be completed sooner than that.Â Any contracts for subsequent jets will likely have to wait until the Air Force makes a formal decision about what engines will power them. The first six F-15EXs will have General Electric F110-GE-129s, but the service plans to hold a competition to select the powerplants for any future examples. Pratt & Whitney’s F100-PW-229 is the main competitor to General Electric’s offering. You can read more about the engine issue in detail in this past War Zone piece . In the meantime, the Air Force is working hard to expedite the testing and evaluation processes for the F-15EX to hopefully speed up its entry into service. The first jet is going to the 40th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin, while the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron will receive the second. The plan is for those two squadrons to conduct developmental and operational testing simultaneously . “To expedite the testing needed to declare the F-15EX ready for operations, the team will use previous testing data from F-15 foreign military sales variants and U.S.-only subsystems and Operational Flight Program software,” according to the Air Force . The service has also made a potentially controversial decision to waive the need for full-up survivability testing on these aircraft, based in part on the availability of existing data, a decision it says will save $108 million and shorten the entire testing process by one year. It is worth noting that the F-15EX will be equipped with the new Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS), a new radar warning and electronic warfare suite now in development that you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . Work on this system will entail extensive testing that will produce its own survivability data that will be applicable to the F-15EX, as well. Regardless, the Air Force’s goal is to begin delivery of F-15EXs to the Oregon Air National Guard’s 173rd Fighter Wing , the Air National Guard’s main F-15C/D training unit, based at Kingsley Field, in the 2024 Fiscal Year. The 142nd Fighter Wing, another unit assigned to the Oregon Air National Guard and based at the Portland Air National Guard Base, would then become the first operational unit to operate the type in Fiscal Year 2025. An Oregon Air National Guard F-15C Eagle seen wearing a commemorative paint scheme in 2016., Lyla Jansma What other units now equipped with the F-15C/Ds might subsequently receive F-15EXs remains to be seen. All of this notably comes amid a major review of the tactical airpower force structure across the entire Air Force, to include the Air National Guard. Major changes in planning are now being openly discussed, including the acquisition of new F-16 fighter jets , reductions in planned purchases of F-35A stealth fighters, and greater integration of unmanned platforms . The Air Force has already been experimenting with using F-15C/D Eagles as aerial launch platforms for networked “loyal wingman” type drones , another role that the F-15EX could potentially assume in the future. The Air Force’s long-standing plans to buy more than 1,700 F-35As, the projected sustainment costs for which have been steadily growing , have been under particular scrutiny in recent weeks, including from members of Congress. â€œWhat does the F-35 give us? Is there a way to cut our losses?” Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington State who currently chairs the House Armed Service Committee, said during a hearing last week. “Is there a way to not keep spending so much money for such a low capability, because the sustainment costs are brutal,” he continued, acknowledging that it would be virtually impossible to simply “get rid of the [F-35] program,” but saying he favored a more balanced mix of types. â€œI want to stop throwing money down that particular rat hole.” Two F-35As, at top, fly together with a pair of F-15E Strike Eagles., USAF At the same time, the Air Force has stressed that the F-35A remains an important part of its future force structure plans. That being said, â€œyou donâ€™t drive your Ferrari to work every day, you only drive it on Sundays,” Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Brown had said in February. “This is our â€˜high endâ€™ [fighter], we want to make sure we donâ€™t use it all for the low-end fight.” By every indication, the F-15EX, which the Air Force now has now gotten its first example of, looks more and more set to be an extremely important part of that future mix of aerial combat capabilities, including as a launch platform for hypersonic weapons.

The U.S. Air Force ran a complex large force test event from March 2nd through the 4th, 2021, that incorporated some of its most advanced platforms, and likely included exotic technology that still remains in the shadows. The first combined Orange and Black Flag event ran over three days in the R-2508 range complex in California and Nevada Test and Training Range , or NTTR, focusing on “kill-web” integration and survivability for stealthy platforms against high-tech adversaries as its core elements. The War Zone previously detailed how Black Flag has emerged as “the Super Bowl” of large force employment testing, and is now being used by the 53rd Wing to provide a high-end trial for new technology and tactics that are under operational evaluation. It is also designed to go after Tactics Improvement Proposals, known as TIPs, that are dreamed-up up at Air Combat Command’s annual Weapons and Tactics Conference, known as WEPTAC. F-22 high over Edwards AFB., USAF Now, Black Flag has been run in parallel with Orange Flag , which is led by the Air Force Test Center’s 412th Test Wing out of Edwards Air Force Base , California. Orange Flag is focused on the developmental test activities that are conducted there, while Black Flag is geared towards operational tests. The move is designed to align objectives, resources, and participants between the two in order to provide better test data in a robust, operationally-relevant, environment. It also more closely conjoins development and operational testing. “Orange Flag started three years ago with the intent to assess integration of warfighting systems in a dense threat, operationally representative environment,” said Major General Christopher Azzano, AFTC commander. These so-called “Test Flags” are the premier large force test events, which support testing of Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), and to validate new tactics and technologies for warfighting forces. “By combining resources and some objectives with the Orange Flag enterprise, we were able to achieve desired test objectives at minimal cost to the government,” said Captain Clifford “Champ” Peterson, an F-16 pilot with the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), and mission commander of Black Flag 21-1. “Due to the combined nature of the events, we were able to get both highly data driven developmental test objectives and more operationally-focused and accurate objectives completed for similar tests.” F-22 Raptors from the test fleet at Edwards AFB were involved in the latest exercise., USAF/Kyle Larson “Orange Flag focuses on technical integration across a breadth of Technology Readiness Levels [TRLs], while Black Flag focuses on the tactical integration of more mature technologies,” explained Major Brandon “Siphon” Burfeind, an F-22 Raptor pilot and the director for this latest Orange Flag event. “We worked together on a previous iteration in 2020, and shared resources, but this was the first time we shared the mission planning process under Orange Flag as a filter for participants flowing into Black Flag.” The March event included three Vulnerability Periods, known as VULs, which are the main live phases of the proceedings. Major Burfeind explained: “We had three total events — two Orange Flag VULs — a four-hour daytime one and then a 2.5-hour night VUL in the R-2508 range complex north of Edwards, and then one daytime Black Flag VUL in the NTTR. Because of our goal of being operationally representative against modern threats, Orange Flag requires highly capable range complexes, so we generally execute in both the NTTR and R-2508, or the Sea Test Range off the coast of California if we need an over-water capability.” “The past three Orange Flags have used the NTTR and R-2508 combined, and for this event that was also the plan, until about two-weeks prior when some administrative issues, plus a lack of need, meant we ended just using R-2508. We did have a couple of participants operating in the NTTR for the Orange Flag portion, but we didn’t use the whole thing like we normally would.” An F-22A photographed during the combined test event in March., USAF/Kyle Larson “This was the first time that we had aligned core elements [of Orange and Black Flag],” Burfeind exclusively told The War Zone . This centered upon kill-web integration across the USAF, U.S. Navy, Army, the Marine Corps, and U.S. Space Force and included a wide array of platforms, systems, sensors and tactical networks, as well as legacy and emerging JADC2 nodes. “[We used] a very complex environment to find a very specific target set and take it through the find, fix, track, target, engage, assess [F2T2EA] process — essentially cradle to grave prosecution of a target — using a whole bunch of sensors, shooter, and nodes.” “We also looked at how various capabilities are survivable in certain environments with a lot of high tech adversaries,” Burfeind continued. Explaining how the VULs typically play out, he added: “In Orange Flag, in a four-hour event, we will do 7 or 8 test runs — some have relatively simple scenarios, but they are complex from a technical perspective. Others just focus on the scenario and will be very focused on the materiel solutions — getting the correct geometry, tactically representative formations, and force packaging to gather our data.” As well as the core objectives, rallying so many participating agencies is facilitated by offering the chance to bolt-on other specific needs for individual participants. The combined Orange and Black flag event included tactics improvement evaluation for the HH-60G Pave Hawk., USAF/1st Lt Savanah Bray “We have top-down objectives imposed by the Orange Flag on behalf of a warfighting entity,” explained Burfeind. “We also — and this is really important — incorporate all of the participants’ objectives from the bottom up. This allows us to garner a large participant list and get them to work together in this environment, which ends up creating the environment we need. We have to include participant-based objectives in order to encourage them to show up.” Some of these added elements of the event included some of the TIPs that emerged from January’s WEPTAC, which was held at Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada. TIPs tested at Black Flag 21-1 included HH-60G helicopter air-to-air survivability, F-35 emissions control (EmCon) tactics development, and continued tactics development and evaluation of the F-16 Viper’s new AN/APG-83 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. “For this particular iteration of Black Flag we jumped on the survivability objectives and extended that to a number of other players — so the HH-60 Pave Hawk was an example of working a TIP that was based on how well they can survive in an air war,” detailed Capt Peterson. “We were sharing objectives on the Black Flag side with more of a missionized environment, but still bringing in all the test folks so we can take a look at the data and decide whether or not we got valid lessons from a tactics standpoint, or if we needed to go back and try something else.” The tests also included U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets., Jamie Hunter “We based the events around a Defensive Counter Air [DCA] gameplan to gather the data about air-to-air survivability objectives. We created a DCA fight to give that fog and friction of war and put the principal participants on one side or the other — not the traditional Red Flag type “Blue” Force versus “Red” — it was just to gather the data.” Speaking directly about the F-16 radar test element, Peterson said: “We are trying to create a baseline on capabilities, work out if there is anything we need to change or improve with regard to the pilot vehicle interface — so we needed a complicated air-to-air picture to really challenge the radar.” The missions included “F-15s, F-16s, F/A-18s, EA-18s, F-22s, F-35s, a U-2 , one B-2 Spirit , an EC-130, ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance], and other classified programs,” according to Major Burfeind. In addition, U.S. Army Patriot missile batteries, M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ), and a Navy Aegis Combat System also took part. A media release added: “A major Orange Flag success is the testing of F-35 and F-22 integration with land-based long-range fires, naval fires, and space-based sensors without humans-in-the-loop. Other successes include tests of multinational F-35 and command and control integration, strategic intelligence surveillance, and reconnaissance integration through all domains.” “We are testing the machine-to-machine connections of an integrated air picture — the targetable track qualities and latencies,” explained Burfeind. “In this case, we had F-35s and F-22s passing data to a U-2 [“Dragon Lady”] that had a specific payload.” That payload was likely a data-linked communications package, which you can read about here . “That U-2 is then passing data to a ground-based control center, and they are passing that information [all machine-to-machine] to the Army engagement operations center and to the naval ships. Those units can use that information for real-time targeting. We were evaluating the ability to do that effectively to complete the kill-chain.” A U-2S at Exercise Northern Edge in 2017 when it flew with a new data linked communications package., USAF/Alejandro Pena Burfeind added that the F-22 Raptor was a significant part of this particular test. “This was the first time we integrated Raptors with the overall kill-web. Generally, Raptors like to operate by themselves — we don’t connect to other entities — however, we are now testing Link 16 transmit and some other kill-web connections that are available to the F-22. We have traditionally been teaching fighter integration tactics in the F-22 that make up for the lack of technical integration — now that’s starting to catch up.” In addition to the Raptors themselves that took part in the event, the Boeing 757-200 prototype turned F-22 Flying Test Bed (FTB) — better known as “ Catfish ” due to its unique and highly modified nose profile — was also involved. The aircraft serves as a flying avionics testbed for the F-22, and its presence was likely linked to the latest avionics developments for the Raptor. Members of the F-22 Flying Test Bed (FTB) team pose for a photo in front of the highly modified Boeing 757 at Edwards AFB in 2017., USAF/Ethan Wagner The Raptor’s Update 6 software upgrade effort likely played a part in the connectivity testing as described by Major Burfiend. This adds F-22 cryptographic architecture to accommodate multiple, simultaneous algorithms for Link 16 interoperability and secure ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio communications. According to the 2019 Annual Report from the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the USAF planned to field Update 6 in 2020. F-22 Tactical Link 16 (TACLink) and Tactical Mandates (TACMAN) are intended to provide Link 16 transmit capability through the Multi-functional Information Distribution System/Joint Tactical Radio System being introduced under the Raptor Agile Capability Release (RACR) capability pipeline, which is planned to release capabilities to the field on an annual basis. The next major event on the horizon for the Orange and Black Flag teams is Exercise Northern Edge 2021, which is scheduled to be held in Alaska in May. The next iteration of Orange Flag, planned for June 2021, anticipates testing the gatewayONE data link format and Skyborg systems, and “several emerging JADC2 capabilities.” An F-22 and F-35A fly in formation with the XQ-58A Valkyrie in December 2020 as part of gatewayONE testing., USAF/TSgt James Cason The AFTC test events are seen as an intrinsic part of the Skyborg roadmap, as well as other cutting-edge warfighting capabilities. Major Burfeind says that the June event will link Orange Flag at Edwards with Emerald Flag out of Eglin, Florida, to “look at some of the very long-range kill chain integration,” which is a critical element of the ambitious Skyborg project. Emerald Flag is the Air Force’s premier multi-domain test exercise, the first iteration of which was held last year. The Orange, Black, and Emerald Flag large force test enterprises all exist to bring some of the U.S. military’s most advanced capabilities to the front line in an efficient and expedited manner. Having them join forces and share resources will only turbocharge these efforts, and as a result, further disrupt the enemy’s ability to stand toe-to-toe with the United States Air Force and the U.S. military overall. Collectively they will provide a huge stage to test new systems and tactics, crunch the data, push equipment to its limits, and rapidly develop innovative solutions for some of today’s most complex warfighting needs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 16, 2021",One Of America’s Most Capable Submarines Has Been In An Ongoing Battle Against Bed Bugs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the U.S. Navy’s most advanced and secretive submarines is battling an unusual foe: bed bugs. The service has downplayed the situation onboard the Seawolf class USS Connecticut , which is presently pier-side at its homeport in Washington State. However, sailors have told multiple outlets that they believe the situation is more serious than is being acknowledged and has been for around a year now. Navy Times’ Geoff Ziezulewicz was first to report on the situation, and obtain pictures reportedly showing dead bed bugs caught on USS Connecticut . The Navy has confirmed that the insects have been a recent issue for the submarine, though it’s unclear if the service is of the view that there is still an active infestation. No details have been given yet about how the bugs made their way into “ perforated bulkheads between bunks ” onboard in the first place. It’s also not clear when the boat’s last deployment wrapped up and when it returned to Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton. There are no indications, as of yet, that any continued presence of the insects has prevented it from leaving port for any scheduled deployments or other activities. USS Connecticut at Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton in 2018., USN Bed bugs are blood-sucking parasites and their bites can cause skin irritations, similar, broadly, to those from other insects, such as mosquitos. “Bite responses can range from an absence of any physical signs of the bite, to a small bite mark, to a serious allergic reaction,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . “Bed bugs are not considered to be dangerous; however, an allergic reaction to several bites may need medical attention.” Connecticut is one of just three Seawolf class boats, which the Navy officially categorizes as attack submarines. The others are the USS Seawolf and the USS Jimmy Carter . The service’s post-Cold War abandonment of plans to acquire 29 of these submarines, in total, subsequently led to their assignment to an ostensibly developmental unit, but which is also responsible for carrying out other specialized missions. The Seawolfs , which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , are known for being especially quiet, being able to cruise for very long periods of time, including under the ice in the Arctic region . Jimmy Carter is even more secretive than its sisters and represents the lone member of a unique subclass, having gained a 100-foot long extension known as the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP), and is understood to be specially equipped to carry out undersea espionage missions involving the inspection, manipulation, and even recovery of items of interest from the ocean floor. “The Navy takes the safety and health of its sailors very seriously,” Navy Commander Cynthia Fields, a spokesperson for Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, or COMSUBPAC, told Navy Times . Daily inspections of berthing areas onboard, to include searches of mattresses for bed bugs, are ongoing and Navy entomologists “have employed authorized countermeasures, and certify that all feasible measures have been taken to control bed bugs,” she added. “After two applications of Navy approved pesticide sprays, and application of a long-acting diatomaceous dust …entomologists recommended repopulation of berthing [spaces],” she added. “All appropriate countermeasures have been taken with plans firmly in place to address further breakouts underway if they occur.” A sailor mans a post onboard USS Connecticut in 2018., USN Some sailors who have spoken on the condition of anonymity to Navy Times , as well as the local Kitsap Sun newspaper , clearly feel that the situation has not been resolved and that Navy leadership has been slow to act. They allege that the USS Connecticut ‘s berthing areas have been full of bed bugs since at least March 2020, when the submarine deployed to the Arctic region in support of Ice Exercise 2020 (ICEX 2020). “We’ve had bed bugs for a year now,” one petty officer told Navy Times . “Sailors complained about getting bitten in the racks.” “People are terrified of getting bit,” they added. “People were getting eaten alive in their racks,” another petty officer told that outlet. “The best way to put it would probably be ‘employee abuse,’ but that’s not really a thing in the Navy, I guess,” a third petty officer said. Sailors reportedly slept in chairs, on the floor, or in other spaces on the boat, such as the crew’s mess, to avoid being bitten while the boat was on deployment. Submarines require sailors to live and work in very confined environments, in general, so there was almost certainly limited alternative options for spaces to sleep in. “Some people were sleeping on metal diamond decking because they didn’t want to sleep in the racks,” a petty officer said. After Connecticut returned home, a temporary structure full of cots was initially provided as a sleeping area for personnel still on duty on the boat to get away from the bugs, but there have been complaints that this was, at best, inadequate. “There’s not nearly enough racks for an entire duty section, so people have also put up hammocks to sleep,” one petty officer told Navy Times . The crew members who spoke out do seem to generally acknowledge the limited options available to respond to the bed bugs while the submarine was on deployment, but they have questioned the response since the boat returned home. They also still raised concerns about the potentially serious impacts the situation could have had on their performance at sea. “If someone’s sleep-deprived because they’re in the rack getting eaten alive by bed bugs, he could fall asleep at (the controls) and run us into an underwater mountain,” a petty officer noted. Sailors work onboard USS Connecticut ., USN The Navy has disputed a number of these allegations, saying that the first official reports of bed bugs on the submarine were only made in December 2020 and actual evidence of the presence of the bugs did not emerge until February 2021. None of the members of USS Connecticut ‘s crew had any “significant skin reaction to the insects,” Commander Fields, the COMSUBPAC spokesperson, told the Kitsap Sun . Sailors say this is due to the fact that Navy regulations require physical evidence of bed bugs before action can be taken and that this had proved difficult to obtain. Fully grown bed bugs are typically only between four and five millimeters long and “their flattened bodies enable them to fit into tiny crevices no wider than a toothpick,” according to an explainer from the University of Kentucky’s Entomology Department. Navy Time s says that members of the crew told the outlet that efforts were taken to try to seal off various areas of the submarine, but proved unable to stop the spread of the bugs. A bed bug., CDC Members of Connecticut ‘s crew also said that their superiors seemed aggressively opposed to the idea that initial efforts to rid the boat of the insects during an earlier month-long stand-down period by steam cleaning and otherwise sanitizing the berthing spaces had been ineffective. “Our senior leadership said, ‘if we clean and sanitize all these, and someone points out bed bugs, they are fucking lying,'” one petty officer explained to Navy Times . Enlisted sailors assigned to the submarine told Navy Times they felt as if they were now being used as bait to check whether the latest efforts to get rid of the bed bugs have been successful. “They’re using us as live bait…to see if (the bed bugs) are still there,” a petty officer declared. “The upper chain of command isn’t going to sleep in those racks. They’re going to make the lower enlisted do it.” There are also concerns that sailors could now bring bed bugs back to their personal residences. “They have to pay for fumigators and their families will suffer,” one petty officer warned, though there’s no indication that there been any such spread of the insects, so far. Whatever the exact details might be, the bed bug situation onboard USS Connecticut is just the last in a series of morale and other readiness issues that the Navy has been hit with in recent years, especially among the crews of its submarines and warships . This has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to ships remaining at sea without port visits for longer than usual periods of time. Submarines already typically remain sea for longer periods than surface ships. The most notable recent scandal, by far, was the COVID-19 outbreak on the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt last year. That incident turned into a political firestorm after the firing of that ship’s commanding officer, Captain Brett Crozier , following the leaking of a letter he had written warning about the severity of the situation, and ultimately led to the resignation of then-Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly. Task & Purpose recently obtained a tranche of Emails that provided further insight into that debacle via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit . How the matter of the bed bug infestation aboard USS Connecticut is finally resolved for good remains to be seen.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 9, 2020",The U.S. Navy’s Submarine-Launched Aerial Drone Capacity Is Set To Greatly Expand,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The AeroVironment Blackwing drone is about to be procured in significant numbers by the U.S. Navy, providing its submarines with an organic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capability that can be launched from below the waves. It’s the latest development in a field in which the Navy has been conducting test work for some time now, as you can read about in this past War Zone piece . In the meantime, it’s likely that the Navy has other similar capabilities already fielded, and perhaps even some examples of older Blackwings. A request for proposal (RFP) today on the U.S. government’s contracting website beta.SAM.gov, revealed that the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to buy up to 120 Blackwing 10C UAVs from the California-based company. Although the Blackwing is derived from the Switchblade loitering munition , or “suicide drone,” but the latest RFP, however, mentions only unarmed drones. The Virginia class attack submarine Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) Indiana during trials in the Atlantic Ocean. All Navy submarines, including the Virginia class, have a three-inch countermeasures launcher that can be utilized for the Blackhawk UAV., General Dynamics Electric Boat/Matt Hildreth The roughly four-pound Blackwing has an inertial/GPS autopilot system and a secure digital data link to maintain communications with the submarine. In order to fit inside a canister, the UAV has two pop-out wing sets with a span of 27 inches, and it’s powered by an electric motor-driven pusher propeller. The drone can be launched from both submerged submarines and from unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and, while the RFP notice doesn’t specifically mention what they will be launched from, in the past Blackwings have been fired from submarines’ three-inch countermeasures tubes during demonstrations. The Blackwing 10C variants will be equipped with miniaturized both electro-optical and infrared sensors in its nose and will be procured as part of the Submarine-Launched Unmanned Aerial System (SLUAS) program. It is unclear how the 10C version differs from previous Blackwings, but it has at least something in common with the same company’s Switchblade 10C that features an upgraded digital data link and allows concurrent operation of multiple drone systems in the same area. The notice confirms that, as of today, the Blackwing 10C has been approved for integration in the SLUAS program under a Tactical Temporary Installations (TEMPALT) effort. Actual drones could be delivered from August this year, according to the Navy, with related contracts scheduled to run for a two-year period beginning May 2021. “AeroVironment is the only known responsible source that possesses the facilities, tooling, equipment, manufacturing expertise, and technical expertise to provide the required Blackwing 10C UAVs within the government’s required delivery and ordering period,” the RFP stated. Back in 2013, the Navy announced it had successfully demonstrated the ability to launch an encapsulated unmanned aircraft via a submarine’s torpedo tube and that it had been actively testing the Blackwing from standard countermeasures launchers. A 2013 Naval Sea Systems Command briefing slide describing testing using the submarine-launched Blackwing drone, including potential attack missions., NAVSEA According to the service, the new drones “will be used on various Navy submarine platforms during the SLUAS Middle Tier Acquisition program execution,” although there was no further detail provided about how they will be used. However, “Middle Tier” suggests there are multiple layers of SLUAS development, likely involving different UAVs and capabilities. This ties in with a statement last November , Rear Admiral Dave Goggins, the Navy’s Program Executive Officer for Submarines, who said that 21 SLUASs had been employed in demonstrations, though it’s not clear how many individual types the Navy has actually experimented with. NAVSEA first posted a contracting notice for the SLUAS program online last October. At that point, it was only seeking proposals for potential SLUAS designs and didn’t yet have firm plans to buy any such drones. “The Navy requires the capability of a SLUAS with a 3-inch diameter form-factor to provide enhanced sensor, communication, and cyber-security capabilities,” last year’s contracting notice read. “The integrated system should be capable of launch from the US submarine fleet’s 3-inch Signal System Ejector (SSE) equipment.” “Threshold performance of the air vehicle should include electro-optic capability with reliable target solution analysis,” it continued. “The vehicle should remain airborne for at least one hour, operate at ranges out to the line-of-sight radio horizon, and use a variable bandwidth encrypted datalink with at least 256-bit encryption strength.” In the past, The War Zone has examined how small-size submarine-launched drones could be used in combat, including providing a discreet surveillance asset that could be hard for an enemy to detect, let alone the submarine from which it was launched. This kind of beyond-line-of-sight intelligence-gathering capability could be used by the submarine to help target surface vessels, for example, before launching a torpedo. “Consider a submarine-deployed unmanned aircraft as a flying periscope able to dramatically extend our submarines’ organic sensor range, provide target-quality sensor data back to the submarine, or to a joint force capability, and enable Harpoon and Maritime Strike Tomahawk missile engagements,” Navy Rear Admiral Blake Converse, Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, said in an online presentation last year . Beyond the “flying periscope” capability offered by a sensor-equipped drone like the Blackwing, there’s also very real potential for submarine-launched drones to operate together as a swarm . Not only could such tactics cover a much wider area in a surveillance capacity, but they could potentially also undertake a range of other missions, too, acting as decoys, carrying payloads including electronic warfare jammers and even potentially small munitions . An armed UAV launched from a submarine in this way could also be used to defend against close-in threats, such as small boats, and this littoral self-defense option is something the Navy has previous considered in relation to Blackwing. Operating more than one drone simultaneously also offers the possibility of extending line-of-sight connectivity as communications relays, not only between the submarine and Blackwing but also as a gateway for UUVs, in what the company describes as “mother-daughter” operations. In addition, communications relay could be especially important during special operations missions, for which submarines are increasingly prepared. It is easy to imagine how a UAV, or fleet of drones, could work in support of submarines such as the quartet of converted Ohio class nuclear-powered guided-missile submarines , or SSGNs, each of which can deliver dozens of special operations frogmen into contested territory. In such a scenario, the drones could scout ahead of the troops, providing (armed) overwatch and monitoring the unfolding operation while maintaining a link between the operatives and the submarine. Added flexibility comes from the fact that the Blackwing drone doesn’t have to start operating as soon as it’s fired from its launcher. As AeroVironment’s Chief Marketing Officer, Steve Gitlin, told The War Zone in an interview last year, the drone “doesn’t have to launch right away. It could be sent to the surface and set to launch at some later time when no submarine’s in the area.” “It can be programmed to conduct a mission and because it incorporates the digital data link that AeroVironment developed for all of our tactical unmanned aircraft systems and Switchblade, not only can it collect information and generate situational awareness, but it can also act as a pop-up mesh network in the middle of the ocean to connect surface vessels to undersea vessels to manned vessels to unmanned vessels and create basically a pop-up mesh network in the ocean,” Gitlin added. With a multitude of possible payloads, the opportunities are boundless. What is clear is that the Navy is now committed to the Blackwing, and to submarine-launched UAVs in general, and we are only likely to see more developments in this intriguing field in the months and years to come.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Mar 31, 2021",Belgium’s Hard-Worked F-16 Fighter Jet Fleet Has Just Been Grounded,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Belgium’s entire fleet of F-16 fighter jets , the backbone of its combat air force, has been grounded since yesterday after one of the Vipers experienced problems with its Pratt & Whitney F100 engine. As of today, the air defense of the European country has now been taken over by the neighboring Netherlands. “While technicians work hard to get our Vipers airborne asap and the Belgium Control and Reporting Center monitors the airspace above Belgium 24/7, the Koninklijke Luchtmacht [Royal Netherlands Air Force] will temporarily take over the Quick Reaction Alert from the Belgian Air Force to safeguard the BENELUX skies as from 12 o’clock,” the Belgian Air Force tweeted today. The view from the cockpit of a Belgian F-16., Belgian Ministry of Defense Belgium’s F-16 grounding order follows a February 11 incident at Florennes Air Base, in which one of the jets had engine problems on takeoff and immediately made a precautionary landing, leaving some debris within the confines of the base and on the end of the runway. The F-16 in question had a “ nozzle burn through ,” in which the engine’s “turkey feather” exhaust petals begin to disintegrate due to excessive temperatures. The engine of the affected aircraft was dismantled and sent to the Patria Belgium Engine Center, the contractor that handles maintenance of the powerplants. In the video below you can listen to the communications between the pilot and tower after the emergency that affected F-16AM serial number FA-118, callsign STING 21: https://youtube.com/watch?v=SYDwGg3vy7c An investigation narrowed down the problem to a hinge pin and the air force said that “ a significant number of engines exhibit similar phenomena.” “Following the advice of the engine manufacturer and the aircraft manufacturer, it was decided to take immediate corrective action and to ground the other aircraft in order to carry out checks as quickly as possible,” the air force said. A composite image showing the moment the F-16’s engine began to disintegrate in the incident last February 11., Youtube Screencap In the meantime, all the partners in the European Participating Air Forces — a community of F-16 users on the continent — have been informed. Investigations are meanwhile underway to establish if any other fleets have similar problems. The Netherlands has already confirmed that its own jets are not affected. All the Belgian jets — 43 single-seat F-16AM and eight two-seat F-16BM variants, according to Flight International’s World Air Forces 2021 survey — have been grounded while their engines are checked. Repair time is estimated at five working days per engine. “However, there is a shortage of spare parts on the market,” the air force admits. The Belgian Air Force’s F-16 fleet is old and has seen heavy usage. In particular, Belgian F-16s have made regular deployments to the Middle East to take part in Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) over Iraq and Syria, and before that, they were regularly tasked with missions in Afghanistan as well as over Libya in 2011. Currently, four Belgian F-16s are in Jordan for a 12-month OIR deployment. Unconfirmed reports suggest those particular aircraft are still flying their combat missions. A Belgian F-16 deployed to the Middle East for Operation Inherent Resolve., Belgian Ministry of Defense Furthermore, the Belgian Air Force is scheduled to send a detachment of F-16s to Lithuania in December to support the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission , established back in 2004 to defend NATO airspace in the region. Since then, Belgium has been one of the most regular participants. A Belgian F-16 intercepts a Russian Navy Su-27UB Flanker during a previous Baltic Air Policing rotation., Belgian Ministry of Defense At least until the serviceability and availability of the Belgian F-16 fleet improve, the responsibility for the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) over the BENELUX country now rests entirely with the F-16s of the Royal Netherlands Air Force at Volkel Air Base. This should be a fairly seamless undertaking, since Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg (which has no fighter jets in its inventory) already share QRA duties, under a system that was introduced in 2017. Normally, the airspace of the three countries is protected on a rotational basis by Belgium and the Netherlands, with one of these providing two armed F-16s on standby around the clock to respond to airspace violations. https://youtube.com/watch?v=5yH-2a1OGRg While this latest incident has had a significant effect on the Belgian F-16 fleet, at least in the short term, it is not as dramatic as that which befell the air force in October 2018, when a ground technician accidentally fired a number of rounds from one of the aircraft’s 20mm M61A1 Vulcan cannon during maintenance at Florennes. Some of these struck another F-16, fully fuelled and ready for a mission. That jet burst into flames and was destroyed, injuring two ground personnel and damaging another two F-16s nearby. Throughout its service career, the Belgian F-16 fleet has been steadily upgraded through the stepped Mid-Life Upgrade (MLU) program, but the jets are now showing their age. The first example was accepted by the air force in January 1979, as the first European-assembled F-16 to be delivered to a European operator. In the meantime, the fleet has been reduced in number by the transfer of successive batches of jets to Jordan . Proposals for a further F-16 life extension , as an alternative to the F-35 acquisition, were rejected. Although Belgium has chosen the F-35A to replace the Viper, there are now reports that the decisions behind that selection will be subject to parliamentary discussion. As it was, the first of 34 examples of the stealth fighter is not due to be delivered until 2023. However, the first aircraft will remain at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona for training, with the first Belgian-based example not expected to arrive home before 2025. At the same time, Belgium is holding a Parliamentary session to question/investigate the F-35 procurement, and not in a good way. Biggest question(s)? When will @Defensie @Forsvarsdep and @Forsvarsmin break cover on F-35 operations costs? — Francis Tusa (@FTusa284) March 10, 2021 Until then, Belgium may well face other challenges in keeping its aging F-16 fleet serviceable to meet operational demands both at home and further afield.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 18, 2021",Construction Of A Large Runway Suddenly Appears On Highly Strategic Island In The Red Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery shows that, earlier this year, construction began on a new, approximately 6,150-foot-long runway on Perim, an island right in the middle of the highly strategic Bab Al Mandeb Strait , which links the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. In addition to its location inside this critical maritime junction, which is an important route for both naval and commercial ships, Perim is situated less than five miles off the coast of Yemen, making it a valuable potential staging area for military operations in that country, possibly against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels , as well as elsewhere in the region. Images from Planet Labs that The War Zone reviewed show that construction of the airstrip, which is around 165 feet wide, on the northwest portion of Perim, also known as Mayyun, only began sometime between Feb. 18 and Feb. 22, 2021. The full outline of the runway, with a turnout at the western end, was visible by March 3. A satellite image showing Perim island in the Bab Al Mandeb Strait as of March 9, 2021. The new runway is plainly visible in the northwest portion of the island., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION / Google Earth Another shot of Perim as of Feb. 2, 2021., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION / Google Earth Available imagery also shows that two new small hangar-like structures appeared on a concrete pad to the south of this runway work sometime after Feb. 24. That paved area is part of an apron left over from a separate, now-dormant project that began in 2016 and that was working toward the establishment of an air base with a nearly 10,000-feet-long runway. There has been no active work on this larger facility since 2017. It’s not entirely clear what happened, but Perim, a remnant of an ancient volcano, has an unforgiving climate that has frustrated attempts to build military outposts on it for centuries. There is activity at this older site, beyond the construction of the two structures, but it appears to be linked to the new runway. An additional image of the island, dated March 8, that The Intel Lab , an independent intelligence analysis group, obtained from Airbus, seen in the video below, strongly suggests that workers are using this older, half-built site as a dumping ground for earth and stone is being removed as part of the construction of the new runway. That image also shows that the two structures each have what appear to be three generators and that a high wall that shields them on three sides. To the south of those buildings, “a protected position is in the making, comprising two high walls and fresh asphalt,” according to The Intel Lab. “This uphill location could be reserved for a future AD [ air defense ] system or EW/SIGINT [ electronic warfare / signals intelligence ] hardware.” Some type of general air and/or surface search radar could be another possibility. As to who is carrying out any of this work and what their ultimate goal is, it’s unclear, but the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as well as Saudi Arabia, are distinct possibilities. There has already been significant discussion about this construction being linked to the UAE. This follows earlier satellite imagery that The Associated Press obtained indicating that the Emiratis had dismantled many, if not all of their facilities at Assab in the East African country of Eritrea on the other side of the Bab Al Mandeb Strait sometime between January and February of this year. The UAE had begun expanding airfield and port facilities in Assab just months after it, as part of a Saudi Arabian-led coalition, had intervened in Yemen to push back Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. That Eritrean base became an important hub for the UAE’s contribution to that campaign, including as a forward base to launch airstrikes against the Houthis and as a point through which to funnel various forces, including Sudanese troops and foreign mercenaries , onto the Arabian Peninsula. It is certainly possible that some of the UAE forces that had been based at Assab have now moved to Perim. The Intel Lab suggests that the two-new structures could house a small UAE contingent, with at least some of that space serving as a headquarters of some kind. In addition, the runway being built now would definitely be long enough to support tactical airlift aircraft, such as C-130s, as well as the UAE’s Boeing C-17A Globemaster III airlifters, among other types. A UAE Air Force C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane., Boeing Perim had been under UAE control since 2015, when its forces, together with local tribal militiamen, had ejected the Houthis . The UAE had started the first abortive air base project and had also reportedly operated a secret prison on the island. However, in 2019, the UAE had removed itself from the Saudi-led coalition and officially ended operations against the Houthis, though it continued to work with the U.S. military to combat other terrorist groups in Yemen. Saudi troops, together with elements of the official Yemeni Coast Guard, part of the internationally-recognized, pro-Saudi government of the country, subsequently arrived on the island to take over operations there, according to Reuters . There are no reports that the Saudis or the Yemenis have subsequently withdrawn or that the Houthis, or even their Iranian benefactors, have made any effort to return. In addition, The Associated Press reported that the dismantling of facilities at Assab had been accompanied by online flight tracking software showing numerous flights by an Antonov An-124 cargo plane belonging to Maximus Air , a Ukrainian-Emirati enterprise, between that base and Al Ain in the UAE. This would seem to suggest that at least some portion of the personnel and assets that had been in Eritrea had returned home, rather than redeployed in the region. None of this, of course, precludes the UAE from having also sent a contingent back to Perim. If this latest construction project is ultimately completed, unlike the last attempt to establish an air base on the island, it will likely become more apparent who is using these new facilities. Whoever is behind the construction work could be looking forward to establishing an extremely strategic outpost in this already critical maritime passage. With respect just to the Houthis, an airfield on the island could serve as an important hub for operations in and around Yemen, including counter-smuggling , maritime patrol , and even anti-submarine operations , among others. Last year, interestingly, the U.S. government approved the possible sale of MQ-9B drones with maritime surveillance and anti-submarine capabilities, among other items, to the UAE. The Iranian-backed rebels routinely employ mines and remote-operated explosive-laden boats to carry out attacks in this general area against both warships and commercial vessels. Iran itself is known to operate a modified cargo ship capable of acting as a covert operations mothership , which could support various kinds of malign activities, including waterborne and other kinds of attacks , in this region, as well. More robust facilities on Perim would also offer a location detached from the mainland from which to carry out various kinds of broader intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, including aerial ISR, using manned or unmanned aircraft . Sufficiently expanded, it could also be a valuable launch point for airstrikes, either using combat jets or drones, across the region. The air base could be coupled with additions to the docks on the southern part of Perim, which, in turn, might enable at least limited naval operations. As already noted, the Yemeni Coast Guard is among the forces that are reportedly making use of the island already. A satellite image of some of the existing docks on Perim as of 2019. Two gray-color boats, which might be Yemeni Coast Guard patrol craft, are seen moored together at one of the docks., Google Earth Beyond the immediate conflict in Yemen, where Perim is situated, the straight is less than 20 miles across. Basing various kinds of anti-access and area denial assets on the island, such as surface-to-air missiles or anti-ship cruise missiles , would give whoever controls them immense leverage in the region. An outpost here could also serve as a base from which to help ensure the safe passage of friendly ships, protecting them from the Houthis or any other threats. At the same time, if the UAE, or the Saudis, are looking to establish an outpost on this island, it would be well within the range of Houthi ballistic and cruise missiles , as well as suicide drones . The Iranian-backed group has been stepping up its missile and drone strikes on Saudi Arabia proper in recent months, including a massive operation just this past weekend that reportedly involved the launch of eight ballistic missiles and 14 unmanned aircraft against targets in four Saudi cities. This was the largest such strikes on the Kingdom since an unprecedented barrage of missiles and drones in September 2019. With this in mind, it’s hard to see how the rebels would not devote significant resources to striking at a target as important as an air base operated by either the UAE or Saudi Arabia on Perim. Whatever the exact details are regarding the construction on Perim, someone is working to build a new airstrip and is already establishing other associated facilities on what is one of the most strategically significant islands on the planet.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Air Force’s MQ-9 Reaper Drone Replacement Requirements Now Include Air-To-Air Combat Capability,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released its latest request for information as it sets out more requirements for the replacement for its MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle , a program now dubbed MQ-Next . The new document indicates that the service is looking at a future drone that will feature defensive counter-air capabilities to protect high-value manned aircraft , such as tankers , as well as potentially fly red air aggressor missions . The request for information (RFI) from the Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) was recently published on the U.S. government’s contracting website beta.SAM.gov. A previous RFI, released last June, focused on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities for the MQ-9 replacement, which the Air Force hopes will offer reduced operating costs and greater persistence, survivability, and range. While the latest RFI doesn’t mention MQ-Next by name, it does explicitly state that the information sought is related to the replacement of the MQ-9. An MQ-9 Reaper prior to takeoff at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Emily A. Kenney Now, with the Air Force having gathered the information it needs on the aforementioned Next-Gen ISR/strike capabilities, the scope of the RFI has been expanded to what is being termed Next-Generation Multi-Role Unmanned Aerial System Family of Systems (Next-Gen Multi-Role UAS FoS). The RFI acknowledges that the Next-Gen Multi-Role UAS FoS may be attritable or expendable, unlike the Reaper, as well as, or as an alternative to being survivable and reusable. The document also confirms that the Reaper’s replacement will be tailored for Great Power Competition — suggesting it will be expected to go to war in the kinds of highly contested environments encountered during a conflict with a peer rival such as China or Russia, in line with the demands of the 2018 National Defense Strategy . At the same time, the UAV is also intended to fly missions in permissive environments, too. As a result, the new combat drone will have to take on additional missions compared to today’s Reaper, including air-to-air, base defense, electronic warfare, and moving target indicator surveillance against assets in the air and on the ground. What is more, the drone is to be designed from the outset to operate as part of the Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) network. The Air Force has already worked with air-to-air-capable armed drones Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS)-related exercise, as you can read about in this previous story . ABMS is the Air Force component of what the Pentagon now calls JADC2. The RFI also references what sounds very much like the Air Force’s “ Digital Century Series ,” in which smaller numbers of manned aircraft are produced quickly to meet dynamically evolving threats. “A continuous rapid development pipeline will be leveraged by which new capabilities are designed, prototyped, demonstrated, and fielded on a recurring basis to adapt to the ever-changing operating environment and integrate the latest emerging technologies,” the RFI explains. Within all this, the Air Force has identified particular capabilities or mission packages known as “on-ramps.” The latest RFI is concerned with on-ramp one, which includes two capability subsets: Air Domain Awareness and High-Value Airborne Asset Protection (HVAAP). Air Domain Awareness is further described as Focus Area #1 and consists of sensors or sensor networks to provide early warning, tracking, and identification of enemy air operations. The RFI mentions low-cost radio-frequency, infrared, and electronic support measures (ESM) among “the multitude of different sensor capabilities” that could fulfill these requirements. Since these tasks are required to be conducted in highly contested and contested environments, the communications suites that will allow integration within JADC2 will have to be suitably resilient, the RFI states. There is also a requirement for data-sharing between multiple UAS as well as with off-board sensors on other platforms. Focus Area #2 is the High-Value Airborne Asset Protection, or HVAAP, set. This is where the Air Force sets out its requirement for a drone that is able to fight back, above all providing defensive counterair to protect HVAAs like aerial refueling tankers or standoff reconnaissance planes against long-range enemy fighters and “other kinetic and non-kinetic threats.” While adding infrared-guided air-to-air missiles to drones is not new for the Air Force, the RFI includes a much wider range of options for this role including, but not limited to weapons, sensors, electronic warfare, and directed energy weapons. An MQ-9 armed with an AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missiles., U.S. Navy Until now, U.S. drones armed with air-to-air missiles have flown mainly in less-contested environments, in very limited circumstances. Providing a UAV with the means, kinetic or otherwise, to defend a friendly airborne early warning and control aircraft , for example, in high contested airspace is clearly a significant challenge. The drone should also be able to defend itself. Therefore, perhaps, the RFI includes options for both HVAAP solutions that can be integrated onto a UAS or what it describes as “complete UAS platform solutions.” The latter suggests a dedicated air-to-air-capable combat drone as part of Next-Gen Multi-Role UAS FoS. In the past, Boeing has pitched its Airpower Teaming System developed for Australia as an escort for high-value aircraft types, among many other roles. In this way, it would free up manned fighters for other frontline missions and would provide a defensive ring around some of the most vulnerable, but also most critical aerial assets. It is worth noting, too, that last year General Atomics revealed a previously unknown unmanned aircraft concept, called Defender, that is intended to be capable of air-to-air combat and mid-air refueling. The company said at the time that its primary mission would be to protect “high-value airborne assets.” Concept artwork for the General Atomics Defender unmanned aircraft., General Atomics It is as an extension of this HVAAP role that the RFI identifies a possible red air aggressor mission for the drone. This reflects previous suggestions that future U.S. drones could help bring down the cost of the entire red air training enterprise, reducing the requirement to procure more expensive manned aircraft and teach the instructors required to fly them. You can read more about that aspiration here . Furthermore, aggressor drones of this kind could potentially also replicate enemy drone swarms, mimicking the kinds of capabilities that some of the United States’ potential enemies are working on . Focus Area #3 reiterates that the Reaper’s successor or successors could be attritable, expendable, survivable, and/or reusable. It also notes that the Air Force desires rapidly reconfigurable payloads — implying, perhaps the kind of modular payload options available in the Boeing Airpower Teaming System — and interoperable software/hardware. Finally, the Next-Gen Multi-Role UAS FoS should be able to operate “autonomously, with minimal dependence on operator inputs.” The first flight of the Boeing Airpower Teaming System., COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE Overall, the RFI emphasizes, to a significant degree, the requirement for the future drone to operate in highly contested environments, including anti-access/area-denial scenarios, and therefore suggests an aircraft that will be packed with robust communications links to ensure a flow of data between the drone and other platforms in real-time, as well as least some degree of low observability. The Air Force also says it wants more endurance — the basic Reaper can fly for around 20 hours unarmed, or more than 12 hours with weapons. In the case of the MQ-9B version , with an extended wingspan, flight endurance can be increased to more than 40 hours . An enhanced level of automation is also a cornerstone of the Next-Gen Multi-Role UAS FoS requirement, which ties in with wider Air Force efforts under the Skyborg initiative. Under this effort, no fewer than 13 companies are already competing to help develop different technologies that could go into “ loyal wingman ” type unmanned aircraft and autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles. The service hopes to begin work on a drone using Skyborg’s AI technologies before the end of the year. Then there is the important cost factor, with the RFI seeking drone technology that is “not too cost-prohibitive to enable the [Air Force] to field an inventory that can withstand anticipated attrition and achieve desired outcomes with critical combat mass.” The Air Force wants to achieve all these ambitious goals quickly, too, under what it calls a “Speed to Ramp” initiative. If all goes to plan, the RFI says that a capability should be fielded before “the 2026/2027 timeframe.” Aviation Week Defense Editor Steve Trimble considers this to refer to the HVAAP set, which could potentially be integrated on existing drones by this time. Subsequently, it seems that this and other solutions that will emerge from the Next-Gen Multi-Role UAS should be integrated on a next-generation unmanned aircraft “in the 2030 timeframe.” It has not yet been established what kind of acquisition strategy will be used to get the new drones to their operators. However, the Air Force says it wants to emphasize “maximizing multiple competitions, to include the aerial platforms, ground control systems, sensors, and data exploitation technologies that nest within open-architecture standards.” In terms of manufacturers, Northrop Grumman is just one of those known to have put itself forward for MQ-Next, and you can read much more about that company’s thoughts on the program in this previous in-depth interview with their vice president of program management. Lockheed Martin and General Atomics have also announced their interest and there will likely be more to follow. A Northrop Grumman concept for a possible MQ-Next., Northrop Grumman In the meantime, however, we are still awaiting hard requirements for the MQ-Next, so it is far too early to say what kind of form the drone, or drones, might take. It could end up being entirely attritable, or recoverable, or somewhere in between. Similarly, while we now know the Air Force wants it to have an air-to-air capability, the degree of survivability that it may embody could range from all-aspect low observability to what is essentially a non-stealthy, missile-packing loyal wingman. For now, we just don’t know, but there is also a strong likelihood that the requirement will ultimately be for multiple types of systems able to address all these points. Despite these limitations, the latest RFI does at least provide a glimpse into some of the kinds of UAV capabilities the Air Force wants to field in the most-too-distant future. Again, it also points to the recognition that the Reaper’s replacement will have to be much more survivable and capable in order to take a more central role in a conflict against an advanced peer-state foe.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 10, 2021",The Soviet Union’s Railway-Based Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Had An Inflatable Nosecone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Soviet Union’s Cold War-era Molodets intercontinental ballistic missile was unique for being fielded on a train, rather than in silos or on mobile launchers . But its novelty didn’t stop there — this weapon, known to NATO as the SS-24 Scalpel, also featured a bizarre inflatable nosecone. What seems to be the only video available of the missile’s nosecone in action was brought to our attention by Twitter user Chase, whose feed is worth a follow for those interested in nuclear weapons and security, including some of its more unusual aspects. The same clip can be found within a longer video on YouTube, at around the 1:05 mark. That entire video is also posted later on in this article. A Molodets missile train with RT-23UTTKh ICBM on display in a museum, with a more durable dummy nosecone fitted., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons The decision to incorporate an inflatable nosecone seems to have been driven by the very specific requirements of railway launch . Since the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) itself was longer than a standard railroad car, this was a solution to accommodate it within the length restrictions of the launcher and retain aerodynamic properties once launched. It seems the nosecone inflated soon after launch and it used a pressure accumulator to increase internal pressure, which in turn deployed a corrugated metal internal structure, forming the conical nose shape. This solution is used to reduce the overall length of the missile and its placement in the car. Meanwhile, inflatables continue to be used in spaceflight , if not missile technology, to this day. The story of the SS-24 itself is an interesting one, part of a wider Soviet effort to make its land-based ICBMs more survivable. By the late 1960s, it was clear that the increasing accuracy of U.S. missiles would likely be enough to ensure the destruction of any Soviet ICBM silos, no matter how hardened. The Soviet response followed a two-pronged approach to enhance survivability: road-mobile missiles on tracked or wheeled launchers, and rail-mobile systems. With 99,000 miles of railway lines able to accommodate disguised missile launchers, rail-mobile missiles would be almost impossible to find and consistently track. At the same time, it promised to allow heavier ICBMs to be fielded: Soviet road-mobile systems, at this point, were limited to missiles weighing around 40 tons. In addition, being tracked, the early road-mobile systems imparted potentially damaging vibrations on the missile itself. In early 1969, two design bureaus, Chelomey and Yangel were tasked with developing rail-mobile ICBMs. The Chelomey offering was quickly abandoned since it used liquid-fuel propulsion that was too sensitive to the vibrations of the train and could potentially cause a catastrophic propellant leak. A Pentagon artist’s impression of what then known as the SS-X-24 — indicating it was not yet fully operational., NATIONAL ARCHIVES In the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Yangel continued work on its design, based on the RT-23 missile for the Molodets system (translated to English, the name means something like ‘good boy’ or ‘well done’). However,  this progressed only very slowly, and it wasn’t until 1980 that design work was finalized. As well as the formidable technical challenges involved in fielding a missile on a train, the Soviets were still perfecting solid-fuel rocket technology, and there was also lingering official resistance to mobile systems in general, on grounds of cost and complexity, as well as contravening arms treaty negotiations. There were also concerns about training crews to operate the systems and about the command-and-control issues surrounding a widely dispersed mobile ICBM force. By the early 1980s, the Molodets had been overtaken by road-mobile developments, now that they could benefit from solid-fuel technology and wheeled launchers. Nevertheless, the rail-mobile system was still selected to form part of the Soviet fourth-generation ICBM force, alongside the road-mobile Topol ( SS-25 Sickle ). At the same time, silo-based missiles continued to be improved, focusing on more accurate warheads and better-protected silos. A silo-based RT-23 was also authorized, this trading the inflatable nosecone for a more robust folding one that similarly deployed after launch. The two-part folding nosecone of a silo-launched SS-24 snaps closed on launch., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP While the Topol was a ‘light’ ICBM with a single warhead, the Molodets used the ‘medium’ RT-23 missile. Testing of this missile began in 1982, but of the first 11 test flights, seven ended in failure. Ultimately, problems with the RT-23 were considered so serious that it was canceled in 1983, although the trains used in the Molodets system were handed over for crew training, while work continued on an alternative missile. A contemporary diagram showing the missile stowed in the railcar, with the inflatable nosecone not yet deployed. Note also the three-stage missile configuration., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Finally, in 1985, test flights began of the improved RT-23UTTh missile, which carried 10 multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) each with a yield of 300 kilotons. Thought was briefly given to fielding this new ICBM on an enormous wheeled transport-erector-launcher (TEL), as well as in silos and as part of the Molodets. The Tselina-2 wheeled version was soon abandoned, but not before a 24 x 24 wheeled TEL prototype had been built. Test launches of the RT-23UTTh missile as part of the rail-based Molodets were completed in December 1987 and the system was declared operational the same month. It was the last of the new-generation Soviet ICBMs to be deployed. By 1988 there were around 10 Molodets trains operational, but it was an expensive system since it required tracks around the different operating hubs to be refurbished. Each Molodets division had four trains. Within each train , there were three cars for the launch module, including a single missile. There were also seven cars accommodating the command modules, one fuel and lubricants car, and two DM62 diesel locomotives that could move the whole thing at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour. All the railcars were disguised as refrigerated vans or as passenger cars. An SS-24, complete with its launch tube, being removed from a train., Public Domain By 1992 the Soviet Union had deployed 92 SS-24s, 36 of which were of the rail-based version. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, all the rail-based missiles were left on Russian territory, but as early as October 1991, Moscow announced they would from now on be stationed in garrisons. Continuing concerns about security were cited, but it’s likely the costs of the system also played a role. Furthermore, since the missiles had been built in what was now Ukraine, further production for Russia was impossible and the supply of spare parts dried up. A Molodets train at the Russian Railway Museum in St. Petersburg., Andrey Filippov/Wikimedia Commons The last rail-based SS-24 missiles had been removed from service in 2002 and the last base was liquidated in 2007 . Surprisingly, perhaps, there were rumors that rail-mobile ICBMs might make a comeback in Russia. In 2014, reportedly with the support of the commander of the Strategic Rocket Forces , it was reported that a draft proposal for a modern version of the system was to be completed, named Barguzin, apparently as a counter to the U.S. Prompt Global Strike initiative. Work on the Barguzin was suspended in 2017 but since then, Russa has also unveiled a host of even more exotic strategic delivery systems . But if the rail-mobile ICBM does ever return to the Russian inventory, it will very likely not feature an inflatable nosecone — the new-generation RS-24 Yars ICBM is already compact enough to fit within a standard-size railroad car, without any such ingenious modifications.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 17, 2020",Debate Over Navy’s Zumwalt Destroyer’s Seakeeping Abilities Doused After Rough Seas Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says the stealth destroyer USS Zumwalt successfully completed the second and final phase of its Rough-Water Trials late last year. This involved sending the ship into two real-world storms with waves between around 16 and a half and 20 feet tall. The testing was extremely significant given the ship’s inward-sloping tumblehome hull form , which critics have long said would make it a disaster waiting to happen in heavy seas. Defense News ‘ David Larter was among the first to notice the official announcement about these trials, which took place between October and November 2020. The first storm Zumwalt , also known by its hull number, DDG-1000, sailed through, which had “mid-Sea State 6 wave conditions,” according to the Navy, was off the coast of San Francisco in Northern California. The second was near Ketchikan in the Alaskan panhandle and saw waves reach to the top-end of Sea State 6. The World Meteorological Organization ‘s Sea State scale goes from 0 to 9 and Sea State 6, defined as “very rough seas,” covers instances where peak wave height is anywhere between 13 and 20 feet. The USS Zumwalt ., USN A team made up of personnel from the Naval Surface Warfare Centers at Carderock in Maryland and Philadelphia in Pennsylvania were responsible for evaluating the performance of the ship and its crew during these trials. This group had already overseen the first phase of the Rough-Water Trials in October 2019, which covered Sea States 2, 3, and 4, and focused on “the seakeeping behavior, structural response, and operability of DDG 1000 in mission-relevant conditions,” as well as “how the ship motion conditions affect crew performance.” Sea States 2, 3, and 4, range from waves just under 4 feet talk to those cresting at just over eight feet. This all followed earlier Calm-Water Trials off San Clemente Island near San Diego in Southern California. While the Navy does run simulations and creates models of how it expects different ship types and their crews to hold up under different Sea States, there’s no substitute for the real thing. At the same time, the need to perform these trials when the wave conditions are just right can make scheduling difficult. “We chose locations and times to conduct the testing that would correspond with what forecast models were indicating would provide the wave conditions required to complete our test matrix,” Stephen Minnich, the Rough-Sea Trials Director, said. “We deployed wave buoys that drifted on the sea surface, which helped us to quantify the seaway in terms of the wave height, period, and direction. We were completely at the mercy of Mother Nature during the testing, but those devices were critically important to the characterization of what we were seeing in terms of ship motion and structural response and for the situational awareness they provided to support safe execution of the testing.” “Minnich and his team were encouraged by the results of the Rough-Water Trials, noting that there were no exceedances of critical motion criteria limits,” the Navy’s official news item on the at-sea testing added. The evaluation team is now preparing to recreate the trials in a model environment in Carderock’s Maneuvering and Seakeeping Basin , or MASK, a wave pool that holds 12 million gallons of water and is 240 feet wide and 360 feet long, seen in the video below. It will then be possible to see how that data compares to what was collected under real-world conditions. This process helps provide valuable feedback about the accuracy of the service’s modeling to help with future evaluations. For Zumwalt , both the Rough-Water Trials and the Calm-Water Trials are part of a standard Performance and Special Trials (P&ST) program that the Navy conducts on the lead ship of every new class. As already noted, the trials were particularly important for this particular ship due to its hull design, over which has long raised concerns about stability in rough seas . “All told I’d rather be on that ship than any other ship I’ve been on,” Navy Captain Andrew Carlson, the destroyer’s commanding officer, had told Defense News in January 2020 while discussing taking the warship through Sea State 6 waters outside of formal trials the previous year. “You definitely have to get used to the roll, which is very short compared to other ships,” Carlson added. “For those of us who have been on [ Ticonderoga class] cruisers , especially up top, you kind of lean over 15 degrees and you wonder if you are going to come back. We didn’t experience any of that. As long as you get used to the finer oscillation, it really handles very well.” The Ticonderogas also have notably high superstructures and are, all around, overloaded ships that have a maxed out hullform derived from the earlier Spruance class destroyer. This has left the cruisers with persistent cracking in their aluminum superstructures. At the same time, the trials, though successful, are just another example of how much work there remains to be done to prove out the Zumwalt ‘s most basic capabilities more than four years after it was officially commissioned. Even then, Congress had prohibited the Navy, by law, from formally accepting delivery of the ship until its core combat systems had been activated, which only occurred last April. It was not until May 2020 that the destroyer fired one of its 30mm automatic cannons for the first time. It then conducted its first launch of an SM-2 surface-to-air missile five months later. All of this came after years of downgrading the ship’s capabilities and its stealthy signature, particularly through the addition of various external antennae . There has been talk about adding new capabilities to the Zumwalt and her two sister ships, the USS Michael Monsoor and the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson , the latter two of which are in various stages of fitting out. These additions could include a new radar , as well as finally replacing the destroyer’s two ammoless 155mm main guns , a saga you read about more in this past War Zone piece . No matter what, the Navy only expects to receive these three DDG-1000s, down from its original plans to acquire a fleet of 32 of these ships. The total program cost for the ships and the advanced technologies within them, at last check, was $26 billion. The trio has long looked set to have an, at best, limited operational utility, and they will all be assigned to Surface Development Squadron One , a unit primarily focused on testing and evaluating new systems, including unmanned platforms, and tactics, techniques, and procedures to go with them. Still, Zumwalt has now proven its ability, and as a result that of the ships in its class, to make it through very rough seas, an important milestone that puts it one step closer to being able to carry out operational missions, no matter how limited, in more challenging environments.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 3, 2021",B-1B Bomber Makes Arctic Pit Stop For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. B-1B bomber has touched down at a Norwegian Air Base above the Arctic Circle for the first time. This comes as the strategic significance of that region only continues to grow. Russia, in particular, is expanding its own military infrastructure in the far north, including improving bases to be better capable of supporting bombers and other combat aircraft . The B-1B, nicknamed the Dark Knight after the DC comic books hero Batman, landed at Bodø Main Air Station in northern Norway on March 7, 2021. This bomber is one of four from the 7th Bomb Wing out of Dyess Air Force Base in Texas that arrived at the Royal Norwegian Air Force’s Ørland Main Air Station last month. This is the first time B-1Bs have ever deployed on any basis to this country, which is also a NATO member, though these bombers have flown long-distance missions to train with Norwegian forces and other American allies and partners in the region in the past. A B-1B bomber lands at Bodø Main Air Station on March 7, 2021., Forsvaret A press release from U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), the top Air Force command in the region, said that the B-1B stop at Bodø was in order to conduct a “warm-pit refuel,” wherein the crew remains on board and the aircraft remains “on” via power from its auxiliary power unit (APU). This is different from a “ hot-pit refuel ,” where the aircraft’s engines are on and running the entire time. The B-1B’s pit stop came during a mission that was primarily focused on training with U.S. special operations forces Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTAC), as well as their Norwegian and Swedish counterparts, on the ground. The bomber also flew together with four Swedish Air Force JAS-39 Gripen fighter jets during these recent flights. Sweden is another important American partner in the region, but is not a member of NATO. A map showing the general locations of the Royal Norwegian Air Force’s Bodø Main Air Station, to the north, and Ørland Main Air Station, to its southwest. , Google Maps “It’s not every day that our bomber has the chance to play such a prominent role in training ally and partner JTACs,” Air Force General Jeff Harrigian, head of USAFE, said in a statement. “Opportunities to train alongside our allies, partners and U.S. Special Operations Forces in forward locations makes us the rapid, resilient and ready force we need to be.” The B-1B bomber on the ground at Bodø., Forsvaret A close-up of the aircraft’s Dark Knight artwork., Forsvaret The “warm-pit refuel” in progress at Bodø., Forsvaret It’s interesting to note that, while the Air Force’s B-1Bs were heavily committed to directly supporting ground forces during the fighting against ISIS, starting in 2014, the service has worked to refocus their aircraft on more strategic power-projection missions in recent years. This has included numerous long-range training sorties in and around Europe , as well as the Pacific . In addition, the crews of these aircraft no longer conduct low-level flight training and reportedly there is now a policy in place that prohibits them from being deployed to perform close air support missions in support of ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Syria, or Afghanistan. The Air Force has now also started retiring 17 of its remaining B-1Bs. All of this is part plan the service says will help conserve the life of the other B-1Bs and keep them operational and relevant for years to come. All this being said, during any future contingency, including a high-end conflict with a near-peer adversary, such as Russia, the Air Force could still potentially commit B-1Bs to close air support missions, in addition to long-range strike stories. Special operations units in forward locations , or even possibly behind enemy lines, via their JTACs, could also feed information to those bombers, among other assets, about the presence of higher-value, time-sensitive targets in a specific area, as well. A head-on look at the B-1B at Bodø., Forsvaret No matter what, the demonstration of a B-1B’s ability to land and refuel at Bodø is simply in line with efforts across the U.S. military, including within the Air Force, to expand the number of potential operating locations available to American forces worldwide during a major conflict. During such a crisis, large, established air bases, in particular, could be destroyed or otherwise made unavailable , underscoring the need for a more distributed posture . With regards to Bodø, specifically, the base provides quick access for the bombers into the Norwegian and Barents Seas and the greater Arctic region. From there, B-1Bs could present a new kind of challenge to Russian operations in these areas, especially those of its naval forces based in the northwestern corner of that country. Russian Navy ships and submarines routinely sail through the Barents Sea and then the Norwegian Sea on their way toward the so-called Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom (GIUK) gap, and the northern Atlantic Ocean beyond it. A Cold War-era map showing the GIUK gap., CIA In addition to their stand-off land-attack capabilities, the B-1Bs are increasingly important anti-ship platforms when armed with the stealthy AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). Last year, the Air Force revealed that some of these bombers had conducted an anti-ship training exercise in the Black Sea region that was almost certainly pointed at Russia and its Black Sea Fleet in particular. As Arctic ice recedes due to global climate change, exposing new economic opportunities, including trade routes and access to natural resources, the region, as a whole, is set to become a point of increasing geopolitical competition . The B-1B’s visit to Norway’s far north notably comes as the U.S. Navy is also looking to expand its own forward presence in northern Norway. This could include future submarine and other naval operations staged from a massive underground base at Olavsvern, near the city of Tromso, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . Olavsvern is situated some 200 miles northeast of Bodø. “We must expect some Russian reactions to the deployment,” Norwegian Defense Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen had told members of his country’s parliament earlier this year regarding the overall deployment of the B-1Bs to the country. “The B-1B are heavy capable bombers and Russia will claim the deployment increases tensions.” On the same day in February that the B-1Bs arrived at Ørland, the Russian Navy’s Slava class cruiser Marshal Ustinov sailed into the Varanger fjord , a body of water that contains a maritime boundary between Russia and Norway. This 12,700-ton-displacement vessel is the third-largest warship assigned to the Russian Navy’s northern fleet and has a primary armament of 16 P-500 Bazalt anti-ship cruise missiles. The Russian Navy’s Slava class cruiser Marshal Ustinov ., Crown Copyright The cruiser remained in Russian territorial waters the entire time, but this was a clearly provocative maneuver that had never been seen before, according to a report from The Barents Observer . Russia had also announced a naval exercise just days before the B-1Bs landed at Ørland, which it said would involve firing missiles into international waters in the Barents Sea between mainland Norway and one of that country’s outlying islands. This was also seen as a direct response to the bomber deployment. Russia has conducted other provocative activities in this general region in recent years, as well. This includes multiple mock airstrikes clearly aimed at a secretive radar facility at Vardø , which is situated very close to the Russian border in Norway. This trip by an Air Force B-1B to Bodø could very well prompt new responses from the Russian military. If nothing else, it is the latest example of how the Air Force, as well as other elements of the U.S. military, are looking to increase their presence in this highly strategic region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 28, 2022","Wait, This Mysterious Heavily-Armored Blue Train Caboose Belongs To The Navy?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When one thinks of the U.S. Navy, ships , submarines , and fast fighter jets probably quickly spring to mind. Armored railcars probably not so much. Those sound more like the stuff of spaghetti westerns, WWII history books, and Steven Seagal movies. But after our investigation, spurred by rail spotters not being able to make sense of a mysterious blue-painted armored caboose, we learned that this year, the Navy, in cooperation with the Department of Energy, is set to begin using a new “fleet” of heavily armored cabooses specially outfitted to escort trainloads of sensitive nuclear material. A reader of The Drive , Rafi Ward, first alerted us to pictures that have been circulating on social media of one of these mysterious cabooses, which has an alpha-numeric identification code, VWXX-800, a prefix that is known in the railroad world as a reporting mark. We subsequently acquired pictures of this car from photographer Anthony Delgado. Based on our own digging, The War Zone can now confirm that this railcar, and others like it, are being built under a U.S. government contract to support the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPP), more commonly known simply as Naval Reactors. A picture of VWXX-800, an armored caboose that is set to enter service this year guarding trains carrying Naval Reactors’ cargoes., Vigor Industrial “The railcar series you describe (VWXX-800) is currently being built, outfitted, and certified by Vigor Works LLC under contract to the U.S. Government and will be used as a courier escort vehicle by the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program to support spent nuclear fuel and other national security shipments,” a spokesperson for Naval Reactors told The War Zone . “The first railcar is expected to be delivered at the end of 2021 and placed into service shortly thereafter. The railcar replaces similar escort vehicles the Navy uses that are near the end of their service life.” In its present form, Naval Reactors, which is responsible for the design, development, and sustainment of reactors for America’s nuclear-powered warships and submarines, as well as various associated work, is a joint Navy-Department of the Energy office led by a four-star admiral. Today, nuclear propulsion is used on America’s most important naval vessels, its aircraft carriers and submarines. This includes the Ohio class ballistic missile submarines that form one of the legs of the country’s nuclear deterrent triad , as well as the four Ohios converted to highly-specialized guided-missile boats . The successors to the Ohios , the forthcoming Columbia class , will also be nuclear-powered. A brief overview of the Navy’s use of nuclear propulsion as of 2016., NNPP The Naval Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) is the main component of the NNPP and encompasses four separate facilities, the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL) in Schenectady, New York; the Kenneth A. Kesselring Site in West Milton, New York; and the Naval Reactors Facility within the Idaho National Laboratory. Naval Reactors operates various other support and training sites and coordinates with naval shipyards and other industrial facilities. An infographic giving a very broad overview of what Naval Reactors does., DOE The exact specifications of VWXX-800 are unclear. A spokesperson for Vigor Industrial confirmed that Vigor Works, a wholly-owned subsidiary previously known as Oregon Iron Works, had designed and built VWXX-800, but could not offer any additional details. They also did not say if any division of the company had previously built any similar kinds of specialized railcars in the past. A picture of this particular car is featured on the company’s nuclear products page . Vigor Works is best known for designing and building a number of stealthy special operations boats for the Navy, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , but has also previously developed an unmanned seaplane for the Navy, built streetcars in cooperation with Czech firm Skoda, and crafted a buoy designed to test the possibility of turning waves into energy . Vigor Industrial also includes other large shipbuilding and marine repair enterprises that provide services to the Navy, among others. An online database available through railroad company CSX says that VWXX-800 is just under 69 feet long, nearly 16 feet high at its tallest, and about 10 and a half feet wide. It has an unloaded weight of around 175,000 pounds and a maximum loaded weight of 185,000 pounds, per that same source. These weights are closer to the figures commonly associated with similarly cargo-carrying boxcars than cabooses, which are generally smaller all around . A shot of the rear of VWXX-800., Anthony Delgado Pictures show it has a typical caboose configuration, in general, with a cupola on top and access doors and the front and rear. There is also what may be a large door at least on one side of the car, which could allow personnel inside to rapidly disembark in an emergency or some other kind of contingency. There are no traditional windows on the body of the car, but there are 10 windows with firing ports on the cupola, two each at the front and rear and six on each side. These would allow individuals to fire small arms at hostile individuals outside while remaining protected inside the railcar’s armored shell. What might appear at first glance to be additional firing ports on the body of the car look more likely to be floodlights, which would offer valuable illumination on either side during any incidents at night. A side view of VWXX-800 showing some of the firing ports on the main body of the car and on the cupola. , Anthony Delgado Another side view of VWXX-800 showing what could be a large door., Anthony Delgado “The couriers escorting the Navy shipments are Federal Officers, provide constant surveillance, and act as first responders in the event of an issue with the transport,” the Naval Reactors spokesperson said. The design appears to be substantially larger and more capable than the armored escort cabooses that the NNPP has now, which notably have no visible firing ports. It’s unclear how many of those escort railcars exist now, but a 2016 Naval Reactors presentation said that the plan, at least at that time, was to acquire five of the new examples from Vigor Works. It is certainly very possible that this represents a one-for-one replacement plan. A slide from a presentation in 2016 showing one of the existing escort cabooses and providing additional information about Naval Reactors’ use of rail transport., NNPP That same presentation said that the design work was 90% complete at that time and the NNPP would receive the first of the new escort cars for testing in January 2020. The procurement plan at that point was to buy two additional examples in both 2020 and 2021. No matter the exact specifications of VWXX-800-series cars or exactly how they will be crewed and operated, having carloads full of armed federal officers accompanying any trains carrying nuclear material or other sensitive related items belonging to Naval Reactors between NNL sites, shipyards, and other facilities makes good sense. Even spent fuel rods and other nuclear waste could be attractive targets for thieves and other malign actors, including those looking to build so-called “ dirty bombs .” A dirty bomb uses conventional explosives to disperse dangerous radioactive material. While experts debate just how real the threat from such a weapon might be, it certainly has the potential to spark mass panic, especially if detonated in a densely populated urban area . NNPP trains carry components in boxcars and, for larger items, in specialized shipping containers on flatcars. Two different types of sealed containers are used to transport spent nuclear fuel. A Naval Reactors boxcar used to carry sensitive components., NNPP A flatcar for carrying larger components inside shipping containers., NNPP The two types of rail transportation methods for spent fuel from the Navy’s reactors., NNPP Trains carrying components typically include one flatcar or three to six boxcars, according to NNPP. Common routes for those trains run between facilities in New York and Virginia and shipyards on the East and West Coasts of the United States. When it comes to spent fuel, those ships generally run from shipyards on the coasts to the Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho, where this waste is stored, at least temporarily. Common component shipping routes as of 2016., NNPP Routes used to transport spent fuel via rail to the Naval Reactors Facility., NNPP It is somewhat interesting that Naval Reactors continues to use rail transport for its nuclear movements, at all. More than three decades ago, the Department of Energy end the practice of moving nuclear weapons via specialized trains, known variously as “atomic trains” or “white trains,” the latter referring to their initial plain white paint schemes. “They featured multiple heavily armored boxcars sandwiched in between ‘turret cars,’ which protruded above the rest of the train. The turrets had slit windows through which armed DOE guards peered out, prepared to shoot if they needed to defend the train. Some guards had simple rifles, while others reportedly had automatic machine guns and hand-grenade launchers,” according to a 2018 piece from History.com . “Known in DOE [Department of Energy] parlance [as] ‘safe, secure railcars,’ or SSRs, the white trains were highly resistant to attack and unauthorized entry. They also offered ‘a high degree of cargo protection in event of fire or serious accident,’ the DOE assured a wary Congress in 1979.” Protests and public outcry , driven in large part by growing opposition to nuclear weapons, in general, toward the end of the Cold War, prompted changing the paint scheme of the trains from white to various colors in the early 1980s. There were still concerns, both inside the U.S. government and out, as well as elsewhere around the world, about the safety and security surrounding these trains, the simple accidental derailment of which presented the potential risk of a major nuclear or radiological incident. The video below shows a dramatic live test, dubbed Operation Smash Hit , that British Energy in the United Kingdom carried out in 1984 in an attempt to demonstrate the safety of transporting nuclear material via rail, even in the event of a derailment. “The painting of these railcars will not stop dedicated protesters from identifying our special trains,” but “will make tracking our trains more difficult, and we believe, enhances the safety and security,” a 1984 Department of Energy memo said. By 1987, however, the decision had been made to bring the operation of these trains to a halt and replacement with specially modified tractor-trailer trucks loaded with James Bond-esque booby traps, which you read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story . These semis, a third generation of which is now under development , are also designed to be highly inconspicuous, but are not immune to detection or accidents themselves . “The Department of Energy quit using railcars for weapon shipments in 1987,” a spokesperson for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which oversees America’s nuclear weapons stockpile, had confirmed was still the case to The War Zone as we sought information about VWXX-800. “Since then, DOE/NNSA has transported national security cargoes in highly modified secure tractor-trailers escorted by armed Federal Agents .” A prototype of the NNSA’s next-generation tractor-trailer truck for hauling nuclear weapons is seen in front of another truck being propelled at it using large rockets as part of a test to see how it would hold up against a high-speed collision., NNSA Separate plans had also emerged in the 1980s to use discreet trains as mobile launch platforms for LGM-118A Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), a concept known as the Peacekeeper Rail Garrison , which would make it more difficult for the Soviet Union to target them. The Soviets had fielded their own train-based ICBMs and the Russians had looked to revive the idea in the mid-2010s, before shelving it again to focus on other higher-priority strategic weapons in 2017. Specialized railcars to carry security personnel were to have been components of the Peacekeeper Rail Garrisons, as well. However, in 1991, with the end of the Cold War, the program was canceled. The LGM-118As instead ended up in traditional silos, before being removed from service entirely in 2005 as a result of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II) agreement. An artist’s conception of an LGM-118A Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missile on a launcher concealed inside what would otherwise appear to be a standard boxcar., Convair/General Dynamics via the San Diego Air and Space Museum It’s important to note, of course, that rail transport remains in use for the movement of commercial reactor components and nuclear waste . At the same time, reactors for naval vessels, in general , are significantly different from civilian power-generating types. Most notably, in part to help keep the reactors compact, but powerful, they often use weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU). As of 2016, the Navy alone accounted for approximately 60 percent of HEU use in naval applications worldwide, according to the Arms Control Association . It’s worth pointing out that the head of Naval Reactors is also one of a number of Deputy Administrators at NNSA, underscoring both the importance and the sensitivity of the NNPP. Naval Reactors’ position is that the exact construction of the fuel used in the Navy’s reactors makes it very safe , by fissile material standards, when it comes to accidents. The fuel rods are solid metal with the nuclear material being fully encapsulated inside, a design decision already driven by the need to make it safe for sailors to work around them on a regular basis and to ensure they are resistant to battle damage during actual combat. “Naval fuel is built to withstand combat battle shock forces well in excess of 50 times the force of gravity (more than 100 times the force of a severe earthquake),” an NNPP document from 2017 says. NNPP Still, there have been efforts to reduce the use of HEU in the Navy’s reactors for safety and security reasons, but this has faced opposition over the years from various ends of the U.S. government. Plans to shift naval nuclear propulsion to primarily use non-weapons-grade low enriched uranium (LEU) are, at best, decades away from becoming a reality. Regardless, at least in the meantime, Naval Reactors will continue to use rail as a means to transport nuclear and nuclear-related cargoes around the country. If the Navy keeps to its schedule, VWXX-800 will be in service helping to guard those trains by the end of this year.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 14, 2021",Israeli F-15s Were Armed With Old Missiles During B-52 Escort,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. American B-52H bombers flew another global power sortie all the way from the United States to the Middle East and back, this time traversing Israeli airspace on their journey. During their time over Israel, they were met by a quartet of F-15A/B/C/D “Baz” (Falcon) fighters. Two of these aircraft appear to be equipped with quite an interesting weapons configuration. Instead of the latest and greatest air-to-air missiles the IAF has to offer, they are seen flying with dated ones, and probably for good reason. The story of Israel’s F-15A-D Eagles is a very different one than that of their American counterparts. Early on, the IAF adapted their most capable air superiority fighter into a long-range strike platform. Since then, the service has continued to morph the Baz fleet into something that’s all its own. Today, these are truly multi-role aircraft and they are treated as prizes by the IAF even many decades after the type first entered service. You can read all about the Baz fleet’s fascinating past in this previous feature of mine . In fact, the IAF continues to get second-hand, well-used examples from the United States and carefully rebuilds them and deeply upgrades them into indispensable national assets, some of which get loaded with the best networking capabilities the force has to offer. IAF So, don’t think of these aircraft like their American cousins with their ‘not a pound for air-to-ground’ operating mindset. At the same time, they are still F-15A-D Eagles at their heart, so they are ruthlessly capable in the air-to-air domain, and like in the U.S., these aircraft still stand alert to protect Israel’s airspace. The Baz is a true multi-role fighter: An Israeli air force F-15 takes off from Tel Nof Air Force base for a mission over the Gaza Strip in central Israel, November 19, 2012., AP I believe the two armed Bazs we are seeing in these images are in fact alert aircraft that incorporated the B-52 air escort duties into their aerial patrol. This is just conjecture, but based on their loadout it makes sense. They armed-up with missiles and Elta-8222 self-protection electronic warfare pods—largely known as the best of its kind in the world, just ask the U.S. aggressors who fly with them on their adversary jets or countries who have tacked them on to far inferior aircraft that turn into something else entirely with their help. You can read all about this reality here. A Baz in a hardened aircraft shelter. Note the conformal fuel tanks and Elta 3222 jamming pod on its left forward conformal fuel tank hardpoint., AP In another difference with U.S. F-15C/D Eagles, all of the Bazs are seen flying without external fuel tanks. Instead they are wearing conformal fuel tanks, otherwise known as fast packs, that the IAF adopted early on and has kept as standard gear long after a portion of U.S. F-15C/Ds stopped using them. In recent years, there was an initiative to bring them back to USAF F-15C/Ds, but that has been put on hold now that the F-15C/D fleet will be replaced with the vastly superior F-15EX —an aircraft that comes with conformal fuel tanks from the factory. This makes some sense as Israel is a tiny country—it’s roughly the size of Vermont—but it is located in a tumultuous area of the world and has plenty of enemies, including non-state actors with increasingly capable arsenals. So, no need for a ton of gas, especially considering the F-15 already benefits from a relatively long combat radius, and the fast packs provide more range without as big of a penalty as external tanks. Early concepts for F-15 fast packs. The IAF ran with it decades ago and using them in the conformal fuel tank configuration makes very long-range strike missions possible., Public Domain The Bazs’ missile loadouts are what’s most interesting. Most notably, we see AIM-7 Sparrows instead of AIM-120 ARAAMs mounted on their conformal fuel tanks. The semi-active radar homing Sparrow is still in use among a dwindling number of air arms. For instance, Egypt and Iraq have to use it with their advanced F-16s due to hardline export restrictions. The active radar homing AIM-120 simply is not an option. Even the U.S. Navy still has some of them in its inventory, but the AIM-120 is far superior to its predecessor in almost every way— almost . While the AIM-120 has superior range, is far more flexible overall, better allows for fighters to engage multiple targets at once, and has a true fire-and-forget capability—you can read all about the realities of these capabilities here and here —the Sparrow has a warhead that is double the size. Although there are other aspects of a missile’s endgame performance that dictates the destruction it can potentially wreak on a target, including fusing, accuracy, and endgame kinetic energy, the AIM-7 gives off a much bigger bang. An AIM-7 on the jammer at Eglin AFB back in 1988., USAF Although we have never gotten an actual explanation of this, apparently there are very unique circumstances in which the AIM-7 may even be preferred over the AIM-120. Once again, these are very particular situations with certain targets and engagement parameters and we have been told in the past they really don’t apply themselves to the vast majority of air-to-air combat. So, we cannot say exactly what these circumstances are, but apparently, they do exist. IAF Regardless, for the homeland defense role, the Sparrow may be good enough. During peacetime, beyond-visual-range engagement of an aerial target is unlikely. Visual identification or other conclusive intelligence would be necessary before that would occur. For threats like cruise missiles, Israel has the most capable multi-tier air defense system on earth , something a place like the United States lacks almost entirely ( outside of the Washington, D.C. area ). So, when you take this into account, and Israel’s tiny geographical size, the AIM-120’s capabilities are really not essential. Furthermore, the AIM-7’s bigger warhead may be preferable when it comes to taking down large targets, like hijacked airliners, or very small targets, like say drones that Iranian-backed Hezbollah is known to possess and use . Semi-active homing used by the Sparrow, where it homes in on the reflected radar energy from the F-15’s powerful radar, may even be advantageous for these types of engagements, we just don’t know. Finally, we have to address the possibility that there is some type of fitment issue with the AIM-120 and the IAF’s conformal fuel tanks. It is certainly possible but seems unlikely. Newer conformal fuel tanks can accommodate the AIM-120 without issue and, historically, Israel hardly lets such issues dictate the capabilities of its aircraft. They have the ability to modify these tanks—I believe they produce them indigenously—so that possibility seems a bit reaching, but we just don’t know. A USAF F-15C launches an AIM-120 AMRAAM., USAF Beyond all that, these are older missiles, so using their flight time up could be preferential, especially if their capabilities are more than what is needed, instead of using newer stocks of AIM-120s for the mission, the newest of which cost over $1M apiece and would be critically important during a time of war for the IAF. The two Bazs are also carrying older indigenous Python 3 short-range air-to-air missiles as well as Python 4/5s on their underwing stations. The missiles are of two generations, with the Python 3 being very loosely akin to the AIM-9L/M Sidewinder and the Python 4/5 being much like the AIM-9X . Both remain capable, but the Python 4/5 is far more advanced. Once again, there may be some targets in which the Python 3 offers very narrow advantages, especially in terms of infrared sensor tech and counter-countermeasures support, over its newer stablemates. As we mentioned earlier, drones are a growing threat to Israeli airspace. They are hard to engage, so having both types of missiles maybe add flexibility for Baz pilots. Also, maxing-out the flight time on old stocks is relevant here, too. A Baz F-15D with a Python 3 captive training round. You can see the unique fin arrangement of a Python 4 on the other side of the missile rail. , KGyST/Wikicommons We don’t know what is hanging on the other side of the Bazs in the picture. It is possible their wing station may hold a different configuration and, usually, one beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile is mounted behind the jamming pod. This could very well be an AIM-120, offering the best mix of what the IAF has to offer all in one loadout. If anything else, these images are a reminder that when it comes to military operations, Israel has its own way of doing things, and usually it is pretty damn logical bordering on brilliant. Regardless, it is great to see the IAF’s Bazs looking as eclectic as possible, sporting some old-school weaponry alongside a very old school American bomber.

Details remain very limited at this time, but the largest city in Equatorial Guinea, Bata, experienced a huge explosion, or possibly multiple explosions, that flattened buildings and killed at least 17, with hundreds more being injured.

Dramatic footage shot in the blast’s aftermath shows widespread destruction and stunned bystanders. It is said that every structure in the city was impacted in some ways.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Spain-Based American Destroyers Are Sporting This Unique Electronic Warfare System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s quartet of Arleigh Burke class destroyers that are forward-deployed to Rota, Spain, and makeup Destroyer Squadron 60, sport a unique configuration. The most notable alteration is the inclusion of the self-contained SeaRAM Rolling Airframe Missile launcher system on the ships’ rear pedestal mount. This is in addition to the Phalanx Close-In Weapon System located on their bows. It was installed to beef-up the destroyers’ defenses against advanced anti-ship cruise missiles due to the high-threat areas they would be regularly operating in—especially the Black Sea, which is a nearly land-locked super anti-ship missile engagement zone. They were also among the first to receive an upgraded SEWIP Block II electronic warfare suite . But another unique and so far totally overlooked enhancement involves a far more obscure electronic warfare system, one that, as far as we know, is totally unique to these vessels. We noticed the funky, WALL-E -looking installations on the bridge wings of USS Porter and USS Donald Cook as they exited the Black Sea through the Bosphorus, which provides a link to the Sea of Marmara, and from there to the Mediterranean, recently. They had deployed to the tense body of water sequentially, and along with a support ship, they represented the biggest U.S. Navy presence in the Black Sea in years while operating together. The Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyers USS Porter (DDG 78), front, USS Donald Cook (DDG 75), USS Carney (DDG 64) and USS Ross (DDG 71) are moored at Naval Station Rota, Spain, all were part of Destroyer Squadron 60 when the image was taken in 2017., USN Upon closer review, the odd installations have been there for a number of years, on all the forward-deployed destroyers that call Rota home. In fact, they seemed to have appeared around the same time these vessels received SeaRAM as part of their unique upgrade program. So, these are at least semi-permanent installations, but we still weren’t sure what they actually did. At first, we thought they were an electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) system, as it seemed similar in basic configuration to other existing EO/IR systems deployed aboard U.S. Navy vessels. It is also worth noting that the Arleigh Burke class was designed with one of the most powerful EO/IR systems around, which you can read more about in this past piece of ours . After more closely examining images of this mystery system, the depth of its ‘cans’ seemed too shallow. A sailor stands next to the installation in question atop USS Carney’s bridge wings., USS Carney Facebook Page/USN Laser range finders and dazzlers were other possibilities, as well as some sort of directional, turreted electronic warfare system we weren’t aware of. We enlisted a number of contacts to help solve the mystery. Our friends over at Naval News were especially helpful. It turns out that this is indeed an electronic warfare system, one we only really knew the designation of, until now. This system appears to be the elusive AN/SLQ-62 TEWM-STF (Transportable Electronic Warfare Module-Speed To Fleet) that we discussed as a counterpart to the AN/SLQ-59, another new electronic warfare system that we detailed in August 2019 , which is found on ships deployed to the Western Pacific as part the 7th Fleet. At the time we wrote: Another similar tailored system is being developed for the 6th Fleet, although it is unclear what physical form it will take. As it sits now, enclosures similar to those used on the AN/SLQ-59 have not appeared on any of the vessels assigned to the region, at least as far as we have seen. Regardless, this 6th Fleet-focused system is designated the AN/SLQ-62. Official budget documents confirmed this designation and the AN/ALQ-62’s 6th fleet exclusivity. USS Ross moored in Souda Bay. Note the AN/SLQ-62 installed on the ship’s bridge wing. Photo was taken in 2015. , USS Ross Facebook page/USN Our friends at Naval News alerted us to one eagle-eyed Taiwanese naval warfare aficionado that tweeted about this system just a few months ago. @hone_hone_bone_ also noted that the system in question, referred to by its general Transportable Electronic Warfare Module name, appeared as part of a 2017 Navy Research Lab review about a worker who helped develop it: The system had been in development since around the early part of the 2010s and was focused on bringing tailorable and modular electronic warfare solutions to the fleet rapidly. A version of it was tested during RIMPAC 2016, as seen in the photo below: USS Pinckney (DDG-91) with a TEWM-STF module mounted on its rear superstructure during RIMPAC 2016. Not the aggressor lear flying with anti-ship cruise missile radar emulator pods in the background., U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Eli K. Buguey So, it would seem that after a year and a half of wondering, we finally know what the AN/SLQ-62 is, and it appears to have been fielded around 2015, but the question remained, what does it do exactly? Is the highly directional, steerable system meant to counter drones? Certain types of missiles? Or something else? Our own Joseph Trevithick quickly found an openly published mention of the AN/SLQ-62 that points to its intended use—countering anti-ship cruise missiles. This would also match with the publicized image above. The passage comes from an open-source Navy bibliography of relevant documents for anyone preparing to take the E-6 exam for the rating CTT, or Cryptologic Technician (Technical). It reads, in part [link was taken down as the exam date passed]: TB-EW-01-18 AN/SLQ-62-MK-59 AND NULKA X TACTICS FOR THE SYRIAN SS-N-26/SSC-5 YAKHONT MISSILE, (U) TB-EW-01-18 AN/SLQ-62-MK-59 AND NULKA X TACTICS FOR THE SYRIAN SS-N-26/SSC-5 YAKHONT MISSILE; CHAPTER 2 The entry here describes multiple countermeasures employed to defeat one specific missile, the SS-N-26. These include the launch of Nulka active electronic-warfare decoys and Mk59 passive inflatable decoys, the latter of which you can read all about here , as well as bringing AN/SLQ-62 to bear on the threat. This doesn’t mean SLQ-62 is specifically used to counter just this threat, not in the least, and there are likely classified countermeasures in place as well, but this is the example listed as one potential eventuality on the preparations for the exam. The SS-N-26 “Strobile,” also known as the P-800 Oniks , is uniquely relevant to the Rota-deployed destroyers as it is one of Russia’s most capable and numerous anti-ship missiles, existing in submarine, ship, and shore-launched versions, the latter of which is fired from the Bastion Coastal Defense System. The ramjet-powered missile is capable of hitting Mach 2.5 and has a range of at least 175 miles (export model), with significantly greater ranges claimed on other variants. The missile also served as the basis for the Russian-Indian BahMos supersonic anti-ship missile. The export version, mentioned in the passage from the Navy guide above, is called Yakhont, 72 of which were sold to Syria in the late 2000s. The missiles are thought to have been upgraded not long after delivery with a more advanced active radar seeker, making them by far the most capable anti-ship weapons in Syria’s inventory and a threat to ships operating in the far eastern edge of the Mediterranean. Syria is just one part of the equation. Russia has Strobiles aboard its most advanced ships in its Black Sea Fleet and Bastion systems line the coastlines of Crimea and Russia, helping to create what is a massive anti-access umbrella over much of the Black Sea. Basically, combined with all the other anti-ship missiles—air, submarine, land, and ship-launched—it has in the region, Russia can turn the entire Black Sea into a super anti-ship missile engagement zone, potentially overwhelming even the most advanced warships’ defenses. As such, unique protection from these threats is especially key for the American destroyers that will spend much of their time cruising the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Unsurprisingly, information as to how the system works or differs from other electronic warfare capabilities is not publically available. Regardless, we know it was meant to be easily upgradeable and Navy budget documents state it was slated for an upgrade in 2017, which would have only made it more effective at doing what it does, how ever it does it. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the AN/SLQ-62 show up on other U.S. warships in the future as it was meant to be adaptable and easily transferable if need be.  At the same time, the Navy is preparing for SEWIP Block III, which will represent a massive boost in electronic warfare capability and will be more adaptable to new technologies than its predecessor. It isn’t clear if SEWIP Block III, with its active jamming technology, would displace the AN/SLQ-62 and when—or even if—the Flight I Arleigh Burke class destroyers deployed to Rota will receive that upgrade, which you can read more about here . This is all part of a major reinvestment into electronic warfare by the Navy which includes the development of next-generation systems that will be potentially interconnected and capable of some truly amazing things. In the meantime, America’s destroyers deployed to Spain remain the most heavily protected and most capable of slugging it out in tighter bodies of water than any other warships in America’s fleet, thanks in part to the AN/SLQ-62.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 20, 2020",This Is The Pentagon’s $27 Billion Master Plan To Deter China In The Pacific,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has submitted a plan to Congress outlining more than $27 billion in proposed spending over the next six years to bolster capabilities across the Pacific region to deter China . This expansion of what is now known as the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, or PDI, would most importantly include the establishment of forward-deployed long-range strike capabilities , including elements that could be armed ground-based cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic missiles. In addition, the plan is to add more capable missile defenses , as well as new space-based and terrestrial sensors , and find ways to ensure access to airfields, ports, and other facilities needed to support these efforts and other future distributed operations. Breaking Defense was among the first to report on these future plans for the PDI, with other outlets subsequently reporting additional details . Congress approved the creation of the PDI in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2021 Fiscal Year, which was passed over former President Donald Trump’s veto in January. This initiative, in broad strokes, is meant to mirror the European Defense Initiative (EDI), which was established to deter Russian aggression following the Kremlin’s invasion and subsequent annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. A US Marine Corps High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) drives off a Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercraft during an exercise in Okinawa., USMC “The greatest danger to the future of the United States continues to be an erosion of conventional deterrence,” one of the PDI documents submitted to Congress said, according to Japanese outlet Nikkei Asia . “Without a valid and convincing conventional deterrent, China is emboldened to take action in the region and globally to supplant U.S. interests. As the Indo-Pacific’s military balance becomes more unfavorable, the U.S. accumulates additional risk that may embolden adversaries to unilaterally attempt to change the status quo.” The Fiscal Year 2021 NDAA had included plans to spend approximately $6.9 billion on the PDI through Fiscal Year 2022. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) had previously supplied lawmakers with a proposal to spend $20 billion , in total, by the end of Fiscal Year 2026. The new plan the Pentagon has now prepared for legislators lays out between $27.3 billion and $27.4 billion in total spend through the Fiscal Year 2027. This includes $2.2 billion to be spent in the 2021 Fiscal Year and another $4.6 billion expected to be available in the next fiscal cycle. From what we know so far, the specific items that INDOPACOM wants in the coming years include: $3.3 billion for “highly survivable, precision-strike fires can support the air and maritime maneuver from distances greater than 500 km [kilometers; ~310 miles]” in the Western Pacific. $1.6 billion to establish an Aegis Ashore missile defense site on the U.S. island territory of Guam. $2.3 billion to launch “a constellation of space-based radars with rapid revisit rates.” $197 million to build a “Tactical Multi-Mission Over-the-Horizon Radar” capable of detecting air and surface threats in the archipelago nation of Palau. $206 million for “specialized manned aircraft to provide discrete, multi-source intelligence collection requirements.” $4.67 billion for “Power Projection, Dispersal, and Training Facilities” within the United States, to include its territories, as well as Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands, which are sovereign nations that are heavily tied to the United States via an international agreement known as the Compacts of Free Association (COFA). Though specific details are extremely limited, the plans to establish new forward-deployed long-range precision-strike capabilities are certainly one of the most notable aspects of the proposed PDI spending layout. No specific weapons or deployment locations are mentioned, but it is clear that the goal is to put land-based systems relatively close to the Chinese mainland and other strategic areas in the Western Pacific. The United States “requires highly survivable, precision-strike networks along the First Island Chain, featuring increased quantities of ground-based weapons,” one of the PDI documents sent to Congress said. “These networks must be operationally decentralized and geographically distributed along the western Pacific archipelagos using Service agnostic infrastructure.” The term “first island chain” refers to an area of the Pacific inside a boundary formed by the first line of archipelagos out from mainland East Asia. This broad zone includes the hotly contested South China Sea , as well as the highly strategic Taiwan Strait . Strategic planning in the Pacific also often takes into account needs within a region defined by a “second island chain,” the boundary of which stretches between Japan and eastern Indonesia and includes the U.S. territory of Guam. A map showing the general areas referred to by the terms “first island chain” and “second island chain.”, DOD The U.S. military, as a whole, and the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps, especially, are actively developing various land-based long-range land-attack and anti-ship missile capabilities , to include new ground-launched cruise missiles , ballistic missiles , and hypersonic weapons , all of which could be potentially forward deployed in the Western Pacific to complement air and sea-launched systems . The U.S. military, and the U.S. Army, in particular, has been talking for some time now about plans to base some of these future missiles on islands in the Western Pacific as part of a strategy to deter China. Having these types of weapons positioned closer to the Chinese mainland could present a very different kind of deterrent threat. However, reports have already emerged that many American allies and partners in the Pacific, such as Australia and South Korea , do not appear to be overly inclined to offer to host any of these weapons. A senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official did tell Nikkei Asia that the planned American missile force in the Pacific “could be discussed as we talk about the course of the Japan-U.S. alliance” and another Japanese official also told that out that this “would be a plus for Japan.” At the same time, neither of those statements voice any sort of clear support for the country actually hosting the U.S. weapons itself. The video below shows a test of a ground-based Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile in 2019. Tomahawk is one of the weapons that is being considered for adaptation for use in a land-based role in the Pacific. In contrast to the long-range strike component of the PDI proposal, the plans to build the Aegis Ashore site on Guam, also being referred to as the Guam Defense System, by 2026 have become much more defined since they first emerged last year . U.S. Navy Admiral Phil Davidson, head of INDOPACOM, has said that this is his number one priority for the region. This facility would provide a more robust forward-deployed missile defense node in the Western Pacific offering “integrated air missile defense in the second island chain,” according to one of the PDI documents. This would complement Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense-capable Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyers, or DDGs, in the region, as well as the lower-tier Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) battery already on Guam . As The War Zone has highlighted on numerous occasions, the THAAD system is lower-tier missile defense asset more geared toward defending against very low-volume attacks, such as a limited ballistic missile strike from North Korea, rather than a major missile barrage from China . As such, Guam, an immensely strategic location in the Western Pacific for the United States, is vulnerable to larger scale missile strikes. “The Guam defense system brings the same ability to protect Guam and the system itself as the three DDGs it would otherwise take to carry out the mission,” Davidson said during a virtual talk hosted by the American Enterprise Institute on March 4. “We need to free up those guided-missile destroyers, who have multi-mission capability to detect threats and finish threats under the sea, on the sea and above the sea, so that they can move with a mobile and maneuverable naval forces that they were designed to protect and provide their ballistic missile defense.” “It doesn’t provide for a 360-degree defense necessarily,” he continued, talking about the THAAD systems on Guam. “It’s really designed to defend against a rogue shot from North Korea.” The missile defense assets the US military currently has deployed in the Western Pacific., DOD The space-based radars would “provide low latency target custody and ground and air moving target indicators and represents a persistent queuing source” for both the Aegis Ashore system on Guam and the new radar in Palau. The constellation would also be able to “maintain situational awareness of adversary activities.” This is all well in line with other efforts within the U.S. military to significantly expand space-based sensor , as well as communications and data-sharing capabilities in the coming years. This array of space and terrestrial sensors directly linked together would also align well with various distributed sensor and general battle management concepts being developed across the services, such as the U.S. Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), and the U.S. Navy’s Project Overmatch , as well as joint service programs, such as the Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) effort. Details are also scant on the “specialized” and “discreet” intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft that are part of the PDI spending plan. This does sound very similar to what the Army has been exploring through its Airborne Reconnaissance and Targeting Multi-Mission Intelligence System ( ARTEMIS ) program, including the Pacific. ARTEMIS “provides high-altitude sensing capabilities against near-peer adversaries and bridges gaps in the Multi-Domain Operations mission,” the Army’s Program Executive Office for Aviation wrote in a post on Facebook in August 2020. “The joint investment between the Army and industry partners started in May 2019 and recently completed aircraft and sensor system engineering, airworthiness qualification, information assurance accreditation, integration and testing requirements and deployed to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.” One of the contractor-owned and operated Bombardier Challenger 650 aircraft confirmed as a platform to carry the Army’s ARTEMIS package., US Army The initial ARTEMIS platforms are a pair of modified contractor-owned and operated Bombardier Challenger 650 business jets. The exact configuration of these aircraft is not known, but they do carry the High-Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) sensor suite, which includes a radar, as well as electronic intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT) packages, to “allow [for] stand-off operations to detect, locate, identify and track critical targets for the ground commander,” according to a previous contracting notice . It’s also worth noting that there have been indications that other elements of the U.S. government, including the Central Intelligence Agency, have been employing contractor-owned and operated aircraft in recent years to conduct overwater surveillance missions in the Pacific to monitor for North Korean sanctions violations. Those kinds of operations would also align well with this manned aerial surveillance component of the PDI proposal. They could be particularly well suited to monitoring for and documenting malign Chinese behavior , including harassment of foreign maritime commercial activities , something the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard said would be an important day-to-day responsibility for their forces in the region in a tri-service strategy document released last year. There are few granular details on exactly how the PDI would help expand “Power Projection, Dispersal, and Training Facilities” across the Pacific. At the same time, the U.S. military has already been pursuing various efforts to expand infrastructure on U.S. soil and in friendly countries in the Pacific that could support future distributed operations. In September 2020, American officials notably announced the completion of a Joint Improvement Project for Angaur Airfield in Palau, which included expanding the airstrip’s runway so that it can handle larger military and commercial aircraft. Angaur is now considered a useful alternative to Roman Tmetuchl International Airport on Babeldaob, the largest island in the archipelago nation. A US Air Force C-130J Hercules airlifter becomes the first plane to touch down at the renovated Angaur Airfield in Palau in September 2020., US Army Army soldiers disembark from an Air Force C-130J at Roman Tmetuchl International Airport during an exercise in 2019., US Army “The U.S. and our allies must develop locations that provide expeditionary airfields for dispersal and ports for distributed fleet operations,” the executive summary of the PDI plan said, according to Breaking Defense . “Ground forces armed with long-range weapons in the First Island Chain allow USINDOPACOM to create temporary windows of localized air and maritime superiority, enabling maneuver. Additionally, amphibious forces create and exploit temporal and geographic uncertainty to impose costs and conduct forcible entry operations.” “We are developing an integrated architecture to horizontally expand data sharing among like-minded nations through the use of information fusion centers in South Asia and South East Asia, as well as in Oceania,” INDOPACOM head Admiral Davidson had said in a speech on March 1. “These fusion centers will combine and analyze sensor data from aircraft ships and maritime picture between the US, our allies and our partners to improve our collective surveillance of potential illegal fishing trafficking activities and transnational threats.” Of course, it remains to be seen how much of the PDI, as it is proposed now, will come to fruition in the coming years. “It’s been fascinating to me, the relative ease at which the conversation happens year to year when it comes to the EDI [European Defense Initiative] when compared to PDI,” INDOPACOM head Davidson had said yesterday in defense of the Pacific defense spending plan. “Some of the angst has been mechanical right? The original European initiative had access to the [overseas contingency operations funding]. And that made it an easier lift.” That being said, there is a growing, bipartisan consensus within the U.S. government that China represents the biggest national security challenge to the United States on multiple fronts . In a recent policy memo, U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger highlighted this reality by placed China in its own threat category, placing Russia in a lower-tier along with North Korea and Iran. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has also made clear that China is the “ pacing threat ” for U.S. defense planning. With support building for various efforts to respond to challenges from China, it seems very likely that at least some portions of this plan to expand ground-based long-range strike, missile defense, and sensor capabilities in the Pacific, as well as the infrastructure and networking needed to support those and other future operations in the region, will start to become a reality in the near term.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 6, 2021",The Air Force Says Its First Hypersonic Missile Will Make Its Inaugural Flight Within 30 Days,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has again pushed back the date for the first flight of its AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon , or ARRW. The launch was supposed to finally occur this week, after being delayed due to unspecified issues last year, but is now expected to take place sometime within the next month or so. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Armament Directorate at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida announced on March 5, 2021, that the first ARRW flight, dubbed Booster Test Flight 1 (BTF-1), should occur “in the next 30 days.” On Feb. 26, during a presentation as part of the Air Force Association’s 2021 Virtual Aerospace Warfare Symposium, Air Force Brigadier General Heath Collins, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Weapons, had declared BTF-1 would happen by the end of this week. Before that, this test was supposed to take place before the end of December 2020 . No specific reasons were given for the new delay, but unspecified “technical findings” and the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were cited as factors. “The BTF-1 test vehicle is complete and is progressing through ground testing to verify its readiness for flight,” General Collins said in a statement. The Air Force says the test missile was delivered to Edwards Air Force Base in California on March 1. “Immediate work began on pre-flight ground tests and checks to obtain certification for the flight to proceed as scheduled,” the service said. Since 2019, there have been seven captive carry tests involving B-52H bombers carrying instrumented test articles, but not actually releasing them. One such test in December 2020, when the first flight had also previously been expected to take place, did involve going through all of the necessary procedures for an actual launch. The Air Force has also now provided a full description of the BTF-1 test plan, which is as follows: The ARRW BTF-1 will demonstrate the booster’s ability to reach operational speeds and collect other important data. In addition to booster performance, the test vehicle will also validate safe separation and controllability of the missile away from the carrier B-52H, through ignition and boost phase, all the way up to separation of a simulated glide vehicle. The simulated glider will not sustain flight, and will safely disintegrate soon after separation. The 412th Test Wing will conduct the ARRW BTF series over the Point Mugu Sea Range in California. The complete AGM-183A weapon consists of a nose section holding an unpowered boost-glide vehicle attached to a large rocket booster. The rocket brings the vehicle to the optimal speed and altitude, after which it glides along a relatively level flight trajectory at hypersonic speed, defined as anything above Mach 5, toward its target. An artist’s conception of the nose cone on an AGM-183A breaking away before the hypersonic boost-glide vehicle it carries then separates from the rocket booster completely., Lockheed Martin The ability of the wedge-shaped boost-glide vehicle to make more unpredictable movements compared to traditional ballistic missiles, while also following a largely atmospheric flight profile, makes it particularly well suited to penetrating enemy air and missile defenses to strike time-critical or otherwise high-value targets with little to no advance notice. This all makes it, at best, very difficult for an opponent to defend against these weapons or even try to relocate critical assets or seek cover before they strike. While we don’t know what the exact issue or issues are that have been delaying the BTF-1 test, wedge-shaped hypersonic boost-glide vehicles have proven to be challenging to develop in the past. The U.S. Army and U.S. Navy are notably developing a common conical boost-glide vehicle that will go on top of ground-based and sea-launched missiles . A mockup of the Army-Navy Common-Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) vehicle., US Army However, the Air Force’s disclosure that the BTF-1 launch will not include an actual boost-glide vehicle and that the simulated glider is supposed to break up shortly after it is released would seem to point to difficulties with the booster. “To ensure ARRW is mature for a production decision, the Air Force and Lockheed Martin took deliberate steps to achieve a high level of manufacturing readiness,” the Air Force also shared in its release regarding the new flight test schedule for the weapon. “Assembly of the ARRW booster test vehicle on production-representative manufacturing lines is a major step toward this production readiness goal.” The service presently plans to buy at least eight full-up prototype AGM-183As, at least four of which it expects to launch during live-fire testing that is still scheduled to begin later this year. Depending on how successful those tests are, any leftover missiles could be used to help field an early operational capability in 2022. As it stands now, the B-52H is expected to be the primary launch platform for the AGM-183A. One of these bombers could carry up to four of these weapons at a time, two under each wing. Boeing is reportedly in the process of developing new underwing pylons, dubbed Hercules, each of which would be able to hold three ARRWs, or combinations of other ordnance totaling up to 20,000 pounds. That work appears to follow on from an Air Force requirement that emerged in 2018 for new Heavy Release Capability (HRC) pylons, which the service wanted to be able to accommodate 20,000-pound-class weapons, for the B-52H. There has also been discussion about potentially integrating the AGM-183A onto the B-1B bomber in the future. At the same time, the Air Force is working with Boeing now to restore the ability of those aircraft to carry various types of additional weaponry on up to six external hardpoints . How the Air Force ultimately fields ARRW, which is set to be the U.S. military’s first operational air-launched hypersonic weapon, will be very dependent on the success of the forthcoming flight test program, which will hopefully kick off later this month.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2016",Taiwan’s New Amphibious Assault Ship Bristles With Anti-Air Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan today formally introduced into service the first of a new class of amphibious assault ships to the Republic of China Navy, or ROCN. While the lead ship of the Yushan class of landing platform docks, or LPDs, has similarities with the U.S. San Antonio class , what’s immediately notable is its relatively enormous anti-aircraft firepower, with launch cells for no fewer than 32 medium-range surface-to-air missiles. This is almost certainly the first time an assault ship of this type has packed such a powerful air defense capability. In a ceremony today in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the Yushan (LPD-1401) was officially transferred to the ROCN today, in the presence of President Tsai Ing-wen. President Tsai Ing-wen at the commissioning ceremony of the Yushan today. via Twitter The Yushan was built by the state-owned China Shipbuilding Corporation (CSBC), which laid the keel of the vessel in June 2020 and then launched it in April 2021. At-sea trials then began in July this year. President Tsai Ing-wen watched the launch of the Yushan in April 2021. Office of the President of Taiwan Speaking at the commissioning ceremony, Tsai said the new vessel reflected Taiwan’s path to “national defense autonomy,” which includes local production of advanced warships and submarines. “When it comes to China’s military threats , only by strengthening our self-defense capabilities can there be true peace,” Tsai said, according to a report from Reuters . “It is our constant policy and determination to implement national defense autonomy so that the military has the best equipment to defend the country.” The size of the first-in-class LPS is evident in this dockside view. via Twitter Appropriately for a vessel named after Taiwan’s tallest mountain, the new warship is the biggest of its kind to be built by local industry, by some margin. It has a fully loaded displacement of 10,600 tons, compared with 4,100 tons for the next-biggest home-built surface combatant, the Cheng Kung class frigate. ROCS Chi Kuang (PFG-1105), one of the Cheng Kung class guided-missile frigates. These were the largest Taiwanese-built warships intended primarily for offensive operations prior to the Yushan class LPD. 玄史生/Wikimedia Commons Other specifications for the new LPD include a length of around 500 feet and a hull draught of 20 feet. The vessel has a reported maximum speed of 21 knots and a range of approximately 7,000 miles. Other amphibious warships in ROCN service are all considerably older vessels transferred from the U.S. Navy service, while the Pan Shi and Wu Yi , both of which are notably larger than the Yushan , are one-off combat support ships and are essentially auxiliaries, with a more limited combat capacity. The amphibious command ship ROCS Kao Hsiung (LCC-1) represents the antiquated nature of the current ROCN amphibious warfare fleet. Originally launched in 1944 as a U.S. Navy tank landing ship, this vessel is still thought to be used by Taiwan for missile launch tests. 玄史生/Wikimedia Commons It is not immediately clear what, if any assistance the United States provided to Taiwan while it was developing its new LPD, but there are clearly outward similarities with the San Antonio class, including the enclosed sensor masts, which help reduce radar cross-section. In recent years, Washington has been more willing to share advanced technology with Taiwan, including, for example, combat management systems vital for developing submarines. The Taiwanese vessel also shares a superficial resemblance to the Chinese Type 071 amphibious warfare ship, although both this and the San Antonio are significantly bigger. According to a tweet today from the Republic of China’s Ministry of National Defense, the Yushan “will supply our outlying islands, transport troops, conduct HA/DR [humanitarian assistance and disaster relief] operations, and reinforce our forces with TF [task forces] aboard.” The movement of troops, including in amphibious assaults launched from a standoff distance, via landing craft and helicopters, is part of an LPD’s standard mission set. Five new landing craft mechanized (LCM) were handed over to the ROCN at the same time that the Yushan was commissioned: For its primary role of amphibious assault, the Yushan can accommodate up to 673 troops and the vehicle deck has the capacity to carry AAV7 tracked amphibious landing vehicles, that can be launched and recovered via a well-dock. A hangar provides space for two UH-60-sized helicopters, which can operate from a single flight deck spot. A view of some of the crew quarters below decks on the Yushan. Office of the President of Taiwan However, these kinds of vessels would also be ideal for maintaining supply lines to Taiwan’s more distant islands, close to the Chinese coast , which are especially vulnerable to attack from the mainland. Indeed, the chairman of CSBC, Cheng Wen-lung said that in addition to amphibious warfare, the Yushan will assume the “main transport role” for Taiwan’s offshore islands close to China, as well as in the South China Sea, where various islands, atolls, and other features are claimed by Taiwan, among other nations. However, the warship’s unusual ability to be fitted with surface-to-air missiles capable of medium-to-long-range defense means that it could also be used for a variety of surface warfare contingencies, perhaps even as the flagship of a surface action group, while also providing significant air defense coverage. In terms of armament, the pair of 20mm Phalanx close-in weapon systems (CIWS), fore and aft, is standard for LPDs of this type, primarily providing protection against anti-ship missiles and other close-range threats. Unusually, the Yushan is also armed with a single 76mm gun that can engage aircraft and missiles, and other surface vessels, and provide fire support for ground operations. The 76mm gun and Phalanx CIWS mounted on the bow of the ship. via Twitter More impressively, the vessel is also equipped with a pair of missile launchers, each of which can accommodate 16 medium-range Tien Chien-2N, or TC-2N , surface-to-air missiles. Part of the Sky Sword family of anti-aircraft missiles, the TC-2N has a range of up to 62 miles and uses active radar guidance. Angled launchers for 32 Tien Chien-2N, or TC-2N, surface-to-air missile on the deck of the Yushan. Office of the President of Taiwan Developed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), this missile fills the gap between the Phalanx point-defense system and the longer-range SM-2 Standard missiles that arms the Kee Lung class destroyers (former U.S. Navy Kidd class ). In the past, there have been reports that the same two missile launchers can each be outfitted with eight Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles. The domestically produced Hsiung Feng II , or HF-2, would give the Yushan an impressive surface warfare capability, as well as much-reinforced self-defense against maritime targets. The subsonic anti-ship missile, powered by a turbojet engine, carries a 500-pound warhead over a distance of 62-75 miles. An extended-range variant is also in development, with a range of over 150 miles. The HF-2 is already found on a range of ROCN warships, from frigates to fast attack craft. Potentially, the missile cells on the Yushan could also be arranged to provide a mix of both anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. However, more recent reports indicate that the plan to fit HF-2 anti-ship missiles has been dropped, for now, at least. Regardless, the kind of air defense armament offered by the Taiwanese LPD is in stark contrast to the U.S. Navy’s similar San Antonio class, for example. These warships have a pair of Rolling Airframe Missile launchers and two 30mm Bushmaster II guns for close-in defense. Theoretically, they can be armed with two eight-cell vertical launch systems for Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles ( ESSM ), but these are not fitted. You can read more about this latent capability here . The amphibious transport dock ship USS Anchorage (LPD-23) fires a RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) during a live-fire exercise in the Pacific Ocean earlier this year. U.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Hector Carrera Clearly, the armament of the Yushan class reflects the fact that it’s expected to undertake a wider variety of missions than the San Antonios , including anti-air warfare, although it would undertake this task as part of a larger surface action group offering a balanced range of capabilities. At the same time, the fact that these kinds of weapons have been fitted in the Taiwanese LPD (in the case of the TC-2N) or at least considered (HF-2), likely reflects the assumption that any kind of conflict involving China in the Taiwan Strait, or the South China Sea would involve a significant air and surface threat. That kind of confrontation, especially in the confines of the roughly 110-mile-wide Taiwan Strait, could leave a warship like the San Antonio class highly vulnerable, even when working alongside other surface combatants and submarines.

U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Sarah Villegas/Released Furthermore, simply having access to more surface-to-air missiles would likely be highly beneficial when dealing with the significant numbers of Chinese aircraft that would be expected to flood into the Taiwan Strait during a major offensive, for example. The TC-2N has also been tested against sea-skimming targets , and one of its key wartime roles would be to engage Chinese anti-ship missiles , a wide variety of which are available for launch from multiple platforms . On the other hand, the ROCN remains wholly outnumbered and outgunned by the People’s Liberation Army Navy, making the survivability of even a heavily defended vessel like the Yushan questionable in any kind of serious conflict. Nevertheless, Taiwan has previously demonstrated a willingness to add missiles to ship classes that wouldn’t normally be associated with these kinds of capabilities. In particular, recent exercises have seen the Taiwan Coast Guard’s Anping class catamaran patrol ship reconfigured to fire HF-2 anti-ship missiles. Measures like this reveal a keen interest in finding ways to bolster the country’s naval capabilities as part of its defense strategy against China. It is noteworthy, too, that expanded amphibious warfare capabilities are just one part of a much broader effort to modernize the ROCN, while at the same time reducing the reliance upon the United States as Taiwan’s primary arms supplier. As well as plans to build a total of four Yushan class LPDs, Taiwan’s shipbuilders are busy working on the Tuo Chiang class of corvettes, with work also now having begun on a new class of attack submarines, in a program run by NCSIST, which you can read more about here . Efforts like these are not only planned to increase self-sufficiency in the defense realm but also to respond to increasing pressure applied by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, primarily in the Taiwan Strait. While Beijing makes no secret of its claims over Taiwan, tensions have increased in recent months, starting with the visit to Taipei by the U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in early August. In response, China launched a series of war games that included launching missiles over Taiwan and sending an unprecedented number of aircraft into the Taiwan Strait. Since then, Chinese military activity has continued, albeit on a reduced scale. With Taiwan’s defensive posture primarily set up to defend against a Chinese attack on the main island, which would likely include a large-scale amphibious assault, fielding a powerful new LPD is also a statement of intent from Taiwan. Whether it receives the anti-ship missiles that were planned in the past is unclear. But even without them, the Yushan class LPD offers a unique air warfare capability and it will be highly interesting to see how the Republic of China Navy develops operational procedures for these impressive warships.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 31, 2016",Nuclear Experts On Chances Of Russia Using Atomic Weapons In Ukraine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The specter of nuclear war has loomed larger over the conflict in Ukraine in recent days. Russia’s recent announcement of a partial mobilization was paired with direct nuclear threats from President Vladimir Putin and Deputy Chairman of the country’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev . Now combined with continued losses on the battlefield and the sudden illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories in the country’s east and south, there appears to be a change in messaging and level of concern from the U.S. government and its NATO allies . The possibility of Russia releasing the nuclear genie from its bottle after nearly 80 years is clearly being taken more seriously as is the potential for rapid escalation that could come as a result. And the stakes could not be any higher. A nuclear exchange is mankind’s problem, not just one of nations , and even a very limited use of a tactical nuclear weapon would change the course of human history. We wrote a recent primer on this rapidly developing issue that you can read here for full background. So, what are the chances that Russia uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine? To bring clarity to this extremely challenging and pressing question, The War Zone reached out to the smartest people we know that live and breathe the nuclear weapons issue on a daily basis for their unfiltered opinion. Our participating subject matter experts are: Hans Kristensen — Director, Nuclear Information Project , Federation of American Scientists . Writes the bi-monthly Nuclear Notebook and the world nuclear forces overview in the SIPRI Yearbook . Ankit Panda — Expert on nuclear policy, Asia, missiles, & space. Stanton Senior Fellow , Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Author of ‘ Kim Jong Un and the Bomb .’ Stephen
 Schwartz — Nonresident Senior Fellow at Bulletin Of Atomic Atomic Scientists , Fellow at N Square Collaborative , Editor/Co-author ‘ Atomic Audit: The Costs and Consequences of US Nuclear Weapons Since 1940 ‘. Michael
 Kofman — Director, Russia Studies at CNA . Senior Adjunct Fellow, CNAS . We sent this impressive group the same questions independently so that their responses could be as direct and unfiltered as possible. Here they are in full. Do you see the current circumstances in Ukraine as drastically increasing the chances of Russia using a nuclear weapon, especially in terms of attempting to freeze the conflict under a so-called ‘escalate to deescalate’ action? Hans Kristensen: Probably not “dramatically,” but since the war is going bad for Russia and the rhetoric is intensifying, it indicates a greater willingness to rattle the nuclear sword explicitly in the Ukraine context. In February, nuclear threats were used generically to signal to NATO not to get directly involved. Now nuclear threats are explicitly mentioned against Ukraine. This is not an “escalate-to-deescalate” scenario as described in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review because Russia is not under attack from NATO and the survival of the Russian state is not at stake. It does not fit Russia’s declaratory policy, but Dmitry Medvedev’s statement earlier today [September 28] sounds like an attempt to link the two nonetheless. Russia is deterred from attacking NATO directly but if the Kremlin believes – as Medvedev suggested today – that it doesn’t have to fear a NATO response, then it could potentially lower the nuclear threshold. But there are other factors too – what will Russia gain from nuclear use and what will it lose more – that influence the decision. Despite the saber-rattling and brinkmanship, the Russians – certainly the military – know full well the consequences to Russia from a greater war with NATO. Ankit Panda: The risk of nuclear use by Russia increased over the pre-war baseline after the start of the war in February. Since then, I don’t assess a significant shift in the risks of nuclear use provided that the basic thresholds of no direct NATO operational involvement in Ukraine and no direct Russian strikes on NATO hold. Russia’s battlefield setbacks, however, probably marginally increase the risk of nuclear use, but I’d still suggest, in subjective terms, that the risk remains low. The logic of “escalate-to-deescalate” isn’t a formal component of Russian military doctrine, but Putin has shown himself willing to maneuver as he’d like to accomplish political objectives. Stephen Schwartz: Desperate people in control of nuclear weapons (especially those committed to always appearing strong) is never a good combination. I think the biggest risk at the moment is if/when Putin declares that his sham referenda show overwhelming support for annexing large parts of eastern Ukraine, and then he annexes that territory and warns that any further military attacks there will be considered attacks on Russia itself, risking a nuclear response to defend Russian territory. By doing so, he may create a dangerous commitment trap, compelling him to respond (even if he was only bluffing) in order to avoid appearing weak and further undermining his already weak military position with Ukraine and NATO, as well as at home. And if he wasn’t bluffing, well… Michael Kofman : No, Russian thinking on nuclear weapons is probably much closer to ‘escalate to not lose’ under certain conditions, rather than escalating to maintain gains. It’s worth noting that Russia hasn’t used nuclear weapons even after suffering significant casualties and defeats in Ukraine, so the criteria are clearly beyond such battlefield losses. This is just one person’s opinion, but rather than a tactical defeat, it may be tied to the loss of cohesion and control over the forces in theater, leading to a collapse of the military, or a significant loss of territory within that context, such that Russia is unable to recover it. If a nuclear weapon was detonated, even just to display a willingness to use nuclear weapons, killing nobody and resulting in little radiological consequences, what do you see the world community doing in response? What about NATO? What would happen right after? Hans Kristensen: The international response to Russian nuclear use in Ukraine would likely be forceful and overwhelmingly condemning. Breaking the nuclear taboo after 77 years would be a monumental political, social, and military event. It would likely lead to even greater isolation of Russia, and Putin’s last remaining friends abandoning him. NATO’s options would likely be complicated. It is by no means certain that the alliance would agree to scale up military involvement in Ukraine. Many would, but one could easily imagine Turkey, Hungary, and Italy would use the event to increase calls for a negotiated settlement of the war. Putin appears to already have declared an energy war on the West, which will likely lead to energy and money hardness in the winter months and weaken public support for continuing to support Ukraine. Since Ukraine is not a member of NATO, the alliance presumably can’t just attack Russian forces in Ukraine (certainly Russian territory) without declaring war on Russia. If it did, we would have a direct military conflict between Russia and NATO – the very scenario Biden and other Western leaders have said they don’t want because of the much greater consequences. Declaring war would likely be blocked by Turkey, Hungary, and Italy. That could potentially leave the United States or a coalition of the willing to react militarily anyway and gamble that Russia would be deterred from escalating further. Ankit Panda: I think this is the hardest case for a response, in many ways: the nuclear taboo would have been broken and the first atmospheric nuclear detonation in anger since Nagasaki would have taken place. But given that the effects would be limited (radiologically and in terms of damage to humans), I’d see the upper-end of a response by NATO and the west to probably consist of conventional strikes against the Russian unit that delivered the weapon combined with various other political-economic measures to continue to punish Moscow. As a practical matter, because this is a tough case, it would be best for the West to maintain ambiguity about the precise nature of its response while clearly communicating that there would be serious consequences for breaching this threshold. Stephen Schwartz: I don’t know because, thankfully, we have never reached that crisis point in the 77 years nuclear weapons have been around. It is very difficult to imagine NATO or the United States or Russia backing down after that (not least because doing so would call into question the very essence of nuclear deterrence). So, again, even if no one really wanted to use nuclear weapons and everyone understood such use would likely be militarily and politically catastrophic, they might nevertheless find themselves unable to ratchet down tensions out of fear that doing so would lead to equally bad or worse consequences. People forget that nuclear deterrence isn’t just about possessing nuclear weapons but also being perceived by one’s adversaries as being both ready and willing to use them under extreme circumstances. That we have not yet witnessed the third use of a nuclear weapon in war is, I believe, in spite of our unwarranted faith in the magical power of nuclear deterrence, not because of it. The 60th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis is in one month. Everyone understands that that crisis ended peacefully and chalks it up to deterrence “working,” but far too few people appreciate how incredibly close we came to accidental nuclear war multiple times during those tense 13 days because human beings and the deadly technologies we rely upon are inherently fallible. Sheer luck played a pivotal role in the ultimately peaceful outcome, not plans or posturing or psychology. Do we dare tempt fate twice? Michael Kofman : I don’t know and it depends. Demonstrative employment can yield different scenarios. What about if a number of military or even civilian targets were hit with nuclear weapons in Ukraine? How does that change the calculus over just the display of use? Hans Kristensen: Beyond a demonstration use of a nuclear weapon (perhaps over the Black Sea), Russia could potentially decide to use a few nuclear weapons to weaken the Ukraine counteroffensive, halt the momentum, and use the pause to get a military advantage. But that would likely be a short-term gain as the Ukrainians would likely soon regroup and resume the push. Russian nuclear use presumably would only postpone the inevitable defeat – unless Putin continued to use nuclear weapons. Prior to the U.S. Gulf War, the Pentagon studied the use of nuclear weapons against Hussein’s army in the desert and found it would have required the use of quite a number of weapons to have a decisive effect. Putin could then potentially decide to use a public terror campaign and level Kyiv and one or more cities to break the Ukrainian’s will to fight. He has already demonstrated that he does not care much for civilians in Ukraine. And his conventional bombing of eastern cities so far has caused so much destruction that a tactical nuclear weapon almost seems like more of the same. Ankit Panda: The use of nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear Ukraine to accomplish military objectives seems unlikely to me; Russia’s lower-yield nuclear weapons would have difficulties providing serious military benefit against distributed Ukrainian infantry units and sparse mechanized units. The primary effect would be to shock and terrorize the Ukrainians, but this could easily have the effect of reinforcing Ukraine’s will to fight in an existential struggle. Putin has little to gain here, I think. Responding to this would present NATO with similar challenges to the scenario above, but I suspect the response would be the same (as would my prescription on signaling). Stephen Schwartz: I have to believe it would, but in what direction I don’t know. Thankfully, no one on Earth has any experience fighting an actual nuclear war. Will calmer heads prevail or will the complex mechanisms we’ve relied on for three-quarters of a century instead propel us even closer to doomsday? Michael Kofman : I suspect there will be a response from the U.S. and several nations, what form it will take place depends on the context. These are ultimately political decisions, and no matter what leaders say, they themselves may not know what they will do until the moment arrives. (Source: Michael Kofman, Anya Fink, Jeffrey Edmonds, “Russian Strategy for Escalation Management: Evolution of Key Concepts,” CNA paper, April 2020. What about the possible use of chemical weapons? Do you see Russia escalating there first, if at all? Hans Kristensen: That’s another option that seems more credible than nuclear use. Chemical weapons would be an escalation but not as taboo as nuclear weapons. Putin would still have other options (to nuclear use). Others have already used them in warfare (Iraq and Syria) and Ukrainian front-line forces are probably not well equipped to protect themselves from chemical weapons. But it would be complicated for Russian forces to subsequently operate in areas that had been contaminated. And it would likely harden the Ukrainian will to fight. Ankit Panda: Yes. We’ve seen from Syria that Russia views chemical weapons as having military utility in urban warfare, in particular. This is a much greater risk in the near-term than nuclear use. Stephen Schwartz: Is this possible? I suppose, but only if it is somehow advantageous to Russia. As Russia tries to draft large numbers of fresh recruits (many with little or no experience with chemical weapons), it may find that any use of such weapons would hinder rather than help its attempts to take and hold Ukrainian territory, to say nothing of the worldwide condemnation that would result if it did. Michael Kofman : No, not really. They bring little value relative to the political cost of using them. They’re also not especially useful for a power with Russia’s conventional or nuclear means. How much warning do you believe Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO intelligence would have before Russia actually detonated a nuclear weapon? Hans Kristensen: If the nuclear weapon is a tactical weapon, then I think they would have several days warning. After Putin ordered the military to prepare, the military would have to communicate to the 12th Main Directive to release the warhead from storage, the custodial and security forces needed to transport the warhead to the unit with the launcher, where they would work to install the warhead on the weapon. Then Putin would have to issue the order, which would have to trickle down the chain of command. During all these steps, U.S. intelligence could potentially discover that something was up. One could also imagine that Putin didn’t plan to use nuclear weapons but chose to disclose preparations to increase the coercive effect of the threat to force Ukraine and some Western countries to back down and demand Ukraine enter negotiations. Use of strategic nuclear weapons would probably have less warning time because the ICBMs and SLBMs are already on alert with warheads installed. Ankit Panda: We know where Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons are stored and U.S. military intelligence would likely have good indicators if warheads are being removed and mated with delivery systems. The U.S. and NATO would also publicize this – loudly. I expect we’d have warning. Stephen Schwartz: Russian nonstrategic or tactical weapons are not believed to be deployed for immediate use on a regular basis but instead are kept in several ‘central storage’ facilities. Presumably, these are closely monitored by US and NATO intelligence so that we would notice unusual movements of personnel or equipment or materiel out of them. Likewise, we would presumably detect elevated alert levels, and increased security, activity, and communications for any nuclear-capable units that received weapons and/or were making them ready for use. The amount of warning could vary from days to hours to minutes depending on how closely we’re watching and the stage of deployment (e.g., moving weapons out of central storage would suggest an increased level of readiness but not necessarily for immediate use). Increasing readiness to use strategic nuclear weapons would include increased communications to and from missile and submarine bases. Submarines surging out of port would also be a worrisome indicator. So would the removal of additional bomber-based nuclear weapons from central storage (where most are kept on a day-to-day basis). Russia, of course, knows this and can use that knowledge to signal its intentions without necessarily making additional overt nuclear threats. On top of all that, one would expect certain senior military personnel and political leaders to, in the most extreme case, relocate to emergency operations centers or bunkers . Any launch of ballistic missiles would be detected almost instantly by early-warning satellites spotting their exhaust plumes. A few minutes later, ground-based, long-range, early-warning radars in Greenland, Great Britain, and Alaska would confirm the launch and provide an assessment of missile trajectories and the estimated time-to-target. Nuclear weapons delivered by aircraft or cruise missiles, especially within the current theater of war, would not be detected so easily (although unusual movements of aircraft at bases known to house nuclear weapons would not go unnoticed), and even if they were, the warning time would only be measured in tens of minutes, if that. Michael Kofman : Russia may actually want to offer plenty of warning in an effort to signal and thereby coerce, i.e. make the act of preparation visible. In general, I suspect that overt preparations might be observed prior to use.

Dan Parsons,"Posted on Sep 21, 2022",Ukraine Situation Report: ‘Army’ Larger Than Russia’s Invasion Force Likely Fled Mobilization,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More Russians have likely fled their country in the week since President Vladimir Putin announced mobilization plans than made up the entire force massed to invade Ukraine seven months ago, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense. “In the seven days since President Putin announced the ‘partial mobilization ,’ there has been a considerable exodus of Russians seeking to evade call-up,” the U.K. MoD said in its latest intelligence assessment of the war. “While exact numbers are unclear, it likely exceeds the size of the total invasion force Russia fielded in February 2022.” Estimates of Russia’s pre-invasion military force range from 130,000 to 190,000 troops. Middle-class, better educated, and ethnic majority Russians are as overrepresented in the masses fleeing Russia as ethnic minorities appear to be in those being conscripted. The exodus, combined with the number of military-aged male Russian citizens being mobilized, contributes to an accelerated “brain drain” from Russian society, according to the U.K. MoD. Putin’s partial mobilization is an effort to plug holes in his front lines in Ukraine with at least 300,000 recruits. The problems with calling up masses of untrained, poorly equipped conscripts were immediately apparent as troops began showing up to frontline positions with little more than a rifle and a few days of training, if that. The conscripts in the video below were dumped in a snowy field with no officers, uniforms, weapons, or direction. Throngs of military-aged men flocked to airports in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities trying to book flights out. All along the Russian border with Europe, long lines of cars stacked up carrying potential recruits hoping to evade conscription. In a genuine sense, Putin mobilized his pool of draftees, if not precisely in the manner intended. Putin seems to recognize that mobilization was not the panacea he may have hoped for. In a recent video address, he said the wrong sorts of people were being conscripted into his beleaguered army. “We must correct mistakes and not allow them going forward,” he says in the video below. A new poll by the Levada Center, an independent Russian nongovernmental social research firm, shows that 56 percent of Russians are anxious about the war. That is up from about 36 percent just a month ago. Mobilization has caused widespread protests in Russia. Ukrainian forces are exploiting the seeming abysmal morale within the Russian ranks. They have instituted a policy of allowing Russian prisoners of war to call home periodically to promote their mental health while in captivity. It also allows individual Russian troops to speak candidly to loved ones about the realities of the war, circumventing Kremlin propaganda about how the conflict is progressing that almost certainly sugar-coats the conditions and circumstances under which its soldiers are serving. In an attempt to help bolster its losing hand in Ukraine, Russia has redeployed most of the troops it had along its northwestern border area. The tactical realities of the two armies now facing off in eastern Ukraine could not be more different. Russian forces are on the defensive along nearly their entire front from Kherson in the south to Kharkiv in the north. They have suffered severe logistical challenges and supply shortages since the invasion began, all the while being hounded and pounded by Ukrainian precision artillery strikes. Their numbers have dwindled and much of their best equipment has been damaged or destroyed, or is increasingly in various states of disrepair. Replacements are usually of inferior capabilities and quality — if they can be had. Opposing them is a well-trained, disciplined, and well-equipped army with the deep backing of the United States and its NATO allies. Most of all, they are fighting for their very soil and freedom. Ukrainian forces have gained the tactical initiative. The Ukraine Ministry of Defense pointed out the disparity in a Thursday video posted to social media. Ukraine’s information battle is also deeply on the offensive. Videos like the one below depict a military force with unbounded morale to the world. Putin has set the stage to escalate the war further, even as his troops defend occupied ground from the advancing Ukrainians. Before we get into the details, catch up on our previous rolling coverage of the conflict here. The Latest Moscow plans to formally annex four regions of Ukraine in a ceremony in Moscow on Friday, according to multiple media outlets. Referendums on annexation were held in the four areas — Luhansk and Donetsk in the east and in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south — late last week that were almost universally condemned as totally corrupt. In preparation for the ceremony, the Russian-installed leaders of all four regions were flown to Moscow aboard a commercial airliner on Wednesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was joined by leaders of several NATO member states and the U.N. Secretary General in calling the referendums sham votes without legal force. On Thursday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki issues a statement calling the “pseudo-referendums … another stage of Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine.” “Russia continues its constant information warfare, which is part of the war effort,” Morawiecki said. “Russia’s information products and narrative are making their way into public opinion in the West. This can also be seen in the way pseudo-referendums organized by the occupiers are described.” U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, held a joint press conference at the Capitol to condemn Putin’s annexation plans. Putin’s next move is anyone’s guess now that his mobilization plan seems unlikely to salvage Moscow’s war effort. However, Ukrainian officials are concerned that the likelihood of Russia using a tactical nuclear weapon to regain the initiative and punish Kyiv is “very high,” according to Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence. “They will likely target places along the frontlines with lots of personnel and equipment,” Skibitsky told The Guardian , according to the Kyiv Independent news service. “In order to stop them, we need not just more anti-aircraft systems but anti-rocket systems.” The possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons has been on the Pentagon’s radar , but so far, the Defense Department has seen no reason to change its nuclear posture in Europe. In his Sept. 29 press conference, Senator Lindsey Graham said the use of a nuclear weapon in Ukraine would constitute a strike on NATO, even though Ukraine is not a member state. Ukrainian forces have liberated several villages around Lyman in the Donetsk Oblast. Battles to recapture other towns around the city are ongoing as Ukraine attempts to surround the city and completely seal off the remaining Russian forces. Pro-Russian media outlet Rybar suggests that Ukrainian forces have completely encircled Lyman. According to Rybar’s most recent map of the tactical situation in Lyman, the remaining Russian troops are trapped in a pocket there. As they push Russian forces farther east, Ukrainian troops are taking custody of a growing fleet of undamaged, seemingly abandoned tanks. Several Russian T-80 tanks were recently inducted into Ukrainian service around Kharkiv in the north. Ukrainian forces also came into possession of two more modern T-90M tanks and an older T-72B3 complete with a roof cage meant to protect against anti-tank guided missiles, or ATGMS, and from drone attacks, although they are largely ineffective. In some places, Russian and Ukrainian tanks are facing off in traditional tank battles, as shown in the video below. The Russian tank does not fare well in the duel. It is seen hit by a round, demonstrating one of the catastrophic ammunition detonations that plagued Moscow’s tanks in this conflict. Russian forces lost a few more Orlan-10 unmanned aerial vehicles to Ukrainian forces. One photographed in Sumy Oblast seems to have been shot down and is in pieces. Another in the east appears undamaged, so it was likely brought down with electronic warfare means or it just crashed, although the soldier pictured is posing with a man-portable air defense system (MANPADS). Ukrainian forces have been able to regularly down Russian reconnaissance drones in this conflict, which has been one factor that has prompted Moscow to source more unmanned aircraft from Iran . Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Putin on the phone on Sept. 29. During the conversation, Erdogan offered to mediate the conflict if Russia and Ukraine agreed to reopen negotiations, according to a readout of the call released by Erdogan’s office. Mark Hamill, the actor famous for playing Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars films, met virtually with Zelensky as an ambassador for United24, a group raising money to fund a Ukrainian “drone army.” Hamill has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on social media since the outset of hostilities in February. Ukraine, and Zelensky himself, have often used Star Wars metaphors and imagery that depicts Ukraine as the rebel force taking on the evil and much more powerful empire.

Howard Altman,"Posted on Apr 22, 2022",Hurricane Hunter P-3 Launched New Low Flying Drone Into Ian,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Shortly before making history by launching the first ALTIUS-600 drone ever to fly into a hurricane, the NOAA WP-3D Orion, nicknamed Kermit , was rocked by turbulence so violent after an eyewall penetration that many aboard suffered air sickness. “A lot of people had barf bags filling up,” Joe Cione, Lead Meteorologist for New Technologies at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory, told The War Zone Thursday morning. The flight was so turbulent that NOAA Hurricane Hunter Nick Underwood, who was one of the 18 people aboard the flight, called it “the roughest flight of my career so far.” “We got slammed pretty hard,” said Cione, who has flown some 150 eyewall penetrations in about 25 such flights. But Nick Liccini and Patrick Sosa, the two staffers from AREA-I, the Marietta, Georgia company that makes the ALTIUS-600 “were real heroes too, because both of them were sick and not feeling well at all and they still managed to do the job.” That job was to help guide the ALTIUS-600 – a 40-inch-long, 23-pound drone with a 100-inch wingspan when deployed – into the eye of Hurricane Ian to help fix its center and gather other data needed to help gauge the intensity and track of the massive, deadly storm. But it was no slam dunk, Cione said. The eyewall was in the middle of rearranging itself, and in an oval shape, instead of perfectly round, “which was a sign that the storm was intensifying while we were there. It was pretty unnerving conditions.” But thanks to the skill of the aircrew and the sturdiness of the airframe designed for such situations, Kermit made it through and the drone was launched. It turned out to be a highly successful first launch of the drone that provided valuable insights including locating the true center of the hurricane. “We managed to launch the drone and babysat it for a few minutes so it could get its bearings. And we did all that under conditions where we had just some very severe turbulence.” The flight was so rough that NOAA waived off further eyewall penetration attempts while still monitoring Ian, collecting “operationally valuable data” and providing telemetry support for the drone. But the ALTIUS-600 – a version of which is also being tested in the U.S. Army’s Air Launched Effects (ALE) program – kept flying for two hours after being launched, providing data from inside the storm that Kermit could not. And the crew inside Kermit was able to maintain communications with the drone, using a datalink, from as far away as 125 nautical miles. “The drone was in there and we were outside the winds while the drone was measuring what it could while we were safe and away from the most violent aspects of that storm.” Ian slammed into the Fort Myers area of southwest Florida Wednesday as a massive Category 4 storm with winds of up to 155 mph, just shy of a Category 5 hurricane. Several people have already been confirmed dead, with many more fatalities expected. Hurricane Hunting Started With A Wage r Aircraft have been flying into and around and above hurricanes for decades. The first such flight was actually flown as the result of a bet. “In 1943, pilots taking part in flight training using instrument panels ribbed their instructor into betting on their new flight training, as flying exclusively with instruments was introduced in the 1940s,” according to weather.com . Hurricane hunting flights have evolved tremendously since then. The U.S. Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (WRS) situated at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, remains the U.S. government’s main hurricane hunting arm. The unit has specially configured WC-130 aircraft . The U.S. Navy stopped contributing to the hurricane hunting mission in 1974, according to NOAA . The 53rd WRS aircraft also flew into Ian, which you can watch in the video below. NOAA operates three hurricane hunter aircraft out of its Aircraft Operations Center in Lakeland, Florida, all given nicknames of Muppet characters. NOAA flies two WP-3D Orions, nicknamed Kermit and Miss Piggy, and a Gulfstream IV-SP , nicknamed Gonzo. The agency has a number of other smaller aircraft for other weather surveillance purposes, too. Like the WC-130s, the Orions generally fly into storms at between 8,000 and 12,000 feet. The Gulfstream IV, meanwhile, flies over and around storms, cruising at about 45,000 feet. All those aircraft drop devices called dropsondes – cylindrical cardboard tubes filled with sensors measuring air pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. The data helps determine how strong a storm is and where it is likely headed. But the dropsondes only offer a limited snapshot of the atmospheric conditions. At 45,000 feet, for instance, the dropsondes have about 16 minutes before they hit the water. Weather scientists have long wanted to collect data from much lower altitudes and for far longer time periods. But it is far more dangerous to fly into a storm just hundreds of feet off the water, said Cione. “We have some remote sensors that measure directly below. But we really have no way to get continuous measurements in that boundary layer environment, which is where the air meets the sea.” So NOAA has turned to drones, because they are expendable. NOAA’s first use of the Raytheon-made Coyote drone s was part of the observation of Hurricane Edouard in 2014. The agency had purchased the drones with funding from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act in the wake of Hurricane Sandy , which caused severe damage to the coasts of New York and New Jersey in particular. The Raytheon-made Coyote drone was first used by NOAA in 2014. (NOAA photo) In 2016, NOAA began receiving improved Coyotes from Raytheon. The biggest improvement was an increase in how far away the drones could fly from the controller on the WP-3Ds. The latest models can operate up to 50 miles from the host aircraft and fly for approximately one hour with the research sensor payloads. In 2017, as Hurricane Maria made its way toward the Caribbean and North America, NOAA scientists launched Coyote drones into these hard-to-reach areas of the storm to gather vital information, highlighting just one of many emerging roles for expendable unmanned aircraft . Raytheon offered the seven-pound Coyote as a lightweight, low-cost platform for a variety of roles. Personnel can get the drone airborne from on the ground, on a ship, or on board an aircraft. After launch, a six-foot wide main wing, two rear stabilizers and twin vertical tails all pop into place, giving the pilotless aircraft a distinctive look. Between Sept. 23 and 24 of 2019, NOAA’s WP-3D Orion research aircraft dropped a total of six of the small remotely operated aircraft into Maria’s “eyewall,” a boundary layer between the eye and the rest of the storm where the weather is most severe and winds can reach speeds of 200 miles per hour or more, according to manufacturer Raytheon . The Coyotes gathered air pressure, moisture, temperature, and wind speed and direction data during the flights. You can read much more about that in our coverage here. Successful Mission The ALTIUS-600 is the latest and most capable iteration of this concept. Developed by AREA-I, ALTIUS-600 is part of the ALTIUS family of autonomous tube-launched drones or Air Launched Effects (ALE) “that are available on-demand and operational within minutes,” according to the company’s website . A closeup of the ALTIUS-600 drone used for the first time in a hurricane on Wednesday. (NOAA photo) They can also be launched from the air, sea, and ground from systems like the Common Launch Tube (CLT), Pneumatically Integrated Launch System (PILS), and other launch systems. To date, ALTIUS-600 has been launched from a variety of aircraft, including UH-60s, C-130s, AC-130s, UH-60s, P-3s, and civilian airframes, as well as ground vehicles. They have a cruise speed of 55 knots, a dash speed of 90 knots, and a cruising range of 220 nautical miles. They can stay aloft for hours. Cione said his team worked with AREA-I to develop a drone that can fly “very, very low, a couple of hundred feet” off the surface at altitudes “otherwise too dangerous for manned aircraft.” The rationale is that the “boundary layer right near the surface is where we all live, right? That’s where our buildings are. So we want to know, especially with the winds, what’s going on down at that altitude. And to do that more accurately, we need more measurements and these drones can give us those measurements at very unsafe altitudes in the most dangerous parts of the storm.” NOAA successfully test flew the ALTIUS-600 in far calmer weather conditions earlier this year. The ALTIUS-600 was tested by NOAA earlier this year. (NOAA photo) Cione, the AREA-I crew and weather scientists Jun Zhang of the University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute For Marine And Atmospheric Studies at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory and Josh Wadler of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University turned that experiment into reality on Wednesday. All things considered, Cione said it was an overwhelming success with some happy operational surprises. “We’ve had it fly as long as 3.5 hours, but yesterday, we had some technical issues,” he said. “We’d lost communication for a little bit. The drone was sometimes flying against the wind in the eyewall which was amazing. We certainly weren’t trying to do that. But at times it was doing that. So that was not an energy-efficient way to go. That’s why we got about two hours instead of three hours or maybe even longer than that.” One of those most interesting and promising aspects of the operation was the autonomy ALTIUS-600 was able to leverage. “When we launched that aircraft, we said ‘go find the max winds.’ And artificial intelligence code was written for that thing to understand how to do that.” Other than some directional commands, the ALTIUS-600 operated autonomously, even after Kermit moved out of the hurricane’s eye. “We also had an algorithm in there so it would go in and go sniff out the center of the storm because we were in the eye at first. So it did a center fix which the P-3 normally does, and does do well, but we wanted to see if a drone could do it. And I haven’t looked at the data yet, but we did get a center fix on it, which is the first time.” That, he said, is an important milestone, providing information the National Hurricane Center and other modeling centers want, “because not only can that help us with the atmosphere and help us with intensity, but if we can pinpoint where it is much with great accuracy, that information can also impact storm track on short timescales over 24 hours or so. Like right before landfall.” Cione said Wednesday was just the beginning. “We’re going to be putting a turbulence probe on there next year,” he said. “Remember, this is the first flight we’ve ever done. So this is sort of a prototype-ish kind of mission.” ALTIUS-600’s Military Cousin In its primary military role, the ALTIUS-600 is one of the standouts among an increasingly diverse universe of highly flexible expendable drones. The ALTIUS-600 can be configured for surveillance, electronic warfare, decoy, and kinetic (equipped with a warhead) missions. It can also pair with a flock of other ALTIUS-600s to work as a highly adaptive swarm. The ALTIUS-600 took part in the Army’s 2022 Experimental Demonstration Gateway Exercise (EDGE 22) held in May at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. Flying in a swarm of 28, each was equipped uniquely to conduct detect, identify, locate and report back enemy positions. The swarm then simulated what the Army is calling a “stimulate, hunt, kill and assess tactic.” You can read much more about EDGE 22 and the use of the ALTIUS-600 in our story here . These drones, and future ALTIUS models destined for combat, will increasingly be used in an air-launched form, to work collaboratively with manned platforms and especially helicopters. They will work to help increase the situational awareness of aircrews and to protect them by working as stand-in jammers, decoys, and as deadly weapons in their own right. Regardless of their military applications, NOAA’s use of drones to gather exciting new data about hurricanes that could end up saving lives is just another reminder of the changing reality of unmanned aviation and all the advantages it brings.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 3, 2022",NATO Says All Signs Point To Sabotage Of Baltic Undersea Pipelines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Swedish authorities say they have identified a fourth breach along sections of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that run under the Baltic Sea between Russia and Germany. The exact circumstances behind the ruptures remain unknown, but NATO has now joined the European Union (EU) in concluding that they were most likely the result of some kind of deliberate attack. Readers can find out more about the details that had already emerged in our preceding coverage of the incidents . The newly announced rupture is the second to be detected along the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. There are two other known ruptures in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The first breaches were detected on Monday following a series of large underwater explosions . At the time of writing, neither the EU nor NATO, or any of their member states independently, appear to have formally accused any actor of culpability, though fingers have increasingly been pointing at Russia. Natural gas bubbles to the surface above one of the breached sections of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Swedish Coast Guard The Swedish Coast Guard revealed the second Nord Stream 2 rupture earlier today, saying it was close to the first one (a distance of approximately 1 mile). It also released pictures and video footage, seen above and below, portions of which appear to have been taken from one of the service’s Dash 8-Q300 maritime patrol aircraft and the search and rescue vessel Amfitrite , of gas bubbling up on the surface. Amfitrite is also equipped with a remotely operated underwater vehicle, but it is unclear if the ship has conducted any direct inspections of the breaches using this system. Swedish Coast Guard DHC-8-300 SE-MAA captured a video of the broken Nordstream 1 pipeline yesterday at 10:41 UTC after an explosion ruptured the pipeline late Monday. #ADSB #4AB421 https://t.co/dSp2qu9BCH pic.twitter.com/JybtoJ0rqs — Amelia Smith (@ameliairheart) September 29, 2022 A stock picture of the Swedish Coast Guard search and rescue vessel Amfitrite , with one the service’s Dash 8-Q300 aircraft flying overhead. Swedish Coast Guard The locations of the now broken portions Nord Stream 2 pipeline are both in international waters, but are within an area where Sweden has declared an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The two ruptured sections of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline are also in international waters, but are situated in an area that is covered by Denmark’s EEZ in the Baltic Sea. The two pipelines are both partially owned by Russian state gas company Gazprom and European energy companies. ***OSINT*** Here -> https://t.co/mgIw61KFZ8 Likely location of 4th leak on Russia's #Nordstream gas pipeline in Baltic. #OSINT Despite the uncertainties inherent in hybrid warfare (and to an extent seabed warfare), eyes are on #Russia pic.twitter.com/GRomvcu2Kh — H I Sutton (@CovertShores) September 29, 2022 Swedish and Danish authorities are among those investigating the incidents, with other countries in Europe and beyond, such as the United States, assisting. Sweden and Denmark are both EU members. Demark is also a NATO member, while Sweden is currently in the process of joining the alliance. “The damage to the Nordstream 1 and Nordstream 2 pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea is of deep concern,” a statement from NATO today read. “All currently available information indicates that this is the result of deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage. These leaks are causing risks to shipping and substantial environmental damage. We support the investigations underway to determine the origin of the damage.” “We, as Allies, have committed to prepare for, deter and defend against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics by state and non-state actors,” that statement added, but did not name any specific party as being responsible for the pipeline incidents. “Any deliberate attack against Alliesâ€™ critical infrastructure would be met with a united and determined response.” This is in line with a separate statement from the EU yesterday , which said “all available information indicates those leaks are the result of a deliberate act” and promised “a robust and united response.” Those sentiments were echoed separately by the prime ministers of Sweden and Denmark, with Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson saying today that a large explosive device would have been necessary to cause the damage. The Swedish Security Service, a national-level law enforcement entity in that country that also has counter-espionage and counter-terrorism responsibilities , and is roughly analogous to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), has said that it cannot yet rule out â€œthat a foreign power is behind it.â€ JUST IN: The Swedish Security Service escalates concern over the Nord Stream pipeline damage, investigating it as ""gross sabotage"" which ""may at least partially be directed against Swedish interests."" A statement adds ""it cannot be ruled out that a foreign power is behind it."" — DW Europe (@dw_europe) September 28, 2022 Despite a lack of official allegations, Western officials do increasingly appear to be looking at the Russian government as a possible culprit. â€œItâ€™s hard to imagine any other actor in the region with the capabilities and interest to carry out such an operation,â€ an anonymous Danish military official told CNN, according to a story published today . Russia is currently subject to particularly crippling Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine in February and has a clear interest in fueling an already serious energy crisis impacting various countries in Europe as winter approaches in retaliation. Gazprom had already stopped the flow of gas through Nord Stream 1 at the end of August, ostensibly for maintenance . Nord Stream 2 was completed last year, but has yet to be used operationally after German authorities froze the project under pressure from the U.S. government before Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine. In addition, CNN’s story follows a report in The Times newspaper in the United Kingdom yesterday indicating that British officials viewed a Russian attack involving uncrewed underwater vehicles planting explosive charges as a particularly “likely scenario.” The potential for combat divers to have planted explosives has also been raised given the relatively shallow depths where the damaged sections of the Nord Stream pipelines lie. That had all, in turn, followed a report from German magazine Der Spiegel that said the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had warned authorities in Berlin about the potential for attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines over the summer. CNN also reported today that unspecified Russian Navy support ships were observed earlier this week in the Baltic Sea in the vicinity of the pipeline breaches. At the same time, there are no clear indications one way or another that this, as other recent Russian naval activity is directly linked to these incidents. Russia has a significant naval presence along the Baltic Sea and regularly moves warships , submarines , and other vessels in and out of the region. Russian authorities, for their part, have denied any involvement and promised their own probe into the pipeline incidents. They have also cast aspersions and amplified theories suggesting that the United States or other NATO members might be responsible in some way, but have provided no evidence to support any of these claims. âš¡ï¸ Russian MFA Spokeswoman Maria #Zakharova : â— Russia intends to convene an official UN Security Council meeting regarding the incidents with the #NordStream & #NordStream2 gas pipelines. pic.twitter.com/bXJB9eeoZJ — MFA Russia ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º (@mfa_russia) September 28, 2022 Routine U.S. Navy and other NATO naval activity in the region has prompted particular speculation about potential western involvement in these incidents. A 2015 incident in which Swedish security forces recovered an underwater mine-hunting drone with a live explosive charge inside it near the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has reemerged as part of these discussions. The owner of that uncrewed underwater vehicle was never disclosed and Swedish officials at the time said it did not pose a threat to the pipeline or ships operating in the area. The War Zone has reached out to the U.S. Navy’s top command in Europe, Naval Forces Europe-Africa/U.S. Sixth Fleet (NAVFOREUR-AF/Sixth Fleet), as well as NATO, for comment. In response, NAVFOREUR-AF/Sixth Fleet spokesperson Capt. Tamara Lawrence referred us to statements made by a senior U.S. defense official and the State Department’s top spokesperson, Ned Price, yesterday. Yesterday, a senior U.S. defense official, in the course of a routine press briefing regarding the situation in Ukraine, said the United States was “absolutely not involved” in the pipeline incidents. “The idea that the United States was in any way involved in the apparent sabotage of these pipelines is preposterous,” State Department spokesperson Price said during a separate press briefing yesterday. “It is nothing more than a function of Russian disinformation and should be treated as such.” “We are aware of reports concerning leaks to the Nord Stream pipelines,”  Capt. Lawrence had also said in a statement issued yesterday. “We stand ready to provide support and assistance in close coordination with our allies and partners, if needed.” It could be some time before the various ongoing investigations ultimately produce any harder conclusions about the nature of these incidents and who might be responsible. What EU, NATO, and others may be willing and able to do, especially if it is determined that Russia is culpable, remains to be seen. Discussions about the potential challenges in finding proportionate and practical responses to attacks on multi-national underwater infrastructure in international waters have come up before in regard to the potential cutting of undersea communications cables . If you are not willing to intervene then what exists in terms of deterrence? Nothing direct beyond condemnation, accusations, and sanctions, that is if there is even sanctions left to deploy? — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) September 21, 2022 Beyond any geopolitical impacts, there are environmental concerns arising from the gas now flowing out from the breaches in the pipelines. Gas is at least expected to stop spewing from the breaches in Nord Stream 1 by Monday. Furthermore, there are fears that the damage may be severe enough to make it cost-prohibitive to make any repairs, effectively shutting down the pipelines for good, as well. Once the gas stops coming out of the broken lines, saltwater will begin to rush in and begin to cause corrosion. There is an additional risk of ice plugs forming in the lines that would need to be cleared as part of any repair process. Fears also may be growing about whether the Nord Stream pipeline incidents reflect some kind of broader effort on the part of one or more hostile actors. Danish police confirmed today that they are investigating mysterious drone activity over the Halfdan B offshore oil and gas field in the North Sea, but could provide no additional details. Norweigan authorities issued their own alert about unidentified drone flights around its offshore oil and gas facilities earlier this week and subsequently announced that there would be an increased military presence around that infrastructure. ""We have taken the necessary steps in accordance with our security procedures and are in close dialogue with the authorities"", energy company says — Faytuks News (@Faytuks) September 29, 2022 If nothing else, the pipeline blasts, together with this still-unexplained drone activity, certainly do raise questions about whether Russia’s conflict in Ukraine may be spilling out into other areas of Europe.

Howard Altman,"Updated on Feb 9, 2022",Geriatric E-3 Sentry Has Caused Dire Airborne Early Warning Gap: General,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Air Force plans to replace a portion of its 31 aging E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft with Boeing E-7 Wedgetail radar jets cannot come to fruition soon enough for the head of Air Combat Command. Thanks to the age and unreliability of the AWACS, there is already a capability gap in airborne early warning and command and control that is only going to get worse, Gen. Mark Kelly told reporters, including from The War Zone , last week at the Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) 2022 Air, Space & Cyber Conference. “The first thing I would offer is there’s already – whether there’s 31 airplanes or 16 airplanes – there’s a gap today,” said Kelly. The Air Force is planning to introduce E-7 Wedgetail radar jets, now used by the Royal Australian Air Force, to replace part of its fleet of E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) fleet. (U.S. Air Force photo) The Sentry, the first version of which entered service in the late 1970s, uses the long out-of-production Boeing 707 airframe powered by TF-33 engines in U.S. variants and has an increasingly troublesome availability rate. The Air Force’s own statistics show the increasing difficulty in keeping the AWACS operational according to Defense News , with between roughly 40% and 45% of the Sentries unable to fly in 2021, the latest figures available. The E-3G’s mission-capable rates fell 10 percentage points last year from 70.7% in 2020 to 60.7% in 2021. The E-3B mission-capable rate dropped from 65.8% to 55.8% during that same period. “There’s a reason why there’s exactly zero airlines on planet earth that fly the 707 with TF-33 engines,” said Kelly. “The last airline was Saha Airlines in Iran. We basically have 31 airplanes in hospice care, the most expensive care there is. And we need to get into the maternity business and out of hospices.” U.S. Airmen assigned to the 962nd Aircraft Maintenance Unit monitor an E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System as the aircraft is towed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, March 22, 2022. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Andrew Britten) The Air Force, which plans to keep its B-52 fleet as part of its core bomber force into the future, is replacing that aircraft’s TF-33 engines . As an example of why he has disdain for the Sentry, Kelly said it was much harder to maintain than the Wedgetail, even for the same basic parts. He used the hypothetical example of both aircraft being deployed to Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. “Let’s say it’s exact same part, whether it be a flat hinge or avionics case. They’ll drive over to Dubai, and they’ll be back in two hours, [and the E-7] is up and running.” The same part breaks on the AWACS “more often because it’s that old,” said Kelly, and it is much harder to fix. One big reason is that the E-7 is based on Boeing’s 737 next-gen airframe, which has a massively active supplier base. An U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry takes off from Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, March 6, 2022. The E-3 is an airborne warning and control (AWACS) system aircraft with an integrated command and control battle management surveillance, target detection and tracking platform. (U.S. Air Force photo by Master Sgt. Dan Heaton) It will be cannibalized “out of the boneyard or out of the fleet at Tinker [Air Force Base] and two weeks later that airplane will be back,” said Kelly. “So that’s not a way we’re going to be able to resource and sustain a fight. So we have a capability gap to date for that. And so the only way we’re going to plug that gap is to get E-7s on the ramp as fast as we can, and as many as we can.” In announcing that the Wedgetail would replace a portion of the Sentry fleet, the Air Force earlier this year said in a media release that it’s “the only platform capable of meeting the requirements for the Defense Department’s tactical battle management, command and control and moving target indication capabilities within the timeframe needed to replace the aging E-3.” A contract award is planned for Fiscal Year 2023, the Air Force said. The Pentagon’s 2023 Fiscal Year budget proposal, released earlier this year , includes a request in the Air Force’s portion for $227 million in funds to support E-3 replacement efforts, including buying the first prototype. The proposed budget also calls for the retirement of 15 E-3s and using the funds that would otherwise go to operating and maintaining those aircraft to instead help pay for their successors. “These funds support the acquisition of a rapid prototype aircraft planned to deliver in FY27,” the Air Force said. “The notional schedule plans for a second rapid prototype aircraft funded in FY24, and a production decision in FY25 to continue fielding aircraft.” We covered that decision in depth here . But Kelly is not patient when it comes to the Wedgetail. He said that the U.S. is decades late in fielding the aircraft originally developed for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). “We are 20 years late getting Wedgetail into the fleet,” he said. “The Royal Australian Air Force is a service of 14,370 airmen that is leading us to field the E-7. The Koreans field the E-7. The Turks field the E-7.” U.S. Air Force Gen. Ken Wilsbach, center, Pacific Air Forces commander, stands with crew members of an Australian E-7 Wedgetail aircraft at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, April 16, 2021. The Wedgetail is an airborne early warning and control platform which provides the Australian Military with advanced air battlespace capabilities. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Jimmie D. Pike) He went on to be very blunt about the current airborne early warning situation, stating “There’s no amount of lipstick on this pig that’s gonna make it look good.” But despite Kelly’s feeling of urgency, getting E-7s into the Air Force inventory is no easy feat because there Boeing already a long waiting list. “The timeline is driven by the fact that we’re buying new commercial airplanes and then modifying them to be the surveillance platforms that we want,” Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year. “Getting the airplanes is about a two-year process, and then modifying them is another two-year process. There are things that we could do, however, to maybe get access to aircraft earlier, one way or another.” Boeing ended commercial production of the 737 NG in 2020, but it continues making the airliner for customers of military derivative aircraft such as the E-7 and the US Navy’s P-8 Poseidon sub-hunting aircraft, according to Defense News . It’s not yet clear how much the Air Force’s E-7 variant will differ from Wedgetails already in service elsewhere, as well as those being now built for the United Kingdom . The RFI that the Air Force put out in February indicated that there could be service-specific requirements for the aircraft’s radar, communications and battle management systems, electronic support measures suite, networking architecture, and defense systems, among other things, as you can read more about here . Beyond being more reliable and supportable than the E-3, the E-7 is also a more capable early warning platform. Existing versions of the E-7 are already highly capable airborne early warning and control platforms with their top-mounted Northrop Grumman Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radars and robust communications and data-sharing suites, among other features. Kelly said he is less interested in getting a perfect platform than he is in getting them airborne and improving them along the way. “My guidance to my team is speed to ramp, get them on the ramp,” he said, “I understand that there’ll be some folks that want to update the avionics, update the radar. That’s okay. We’ll do that. We need to get them on the ramp. Because if we can’t get him on the ramp, we can’t get them in the air.” Maintenance Airmen from the 380th Expeditionary Aircraft Maintenance Squadron’s Sentry aircraft maintenance unit work on an E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft during flightline operations at a non-disclosed base in Southwest Asia, March 8, 2010. The 380th EAMXS, as part of the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing, supports operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom and the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa. The E-3 Sentrys and their associated maintenance Airmen are deployed from Tinker Air Force Base, Okla. The Air Force has said in the past that it hoping to field a space-based radar to meet some of these needs in the future. How advanced the development of that capability might be already is unknown. Last year, the head of the U.S. Space Force, Gen. Jay Raymond, revealed that work was already being done in the classified realm on a constellation of radar satellites with ground moving target indicator (GMTI) capability as part of the replacement of the Air Force’s E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) jets. The Air Force’s 2023 Fiscal Year budget request says that “the SecDef [Secretary of Defense] certified that a spaced based Ground Movement Tracking Indicator (GMTI) capability exists to meet the Combatant Commanders Requirements” to further justify the divestment of the entire E-8C fleet over the next two years or so, indicating that capability is much more mature than previously understood. There are other clandestine capabilities that could provide some of the sensor side of the GMTI and possibly the AEW role in the forward reaches of the battlefield, too. Kelly is not just interested in growing the E-7 fleet. Doing the AFA session with reporters last week, he also expressed a similar interest in growing the fleet of the EC-37B Compass Call electronic warfare aircraft, saying that and the Wedgetail are two of his top priorities. The first EC-37B Compass Call aircraft made its inaugural flight in the fall of last year and the Gulfstream 550-based aircraft will replace the aging fleet of EC-130H Compass Call aircraft that are many decades old. The amount of EC-37s being bought is a contentious issue. You can read all about it and the leap in capabilities these aircraft will provide in our recent expose here . When asked if the planned EC-37 buy was insufficient, Kelly said while he “wants more” he is cognizant of budget realities. “I want more, you know, but it’s like a lot of other questions. I want more F-35s. I want more [F-15] EXs. es, I want more. But Secretary Kendall and [Air Force] Chief [of Staff Gen. Charles Q.] Brown are paying a non-trivial bill to recapitalize two of the three legs of the nuclear triad and it is not small zeros. And so the short answer is yes, I’d like to have more. But I want a lot more of everything. I’m a big fan of the E-7 and the EC-37.” Kelly is not alone in wanting to see the Air Force ramp up procurement of Wedgetails. “The Air Force spent decades ignoring the need to recapitalize an aging fleet of command and control aircraft, the E-3 AWACS,” Sen. James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who serves as the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement to The War Zone . “Now, with the Chinese threat bigger than ever, we cannot wait a moment longer to get the E-7 Wedgetail to the battlefield. The Air Force is finally hearing us on this and taking the first steps on getting this critical capability out there months or years sooner than the five years they planned. Now, we’ve got to hold them to it. Our closest allies have been flying the E-7 for a decade or more, it’s past time we catch up.” Contact the author: howard@thewarzone.com Howard Altman Senior Staff Writer Americas Around The Globe News & Features U.S. Homeland"
Dan Parsons,"Posted on Aug 30, 2022",Ukraine Situation Report: Another 18 HIMARS Launchers For Ukraine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Another 18 high-mobility artillery rocket systems , or HIMARS, launchers are included in the latest $1.1 billion security assistance package for Ukraine announced on Sept. 28 by the U.S. Defense Department. The weapons and equipment in the latest aid package will be bought directly from industry on Ukraine’s behalf under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), meaning they are not yet built and could take some time to reach the battlefield. Most of the equipment already donated to Ukraine by the U.S. came from existing Defense Department stocks through Presidential Drawdown Authority, or PDA . Items in the $1.1 billion package include: 18 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and associated ammunition 150 Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) 150 Tactical Vehicles to tow weapons 40 trucks and 80 trailers to transport heavy equipment Two radars for Unmanned Aerial Systems 20 multi-mission radars Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems Tactical secure communications systems, surveillance systems, and optics Explosive ordnance disposal equipment Body armor and other field equipment Funding for training, maintenance, and sustainment The announcement represents the beginning of a contracting process to provide additional priority capabilities to Ukraine in the mid- and long-term, according to the Pentagon. “This USAI package underscores the U.S. commitment to continuing to support Ukraine over the long term,” the Pentagon said in a statement. “It represents a multi-year investment in critical capabilities to build the enduring strength of Ukraine’s Armed Forces as it continues to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty and territory in the face of Russian aggression.” The United States has committed $16.9 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since January 2021. Since 2014, the United States has donated $19 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, of which $16.2 billion was promised or delivered since the beginning of Russia’s invasion on February 24. HIMARS has undeniably been one of the most impactful weapons the U.S. has donated to Ukraine’s war effort. While the Pentagon cautiously progressed with deliveries at the outset while Ukrainian troops proved they could use the precision weapons effectively, there are now 16 firing precision rockets at Russian positions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov mentioned HIMARS by name when thanking the U.S. government for its latest military assistance. The wheeled launchers and M270 tracked launchers donated by NATO allies – both of which fire the precision Guided Multiple-Launch Rocket System , or GMLRS, munitions – played a critical opening role in Ukraine’s ongoing dual-pronged offensive in the north around Kharkiv and south around Kherson. Both launch systems also can fire the Army Tactical Missile System , or ATACMS, which has a 190-mile range. The U.S. has so far declined to provide Ukraine with such a long-range missile capable of striking targets well inside Russia. A systematic campaign using GMLRS to target Russian ammunition storage and logistics capabilities set conditions for Ukraine’s rapid liberation of vast swathes of occupied territory. The War Zone explained how both launcher types, loaded with the M30/31 rockets, would be used as precision-strike weapons and very effective even in relatively small numbers in this piece . HIMARS has achieved cult status as it obliterated Russian positions in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian media began spreading the news of more inbound HIMARS systems even before the Pentagon announced Wednesday. Russia has repeatedly claimed to have destroyed some of Ukraine’s HIMARS launchers, going so far as to chalk up the elimination of more weapons than had even been donated. Knowing Russian forces would seek out and target the HIMARS launchers, Ukrainian forces made mock-ups from plywood to compel the enemy into wasting valuable ammunition. Introducing another 18 HIMARS will more than double the number of them in Ukraine’s arsenal, although the timeline for achieving this is still unknown. Every wheeled launcher can precisely strike targets within a 43-mile radius of its position. As Ukraine pushes consistently eastward along its two axes of advance, its HIMARS can reach further into Russian-occupied territory. There have been concerns that U.S. ammunition stockpiles are insufficient to keep Ukrainian forces firing GMLRS while leaving enough for the U.S. military in case of major contingency operations. Before we get to the details of everything else happening in the fight for Ukraine, take a moment to revisit our rolling coverage of the conflict here. The Latest In addition to detailing what was in the announced $1.1 billion in USAI funding, a senior U.S. defense official said that Ukraine is consolidating the territorial gains it has made in recent weeks of the seven-month-long war. From the other side of the line, Russia is thought to be increasing strikes against civilian targets. In the Donetsk region, Ukrainian forces have nearly encircled the city of Lyman, according to pro-Russian media sources. The map below shows Russian forces almost surrounded in and around the city, with Ukrainian troops pushing to close the pincer from the north and south in their rear. The same push to cut off Russian troops in Lyman is reflected in the U.K. Ministry of Defense intelligence assessment map of the conflict for Sept. 28. Ukraine has pressed its offensive operations in the north-east of the country over the last few days, the U.K. MoD said in its latest intelligence assessment of the conflict. “Units are making slow advances on at least two axes east from the line of the Oskil and Siverskyy Donets rivers, where forces had consolidated following their previous advance earlier in the month,” the U.K. MoD said. “Russia is mounting a more substantive defense than previously, likely because the Ukrainian advance now threatens parts of Luhansk Oblast as voting in the referendum on accession to the Russian Federation closes. Heavy fighting also continues in the Kherson region where the Russian force on the right bank of the Dnipro remains vulnerable.” The specter of nuclear weapons continues to loom larger over the conflict in Ukraine. NATO is clearly taking the threats more seriously than they had been, while it seems that Putin has chosen the troop surge route instead, at least for now. In Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces continue to put abandoned Russian vehicles and equipment to good use. In the video below, a Ukrainian crew tows a captured Russian Msta-B 152mm howitzer with a captured Russian T-80 main battle tank , according to the Ukrainian MoD. It appears that was not the only Russian T-80 tank Ukrainian forces were able to capture in working order during their Kharkiv offensive. More Western-donated vehicles are on their way to Ukraine, including the LAV 6.0 troop carrier recently seen in Germany. The vehicle is part of a $500 million aid package from Canada. Ukraine still has an insatiable appetite for artillery and has made do with any weapons at its disposal, including an apparent museum piece. A Soviet-era M240 240mm mortar, a type that entered service in 1950, was recently seen in Ukrainian service. While the weapon is not known to be in Ukrainian inventories, one was displayed in a Kyiv museum before the war. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda piled on with other Western leaders in denouncing the referendums Russia recently orchestrated in occupied territories of Ukraine. He called the votes – which unrealistically nearly unanimously favor of Russian annexation – as “desperate attempts by Russia to annex Ukrainian territory.” Nevertheless, the Russia-installed leaders of Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk Oblasts were flown to Moscow in the wake of the highly suspect votes. Evidence continues to surface that Russian conscripts called up following President Vladimir Putin’s mobilization decree are shockingly ill-equipped and poorly trained before being shipped to the front. The quality of firearms training for those that are lucky enough to get any is also suspect. The photo below appears to show a Russian shooting skills instructor holding the palm of his right hand over the muzzle of a trainee’s AK pattern rifle. The move is an egregious safety violation even if the weapon is unloaded. Near Lyman, a Russian vehicle was seen with its turret draped in damaged body armor meant to protect humans. The weathered vests seem to have provided little protection to the vehicle and certainly did no good for whomever they were issued to. At worst, Russian military leaders are aware that conscripted soldiers have little chance against a hardened Ukrainian military that already has succeeded against Russia’s professional soldiers. In at least one instance, Russian officers appear to have stated this fact to a group of recruits, calling them “cannon fodder” and “meat” to be sent into combat, as reported by Russian independent media outlet Meduza . The War Zone broke the news today that Russia has closed off Sevastopol harbor, home of its Black Sea Fleet, likely in response to the appearance of Ukrainian “suicide” drone boats and other threats as Ukraine ramps up operations around Crimea. U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante on Wednesday chaired the first meeting of the National Armaments Directors (NADs) from member nations of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) in Brussels, Belgium.  He was joined by defense industry leaders and representatives from 45 countries, the European Union, and NATO, according to a statement from the Defense Department. “The forum enabled frank and open dialogue about defense industrial base challenges and opportunities to increase production of capabilities critical to Ukraine’s long-term defense,” according to DoD spokesperson Jessica Maxwell. “The U.S. delegation outlined the Department’s analytical approach to identifying supply-chain constraints for major components and sub-components and plans to increase production of ground-based long-range fires, air defense systems, air-to-ground munitions, and other capabilities. Nearly 20 international partners briefed similar efforts to strengthen and expand their nations’ industrial base to accelerate production, spurring productive dialogue on areas for multi-national coordination.” We will continue to update this post until we state otherwise.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 18, 2023",China Is Working On Its Own Sixth-Generation Fighter Program: Official,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China is busy developing an answer to the U.S. Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance program, or NGAD , according to Gen. Mark D. Kelly, the head of Air Combat Command (ACC). Gen. Kelly expects that the highly secretive Chinese efforts will yield the same kind of air combat ‘ system of systems ’ that the Air Force is pursuing, including a sixth-generation manned fighter jet . As we have explored in the past, the NGAD program is much more than a sixth-gen manned fighter. It’s also planned to include collaborative drones to work alongside manned aircraft, plus new weapons , sensors, and communications architecture. The U.S. Air Force wants NGAD to be fielded as real capability before 2030 and the Chinese are keeping pace, Kelly says. A notional design for the U.S. Air Force NGAD in a promotional video from Northrop Grumman . Northrop Grumman Kelly recently addressed The War Zone and other members of the media at the Air & Space Forces Association’s Air, Space & Cyber Conference, providing his reflections on future Chinese air combat programs. One of the key takeaways from this is Kelly’s belief that China looks at sixth-generation air power, including future manned fighter aircraft, “greatly the way we see it: an exponential reduction in signature, exponential acceleration of processing power and sensing.” Another key factor is the ability to “iterate” improvements aided by open mission systems. That iterative approach should allow China to “reprogram at the speed of relevance,” Kelly contends. Gen. Mark D. Kelly, Air Combat Command commander, during a Fighter Roadmap presentation at the Air, Space & Cyber Conference in 2021. U.S. Air Force illustration by Tech. Sgt. Joshua R. M. Dewberry Moreover, the ACC boss points to China’s existing experience in the iterative development of interconnected families of fighter jets, chiefly its reworkings of the Soviet-designed Flanker series. “They started with Su-27 , morph into Su-30 , then their own J-16 [and then the] Su-35 ,” Kelly said. A Chinese J-16 fighter jet takes off for a mission during the Sino-Russian Aviadarts exercise in 2021. Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation China became the first export customer for the basic Su-27 in 1992 and by the time it bought the multirole Su-30MKK from Russia in 2000, it had produced Su-27s under license (as the J-11 and J-11A) before it began developing the homegrown J-11B with multirole capabilities, plus Chinese engines and avionics. This, in turn, led to the two-seat J-16 that’s essentially a Chinese version of the advanced Su-30MKK. In the meantime, the carrier-based Su-33 got the same treatment, emerging as the multirole J-15 . Today, the development of successively more advanced versions of the J-15 and J-16 continues, including expansion into the electronic warfare domain . Interestingly, Kelly seemed to suggest a possible reason for China’s surprise purchase of a relatively small batch of 24 Su-35s — arguably Russia’s most advanced current Flanker version. Noting that the Su-35 has “fifth-gen avionics [and] fifth-gen speed” despite its otherwise fourth-generation status, Kelly said that its acquisition will “make it a little easier when they go off the rung” to their next fighter — that is to say, the transition from the fifth to the sixth generation. Since Beijing bought the Su-35 there’s been much speculation as to why it might have placed the order. Some have suggested China wanted a closer look at the Su-35’s thrust-vectoring engines, as well as gain insight into one of Russia’s frontline assets, its weapons, and electronic warfare systems . The Su-35 has been used in dissimilar air combat training but also for operational long-range escort missions over the South China Sea . As such, a small buy of Su-35s makes a lot of sense for China, both in terms of comparing the latest Russian avionics and weapons with its own technologies, but also for developing highly agile aircraft and related tactics. Overall, the experience with the Flanker family, Kelly says, will put China in a good position to develop its equivalent to NGAD. In fact, it could provide such a head start that the United States will have to race to keep ahead. Kelly said he wanted to see the U.S. Air Force “get to sixth-gen air dominance at least a month prior to our competitors.” While the meaning of that statement is not immediately clear, The War Zone has approached ACC for clarification. Nevertheless, these words would seem to reflect a degree of concern about China’s fledgling sixth-generation capabilities that contrast with the recent downplaying of the threat posed by the Chinese fifth-generation J-20 stealth fighter , by Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, head of Pacific Air Forces. Gen. Wilsbach told The War Zone and other members of the media that the J-20 is “not anything to lose a lot of sleep over.” Gen. Ken Wilsbach, Pacific Air Forces commander, in the cockpit of an F-22 at Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal, Australia, September 5, 2022. U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Tristan Biese When it comes to the potential successor to the J-20, however, Gen. Kelly warned that China “are not dummies. They know what they’re doing.” At the same time, it’s notable that China has not stopped the development path of the J-20. As well as a two-seat variant that appeared in public last October, there are persistent rumors of a further advanced ‘J-20B’ that’s expected to feature thrust-vectoring engines, and improved overall performance, among other new features. China has tested a thrust-vectoring version of its WS-10 engine on the J-10 fighter: Apart from paralleling NGAD’s ‘system of systems,’ Kelly otherwise revealed few details of what the United States knows about Chinese sixth-generation air combat programs. However, in one interesting detail, he said that the family of systems that emerges will have an “exponential” improvement in stealth compared with current platforms. Kelly asserted that China is able to master the advanced levels of stealth required for sixth-generation platforms and that this was also part of the iterative approach. A timeline for when we might start to see Chinese sixth-generation assets enter service was also not forthcoming, although Kelly did note that “they’re on plan, absolutely.” A J-20 fifth-generation fighter prior to delivery. @白龙_龙腾四海 & @机外停车RABBIT VIA WEIBO Kelly judges that China “is building a first-rate air force.” Its sixth-generation ambitions are only likely to make it better still. With that in mind, the ACC boss reiterated that “We need to get there before they do. It won’t end well if we don’t.” On the Chinese side, there have been only very few hints about its sixth-generation fighter ambitions. This is in contrast to the next-generation stealth bomber program , which has been touted by state media and the Chinese military, although any details remain a closely guarded secret. The H-20 bomber is just part of a wholesale effort to modernize the air combat capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army. This also includes at least one other stealthy fifth-generation fighter, with carrier compatibility , a new-generation transport and refueling tanker , plus various new rotary-wing designs that are already in service or under test . U.S. intelligence also assess that China is also working on a regional stealth bomber too, which could potentially be a manned component tied to its NGAD-style airpower initiative. It is clear, too, that China is rapidly developing the kinds of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) that could have potential applications within an NGAD-style architecture, as well as hints that it may also be infusing unmanned combat aircraft with advanced autonomous capabilities , in a concept that echoes the U.S. Air Force’s Skyborg artificial intelligence program. The Chinese GJ-11 Sharp Sword stealthy UCAV on parade. China Military The enigmatic Dark Sword is thought to be a high-performance and stealthy UCAV that could be used for teaming with the J-20 and sixth-generation manned fighters. Chinese Internet As for the manned fighter element, here things are much less clear, although there have been some credible rumors. “We know that there is a project which aims for service entry around 2035,” Chinese military aviation expert Andreas Rupprecht told The War Zone . “Interestingly, if they really hold to that service-entry date of 2035, we should see a maiden flight at least by 2026–28,” Rupprecht added. That target of 2035 originates in a 2019 interview with Wang Haifeng, chief designer for the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC). As one of the two preeminent fighter manufacturers in China, CAC is responsible for the single-engine J-10 fighter as well as the stealthy J-20 and is an obvious candidate for a sixth-generation fighter program. Taking that into account, it seems almost certain that China is already engaged in preliminary testing of different manned fighter configurations. This development work may also include demonstrators, both sub-scale and full-size. The mysterious tailless vehicle that appeared in satellite images of a CAC factory airfield in October last year may have been a demonstrator or a mock-up, perhaps related to this effort. The U.S. Air Force, for its part, flew some kind of prototype for the NGAD program in 2020. The diamond-shaped tailless sub-scale demonstrator identified in a satellite image of a CAC factory airfield in October last year. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION “Allegedly, since 2018, CAC and its related 611 Institute have been working on the development of key technologies for the next-generation fighter,” Rupprecht said. Those advanced technologies are expected to include new radar, exotic propulsion systems including variable-cycle engines , and directed-energy weapons. In his 2019 interview, Wang also highlighted the ability to team with drones , the use of artificial intelligence, enhanced stealth, and advanced sensors. All in all, China’s combat aircraft and related technologies are very much in ascendancy now. Alongside myriad other aerospace programs, it will especially interesting to see when China’s next-generation manned fighter and related air combat systems finally break cover.

Commander Paul Tremelling RN (Rtd),"Posted on Jun 23, 2016",The Truth About The Harrier’s Unique ‘VIFF-ing’ Dogfight Maneuver,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Of all the air-to-air combat maneuvers employed by fighter pilots during the jet age, vectoring in forward flight, or VIFF-ing, remains something of an outlier. Practiced exclusively by Harrier jump-jet pilots, like the Sea Harrier FA2s and Harrier GR9s I flew, this is a form of thrust-vector control , or TVC, but is very different from that which is seen on jets like the F-22 . The major difference is that Harrier VIFF is done with four nozzles that all move together, are centrally located on the jet’s fuselage, and can only move in one plane. With a pull of control stick next to the throttle, they can move up to 98.5 degrees deflection, with 81 degrees needed to hover. Although it became something of a legendary trademark of the Harrier, VIFF-ing remains very much misunderstood. Many will even claim that it has no place at all in a dogfight situation, being little more than a unique ‘party trick.’ But the truth is different. Case in point, my experience of dissimilar air combat maneuvering, with my Royal Air Force Harrier GR9 attack jet up against an RAF Typhoon — a true thoroughbred in the air-to-air domain : The Typhoon was up in the deep blue stuff. The driver had just gunned my playmate and was straightening his cravat. I needed to reef the nose up to get a shot off, but the combination of Harrier and the Bernoulli principle decided that this was someone else’s problem and the GR9’s nose was staying well below the threat fighter. I reached for the nozzle lever, yanked it back about 40 degrees and the nose rose perfectly to place the Sidewinder symbology over the Typhoon. Fox 2 . About three triumphant seconds later I was windmilling earthward with no airspeed on the clock or control of any kind. Out of the fight. Good times. Four specially marked RAF Harrier GR9s fly a photo sortie on December 13, 2010, two days before the United Kingdom retired its last Harriers. Jamie Hunter As in this example, VIFF-ing comes into its own on the few occasions where the nozzle can gain an advantage. But it also provides more than a few ways of embarrassing yourself. Many other aircraft with TVC use a multi-directional nozzle mounted at the back of the aircraft and can achieve maneuverability that isn’t dissimilar to witchcraft. Harrier VIFF is more a thing of yesteryear and is probably most relevant in guns combat where it can disrupt an attacker’s tracking or give them a massive ‘angle and closure’ problem — which can be enough to evade destruction. Marines with Marine Attack Squadron 223 (VMA-223) change the engine on an AV-8B Harrier II. In this image, the forward nozzle is deflected fully downward, while the rear nozzle is deflected fully backward for forward flight. U.S. Marine Corps Let’s get one thing straight. Most things in the military have a degree of utility. Most of them have absolutely no utility if used badly or at the wrong time. VIFF is one of those many things. VIFF has, however, and contrary to popular belief, been used in combat. A Sea Harrier pilot of 800 Naval Air Squadron used nozzles to slow his descent while trying to get a Sidewinder lock on an Argentinian Pucara close support aircraft. It didn’t work out — but then again at least it was available in an aircraft that made it to the warzone. A whole heap of technologies, tactics, and even aircraft types don’t get that far. You know who you are. A pair of U.K. Royal Navy Sea Harrier FRS1s off the coast of the Falkland Islands soon after the conflict. Sea Harriers claimed 23 enemy aircraft shot down during the Falklands War; two of their own kind were lost to enemy ground fire. Crown Copyright I have, in exercises — as well as losing a couple of hundred times — simulated successful shots from Sea Harrier FA2 against F-15, from Harrier GR9 against Typhoon, and from F/A-18E against F-22. In all three cases, the poorer air-to-air combatant won. I used VIFF to shoot the Typhoon. Does that mean that Harrier plus VIFF was in any way comparable to the Typhoon in an air-to-air engagement? Of course not. Not by a country mile, well, closer to a light year. However, it probably demonstrates that used correctly, VIFF can extend your envelope and if that little bit of extension improves lethality or survivability — well, you would be crazy not to use it. It also demonstrates that a ‘Hail Mary’ play involving the nozzles is a one-shot deal and things will not go your way in subsequent maneuvers if you don’t make it count! VIFF cannot change the laws of physics (that would be absurd, it relies upon them) but it can make the enemy’s day a little harder and can also create the mother of all aerodynamic catastrophes for the user. It can enhance a Harrier’s performance, but the price you pay for changing thrust direction is energy decrease and instability. Instability is easy to understand — VIFF relies upon taking a sleek(ish) fighter with a tidy vector diagram and moving one of the really important parts. So what was it? A pilot can VIFF by moving the nozzles using the nozzle lever and therefore change the direction of the thrust vector. It provides a nose-up pitch change, in return for energy loss. The Sea Harrier FA2 Aircrew Manual noted that dropping nozzle produced a trim change, but whether that was, down to using thrust to counterweight or a moment being generated between thrust axis and center of gravity (CoG), wasn’t actually explained. The answer is both but the relationship between thrust vector and CofG position varies with nozzle deflection. As early as 1961, though, aerodynamicists were examining whether or not vectored thrust could unload the wing. At about the same time, U.S. Marine Corps pilots were wondering what this natty little lever could achieve and whether or not an unloaded wing could be immediately loaded up again to greater effect. An AV-8A Harrier from Marine Attack Squadron 513 (VMA-513) preparing to land, with its nozzles deflected fully downward. U.S. Marine Corps pilots pioneered the VIFF maneuver. National Archives Just think of an aircraft at the bottom of a loop. The lift vector can be drawn as a great arrow pointing up through the wing (or pilot’s head if you like) towards the center of the circle the aircraft is transcribing in the sky. The size of the arrow has a limit, based on the lift the wing can give at the aircraft’s current speed — and performance is also limited by the aircraft’s maximum g. Lift is opposed by weight, acting straight down. What if you could remove a little bit of that opposing force? Essentially removing weight with a little bit of thrust? Same lift. Less weight. Better pitch. That would be a great idea and would be similar to the effect at the top of the loop where weight and lift are both acting downwards, and higher pitch rates can be achieved. That’s how small-angle VIFF works. Momentarily. What is removing weight or augmenting lift is no longer pushing you along. What you gain in instantaneous pitch you pay for in reducing energy — and the maximum attainable g will reduce as the aircraft decelerates. Now turn that loop on its side and add an enemy fighter. You have a turning fight and pitch is determining the rate and radius of turn. Lift vector placement is describing where you wish the aircraft to go — which we can probably all agree is quite important. Early recommendations for VIFF included 20 degrees of nozzle to be used for sustained turns and 60 degrees to be used for instantaneous turns. Sixty degrees was quite a snatch but definitely got the nose moving. However, VIFF is weird and therefore places abnormal stresses on parts of the aircraft that might not be expecting them. Early and enduring VIFF limits were actually due to the high-pressure ducts leading from the Harrier’s Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine to the control vanes for V/STOL flight control. These were charged when nozzle was deflected and could only withstand so much — originally designed for very low speed they couldn’t withstand being charged at high speeds and powers. Therefore, limits on altitude, airspeed, and engine setting were laid down. From an in-cockpit perspective, it really is — to start with — as simple as ‘take hand off throttle, grasp the nozzle lever, pull it a bit.’ There will be a positive, rapid, nose-up change and the aircraft will get a little more unstable and slow down. None of these effects will be particularly marked for the experienced aviator — but a newcomer to the game would find the experience both violent and disconcerting. The FA2 Aircrew Manual makes repeated recommendations to keep things simple ‘until experience is gained,’ which is probably wise — if somewhat open to interpretation. When can we use small-angle VIFF? Things like nozzle biting. Taking small chunks out to get your nose gradually further around the circle — useful if you and an adversary are in a largely neutral turning fight and you want to chomp away at the problem, particularly if your circle and that of the adversary aren’t 100 percent aligned and a judicious bit of nozzle can bring your nose to bear. This is most effective when combined with any off-boresight capability the weapons system can give you. A Sea Harrier FA2 from 800 Naval Air Squadron in the unit’s decommissioning scheme, just prior to squadron disbandment in March 2004. Jamie Hunter Fighting slow is a race to the wall. First prize is taking a shot in the ass and VIFF can help you get slow, thereby taking second place — where you got to award the prize. VIFF is therefore a good thing. This fight is sometimes called a ‘scissors.’ Both jets attempting to fly as slowly as possible. A bit of nozzle can get your nose up to stop down-range travel at the same time as slowing you down. Win-win. Some advocated flying the resulting scissors with some nozzle down as it charged the reaction control vanes and augmented aerodynamic control with jets in the wings, nose, and tail — meant for control in the hover. I personally found the slow-speed fight hard enough in any case — and as VIFF made the jet more unstable — I didn’t think being more unstable than ‘only just in control’ was a great place to be. Other uses of small-angle VIFF would be when one really doesn’t care about losing energy — throwing in some nozzle to get onto a decent turning parameter if you are fast for any reason — or a really quick transition between instantaneous and sustained turning. Detractors of VIFF point out that the other aircraft can actually win this simplistic competition if it simply decides not to fly slow — to light the afterburner, fly a loop, or just position out of plane. This would put it behind the now very slow Harrier wallowing around wondering what had happened. This is plausible if the bandit can add that much energy quickly enough. Both viewpoints are annoyingly correct in isolation. This brings us to a thorny issue. The school of thought that VIFF only ever caught people out once; and the opposing school of thought that you only need it to work once. I would probably side with the latter view — but the debate is probably more a reflection on military pilots flying millions of peacetime hours for each hour of combat than it is a reflection on whether or not VIFF actually brings an advantage. A Sea Harrier FA2 from 801 Naval Air Squadron, during the final months of this type’s service, in 2006. Jamie Hunter The fun uses of VIFF are the larger angles, right to the point of having the nozzles facing forward. Forward nozzle —98.5 degrees deflection — is a whole load of deceleration, and the Marine Corps originally envisaged it as a means to get slow really quickly to defeat helicopters. The large deflections take some mastering and for me resulted in more than one complete departure from controlled flight — which was like being thrown through space in an asymmetric washing machine. These maneuvers included the ‘braking stop barrel roll’ whereby the nozzles are jammed all the way forward and a decelerating (and I mean decelerating ) barrel roll ensures that all forward motion is killed and anyone behind you goes sailing past. Yes of course a jet can maneuver to avoid being thrown out in front — but again if it only works once, in combat, that will be the time that actually counts. In the cockpit this means a momentary unload at the inverted point to guard against immediate departure and a smooth application of nozzle all the way forward. This leaves the pilot thrown forward, hanging in the straps and the jet begins to waffle a little as airspeed collapses. No time to dawdle though as the one-shot opportunity will only last a heartbeat. You needed to be nozzles aft, weapons ready the second the other jet flies past… which you track by craning your neck over the seat box and accepting a modicum of spit across your face from an oxygen mask that has about as much clue as to which way was up as you do. Radar-equipped AV-8B Harrier IIs from Marine Attack Squadron 223 (VMA-223) configured for close-quarters air combat, with Sidewinder missiles and (on the rear aircraft) an Equalizer 25mm gun pod below the fuselage. Jamie Hunter Eventually, most jets run out of energy, and it is common for a slow-speed fight to essentially ‘fall out’ into a descending, accelerating turning fight. In this situation, with the nozzles fully forward, one can keep a very tight spiral going. If anything, an aileron roll pointing at terra firma — or the sea — with the enemy aircraft accelerating faster and therefore moving ahead and producing a shot opportunity. I used to practice that one by looping and taking all the nozzle in one go from the halfway point. Bullseye nose high to staring at the nadir symbol in one fell swoop, essentially a ‘Bolt Flop,’ named after the Marine Corps officer, but without the acceleration after the nose-down flop. Exciting stuff. Two jets doing this to each other was usually very good fun as it led to a canopy-to-canopy spiral at full power but with the thrust wondering why it was going in the wrong direction. U.K. Royal Navy Sea Harrier pilots learned their trade on the two-seat Harrier T8. Jamie Hunter Is it dangerous? Well, yes to a certain extent. It is possible to make a closing bandit’s ‘angles, speed, closure’ problem so bad that you make it into a ‘closure, collision’ problem instead. For that reason, we didn’t allow peacetime use of last-ditch Braking Stop decelerations which would be used in wartime to counter a fighter closing from behind. There was, in the FA2, no altitude limit for VIFF in the Aircrew Manual but we didn’t do it below 8,000 feet because of how long a recovery from departure could take! The manual contained all the usual advice such as not to VIFF when you were already in pre-departure wing rock and noted that progressive nozzle made the aircraft unstable and hard to control. One nasty accident included VIFF-ing jets that ended up crashing into eastern England . Ready for longer-range air-to-air engagements, this 801 Naval Air Squadron Sea Harrier FA2 carrier (inert) AIM-120 AMRAAMs. Jamie Hunter The summary, however, remains the same. All military aircrew should recognize the need to get the absolute maximum performance out of their aircraft. That’s all VIFF does in some niche circumstances, with some benefits and some gotchas — and it can be one hell of a ride!

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 29, 2022",Fingers Point At Russia In Baltic Undersea Pipeline Attack (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Rumors and speculation continue to swirl around a series of blasts that significantly damaged two major underwater pipelines in the Baltic Sea designed to carry natural gas from Russia to Europe yesterday. The European Union has now joined a growing chorus of government officials, as well as experts and observers, saying the explosions were all but certainly the result of some kind of deliberate attack. A British media report today indicated that officials in that country are increasingly convinced that the Russian government is responsible, possibly using uncrewed underwater vehicles to plant explosives. Readers can get up to speed first on what is already known about these incidents in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting here . The first reports that something was amiss came earlier this week, when at least three separate gas pipeline leaks were detected in the Baltic Sea. Two of these were traced to portions of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which has been in use since 2011. The other was found to be coming from Nord Steam 2, which was finished last year, but has not yet started normal operations. All three leaks are in international waters, but are within areas that Denmark and Sweden claim as part of their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Danish authorities subsequently established a five-mile maritime exclusion zone, as well as a smaller no-fly zone, around the leaks. The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland has confirmed the reported explosions by the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines on the 26th and their locations. https://t.co/UlwjKWpJA4 pic.twitter.com/Y5iZWDU3Mk — Oliver Alexander (@OAlexanderDK) September 27, 2022 It later emerged that seismic monitoring stations in the region had detected a number of apparent explosions in areas where the leaks had occurred, immediately pointing to the possibility of sabotage or some other form of attack. One of these blasts created a force equivalent to a magnitude-2.3 earthquake, according to the Swedish National Seismic Network. “The European Union is deeply concerned about damage to the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that has resulted in leaks in the international waters of the Baltic Sea,” Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s (EU) High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said in a statement today on behalf of the entire economic bloc. “All available information indicates those leaks are the result of a deliberate act. We will support any investigation aimed at getting full clarity on what happened and why, and will take further steps to increase our resilience in energy security.” A number of investigations appear to be underway, including at the national level in specific countries, such as Sweden . The German Navy is supporting at least one of these efforts in an unspecified way. “Any deliberate disruption of European energy infrastructure is utterly unacceptable and will be met with a robust and united response,” Borrell’s statement added, but without describing any specific potential courses of action that the EU might pursue. Damage to Nord Stream 1 & 2 are not a coincidence and affect us all. All available information indicates leaks are the result of a deliberate act. Deliberate disruption of European energy infrastructure is utterly unacceptable and will be met with a robust and united response. https://t.co/p32qR8TzOb — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) September 28, 2022 With the exception of Russia, all of the countries with borders on the Baltic Sea are EU members. Except for Russia, Finland, and Sweden, they are all also NATO members, and the latter two nations are in the process of joining the alliance . At the time of writing, no EU member appears to have officially alleged that any specific actors may have been responsible for these apparent attacks, though officials in a number of countries within the bloc have made statements similar to Borrell’s. The U.S. government has also shied away from attributing responsibility so far, though it has come to similar conclusions. Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said today that the U.S. military is sharing pertinent information with its allies about the “apparent acts of sabotage.” The US is sharing info w European allies regarding the ""apparent acts of sabotageâ€ on the Nord Stream pipelines, @StateDeptSpox says. He notes that â€œan investigation like this, owing to the nature of the investigation underwater for one, could well take time."" per @jmhansler — Kylie Atwood (@kylieatwood) September 28, 2022 Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki did allude to Russian culpability yesterday by drawing a direct connection between the pipeline incidents and the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak also alleged Russia was responsible. ""Gas leak"" from NS-1 is nothing more that a terrorist attack planned by Russia and an act of aggression towards EU. ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º wants to destabilize economic situation in Europe and cause pre-winter panic.

There are entirely unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, which Russian state and non-state actors are amplifying , circulating already that the U.S. government, or other actors working in cooperation with it, were responsible. Spreading misinformation and disinformation, or enabling their spread, are common Russian government tactics to deflect attention from its own malign activities. âš¡ï¸ Russian MFA Spokeswoman Maria #Zakharova : â— Russia intends to convene an official UN Security Council meeting regarding the incidents with the #NordStream & #NordStream2 gas pipelines. pic.twitter.com/bXJB9eeoZJ — MFA Russia ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º (@mfa_russia) September 28, 2022 These insinuations have been based in part on the presence of a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship, the USS Kearsarge , and a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane , among other assets, in Baltic Sea around the time the leaks were reported. The U.S. military routinely operates in the region and has publicly stepped up its presence as part of efforts to bolster NATO’s posture in light of the war in Ukraine. No hard evidence has been put forward to link American forces to the pipeline incidents in any way. (Revision) We noticed a ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ USN P-8A running circles near one of the Nordstream pipeline blasts not long after it occurred.

There is no indication whatsoever that this was anything but a comment on the potential diplomatic pressure the U.S. government would exert on German authorities to at least freeze that specific pipeline project, something that very publicly happened . All this being said, there are indications that Western intelligence agencies are increasingly of the view that the Russian government, or actors acting on its behalf, was responsible for the pipeline leaks. The Times newspaper in the United Kingdom, citing an unnamed U.K. “defense source,” reported today that a “likely scenario” for the attacks involved Russian uncrewed underwater vehicles, deployed from a mothership vessel of some kind on the surface, possibly something as innocuous as a fishing boat. Those undersea drones would then have laid explosive devices along the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. According to The Times story, the explosives could have been planted weeks or even months ago as part of a “premeditated and planned” operation. This detail follows a separate report from the German magazine Der Spiegel yesterday that said the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has passed along warnings to authorities in Berlin about the possibility of future attacks on Nord Steam 1 and 2 this past summer. Experts and observers have also put forward the possibility of combat divers planting explosives. The leaks occurred in areas where the pipelines lie at sufficiently shallow depths for divers to operate. The NS2 pipeline is over 1000km long. A large amount of it in shallow water. Sabotage anywhere along the length of the pipeline would have had the same end result. It was a deliberate choice to do it this close to Danish territorial waters. pic.twitter.com/1RD9a09Y3I — Oliver Alexander (@OAlexanderDK) September 28, 2022 Russia’s military and intelligence agencies certainly have the capacity and expertise to execute such an operation. Russia is known to operate a fleet of highly specialized submarines, including very large mothership types capable of discreetly carrying midget submarines very close to specific target areas, as well as a variety of uncrewed and remotely-operated underwater vehicles . Typically, the large nuclear-powered special mission motherships have not operated in the Baltic. The Russians have a number of equally specialized surface vessels that can conduct various kinds of deep-sea operations, including salvage . Discussions about these assets typically focus on concerns about Russia’s ability to tap or even potentially cut undersea communications cables , but the same capabilities that enable those kinds of activities could easily be employed to plant explosives or otherwise launch destructive attacks on other undersea infrastructure. Regardless, the full scale and scope of the impacts from the apparent attacks on Nord Stream 1 and 2 very much remain to be seen. Western Europe, as a whole, faces an increasingly critical energy situation as winter approaches, something the Russian government sought to exploit as an indirect response to crippling sanctions from the EU and others over its invasion of Ukraine. Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom had already stopped the flow through Nord Stream 1, ostensibly citing maintenance issues , in August. Construction of the initial components of Nord Stream 2 was completed last year, but, as already noted, the final certification of the pipeline was first halted by German authorities after the Kremlin recognized two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent countries. The project was frozen indefinitely after Russia subsequently launched its all invasion of its neighbor. Despite all this, residual gas was present in both pipelines. A report from German outlet Tagesspiegel today said that authorities in that country are concerned that Nord Stream 1 and 2 could effectively be rendered unusable forever as a result of the apparent attacks. If repairs cannot be conducted quickly, saltwater corrosion, among other factors, might leave the pipelines so damaged that fixing them becomes prohibitively expensive. At the same time, European countries have been actively working to decouple themselves from Russian energy resources for months due to the current geopolitical climate. Just yesterday, Danish and Polish authorities inaugurated a new Baltic Sea gas pipeline. ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡° Ahead of the launching ceremony of the #BalticPipe gas pipeline, PM @MorawieckiM met with PM of Denmark Mette Frederiksen to discuss: â¡ï¸security issues in the Baltic Sea region â¡ï¸aid for Ukraine â¡ï¸cooperation in the energy sector and energy security pic.twitter.com/b0L6Unk1HS — Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland (@PremierRP_en) September 27, 2022 The apparent pipeline attacks will very likely prompt increases in various countries’ security postures, as well. Norway, a NATO member that does not have a Baltic Sea coastline, announced today that its military would be increasingly visible around its offshore gas and oil installations in light of both the Nord Stream incidents and separate reports of concerning drone activity . Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said that any attacks on its energy infrastructure would be “handled jointly with our allies.” The warning came after the country's largest oil and gas firm Equinor recently said it had notified authorities of sightings of drones of unknown origin flying near some of its platforms. — Francesco Sassi (@Frank_Stones) September 26, 2022 Norway's southwestern police district said it had started an investigation into sightings of drones offshore and notified authorities dealing with terrorism and external threats. ""The police are taking seriously observations…and are monitoring the situation closely"" — Francesco Sassi (@Frank_Stones) September 26, 2022 There is also simply the matter of the environmental impacts from the leaking gas in the Baltic. More than half of the 778 million cubic meters of natural gas that remains in both Nord Stream pipeline networks at the time of the incidents has leaked out already, according to Danish authorities . Those same officials said that this amount of gas escaping into the atmosphere represents a volume of pollution equivalent to 32 percent of Denmark’s total annual CO2 emissions. What actions EU or NATO members, within their respective organizations or individually, may be prepared to do if formal accusations are leveled against Russia over the Nord Stream incidents is unclear. Similar questions have been raised in the past about what the response might be to a state actor like Russia cutting undersea cables. If you are not willing to intervene then what exists in terms of deterrence? Nothing direct beyond condemnation, accusations, and sanctions, that is if there is even sanctions left to deploy? — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) September 21, 2022 As already mentioned, Russia is already subject to extensive Western economic sanctions, and any more direct response would carry at least some risk of escalation. This all comes at a time when concerns have already been growing over whether or not the Russian government may seek to pursue some kind of escalation, even including the use of nuclear weapons , in response to steady losses to Ukrainian forces . Of course, if Russia is conclusively determined to have been responsible, the situation has already escalated to a significant degree. Update 5:40 PM EST: The Pentagon has issued a press release regarding a phone call today between U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Danish Minister for Defence Morten BÃ¸dskov specifically regarding the Nord Stream pipeline incidents. The full readout of that call , per Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, is as follows: Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III called Danish Minister for Defence Morten BÃ¸dskov today to discuss the recent Nord Stream pipeline explosions near the Danish island of Bornholm.  Secretary Austin offered his full support to Denmark as it begins to investigate the explosions. The United States remains committed to Baltic Sea Security and its longstanding Ally, Denmark. The leaders agreed to continue to work together as this situation develops.

Dan Parsons,"Posted on Sep 22, 2022",Ukraine Situation Report: Untrained Russian Draftees Reach The Front,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian forces are fighting a defensive war against determined Ukrainian forces that continue to make “deliberate movement forward” along the entire frontline from Kherson in the south to Kharkiv in the north , according to a Pentagon spokesman. “The way I would characterize the North and the South is on the Russian side is essentially defensive at this stage,” Air Force Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said on September 27 during a press conference at the Pentagon. “In the Donbas region, the Russians, with elements of the Wagner Group, are attempting to essentially take territory – we’ve seen hundreds of meters in some cases – but nothing that I would consider significant. The Ukrainians have so far done a good job of holding a line there and repulsing those defensive operations.” Video continues to emerge of Ukrainian forces advancing on Russian positions in several sectors of the front line, including the footage below from the Kharkiv region. The clip shows several Russian troops surrendering in a forest encampment made of translucent plastic sheets strung between trees. Ukrainian forces are slowly but surely liberating town after town along their twin axes of advance in the north and south, including Kupyansk, home of one of the country’s largest rail stations. The yellow-and-blue flag of Ukraine was raised outside the station on September 27 by a soldier standing on the Russian tricolor it replaced, as seen in the video below posted to social media by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. Russian troops conscripted through Vladimir Putin’s recent mobilization efforts are arriving on the frontlines with little or no training and few supplies. The draftee in the video below claims he was sent into combat near Kherson with no training at all. Elsewhere, Russian troops complain of being dumped near the fighting with nothing but assault rifles. Cursing their commanders, the Russian recruits in the video below claim they were supplied no food or water before being sent to the front. As Brig. Gen. Ryder suggested last week , pouring hundreds of thousands of untrained, poorly equipped recruits into an active combat zone likely will further stress a Russian war machine that has struggled with discipline, logistics, and maintenance since this war began. Russia still must notionally feed, clothe, transport, and provide arms and communications to these recruits, all things it has struggled to provide its regular military units. Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau questioned the effectiveness of raw Russian recruits against hardened Ukrainian forces, especially given the tactical performance of better-trained regular Russian troops earlier in the war. “It’s not a very promising move from the military point of view,” Rau said on September 27 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, D.C. “I’m not a military analyst, but following common sense, it doesn’t seem a very good solution because if the Ukrainians managed to defeat well-trained and well-equipped Russian soldiers, what’s the chance that those that are worse … are going to prevail? I suppose it’s rather unreasonable to expect a breakthrough as the result of a mobilization.” Russia is wholly unprepared to support its newly mobilized source that at least one unit was promised only uniforms and body armor. In the video below, a Russian officer instructs recruits to source their own medical supplies, including tampons as bandages for gunshot wounds. Reports are proliferating that Russian recruits are being sent to war immediately after being drafted, without training or equipment, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine’s interior minister. The Russian prisoner of war in the video below claims to have been mobilized on September 21 and captured less than a week later in Ukraine. Before we dive into the recent developments in this dynamic conflict, take a moment to catch up on our previous rolling coverage here . The Latest As expected, Russian-allied officials in the occupied regions of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and the self-declared Peoples Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk announced near-total approval for joining Russia among their citizens. In what the U.S. and NATO have called “sham” referendums on Russian annexation of the regions , a laughably implausible 98 percent of the vote was reportedly in favor of joining Russia. International supporters of Ukrainian sovereignty immediately dismissed the results. Israel’s foreign ministry said it supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty and will not recognize the results of the referendums. Putin is primed to announce the annexation of occupied Ukrainian territories during an address scheduled for September 30, according to the Kyiv Independent news service. Annexing these regions, however illegitimate the move may be, could provide an excuse for conscripting soldiers from the occupied populations. That could deal another blow to already seemingly dismal Russian morale in the ranks and support for the war at home, especially in frontier republics where ethnic minorities are being disproportionately conscripted to participate in the war. The Russian military appears to be doing just that in occupied Crimea. Photos of recruits, many confused-looking older men, in formation wearing military uniforms equipped with little more than an AKM assault rifle. Perhaps recognizing that Russia has embarrassingly mismanaged its campaign of conquest, Putin has threatened the use of nuclear weapons over the Ukraine conflict. Brig. Gen. Ryder said the Pentagon takes those threats seriously but does not yet foresee a Russian nuclear strike in the works. “At this stage, we’ve not seen anything that would cause us to adjust our own nuclear posture at this time,” Ryder said. “As we’ve said previously, our focus continues to remain on supporting Ukraine in their fight and working closely with our allies and partners in terms of Russian force posture.” Polish Foreign Minister Rau said that European countries positioned in Russia’s geographic shadow have no choice but to take Putin’s nuclear threats seriously. He said Putin’s potential use of nuclear weapons to avoid defeat stands in stark contrast to the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan to hasten an already determined victory. “If Putin is threatening to use his nuclear tactical nuclear weapons, we have to realize that this event would be a completely different situation, because it would be the use of nuclear weapons by the side which is rather losing rather than winning the war and not at the very end of the war, but in fact in the middle of the war. So it’s a completely new situation. And the fundamental question is, what would this bring for Russia?” “The answer is,” Rau added, “following the emerging consensus of NATO member states, a conventional response in Ukraine.” The situation has devolved to the point that some NATO member states, including Bulgaria, are telling their citizens to leave Russian territory as quickly as possible. Russian officials at the highest level continue to allude to the possibility of nuclear weapons being put to use. Russian Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev said on September 27 that his country has the right to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine “if we or our allies are attacked with this type of weapon or if aggression with the use of conventional weapons threatens the very existence of our state,” according to the Kyiv Independent. Notably, Medvedev includes the use of conventional weapons – with which Ukraine has routed Russia’s invading army in some areas – among his justifications. Medvedev also questioned whether NATO would respond if Russia used nuclear weapons. Contrary to reports yesterday, the U.S.-donated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems , or NASAMS, are not yet in Ukraine. The first is expected to arrive there within the next two months, Brig. Gen. Ryder said. The remaining six NASAMs promised Kyiv will be delivered “in the future,” Ryder said but did not give a timeline. “Those will be longer-term,” he said. “These are the ones produced by industry.” NASAMS firing an AIM-120. Kongsberg Defense Ukraine has sought those systems to protect its cities from Russian missile bombardment, which continued September 27 with an attack on the liberated city of Kharkiv. Five Russian missiles reportedly landed in the city, striking an electrical station, knocking out power, and starting a massive fire. Brig. Gen. Ryder confirmed that Iranian-produced drones are in Russian service in Ukraine, where unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are used for strike and reconnaissance missions. “We do assess that the Russians now are using the Iranian drones. … We do assess that they are now using them in Ukraine,” Ryder said. “In terms of their effectiveness, I don’t want to provide a battle damage assessment here from the podium or get into specific intelligence other than to say again, we’ve seen them employ them. We’ve also seen reports of the Ukrainians shooting down some of these drones, and again, I’m not going to get into specific numbers, but we assess that those are credible. … It’s just indicative of the Russians employing a capability that we know they’ve sought from Iran. And they’re using the way they indicated they would use them, for both kinetic attacks and ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance].” Video has emerged showing Ukrainian surface-to-air missiles taking down one of the Iranian Shahed-136 drones used by Russian forces. Seven months into the conflict, Ukrainian Air Force jets can still fly close-air-support missions over combat zones. The video below shows a pair of Su-24M strike aircraft dropping bombs on Russian positions, apparently destroying a Russian tank. Russia’s troops in the field continue to provide footage of laughably incompetent conduct, including the soldier in the video below firing a rocket-propelled grenade straight into a tree just yards in front of his position. Meanwhile, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas took time to train on the Javelin anti-tank guided missile system. Thousands of the Lockheed Martin-made ATGMS, as they are commonly known, have been provided to Ukraine by the U.S. and were standout weapons in the early days of the war. Russia remains a significant supplier of vehicles and weaponry to opposing Ukrainian forces. One recent acquisition was a Russian Msta-SM2 152mm self-propelled howitzer, captured by Ukrainian troops near Izium in near mint condition. The United States has committed another $457.5 million in civilian security assistance aimed at enhancing the operational capacity of Ukrainian law enforcement and criminal justice agencies, the U.S. State Department announced on September 27. Since mid-December 2021, the United States has committed more than $645 million in assistance that has “provided a tangible, positive impact on our Ukrainian law enforcement and criminal justice partners, including the National Police of Ukraine (NPU) and State Border Guard Service,” the state department said in a statement. The funding will go toward personal protective equipment, medical supplies, and armored vehicles to reduce Ukrainian casualties. “In addition to expanding our direct assistance to Ukrainian law enforcement, a portion of this new assistance will also continue U.S. support for the Ukrainian government’s efforts to document, investigate, and prosecute atrocities perpetrated by Russia’s forces,” the State Department said. Vladyslav Zhaivoronok, a Mariupol defender in the Azov Regiment’s ranks who was captured after the fall of the Azovstal Steel Plant , is in Washington, D.C., visiting with members of Congress. He was released from Russian captivity due to a recent prisoner exchange, rehabilitated, and is now advocating for Ukrainian prisoners of war.

Oliver Parken,"Updated on Jan 11, 2022",Electric Commuter Aircraft ‘Alice’ Has Flown For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Eviation’s sleek ‘Alice’ aircraft, an all-electric plane, flew for the first time today. The aircraft’s first flight marks an important step forward for the Israeli startup, following months of ground testing and delays in getting the plane airborne. More broadly, Alice’s first flight has been hotly anticipated by those within the aviation industry, with Eviation branding it the “world’s first all-electric commuter aircraft.” You can read our previous profile on Alice here. The aircraft’s first flight took place at Grant County International Airport (KMWH) in Moses Lake, Washington, on September 27. Alice was airborne at around 7:10 AM PST, and flew for approximately 9 minutes and 3 seconds at an altitude of around 3,500 feet. Eviation has been working with the aerospace engineering company AeroTEC for some time to deliver the aircraft, with tests being performed at AeroTEC’s Moses Lake facility. In an official statement , Eviation President and CEO, Gregory Davis, said. “Today we embark on the next era of aviation – we have successfully electrified the skies with the unforgettable first flight of Alice. People now know what affordable, clean and sustainable aviation looks and sounds like for the first time in a fixed-wing, all-electric aircraft. This ground-breaking milestone will lead innovation in sustainable air travel, and shape both passenger and cargo travel in the future.” Signs that Eviation was close to Alice’s first flight came several weeks ago, after the aircraft undertook a successful high-speed taxi rotation test at Moses Lake on September 18, 2022, which Eviation advertised in a short video released online. Named after Lewis Carrol’s ‘Alice’ from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, the plane is designed to seat nine passengers and two pilots. After an early iteration was unveiled at the Paris Air Show back in 2019, the since refined airframe features a T-tail, high aspect ratio straight wings with winglets, and unique rear-mounted, front-facing propellers. According to Eviation , the aircraft is designed to fly at a maximum day range of 250 nautical miles, with a maximum cruise speed of 260 knots. An ‘executive’ configuration, with six seats, is also apparently in the works. As The War Zone has previously reported, the all-electric aircraft is powered by high-energy-density batteries that feed two tail-mounted 640-kilowatt Magni650 motors manufactured by MagniX that push its five-bladed propellers. JDLMultimedia Omer Bar-Yohay, Eviation’s previous CEO who remains on the company’s board, told flyingmag.com that the aircraft uses “the same kind of 21700 [Li-ion] battery cells that you can find in a Tesla or in a lot of cars that are out there today. If you look at the spec sheets we get roughly 270 to 260 watt-hours per kilogram at the cell level.” The battery itself “functions as a structural part of the aircraft, meaning the plane cannot fly without the battery there, from a load bearing perspective.” Bar-Yohay also revealed he hopes the plane will obtain FAA-type certification in time to enter service in 2025. The journey to Alice’s first flight has been anything but smooth sailing. Alice’s inaugural flight had been expected to take place in late 2021, but several factors pushed this into 2022, according to the company. These included poor weather conditions, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and leadership changes at the top of Eviation with Bar-Yohay’s departure as CEO. Technological challenges of such an ambitious design are also omnipresent. Back in December 2021, the aircraft underwent engine testing at Arlington Municipal Airport (KAWO), north of Seattle, in anticipation of its first flight, while taxi tests were also performed. By January 2022, Bar-Yohay anticipated that the plane was on track to take to the skies within weeks following the completion of additional ground-based tests. These were not altogether successful. During a taxi test on January 28, 2022, the plane experienced a runway excursion that sent it a few hundred feet off the runway. Lee Human, President and CEO of AeroTEC , told The Seattle Times the following in July, 2022: “We finalized the design work [for Alice] a year ago. There are a lot of new technologies being applied to the aircraft. And yeah, there’s been some serious teething pains in integrating these technologies to make them work.” The aircraft’s potential to revolutionize the aviation industry in the near term is reflected in Eviation’s recent commercial success. Global Crossing Airlines (GlobalX) recently signed a letter of intent (LOI) with Eviation for 50 Alice aircraft , with deliveries provisionally beginning in 2027. The Chair and CEO of GlobalX, Ed Wegel, stated: “Eviation’s Alice aircraft is setting the standard in sustainable aviation, and we plan to offer the aircraft to our cruise line, tour operators, leisure travel providers, and business clients with a need for short-haul charter flights across Florida.” Moreover, back in April 2022, the commuter-giant Cape Air also signed a LOI with Eviation for 75 Alice aircraft , with the aim of advancing “sustainability, growth, and innovation.” You can read more about how Alice could help usher in a new era of battery-powered aviation in our past writeup on the aircraft. But that is still a long way off. Alice has so much to prove, but just the fact that it has flown is a major milestone in aviation history.

Emma Helfrich,"Posted on Mar 2, 2023",This Is What The B-52 Will Look Like With Its New Rolls-Royce Engines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing released a video announcing that the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program has completed wind tunnel testing using a model of the B-52 Stratofortress . The clip provides the best look yet at how the aircraft will appear with its new F130 engines. Rolls-Royce won the long-anticipated re-engining deal, which is supposed to help ensure the bombers can keep flying into the 2050s and probably beyond, last year . In the brief video posted to Boeing’s Twitter account, a 4% scale model of the B-52 could be seen installed inside the company’s transonic wind tunnel where it has been undergoing said testing at a max speed of Mach 0.92. The text that accompanies the tweet explains that the model is similar to those used by engineers in the 1950s and helps collect data for future flight trials. The four engine pods, made up of two nacelles each, will house eight Rolls-Royce F130 engines in total and can be clearly seen in the footage. The F130 engines will be significantly more fuel efficient and maintenance-friendly than the Pratt & Whitney TF33-PW-103 engines they will be replacing, as Mike Seltman, an aerodynamics engineer at Boeing, reminds us in the video. TF33s have been out of production entirely since 1985 and are projected to no longer be supportable past 2030. While the B-52Hs will require newer and bigger nacelles supplied by Spirit AeroSystems to sufficiently house the higher-bypass turbofans, U.S. Air Force documentation on the re-engining states that new nacelles are an anticipated and acceptable redesign area under the program. “The goal of the wind tunnel testing is to gather data and build up our error databases and to reduce our risk to ultimately get to flight tests so we can get the airplane in the air for the customer,” said Seltman in the company’s video. “The new engines are larger, so we have bigger nacelles, which brings us closer to the wing and brings up interesting aspects in terms of controllability, which is why we’re doing the wind tunnel test: to make sure we have all of that covered.” A screenshot from the Boeing video clearly showing the B-52 model’s engine nacelles.

Credit: U.S. Air Force While Pratt & Whitney’s TF33s have certainly helped the B-52 achieve its 68 years of service, they have simply become too expensive to maintain. An Air Force rule requires that the service overhaul each TF33 every 6,000 flight hours, which incurs a cost of $2 million per engine . As of 2019, these factors paired with fuel needs had made it so the B-52 cost $70,000 per hour to fly, cementing the Stratofortress as one of the most expensive aircraft for the Air Force to operate. Therefore, the Air Force kicked off the competition for the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program in 2018, with Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, and General Electric Aviation all in the running . After a three-year-long battle, and almost exactly one year ago to the day, Rolls-Royce was awarded the $500.8 million contract (with the potential to reach $2.6 billion if all of its options are exercised). You can read more about the award and the long and meandering road to finally re-engining the ‘BUFF’ in The War Zone ’s past coverage, here . Rolls-Royce will provide Boeing, who designs and builds the B-52, with “608 commercial engines plus spare engines, associated support equipment, and commercial engineering data, to include sustainment activities, to be used on the B-52H bomber fleet,” according to the Pentagon‘s contracting notice released at the time of the award. Rolls-Royce will build the F130 engines at its facility in Indianapolis and Boeing will be responsible for integration.

Credit: U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Trevor T. McBride Each of the F130s to be built under the contract will account for a one-for-one replacement of the eight TF33 engines presently aboard each of the Air Force’s 76 B-52Hs, although spares will likely be procured as well. Other than Rolls-Royce’s claims of 30% greater fuel efficiency, increased range, better field performance, enhanced reliability, and reduced tanker aircraft requirements, however, specific performance metrics for the F130 as it will relate to the B-52H have yet to be divulged. But Air Force Magazine did note in March that the new engine will not impact the aircraft’s speed in a negative manner. Rolls-Royce’s winning F130s are actually military variants of its BR700 engines that currently equip not only the Gulfstream GV/G550/G650 business jet but also the Air Force’s C-37 VIP transport variant of the GV/G550 and E-11 Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) , among other aircraft. Rolls-Royce claims that once installed, the F130 will be able to stay ‘on-wing’ throughout the planned duration of the B-52H’s lifetime, which of course doesn’t pertain to any replacements that would be required or for regular preventative maintenance.

Credit: U.S. Air Force photo by William R. Lewis Before the B-52’s Commercial Engine Replacement Program was formally announced, there had been previous proposals over decades to re-engine the B-52 that included commercially derived high-bypass turbofan engine options. Although, the proposals had been passed over in part because of complications with integrating the new larger engines with the B-52’s existing wing design. For moving from eight to four engines, this would have included the need to deal with issues relating to how low the engines would be to the ground and major asymmetric thrust issues for engine-out situations, as well as the need for relocated placement on the wings and new pylons to mount the engines at those locations.

(Boeing Image) Boeing itself has also been pushing for a re-engining for years now, citing the potential for a replacement to save the billions of dollars that would otherwise be spent on sustainment and fuel. This manifested itself in various ‘creative’ procurement and financing schemes where the engines would ‘pay for themselves’ via savings over long periods of time.

One of the most prominent of which is projected to be the new AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar intended to bolster the bomber’s situational awareness and targeting capacity, but it could also be used for electronic attacks and long-range communications. This particular AESA is also used on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , an entirely different aircraft altogether, which means some modifications will be needed to fit it properly but also so that its array can be scaled up to take full advantage of the BUFF’s big radome. The Aviationist has reported that the fielding schedule for the APG-79 will overlap with that of the engine replacement program, with the radar’s flight testing aboard the B-52H slated to begin in 2025, and initial operational capability expected in 2027. The article goes on to explain how this could mean that the B-52H will gain two new and separate designations throughout this process, B-52J or B-52K, as bombers modified with only the new radars take flight ahead of getting their new engines and vice versa.

Credit: Rolls Royce North America As of March 2022, two test F130 engines had been built and will be evaluated at Rolls-Royce’s outdoor jet engine test facility at NASA’s John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. By the end of 2025, the Air Force expects that the first two B-52Hs will be modified and delivered with their new F130 engines to then undergo ground and flight testing. The first eight re-engined bombers will join a B-52 test force at Edwards Air Force Base, California meant to assess all of the new capabilities that the next-generation B-52s will offer. The Air Force is hoping to complete its integration processes and deliver the first set of modified and operational B-52 aircraft by the end of 2028, and the entire fleet is projected to be re-engined by 2035. Needless to say, the B-52 will be undergoing quite an evolution over the next few years, one that could potentially keep the bomber flying for an entire century.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 29, 2022",Sabotage Suspected In Undersea Gas Pipeline Explosions In The Baltic,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Various European leaders are suggesting that sabotage is the most likely reason for mysterious gas leaks that have struck two undersea pipelines in the Baltic amid confirmation of several explosions in the area. The leaks affect the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, used to carry gas from Russia to Europe and which have been at the center of an ‘energy war’ between Moscow and the West since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Of the three leaks identified, two affect the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that has two parallel branches that run around 750 miles between a location near St. Petersburg to northeast Germany. Nord Stream 1 has been closed down for maintenance since August and is not currently transporting gas. One other leak affects the ‘sister’ pipeline, Nord Stream 2, construction of which was suspended by the time Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. While neither of the pipelines are currently operational, they both still contain gas, making any kind of significant leak hazardous, including to shipping. The first reports of a “rapid gas pressure drop” on Nord Stream 2 came yesterday afternoon, from the pipeline operator, Nord Stream AG, of which the majority shareholder is Russia’s state-owned Gazprom giant. That leak is located southeast of the island of Bornholm, which has been a flashpoint of East-West tensions in the Baltic. In response to the incident, Danish authorities warned ships to avoid a five-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the area. A small no-fly zone was also established, although a Royal Danish Air Force F-16 fighter jet and an EH101 Merlin helicopter, at least, have been active in the area to monitor the leak. One of the gas leaks photographed from a Danish F-16 fighter jet. Danish Armed Forces Hours later, the Swedish Maritime Authority issued a warning over the two leaks on Nord Stream 1, which have also been located in an area close to Bornholm. Both those leaks are located northeast of the island, one in the Danish economic zone, and one in the Swedish. The Danish Armed Forces have stated that the largest of the three gas leaks has led to a surface disturbance measuring over 0.6 miles in diameter. As well as using aircraft to monitor the leaks, the Danish Armed Forces have sent the multi-mission frigate Absalon and the environmental protection vessel Gunnar Thorson to the area. The Danish frigate HDMS Absalon (L16) transits the Baltic Sea during Exercise BALTOPS 2017. U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist America A. Henry/ Released Nord Stream AG said that the pipelines had sustained “unprecedented” damage in the course of the same day. Today, the Swedish national broadcaster SVT reported that Swedish seismologists had registered explosions near the Nord Stream pipelines in the last 36 hours. “SVT can reveal that measuring stations in both Sweden and Denmark registered strong underwater explosions in the same area as the gas leaks on Monday,” SVT reported. According to Björn Lund, a lecturer in seismology at the Swedish National Seismic Network, the first explosion was recorded at 2:03 AM on Monday night and the second at 7:04 PM on Monday evening. “You can clearly see how the waves bounce from the bottom to the surface,” Lund told SVT. “There is no doubt that it was a blast.” Different European countries in the region are now investigating the cause of the three leaks, with the Danish energy authority stating that they could last for several days, and even up to a week. Nord Stream AG said it was impossible to determine how long repairs could take. There’s now speculation at an official level that the damage could have been the result of sabotage. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said it is hard to imagine that multiple leaks could be a coincidence, although cautioned that it was too early to come to a definitive conclusion. “We are talking about three leaks with some distance between them, and that’s why it is hard to imagine that it is a coincidence,” she said. In Germany, there are unconfirmed reports that authorities are not ruling out some kind of attack on the pipelines. The Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, meanwhile, was more forthcoming, however, stating that the leaks were caused by sabotage and apparently pointing a finger at Russia. “Today we faced an act of sabotage, we don’t know all the details of what happened, but we see clearly that it’s an act of sabotage, related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine,” Morawiecki said. Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, described the pipeline leaks as a “terrorist attack planned by Russia”. From Russia, too, there have been suggestions from officials that there could have been a deliberate attack, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying he was “extremely concerned” about the incident. Europe’s reliance on Russian-supplied gas has been one of the key issues in the background of the war in Ukraine and the continued deterioration of East-West relations. Previously, the European Union has accused Moscow of using its gas supply as a tool for blackmail. Moscow denies such accusations and instead blames sanctions imposed by the West for poor maintenance standards of its gas infrastructure. However, it’s notable that the latest damage to the two Baltic pipelines won’t have an effect on Europe’s gas supplies, at least for the time being, with neither of the pipelines having been operational of late. Bearing all this in mind, it’s not altogether surprising that some observers are already looking at Russia’s capabilities, at least, for prosecuting this kind of attack on undersea pipelines. In the past, we’ve looked at how the Russian Navy can use a variety of means to conduct covert operations on the seabed. Normally, it’s been assumed that these special mission submarines, deep-sea submersibles, and unmanned underwater vehicles are charged with investigating and disrupting undersea cables. As well as cutting and tapping communications cables, however, such craft could also be used to interfere with gas pipelines, for instance. Most prominent among these exotic craft is likely the Project 09852 Belgorod , a large mothership submarine that is suitable for transporting other smaller submarines, like the nuclear-powered midget submarine Losharik , which it can bring covertly to and from a mission area. However, the Belgorod is currently thought to be operating in the White Sea and the Baltic Sea is not where these large submarines operate. Moreover, it’s also highly likely that pipelines could be covertly sabotaged even without recourse to using high-tech submarines and other underwater vehicles. At least one of the leaks is thought to be in water shallow enough for divers to operate and transporting explosive charges would certainly be feasible. However, divers or unmanned underwater vehicles would at least require some kind of support vessel, although this wouldn’t have to be operating in the vicinity. Whether by coincidence or otherwise, Norway’s Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) warned oil companies yesterday to be on the alert after it reported that unidentified drones were seen flying near Norwegian offshore oil and gas platforms. The timing of the pipeline incident is also noteworthy, and not only due to concerns in Europe about the cost of energy prices since Russia invaded Ukraine and the resultant effect on Western economies. As part of the response to this energy crisis, the European Union has been looking at ways of reducing its reliance on Russian gas. The plan includes a new pipeline, the Baltic Pipe, that will carry gas from Norway to Poland. Ahead of the opening of this pipeline today, Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki met with his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, to “discuss security issues in the Baltic region, aid for Ukraine [and] cooperation in the energy sector and energy security.” Meanwhile, the political reality makes it look increasingly unlikely that the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines will be back in action any time soon, regardless of how long it might take to repair them. While there is no evidence that Russia was behind the pipeline leaks, it does serve as a reminder of the critical role played by Russian energy supplies in relations between East and West. As long as tensions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine continue, the issue of Europe’s gas supply is likely to be prominent. Whatever was responsible for breaching Nord Stream 1 and 2, the incident sends a clear message about the vulnerability of such infrastructure and, in turn, the vulnerability of Europe’s energy supply. It seems highly probable that other energy infrastructure in Europe will now also be placed on high alert. Update, 12:00 PM PST: Further details are emerging on the extent of the damage to the two gas pipelines. “This is not a small crack. It’s a really big hole,” the Danish Energy Agency stated, in regard to the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Planet Labs has also provided satellite imagery captured yesterday showing the moment of one of the explosions that affected the pipelines. The location of this blast was approximately 13 nautical miles southeast of Bornholm Island. PHOTO © 2022 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2022 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Meanwhile, the Danish Armed Forces have released more information on the effects of the leaks on the surface of the water. While the largest disturbance has a diameter of over one kilometer (or 0.6 miles), the smallest covers around 200 meters (650 feet). The Danish Minister of Defense Morten Bodskov will travel to Brussels tomorrow to meet with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg to talk about the gas leaks and their wider implications, which are increasingly being seen in the light of Russian military activity elsewhere on the continent. Washington has now also raised the possibility of an attack on the pipelines. “There are initial reports indicating that this may be the result of an attack or some kind of sabotage, but these are initial reports and we haven’t confirmed that yet,” said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a press conference today. In another interesting development, the German magazine Der Spiegel is reporting that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) warned Germany about possible attacks on gas pipelines in the Baltic earlier this summer. Citing unnamed sources, the same publication added that the German government also considers the leaks were the result of a targeted attack, although it is yet to make an official statement to this effect.

Howard Altman,"Posted on Sep 13, 2022",Ukraine Situation Report: Kyiv Continues To Rack Up Small Gains,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Russia continues to struggle with widespread negative reactions to President Vladimir Putin’s mobilization of hundreds of thousands of Russians to fight in Ukraine, the war, now 215 days old, rages on. Though not advancing nearly as quickly as it had during the beginning of its Kharkiv counteroffensive earlier this month, Ukrainian troops are still making some gains. Much of the fiercest fighting is in the Donbas and centers on the towns of Lyman and Bakmut, The New York Times reports. “Ukraine is pushing hard to reclaim Lyman, a railway juncture that serves as an important supply hub on the western edge of the Donbas. Russian forces control the city, but Ukraine is hoping to use it as a gateway to push farther east and maintain its momentum,” The New York Times reports . “Bakhmut is an entry point to part of the region still held by Ukrainian forces. Capturing it would also give Russia a win after being routed in humiliating fashion in the north. The Russians have been shelling Bakhmut incessantly for the past three months.” The Institute for the Study of War , a Washington D.C.-based think tank, said it identified “three small changes in control of terrain” over the weekend. Fighting continues in the east and in the south. Ukrainian forces likely liberated the town of Shevchenko in Donetsk Oblast, likely control Maliivka in Kharkiv Oblast, and are contesting Russian positions around Karpivka, Nove, Ridkodub, and Novoserhiivka in Donetsk Oblast, according to ISW, which said that Russian forces claim to have recaptured Karpivka and Nove on Sept. 25. But the Russians continue to hit back, both Ukrainian and Russian officials say. In its latest assessment, the Ukrainian General Staff said that Russian forces are focusing their efforts “on holding the captured territories” as well as trying to fully occupy Donestk Oblast and disrupting gains made by Ukrainian forces. “During the day, Ukrainian soldiers repelled enemy attacks in the areas of Spirne, Soledar, Pidhorodne, Bakhmut, Mayorsk, Kamianka, Pobyeda and Pavlivka settlements,” according to the Ukrainian General Staff assessment, posted on its Facebook page. The Ukrainian General Staff said that 12 settlements were damaged by Russian fires, including Zaporizhzhya, Marhanets, Musiivka, Nikopol, Potemkine, Osokorivka, Mykolayiv and Ochakiv. “There remains the threat of air and missile strikes on the entire territory of Ukraine,” according to the Ukrainian General Staff, which said that on Monday, the Russians launched two missile and four air strikes, carried out more than seven attacks with anti-aircraft missiles, and used strike UAVs in the area of ​​Bilenke settlement of Odesa Oblast. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) claimed a number of artillery and aviation attacks on Ukrainian forces, but no ground gains.

(Photo by Yasuyoshi CHIBA / AFP) (Photo by YASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP via Getty Images) Russian artillery struck Ukrainian positions near Senkovo and Chervony Oskol in the Kharkiv region, the MOD said in its latest assessment. In addition, it said Russian Aerospace Forces struck provisional bases of the International Legion of fighters – who have flocked from around the world to assist Ukraine – as well as Ukrainian troops near Svyatogorsk in the Donetsk Oblast. The Russian MOD also claimed missile attacks on Ukrainian positions near Chasov Yar in Donetsk Oblast, an attack near Ochakov in the Mykolaiv region and aviation, missile, and artillery attacks on Ukrainian positions near Kupiansk in the Kharkiv Oblast as well as in locations in Donetsk Oblast and near Zaporizhzhya and Kherson. Before heading into the latest updates from Ukraine, The War Zone readers can get caught up on our previous rolling coverage here . The Latest Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the first tranche of the long-awaited National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS air defense systems have arrived in Ukraine. In August, the U.S. pledged an additional six NASAMS on top of the two previously promised. You can read more about that in our coverage here . Some observers, however, wonder if that is enough as NASAMS provides medium-range, localized coverage that is best suited for critical target areas and cities, not broad coverage over long distances. Regardless, even getting the batteries already promised will take time. And while grateful for the NASAMS, Zelensky told CBS News reporter Margaret Brennan that he would still like to see Ukraine provided with more tanks from the U.S. and its European allies like Germany. They may not be tanks, but 50 M113 armored personnel carriers donated by Lituania arrived in Ukraine a few days ago, that nation’s Ministry of Defense said. Belgium has promised Ukraine M2HB heavy machine guns, ammunition, and other military equipment. Added all up, the equipment is valued at about $11.5 million. And on top of donations from friendly countries, Ukraine continues to be the beneficiary of Russian battlefield largesse. The Ukraine Weapons Tracker (@UAWeapons) reported two more infantry fighting vehicles captured by Ukraine, a BMP-3 and a BMP-2 in the Kharkiv Oblast. Ukraine Weapons Tracker also reported that a Russian Army MT-LB with a towed ZU-23-2 23mm autocannon was also captured by Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv Oblast. And to go with all the captured weapons, Ukraine has managed to amass a cache of captured ammunition as well. Boxes and boxes of ammunition, which Ukrainian troops have promised to return to sender. And speaking of ammunition, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense says its troops are being careful about how they are using the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System or GMLRS munitions provided by the U.S. to be used with the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS . Ukrainians are also being cautious with the donated M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which use the same ammo as the HIMARS, as you can see in the video below of the tracked MLRS doing the “shoot-and-scoot” after launching its munitions in an effort to avoid Russian counter-battery fire. There was also the first confirmed firing of a BGM-71 TOW anti-tank guided missile by Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv-Lugansk area. For the first time, the architect of much of Ukraine’s military success has given an interview. Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s top military officer, talked to Time magazine about how he was surprised that he was picked for the job and, after studying Russian military history and doctrine, how he was surprised by his enemy’s failures. Zaluzhny, who helped reform Ukraine’s military by weaning it away from its former rigid Sovietesque doctrine, was one of the earliest and loudest voices sounding the alarm of a pending Russian all-out invasion. Putin’s mobilization, ordered in the wake of Ukraine’s stunning Kharkiv blitz, continues to rankle Russians and cause consternation abroad. Throngs of people who were not within the guidelines Putin laid out for ‘partial mobilization’ are being sent to fight. This has infuriated even the most hawkish voices in Russian media and seems to have allowed the realities of Russia’s war of choice to seep into even the most well-cencored Russian programming. The uncanny ability of the usual suspects to lambast the execution of mobilization and recognize the horrible reality of the conflict, while also praising the man who made it happen and continues to double down on it, is remarkable. Satellite images captured by Maxar Technologies show long lines of cars heading from Russia toward Georgia, attempting to cross the border at the Lars checkpoint. As of Sunday, videos showed several-mile-long line of cars attempting to head from Russia toward Georgia. Russia, however, appears to be cracking down on this mass exodus, sending troops to the border to set up checkpoints to stop the outflow of military-aged men. Meanwhile, in the Russian Republic of Dagestan, which is on Georgia’s eastern border, locals continue to be outraged by the mobilization. Video has emerged on Twitter of what’s claimed to be parents of mobilized children blocking the main road to a regional capital. Women in Dagestan told police that they are opposed to the mobilization because Russia attacked and now occupies portions of Ukraine. Muslims in Dagestan, furious that they are being singled out during this effort to rebuild the Russian military, are also expressing disgust with Putin’s mobilization. The outrage was even more extreme in the Siberian region of Irkutsk, where Guardian reporter Andrew Roth said a Russian man shot and killed the military commandant in the draft center of the city of Úst-Ilimsk. Russian mobilization evaders, however, seem to have no problem getting into Finland, with some 17,000 Russians entering that country, a jump of 80% from the previous weekend. Most of those people seem to be in transit to other countries, according to the Chief of the Finnish Border Guard. That still leaves thousands of people either seeking asylum or just entering illegally, said Matti Pitkäniitty head of internal affairs for the Finnish Border Guard. Despite the protests, shooting and mass exodus, Moscow has yet to make a decision on closing the borders or introducing martial law, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. How much of a difference all these additional troops will make remains doubtful, at least according to Kyiv. The Ukrainian General Staff says the conscripted troops are heading directly to the frontline with no training While a lot of people are racing to get out of Russia, one well-known individual was just granted Russian citizenship. Putin on Monday granted former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who first arrived in Russia in 2013 after leaking secret files that revealed a vast web of domestic and international surveillance by the U.S. government. The Kremlin subsequently granted him asylum, even as the U.S. pursued espionage charges. And in another sign of the former Soviet Union’s declining influence over its former republics, Kazakhstan said it would not recognize the upcoming referendums in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhya on annexation to Russia, a move widely condemned by Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies. The rush of bad news may have gotten to one Russian soldier, who was seen in this video below approaching Ukrainian troops while carrying a Russian flag. It probably didn’t end well for him. Finally, Iranian-built suicide drones continue to be a growing problem for Ukraine as they can strike virtually anywhere and are hard to spot and shoot down. Another wave of the drones descended on various targets on Saturday evening. Contact the author: howard@thewarzone.com Howard Altman Senior Staff Writer"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 16, 2023",Flying Saucer Appears On U.S. Aviation Intelligence Office Logo (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new official logo for a U.S. Intelligence Community office focused on aerial threats and related security issues, particularly in the skies over the United States, is turning heads for its inclusion of a depiction of a flying saucer. This comes at a time of reinvigorated interest within the U.S. government, as well as the public at large , in unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, which are currently now referred to officially as unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP . Over the past year or so, the U.S. military, in particular, has been increasingly sparring with members of Congress about how best to respond to the potentially very real threats that UAP present. The logo in question is the official seal for the National Intelligence Manager-Aviation (NIM-A), who resides, along with their staff, within the Office of the National Director of Intelligence (ODNI). U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Daniel L. Simpson is the current NIM-A, and is also the Executive Director for the National Air Intelligence Integration Office (NAI2O) and Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). The logo appears on an official website for both NIM-A and NAI2O, the latter entity also operating under the auspices of ODNI. A close-up of the NIM-A logo. ODNI/DOD The complete logo has four other air vehicle silhouettes, each in a different color – a dark gray drone, a blue wedge-shaped vehicle, a red Russian Su-57 advanced combat jet , a light gray airliner-sized aircraft. The drone silhouette appears to represent a twin-boom, pusher-propeller design. Multiple types of uncrewed aircraft in this general configuration are already in use by armed forces around the world today, including in China and Iran , and have also notably served as the basis for ‘kamikaze’ drones that the Ukrainian military has employed against its Russian opponents. Each one has a trailing line behind it in the same color, with the blue one, which is all but certainly meant to reflect emerging hypersonic threat, showing a lateral shift in its flight path. Wedge shapes are among those commonly used in the design of unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicles . However, it’s not clear if the specific silhouettes are meant to reflect anything in particular beyond the general categories of threats that NIM-A focuses on – which would also appear to include UAPs. At least one of the air vehicle silhouettes, the Su-57 one, appears to have come from an Adobe clip art gallery. All of this is superimposed on top of a basic map showing much of North America and Central America, as well as parts of South America. The four air vehicles are depicted moving in a northwestern direction across the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, and then over North America. The flying saucer, which has no corresponding line indicating movement, sits by itself in the Eastern Pacific to the southwest of the Central American isthmus. An outer ring features the phrases “OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE” and “NIM – AVIATION” in gold and white lettering, respectively, as well as a pair of gold stars. In addition, by all indications, the seal is new – the filenames of two versions currently on the NIM-A/NAI2O site are “FINAL_NIM-AVIATION_SEAL%20(2).png” and “web_banner_newseal.png” – but it’s not clear how new. An older version of the site from June available through the Internet Archive shows the logo for the separate NAI2O rather than any NIM-A one. The National Air Intelligence Integration Office (NAI2O) logo. ODNI/DOD In addition, for an unexplained reason, between September 25 and 26, a trio of logos on the main website was changed. On the 25th, the seals for ODNI, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for ISR and Cyber (also known A2/A6), and NIM-A were present . The NIM-A logo was then swapped out for the NAI2O one. At the time of writing, there do not appear to be any readily available details about the NIM-A seal or the potential symbolism of any specific element therein. It is, of course, important to note that this would not be the first time, by any stretch, that an official U.S. government/U.S. military seal, unit insignia, or other logo has featured some kind of curious motif that has prompted discussions about its meaning , only for it to later turn out to be an in-joke or something similarly innocuous . This is nothing to say of the absolute mountain of semi-official logos on U.S. military morale patches and challenge coins with UFO and alien motifs , many of which are tied to top-secret projects . The War Zone has reached out to ODNI for more information. Though the logo, and the inclusion of the flying saucer, in particular, have prompted varying degrees of speculation already , on a core level, the graphical choices are both unsurprising and entirely relevant to NIM-A, as well as NAI2O. Formally established in 2015, NAI2O has its roots in recommendations from the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States’ report on the infamous 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York City and the Pentagon. The position of NIM-A, a central manager for such issues, was subsequently established. “NIM-A + NAI2O leads intelligence community efforts to identify, analyze, and integrate intelligence on threats and vulnerabilities in the Air Domain,” a mission statement on the current version of the shared website for these two entities reads. “We advocate for intelligence priorites and opportunities to strengthen the safety and security of the Air Domain.” The mission statement graphic from the NIM-A/NAI2O website. ODNI/DOD “Our team works diligently to keep partners and stakeholders informed on key air domain intelligence efforts,” a message attributed to Maj. Gen. Simpson on the site’s landing page adds. “We developed this site as a resource hub featuring background on NIM-Aviation and up-to-date informative unclassified intelligence and products.” “We particularly welcome all existing and future partners whose collaborations continue to strengthen our global air domain,” it continues. “As our team continues to grow we encourage you all to visit our site frequently to learn more about our role in integrating intelligence to safeguard the global air community.” The current version of the NIM-A/NAI2O site does not appear to specifically mention UAP, but it does talk specifically about the other kinds of aviation threats – hostile uncrewed aircraft , hypersonic weapons and other traditional military threats , and hijacking and other forms of aviation-related terrorism – depicted in the NIM-A seal, among others. These are all very real potential threats to U.S. interests, including within the United States itself, which could be employed by a variety of state and non-state actors. The dangers posed by small uncrewed aircraft, including weaponized commercial types , to targets on and off the battlefield is something that is a particular area of concern. The War Zone has highlighted these threats and how they continue to evolve and expand on numerous occasions , as well as the potential for uncrewed systems to be the explanation for at least a significant number of reported UAP sightings. It’s also no secret that NIM-A, together with the now-defunct U.S. Navy-led UAP Task Force (UAPTF), was responsible for the production of the much-anticipated unclassified government report on UAP activity , which was released in June 2021. The report raised more questions than it answered, as you can find out about more in The War Zone ‘s in-depth analysis of its contents here . Many members of Congress who have become focused on the issue of UAP have made clear that their concerns stem from the very real potential national security threats unidentified craft might represent, rather than fears of something like an alien invasion . U.S. military officials have already determined that a number of high-profile incidents initially described as UAP sightings involving American warships off the coast of Southern California in recent years were actually instances of harassment by drones that might be tied to a hostile foreign power. The War Zone has reported extensively on these incidents based on information obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Of course, the inclusion of the saucer in the NIM-A logo, which would strongly appear to be a tongue-in-cheek reference to NIM-A/NAI2O’s work on the UAP issue as part of their larger missions, does raise the question of whether it feeds into an unuseful stigma that could hamper recording of possible significant incidents. The War Zone has in the past discussed how UFO/UAP stigma might discourage individuals within the U.S. Intelligence Community and U.S. military from making potentially important reports. Multiple pieces of UAP-related legislation now making their way through Congress that specifically include provisions that would create added protections against retaliation for individuals who share information with relevant US government entities. Congress and the Department of Defense are also sparring over the basic organizational structure to handle UAP matters. Late last year, the Pentagon created what it called the Airborne Object Identification and Management Group (AOIMSG), as well as the Airborne Object Identification and Management Executive Council (AOIMEXEC). Earlier this year, AOIMSG was renamed the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), reflecting a broadening of its responsibilities. Some legislators are worried these organizations are still not up to the task and are looking to compel the Pentagon, by law, to reorganize its efforts . All told, it remains to be seen what the official reasoning behind including the flying saucer in the NIM-A seal was, but ODNI certainly has very real responsibilities with regards to reported UAP incidents, many of which themselves may well reflect very down-to-Earth threats. We will be sure to let readers know what we ultimately hear back from ODNI. Update 9:55 PM EST: Cyberscoop has now reported that an ODNI spokesperson told them in a statement that someone “erroneously posted an unofficial and incorrect logo” on the NIM-A/NAI2O website. The NIM-A seal with the flying saucer has now been removed from the site and replaced with the NAI2O logo. It is unclear whether this means the actual NIM-A seal is completely different from the one that had been online earlier or if only one or more specific aspects, such as the flying saucer, were not part of the official design. The War Zone is still working to follow up directly with ODNI. Update 10:25 PM EST: The War Zone has now received a statement directly from ODNI, which is as follows: “NIM Aviation erroneously posted an unofficial and incorrect logo.” Contact the author: joe @robthedrive Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Christopher P. Cavas,"Updated on Mar 25, 2022",Navy About To Get World’s Largest Unmanned Warship But Has No Plans To Use It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Military Sealift Command (MSC) is set to receive its newest ship, the thirteenth in a series of high-speed EPF expeditionary transports providing logistics services around the globe. But Number 13 is special – not only is it the first EPF fitted with autonomous navigation and operating systems, but it is possibly the world’s largest ship capable of unmanned operation. Yet as of now, neither the Navy nor MSC has any plans to use the unmanned capability when the USNS Apalachicola (T-EPF 13) enters the fleet. Rather, MSC intends to send the vessel to the western Pacific to serve as a logistics ship with the U.S. Seventh Fleet. It seems an odd choice, given the strong emphasis Navy leaders place on the importance of developing a fleet of up to 150 unmanned ships by the mid-2030s. While several medium-sized unmanned surface vessels are already in service or under contract , the size of the EPF puts it squarely into the large USV category, a type that could well be fitted with offensive missile systems . The Apalachicola was launched last November by Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama. Since June 2022, the ship has run a series of autonomous trials of increasing complexity and distance. One conducted in late July into early August ranged as far as the southern tip of Florida and the Miami coast, high-traffic areas that would challenge the vessel’s autonomous navigation systems. APALACHICOLA has carried out a series of sea trials testing its autonomous features. Here is the ship early on the morning of August 5, 2022, just returned from a wide-ranging trial that ranged as far as the Florida Atlantic coast. (Chris Cavas) The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is touting the ship’s accomplishments. “In transit from Mobile, Alabama, to Miami, Florida, Apalachicola ’s autonomous system completed a stress test in high-traffic coastal areas by taking appropriate ship handling actions while operating around other ships, boats, sailboats, and craft,” NAVSEA said in a Sept. 9 press release . “Overall, the ship was in autonomous mode for approximately 85 percent of the multiple day at-sea period.” Tim Roberts, NAVSEA’s program manager for Strategic and Theater Sealift, noted the value of the autonomous system. “The ability to expand unmanned concepts into the existing fleet was validated by these trials,” Roberts said in the press release. “The capabilities integrated onto EPF 13 set the groundwork for future autonomous operations.” Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama – designers and builders of the Spearhead class – has long been working on a wide range of unmanned surface vessel designs, including unmanned variants of the EPF. The Navy did not request funding for the unmanned fast transport, but Congress was significantly impressed by the proposal to add about $50 million in the fiscal 2021 defense appropriations act specifically to modify EPF 13. Austal USA has been pursuing a wide range of unmanned surface vessel designs, including this concept from 2019 showing a large unmanned surface vessel based on the Expeditionary Fast Transport design and fitted with a vertical launch system. (Austal USA) The autonomous portion of the ship was produced under a $44 million contract awarded to Austal USA in June 2021. In a press release at the time, Austal USA said “the work will include installation of a perception and autonomy control suite, as well as several automation enhancements to the machinery plant improving hull, mechanical, and electrical (HM&E) reliability while reducing the amount of personnel required for operations and maintenance at sea.” Austal noted that the existing EPF machinery plant is already highly automated to allow for a smaller crew. Overall, Austal said, “the EPF provides immediate capability to deploy a large autonomous weapons and logistics platform.” The EPF Autonomous Prototype project, according to Austal, aimed to produce a ship that could: Conduct extended autonomous transits, operations and station keeping; have a perception and autonomy software and hardware suite; integrate the ship’s machinery control system with the autonomy suite; and increase machinery plant automation to reduce human intervention when operating in the autonomous mode. Austal USA produced the hull, mechanical and engineering components, and the machinery control system (MCS). The navigation autonomy and perception suite was developed by L3Harris, while General Dynamics Mission Systems handled systems integration. The machinery control system includes the ship’s propulsion plant and electrical plant controls. According to Austal, it is able to provide navigational and shiphandling tasks including setting navigation lights, handling day shapes , recognizing anomalies and providing a response; and conducting machine learning for condition-based maintenance. The MCS was developed in-house by Austal, supported by a Siemens partnership; the system already is in service aboard other EPFs and aboard the Navy’s Ghost Fleet Overlord unmanned surface vessel Nomad . It is reconfigurable to multiple propulsion configurations, a characteristic dubbed “machinery agnostic.” The Navy’s unmanned surface vessel Nomad . (USN) L3Harris’ Perception and Situation Awareness system provides navigational autonomy and is “AI-Ready,” able to learn from manned operations using artificial intelligence . The ship’s navigation scheme includes the General Dynamics – Applied Physical Sciences Corporation’s FutureWaves system . It provides real-time decision-making based on sea states. The system, in use for several years aboard Military Sealift Command and commercial ships, provides ship motion forecasting based on data from an advanced wave-sensing Doppler radar . Austal USA and MSC have confirmed that the autonomous systems will remain in place aboard Apalachicola when the ship is delivered. MSC plans to bring the ship to Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek in Virginia for normal post-delivery testing and a post-shakedown shipyard availability before moving it to San Diego and then to the western Pacific to take up logistics chores. The Apalachicola already is one of the world’s largest autonomous ships, if not the largest, and is significantly bigger than the Navy’s Ghost Fleet Overlord unmanned ships. The latest Overlord ship, Mariner , delivered in August, is 194 feet long with a beam of 32 feet, and has a maximum allowable displacement of 673 metric tons. The EPF, by contrast, is 338 feet long, 93 feet wide, and has a full load displacement of 2,460 tons. In terms of sizeable unmanned vessels being developed in the commercial world, the small Norwegian container ship Yara Birkeland , is being billed as the world’s first truly autonomous merchant ship. Christened in April and funded in part by the Norwegian government, the Birkeland is 260 feet long, has a beam of 49 feet, and has a carrying capacity of 3,200 deadweight tons. Still under testing, the ship is intended to operate as an unmanned vessel in coastal service between the Norwegian ports of Brevik and Heroya – a modest distance of about seven nautical miles. At present, there are no operating funds available to use the Apalachicola ’s autonomous systems. According to multiple sources, there are no approved Navy plans to use the ship as a developmental autonomous asset with the Ghost Fleet Overlord ships operating under NAVSEA’s Unmanned Maritime Systems (PMS 406) office. Navy leadership, however, is aware of the opportunity presented by the Apalachicola . The service is in the process of finalizing the fiscal 2024 budget request due to Congress in February or March, and funding for the ship as an autonomous test asset could, repeat could, appear in some form in the request.
