Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Air Force To Turn Navy Air Defense Busting Missile Into High-Speed Critical Strike Weapon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has revealed that it is working to turn the U.S. Navy’ s Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range, or AARGM-ER , into a fast-flying strike weapon that its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters will be able to use against a variety of time-sensitive targets. This is something that The War Zone had thought would be the case based on previous information about this program. The new missile would give those stealthy jets, as well as other aircraft in the future, an important tool for quickly knocking down anti-access and area denial threats, as well as destroying pop-up targets on short notice. What appears to be the first public announcement that the AARGM-ER would serve as the basis for what the Air Force officially refers to as the Stand In Attack Weapon, or SiAW, was included in detailed documents about the service’s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2020, which it released on Mar. 18, 2019 . Mention of the SiAW had first appeared in the Air Force’s budget request for the 2018 fiscal cycle, which came out in February 2017 , but the line items made no mention of using a particular missile as the starting point. The “Stand In Attack Weapon (SiAW) system will provide strike capability to defeat rapidly relocatable targets that create the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environment,” the Air Force’s latest budget request explains . “The target environment includes Theater Ballistic Missile Launchers , Land Attack and Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Launchers, GPS Jammers , Anti-Satellite Systems , and Integrated Air Defense Systems .” The Navy, which is already the lead on the AARGM-ER program, is in charge of the development of the SiAW variant. The Air Force is handling integrating the missile onto the F-35A, which is its threshold launch platform. Northrop Grumman is developing the weapon having purchased the company that first created the design, Orbital ATK, in 2017. Joseph Trevithick The SiAW will feature a different warhead and fuze, of unspecified types, which the Navy began working on in the 2019 Fiscal Year. The Navy already has a requirement for the AARGM-ER to fit inside the weapon bays of its F-35C, so the new variant just needs to retain a similar dimensional profile for the F-35A to carry it internally. The Air Force will also need to make sure the flight computer on its jets can “talk” with the missile, something the service has been working on itself since FY19. The USAF’s latest budget proposal asks for nearly $163 million in additional funding to continue this developmental work. The AARGM-ER is already set to be an extremely capable missile. This is why it seemed like an obvious choice for at least a starting place for the SiAW to us at The War Zone last year. The AARGM-ER is derived from the AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), the latest variant of the already proven High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), which is already much more than just an air defense-busting radar-homing missile. This missile has multi-mode guidance capability that includes a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system and a millimeter wave radar seeker. This allow the missiles to hit targets that have stopped emitting radio signals to home in on, or may never have been emitting in the first place, or simply hit a specific location. The missile also has a two-way data link so the launching aircraft, or another source, can feed it new target information in flight. The AARGM-ER will have this exact same guidance package and the Air Force’s budget documents make no mention of the SiAW needing a new guidance system. The AARGM-ER shares other features with the AGM-88E, including its warhead and portions of its control section, but it is in many ways an all-new missile with significant improvements in range and speed. We don’t know the exact for the Air Force’s SiAW and those same details regarding the AARGM-ER are classified, but previous reports have suggested the latter missile would have between 20 to 50 percent greater range than the existing AGM-88E. This means the AARGM-ER, a possibly the SiAW, would have a maximum range of at least somewhere between 96 and 120 miles. The AARGM-ER’s improved rocket motor and streamlined design will also make it faster than the AGM-88E, which reportedly flies at more than twice the speed of sound during a final dash to the target. You can read more about both the game-changing capabilities of the AGM-88E and the up-coming AARGM-ER in detail here . A slide showing the relationship between the AGM-88E AARGM and the new AARGM-ER., USMC The SiAW program makes good sense given concerns about increasingly dense integrated air defense environments in the future, especially those that Russia and China are working to establish. Stealthy features and defensive electronic warfare systems may not be enough to guarantee survival against networks of advanced enemy radars and other sensors linked to long-range surface-to-air missiles and increasingly capable jamming systems . There is always the potential for pop-up systems to appear with little notice and for wild card threats to emerge. This is to say nothing of other kinetic and non-kinetic weapons that could challenge American forces on the ground, at sea, or even in space , as the Air Force’s budget documents note. So, there is a clear requirement for a rapid response weapon with significant range and high speed to be able to neutralize these threats quickly, as they appear. The weapon also needs to be able to do so before an opponent can launch their own strikes, relocate elsewhere, or flee to safety. Combining the SiAW with a low-observable platform such as the F-35A only improves the likelihood that it will be able to reach the target in time, even in a high-risk environment. Leveraging the AARGM-ER design is also smart, given that it is already in development, already fits inside the F-35A’s weapon internal bays, and has the range and speed to meet the SiAW’s general requirements. As noted, it also uses a significant amount of technology and components from the older AGM-88E, making it a much more cost-effective option over a completely new design. This will also help simply maintenance and logistics requirements. A model of the AARGM-ER., Joseph Trevithick The F-35A will almost certainly only be the first platform to get the SiAW, not the last. The Air Force’s 2018 Fiscal Year budget proposal mentioned a desire to also integrate it onto the upcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber . A B-21, potentially carrying dozens of SiAWs, would offer a new and impressive means of challenging and defeating enemy anti-access and area-denial threats. A bomber loaded with a mix of AARGM-ERs and SiAWs would be a particularly capable tool for destroying both air defenses and targets of opportunity along a certain route, helping clearing a path for following-on forces both in the air and down below. The truth is that stealthy planes, both manned and unmanned , will need weapons such as SiAW to defend themselves and their companions in ever-increasingly dangerous high-end air defense environments. Stealth technology is not a cloaking device , requiring a blend of additional capabilities to best ensure the survivability of these aircraft in the future. For the B-21, the ability to quickly make changes to its route of best survivability, often referred to as the “blue line,” on the fly using real-time intelligence garnered organically from its own sensors and those from third party platforms received via data-link will be key. But also having the ability to blast its way through to its intended target when avoiding a threat isn’t possible will be very important. SiAWs would give it this capability. Non-stealth planes could also potentially carry the weapons, improving their ability to neutralize threats in high-risk environments, in turn making older platforms more relevant in future major conflicts. Northrop Grumman is also offering a containerized land-based launcher for the AGM-88E and AARGM-ER, which could allow forces on the ground or ships at sea to employ the weapon, as well. A model of Northrop Grumman’s containerized AARGM/AARGM-ER launcher., Joseph Trevithick With the impending demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, between the United States and Russia, which you can read about in more detail here , the U.S. military will only be presented with more threats from ground-launched cruise missiles and theater ballistic missiles , in the coming years. Ballistic and cruise missile technology , in particular, as well as road-mobile launchers for these weapons, are steadily proliferating, even among non-state actors , as well. With all this in mind, the Air Force’s new “stand-in” missile is one of, if not the most relevant air-launched weapon one could imagine to help the Air Force respond the most significant threats it faces in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 2, 2019",North Korean Resistance Group Was Reportedly Behind Mysterious Embassy Raid In Spain,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A little-known group actively seeking to undermine North Korean Premier Kim Jong Un and his regime, known as Cheollima Civil Defense, was responsible for a bizarre break in at the country’s embassy in Spain, according to a new report. Four weeks after the incident, there are still few hard facts about what exactly happened at the compound in Madrid. The Washington Post , citing “people familiar with the planning and execution of the mission,” was first to report the connection to Cheollima Civil Defense , also known as Free Joseon, a reference to the last dynastic kingdom on the Korean Peninsula, on Mar. 15, 2019. This comes two days after a separate story in the Spanish newspaper El Pais , citing unnamed Spanish government sources, alleging that two of the attackers had connections to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Spanish, North Korean, and American authorities declined to comment when The Post asked whether Cheollima Civil Defense or the CIA were involved in the raid. The newspaper’s sources also reportedly told them that there had been no coordination with any intelligence agencies. The incident itself occurred on Feb. 22, 2019 . Around 10 unidentified masked individuals briefly took control of the North Korean Embassy before fleeing the scene in two cars after reportedly tying up and interrogating members of the staff and stealing cell phones and computers. The Post ’s report did not ascribe a particular motive to the hostage taking and robbery.

Spain’s authorities are investigating, but nearly a week afterward there was reportedly still no official complaint from the North Koreans. The assailants were in the embassy for approximately four hours. During that time, one of the staff escaped and alerted police, who went to check on the situation. A man wearing the North Korean standard pin bearing the likenesses of Kim Jong Un and his father, the country’s previous leader, Kim Jong Il, told them everything was “normal” and they left. The front door of North Korea’s Embassy in Madrid., AP Soon after, the attackers left in a pair of cars at high speed, according to Spain’s El Confidencial newspaper, which was first to report that anything had happened at all. “Basically, the information that El Confidencial describes is how the events unfolded,” Reuters subsequently reported , citing an unnamed Spanish Foreign Ministry source. The raid in Spain occurred just days before U.S. President Donald Trump joined Kim for talks in Vietnam and it briefly threatened to upend those meetings. That summit subsequently collapsed due to the inability of both parties to find common ground in the negotiations over various topics, including sanctions against Pyongyang and North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs . US President Donald Trump speaks to the press after the breakdown in talks in Hanoi on Feb. 28, 2019., The Yomiuri Shimbun via AP Images If Cheollima is responsible, it would be the highest profile act the group has carried out since it came into the public eye in 2017. Early that year, operatives from the group reportedly spirited North Korean princeling Kim Han Sol out of the Chinese city of Macau and into hiding, where he remains. Kim Han Sol is son of Kim Jong Nam , who was a son of former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and was Kim Jong Un’s half-brother. Foreign diplomatic and intelligence officials had pegged Kim Jong Nam as the heir apparent in North Korea until he fell from grace in 2001 after trying to use fake documents to visit Disneyland Japan . Kim Jong Nam subsequently went into exile, sometimes publicly criticizing the North Korean government. On Feb. 13, 2017, two assassins, under the orders of North Korea’s security services, killed him in Malaysia with VX nerve agent . Kim Jong Nam seen here swarmed by reporters after arriving in Beijing, China, in 2007., Kyodo News via AP Kim Han Sol had himself challenged the North Korean state narrative publicly on multiple occasions. This included an interview with Finnish television network Yle in 2012, seen below, where he not only said he hoped for eventual Korean unification, but did not dispute the characterization of his uncle and grandfather as dictators. Cheollima Civil Defense released a video of Kim Han Sol in March 2017, in which he said he was with his mother and sister and that “we hope this gets better soon.” The group said the young Kim had been in danger and that they had been able to get him to safety with Chinese, American, and Dutch authorities, according to a story The Wall Street Journal published on Oct. 1, 2017. South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo reported that Chinese officials had arrested two members of North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau in connection with an assassination plot on Oct. 31, 2017. It is possible that the raid in Spain was connected in some way with helping another North Korean national escape to safety. In January 2019, North Korea’s acting Ambassador to Italy, Jo Song Gil disappeared and reportedly went into hiding with wife, according to a South Korean lawmaker . Jo had been on the job since Italy declared his predecessor Mun Jong Nam persona non grata in protest of North Korea’s sixth nuclear test and its test launches of increasingly capable ballistic missiles . Cheollima Civil Defense might have also been trying to gather information about Kim Hyok Chol, who had been North Korea’s ambassador to Spain until 2017, when Spanish authorities ejected him for the same reasons Italy had booted Mun. Kim Hyok Chol has subsequently become the country’s top negotiator in talks with the United States and had been a key figure in setting up the Hanoi summit. If this was the case, however, it might indicate direction from a intelligence service, such as the CIA, in spite of the denials from The Post ’s sources. Kim Hyok Chol arrives on Hanoi on Feb. 20, 2019, ahead of Kim’s summit with Trump., Kyodo via AP Images The group, which takes its name from a flying horse common in East Asian mythology, which the North Korean regime often refers to in its own propaganda, has otherwise not acknowledged any other major operations. On Feb. 28, 2019 , it released a manifesto in Korean and English on its spartan website, calling for North Koreans to resist the Kim government in any way possible. Since then, the site has only had two additional posts, both on Mar. 11, 2019. One announced a new website would be coming in the future and provided a form to sign up for Email updates and another had a simple message of encouragement for resisters. The second post had “Kuala Lumpur” in English in the title and appeared to be in response to the Malaysian government’s surprise decision to drop all charges against one of Kim Yong Nam’s alleged assassins. Siti Aisyah, at center, an Indonesian national on trial for the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, leaves the courthouse a free woman on Mar. 11, 2019, after prosecutors said they would drop all charges without giving any official reason., Kyodo News via AP It’s also curious that if the group had been responsible for the embassy raid, for any reason, that they would not have taken credit for it, though. Cheollima Civil Defense’s website has an Email address that anyone can contact and it has not particularly shied away from making anonymous statements – understandable given the reach of North Korea’s security services – to reporters in the past. None of the posts since the break-in have suggested a big reveal is coming, either. A 2017 piece in The New Yorker that came out after the Kim Han Sol incident also noted that at the least first posts on Cheollima Civil Defense’s website were written in a Korean that was “oddly stilted, as if the statements there had been drafted first in a different language, then translated.” This calls the exact origins of the group into question, as well as who is issuing these statements. The use of unusual and awkward Korean could be a countermeasure to make it more difficult for North Korean intelligence officials to analyze the text, too. A statue of Cheollima in Pyongyang, meant to symbolize the advance of the Korean people at the winged horse’s lightning speed under the leadership of the Kim dynasty., Nicor via Wikimedia For its part, North Korea appears to be keeping largely quiet on the incident in Spain. If nothing else, it has to be highly embarrassing that any group could take control of the Embassy for an extended period of time and then just walk out and escape. Whether there is a CIA connection or not, the North Koreans appear to have hit an impasse in their interactions with the United States, as well. On Mar. 14, 2019, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui lambasted the U.S. government for the breakdown in talks in Hanoi and called the American position “gangster-like.” This is a turn of phrase that was common in North Korea’s statements and propaganda missives prior to the warming of relations between Kim and Trump. “We have no intention to yield to the U.S. demands [presented in Hanoi] in any form, nor are we willing to engage in negotiations of this kind,” Choe told reporters in Pyongyang, referring to American demands for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and more in exchange for the possibility of sanctions relief. He did also say that these personal ties between Kim and Trump remained strong and indicated that it would be up to the country’s premier to determine the policy going forward. It remains to be seen how North Korea might respond to the evolving situation. There has been apparent work to reactivate its space launch facilities at Sohae , which Kim had previously agreed to give up after his first summit with Trump. It is possible that the North Koreans could launch another space launch vehicle rocket to test the American president’s resolve. Trump has warned that the United States could once again take a tougher stand if North Korea conducts new missile or nuclear weapons tests. North Korea in the past has insisted that space launches are not missile tests, despite the fact they can serve a dual developmental purpose, especially in regards to the crafting of new rocket engines. North Korea’s stance, as well as that of the United States, will likely become increasingly clear in the near future. Whether we gain any more clarity about what happened at the North Korean Embassy in Spain remains to be seen. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We had a quieter week overall here at The War Zone , but it started off with a giant bang. We published our big takedown of the crazy narratives coming out of the Indian-Pakistan MiG-21 Bison shoot-down and it caused quite the storm. Then we were all primed and ready to follow that with a week of budget-related news, but the DoD didn’t release the detailed line-item budget books, so were were only left with broad, but still important strokes to report on . Beyond that, there was news about Japan getting its first land-attack capable cruise missile , new sniper rifles for America’s special operators, a flight by a shady L-100 to Venezuela , and the retirement of the Tornado after 40 years of Royal Air Force service. Oh and we were able to take a walk back in time to revisit the crazy SAGE air defense bunkers of the Cold War. Still, there were many subjects we didn’t get to. But it’s not too late. Welcome to Bunker Talk! This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t get to. In other words, literally an off-topic thread. We can talk about Louiseville Sluggers becoming standard equipment aboard U.S. supercarriers in the age of great power competition: Or the slowly unraveling situation in Afghanistan: Then there are the reports that the Trump Administration doesn’t  just want allies to foot the bill for posting American troops in their countries, but they want to make a hefty profit on it: We also have the ongoing 737MAX crisis. And really, that’s what it is, a crisis. That airplane is Boeing’s cash cow. There is a strategic importance to keeping that product line stable and well regarded. The discussion section has been all over this story at times. I haven’t found a need to address it… At least not yet, but here is one interesting take I think is worth at least reading. Finally, I just want to say a few things about what happened in Christchurch, New Zealand: Evil is real. It lives among us and is fed primarily by stupidity. That pathetic excuse for a human being put an amazing amount of effort into defining his hate and acting upon it. One can only imagine how he could have bettered his position in life with all that energy and effort if he put it to positive use. For some people, blaming everyone else for their problems is the only way they can cope with their own deficiencies. In their eyes, the world’s ills and personal failures are always someone else’s fault and it is more convenient and satisfying blaming an entire race of people or a religion for them. Superiority of race is also grabbed at for a personal identity because certain people lack the ability to create their own space in the world. Maybe these are mankind’s most vile diseases, ones in which medicine can’t provide a cure. I feel so bad for everyone involved in that tragedy. Not just for those who were injured or died, but also for those whose lives will be changed by experiencing that level of horror first hand and right in the places they are supposed to feel most comfortable in. It is a direct attack on all our freedom and should be viewed as such. Remember to remind those you care about how important they are to you. Try to be a teacher not a disciplinarian to those who depend on your leadership. Give people a shot who need it most. Don’t fall for soft peddlers of hate and bigotry, but still have the ability to laugh at ourselves. And above all else, keep your guard up.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 26, 2019",This Crazy Contraption Was Supposed To Help Aussie Troops Carry Their Guns. It Did The Opposite.,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A little less than three years ago, the Australian Army said it would evaluate an unusual backpack-mounted pole-and-sling combination called the Reaper that could make it easier for machine gunners and snipers to carry their weapons on patrol. Now, The War Zone have obtained trials reports that make it clear the Australians weren’t impressed and found the system to be far more of a burden than a benefit. In December 2016, the Australian Army officially rejected the Reaper Small Arms Carriage System, or RSACS, and informed the manufacturer, Advanced Accuracy Solutions , of its decision. The Idaho-based company had first demonstrated their piece of kit at an Army Innovation Day showcase in October 2015. “The Australian Army units involved in the trial of ‘The Reaper’ all indicated that although it may have utility in specific situations, these advantages were outweighed by a number of disadvantages,” an unknown officer wrote in a letter to Advanced Accuracy Solutions. “These disadvantages included compromised camouflage and concealment, integration with night fighting equipment and user safety in airframe and vehicle platforms.” The War Zone obtained this partially redacted document and other records related to the Reaper trails via Australia’s Freedom of Information (FOI) law. A copy of the Australian Army’s December 2016 letter to Advanced Accuracy Solutions., Australian Army via FOI Reaper consists of a two-piece aluminum pole attached to a frame a shooter wears like a backpack. This assembly extends up over the user’s shoulder. A cord extends from the curved end of the pole and attaches to their gun. The basic idea is that this arrangement offers additional stability to improve accuracy and reduce the physical strain of carrying a rifle or machine-gun around at the ready for hours on end. “Personnel patrolling for long periods of time can become combat ineffective, or at the very least have a diminished response to a threat,” Advanced Accuracy Solutions’ Jason Semple told me in an Email when I initially reported on the Australian Army’s trial in 2016. He wasn’t wrong. Soldiers in any major military today are increasingly burdened with all sorts of weapons and equipment, especially if they’re conducting extended dismounted patrols. Machine guns and large sniper and anti-materiel rifles, which can weigh more than 20 pounds on their own, only add to the strain on soldiers assigned to carry those types of weapons. “It’s a funny-looking contraption,” Australian Army warrant officer Nicolas Crosbie, who took part in the trials, said in an official video. “I’m interested to see … when we trial it with the soldiers, what they think of it and that sort of thing.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=R1FspYLGokM The Australian Army trialed the system in combination with three machine guns, its version of the FN Minimi , known as the F89, the 7.62mm FN Maximi, similar to the U.S. Mk 48 , and the FN MAG-58 . Snipers also tested it together with their KAC Mk 11 , Accuracy International SR-98 , Blaser Tactical , and Accuracy International AW50 rifles. The evaluations also involved using various Reaper and weapon combinations together with the Bushmaster wheeled armored vehicle, the M113AS4 tracked armored vehicle, and the CH-47 Chinook and MRH-90 helicopters. The response from soldiers was not positive. “The Reaper trial sought to prove or disprove the hypothesis that the utilization of the Reaper by a Rifleman will provide greater lethality by reducing the effects of muscle fatigue and weapon instability in a mounted and dismounted role,” the final report concluded. “As a result of the evidence collected over the trial period, the hypothesis has been disproven.” For one, the Reaper did reduce strain on a soldier’s arms when carrying a weapon. But it also increased fatigue from the awkwardness of firing and moving with the system on their back. “The soldier’s breathing motion was exaggerated by the RSACS,” one report says. “This forced the soldier to tense his entire torso in order to effectively release each burst, thus significantly increasing the soldier’s overall fatigue.” The change in high-mounted weight distribution also made it harder for troops to run and the pole made it impossible to get into a prone firing position. Advanced Accuracy Solutions has said that the Reaper can work when the shooter is prone, but the Australians vehemently disagreed in their trials. Troops also just found it difficult to put it on at all, usually requiring the aid of a second person. An Australian Army soldier fires an F89 machine gun, something the the service said was not possible to do with the Reaper., Australian DOD These factors also contributed to a lack of any meaningful improvements in shooter accuracy. When troops firing their weapons unsupported while kneeling, they were able to achieve better effects without the Reaper at four of the six tested distances. The Australian Army said that the RSACS performed better during standing unsupported fire drills, but the improvements were still negligible. Some of these results can certainly be blamed on a lack of experience with the Reaper and further practice using the system may have led to better performance. However, this would have meant the Australian Army might have been looking at increased training requirements had it adopted the system for widespread use. In addition, ignoring the issues of accuracy and fatigue, the Reaper presented other serious problems. The pole made it difficult for soldiers to stay concealed on the open battlefield, maneuver through more constrained environments, such as buildings, and get in and out of aircraft and vehicles. The Australian Army determined that the system presented such a serious safety risk for personnel in helicopters, especially if they had to ditch over water, that it would preclude any soldier from wearing it during airmobile operations. A table describing the various issues Australian troops uncovered in their trial of the Reaper., Australian Army via FOI In an apparent attempt to be charitable, the Australian Army noted that the system could help soldiers stabilize heavy guns while standing in turrets on vehicles such as the Bushmaster wheeled armored vehicle. However, the report pointed out that these vehicles already had fixed mounts in those positions specifically for this purpose. In addition, Australia’s Bushmasters feature a remote weapons station that reduces the need for individuals inside to expose themselves to enemy fire at all during a firefight. Advanced Accuracy Solutions says that the system can be folded away when users are riding in vehicles, something that is not mentioned in the Australian reports. However, this would mean that troops would have had to go through the motions of extending and collapsing the Reaper every time they mounted or dismounted a vehicle, which could have made the process more cumbersome, especially under fire. An Australian Bushmaster armored wheeled vehicle with a remote weapons station. A fixed weapon mount is visible at the back where an individual could use it to support their weapon when standing in the right rear hatch., Australian DOD Not surprisingly, the pole and cord also had a habit of getting caught on both foliage and other objects, as well as the user’s other gear. The system notably interfered with troops using helmets with night vision googles attached to them. It also made it difficult for machine guns with the F89 machine gun to open the top cover to reload or clear jams. “The live fire trials identified that the Reaper, overall, created a decrease in accuracy and transferred muscle fatigue to the remainder of the torso,” the Australian Army concluded. “The Reaper is not suitable for dismounted operations. The Reaper for utilization in all mounted in all mobility platforms trialed.” These potential issues had been obvious well before the Reaper trials began. But it’s not necessarily surprising that the Australians were still willing to consider the system. Large armed forces, including the United States, have expended considerable time and resources to try and reduce the weight of things troops need to carry and mitigate the fatigue they experience lugging their individual loads around. This has included programs to develop everything from lightweight ammunition to powered exoskeletons . Ammunition-filled backpacks , more commonly associated with action movies such as Predator , have been another option. “Third arm” systems such the Reaper, another Hollywood staple, most notably the M-56 Smart Gun in Aliens – a prop made from a Steadicam video camera stabilization system and an MG-42 machine gun – have offered the potential for a less risky and lower cost interim solution. Aliens The U.S. Army is in the process of testing its own “ third arm ,” which clearly tries to mitigate many of the problems with the Reaper by placing the support under the shooter’s arm, rather than over the shoulder. It still remains to be seen whether the added bulk of this system offers more benefits than hindrances. U.S. Special Operations Command recently put their “Iron Man” exoskeleton program, officially known as the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS), on ice , admitting that the initial prototypes had not met expectations. But SOCOM does intend to continue developing certain specific portions of the overall system that do show promise, including “a small arms stabilization system,” according to Task and Purpose . So, while the Australian experience with the Reaper might have been poor, there’s still a possibility that troops in major militaries around the world might end up some similarly unusual contraption strapped to their backs in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 30, 2020",The Royal Air Force Has Said Goodbye To The Tornado After An Amazing 40-Year Career,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Air Force has marked the end of an era and formally retired the very last of its swing-wing Panavia Tornado combat jets. For almost 40 years, the aircraft formed an essential part of British air combat capabilities, but are now giving way to the next generation of aircraft, including the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . The last two RAF Tornado squadrons, No. IX(B) and 31 Squadron , stood down in a ceremony at RAF Marham on March 14, 2019. The event included a parade by members of both units and a fly-by from a single Tornado GR4, which concluded the last official flight by the type in British service. Photos and video from the event show the jet roaring past at low altitude and at high speed with its swing-wings swept back, a fitting final send off for an aircraft that was originally meant to fly fast and low strike missions against Soviet targets in Europe. Afterward, the jet taxied to a hangar at Marham where Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, the RAF’s top officer, greeted the two pilots, Squadron Leader Ian Dornan, and Squadron Leader Stephen Beardmore. “Today is a time to rightly recognize the truly exceptional achievements of the people who have been the Tornado Force. We reflect on the courage, skill, commitment and sadly sometimes sacrifice of those who have been at the heart of the Tornado story, from its inception through to the present day,” Air Chief Marshal Hillier said at the ceremony . “All have played their part to the full in the success story that is Tornado.” The Tornado has been a constant presence in British skies and major factor in U.K. military operations since the RAF received its first examples in 1979. It earned the nickname “Tonka” after the popular line of toy trucks and other vehicles that were “ built Tonka tough .” But despite this moniker, the design was born out of years of stutter-started multi-national efforts to develop a new multi-role combat jet. The United Kingdom’s own requirement traced back to the near legendary cancellation of the British Air Corporation’s (BAC) TSR-2 supersonic strike and reconnaissance aircraft in 1964. Four years later, the U.K. Ministry of Defense cancelled a subsequent order for American-made General Dynamics F-111K swing-wing combat jets. In parallel, the British had entered into a partnership with the French to develop the Anglo-French Variable Geometry (AFVG) combat aircraft. After France withdrew from the effort, this project subsequently evolved first into the Multi Role Aircraft (MRA) and then became the Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA). At one time, Belgium, Canada, Italy, The Netherlands, and West Germany were all also involved. The Belgians and Canadians dropped out before the program made any significant progress. In 1969, the British, Dutch, Italians, and West Germans agreed to form a multi-national conglomerate, with its main headquarters in West Germany, to continue development of the aircraft. The next year, The Netherlands pulled out of the program. This left BAC in the United Kingdom, the West German firm Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm, and Italy’s Aeritalia to handle various portions of the development and production of the aircraft, which eventually became known as the Tornado. The result of the program was a twin-engine, two-seat, swing-wing combat aircraft. Panavia built Tornadoes in three main variants, Interdictor/Strike (IDS), Electronic Combat/Reconnaissance (ECR), and Air Defense Variant (ADV). The RAF only operated the IDS and ADV types, referring to them as Tornado GR-series and Tornado F-series aircraft, respectively. A camouflaged Tornado GR1 flies in front of the Tornado F2 prototype at the Farnborough Air Show in 1982., DOD All three types used variants of the Turbo-Union RB199 turbofan engine. The first examples of the IDS featured versions that were of lower performance compared to subsequent models, all of which had generally similar thrust ratings. These engines gave the Tornado a dash speed of more than Mach 2 at high altitude, which was especially important for ADV variants operating in the interceptor role. The major difference between the IDS and ADV variants was the latter’s GEC-Marconi/Ferranti AI.24 Foxhunter radar, which necessitated a completely different nose shape. With Foxhunter, these planes could detect opponents at beyond visual ranges in any weather. A Tornado F3 on display with a Foxhunter radar in front., Ad Meskens via Wikimedia The ADV types also only had a single 27mm Mauser BK-27 automatic cannon mounted in the lower right side of the forward fuselage, whereas the IDS had two of these guns, one on each side. The two aircraft had different under fuselage hard point configurations for various types of ordnance, as well. Both the IDS and the ADV had a maximum total payload rating of almost 20,000 pounds and provisions for up to four under-wing hardpoints. These stations all swiveled as the wings moved, keeping the stores properly aligned with the direction of travel at all times. In June 1982, No. IX(B) Squadron became the first ever operational Tornado unit flying first generation IDS variants, known in RAF service as the GR1. The squadron, which traces its history back to World War I, and took part in the famous World War II operation to sink the German battleship Tirpitz , had previously operated the Avro Vulcan heavy bomber. The Falklands War was just ending as No. IX(B) was reaching its operational status, meaning that no Tornadoes saw action in the South Atlantic. Instead, the truly multi-mission Tornado Force took up stations in the United Kingdom and West Germany to respond to a potential Soviet bloc invasion of Western Europe. If a major conflict between NATO and the Warsaw had erupted, the RAF’s Tornado GR1s would have sortied out to destroy air bases and air defense sites in East Germany with a mix of regular high explosive and cluster bombs, fixed cluster munitions dispensers containing runway cratering bomblets and anti-personnel mines, and anti-radiation missiles . Aircraft based in West Germany might have also found themselves carrying WE.177 nuclear gravity bombs. GR1As, equipped with the Tornado Infra-Red Reconnaissance System (TIRRS), were also available to fly pre- and post-strike reconnaissance missions. TIRRS consisted of side-looking infrared cameras on either side of the forward fuselage in place of the two BK-27 cannons and an infrared line scanner camera in the lower fuselage, which gave them a general tactical reconnaissance capability. State of the art for its time, the system recorded imagery and full-motion video on six S-VHS cassettes that personnel would have to retrieve when the aircraft returned to base. A Tornado GR1A. The window for the left-side mounted camera is visible just to the right of the national insignia on the forward fuselage., Anthony Noble via Wikimedia The RAF also had a smaller number of GR1Bs that could carry Sea Eagle anti-ship cruise missiles based in Scotland. From there, these jets would have gone hunting for Soviet ships in the Norwegian Sea, North Sea, and other nearby bodies of water. In 1984, the RAF also began flying its first version of the ADV, known as the F2, but problems with the Foxhunter radar left them relegated primarily to training duties. The jets flew with concrete ballast in their nose, which RAF personnel jokingly referred to as the “Blue Circle” radar, a play on a popular cement brand and British “ Rainbow Codes ” naming convention for advanced military equipment. The F2 quickly gave way to the F3, which finally featured working radars, as well as an improved version of the RB199 engine. In 1987, 29 Squadron became the first RAF unit to actually fly the F3 operationally. A pair of Tornado F3s., Crown Copyright The RAF expected these jets to focus primarily on intercepting Soviet bombers, and engage them at beyond visual range, during any potential conflict. But compared to other fighter jets of the era, the F3’s maneuverability in more close-in engagements was notably poor. Still, British pilots demonstrated that the combination of their jet’s dash speed, Foxhunter radar, Skyflash missiles , and good tactics could be deadly even against some of the best opponents. RAF F3s came out on top against U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcats and F/A-18 Hornets, among others, in numerous training exercises, something you can read about more here . A Tornado F3 intercepts a Russian Tu-160 Blackjack bomber., Crown Copyright Thankfully the twilight of the Cold War remained cold and no Tornadoes ever had to fly into action against the Soviet Union or the Warsaw Pact. GR1s and F3s instead saw their first combat missions against Iraqi forces following Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait. The GR1s performed many of the same missions they would have done in a European conflict, using unguided bombs and JP233 luster munition dispensers , as well as new laser-guided bombs, to attack Iraqi airfields and surface-to-air missile systems. F3s flew thousands of combat air patrols overhead to keep away enemy fighter jets. The Tornado did not have its own laser designator, requiring other aircraft to mark targets initially. Some of the jets eventually did receive the GEC Marconi Thermal Imaging Airborne Laser Designator ( TIALD ) targeting pod during the conflict to allow them to laser designate targets themselves. The United Kingdom became the first country to lose a Tornado in combat when an Iraqi soldier shot one down with a SA-16 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile in January 1991. The RAF would lose five more aircraft during the campaign to eject Saddam’s troops from Kuwait. Analysis of these incidents highlighted the risks of the Tonka’s low-level tactics . The jets had to make extremely low passes to effectively employ the JP233s in particular. By the end of the First Gulf War, these types of missions had given way to higher-altitude bombing runs. Lessons learned from the GR1’s performance during the conflict also contributed to a Mid-Life Update program that began in 1996. British Aerospace, BAC’s successor, eventually upgraded more than 140 GR1s and GR1As to the new GR4 and GR4A standard. This improvement program, which ran through 2003, added new avionics, updated communications equipment and data links, and a more robust ability to self-designate targets for laser guided bombs through the eventual integration of the Israeli-developed LITENING targeting pod . A Tornado GR4A with the Litening targeting pod visible under the forward fuselage., Crown Copyright As the upgrade program was progressing, GR1s continued to serve in the Middle East, contributing to no-fly zones over Iraq, and took part in international peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions in the Balkans, flying over Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. The Tonkas had firmly become the primary combat aircraft in the RAF. Separately, in the late 1990s, the Tornado GR1 and GR4s gained the ability to carry the Reconnaissance Airborne Pod Tornado ( RAPTOR ), a U.K.-specific version of the DB-110 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance pod, which you can read more about here . This system effectively rendered the older TIRRS obsolete, allowing tactical reconnaissance squadrons to fly regular GR1s and GR4s. A Tornado GR4A carrying the RAPTOR pod., Crown Copyright In 2003, Tornados took part in the opening phases of the invasion of Iraq, employing the new Storm Shadow cruise missile, as well as RAPTOR, in combat for the very first time. Unlike during the First Gulf War, the Tornado Force suffered virtually no losses during the conflict. The one exception was when a U.S. Army Patriot surface-to-air missile battery mistakenly identified one of the Tonkas as an enemy jet and shot it down, killing both pilots on board. Precision guided munitions steadily became the norm, as well. During the Kosovo campaign, just a quarter of the munitions that the Tonkas employed were guided. In Iraq in 2003, 85 percent of all the weapons they used were “smart.” At this time, the primary precision guided munitions were laser-guided Paveway bombs , but the Tornadoes arsenal eventually expanded to include dual-mode laser- and GPS/INS-guided Enhanced Paveway bombs and dual-mode Brimstone missiles. The last RAF Tonkas left Iraq in 2009. A Tornado GR4 with a mixed load of Paveway precision-guided bombs and a Brimstone missile during a training exercise., Crown Copyright The Tonkas remained at the core of the RAF’s combat capabilities even after the introduction of the Eurofighter Typhoon , which began in 2003. Difficulty in that aircarft’s development delays its entry into service to begin with and when it did arrive, it had extremely limited air-to-ground capabilities. But those more modern jets did certainly contribute to the decision to retire the Tornado F3s, which the RAF stopped flying for good in 2012. The remaining GR4s continued to receive additional upgrades. In 2004, BAE Systems, which had absorbed British Aerospace, began overhauling the front and rear cockpits in these jets, adding in new digital multifunction displays in place of old CRT screens. They called the update the Tornado Advanced Radar Display Information System, or TARDIS, a clear reference to the phone box-shaped time machine in the popular British television series Dr. Who . After Iraq, and with these additional upgrades, Tonkas made their way to Afghanistan to take part in that conflict. The last jets headed home from that theater in 2014. RAF Tornados also took part in the U.S.-led campaign in Libya in 2011 that led to the ouster of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi. A Libyan tank seen through a Tornado GR4’s targeting pod before its destruction at the hands of a Brimstone missile., Crown Copyright The last major campaign for the RAF’s Tornados began in 2014 with operations against ISIS in Iraq, with those operations eventually extending into Eastern Syria. The aging swing-wing jets also took part in the U.S.-led missile strikes against Bashar Al Assad’s chemical weapons infrastructure on Apr. 14, 2018. Four Tonkas, flying from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, each fired two Storm Shadow cruise missiles at a weapon storage facility west of the Syrian city of Homs. Over the years, the Tonkas have been a regular sight across the United Kingdom, as well as elsewhere around the world, during training exercises and at air shows. They were also called upon for non-combat missions now and again. In 2014, 31 Squadron’s jets notably used their RAPTOR pods to capture imagery of flooding in the Thames River Valley in support of disaster relief efforts. Annotated imagery from a Tornado’s RAPTOR pod of flooding in the Thames River Valley in 2014., Crown Copyright So, the sunset of the United Kingdom’s Tornadoes and the celebration of their lengthy service is certainly bittersweet for many. It certainly marks a major change for the RAF. Typhoons will be the aircraft to primarily take over from the Tornado now. The RAF eventually plans for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to fulfill many of the roles the Tonka had fulfilled as time goes on. No. IX(B) Squadron will reform as a Typhoon unit on Apr. 1, 2019, while 31 Squadron will come back into being in 2024 to begin flying the Protector unmanned aircraft, a derivative of the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper . No. IX(B) Squadron gave one of its GR4s this special scheme in late 2018, marking 36 years flying the Tornado., Crown Copyright The RAF’s retirement of the Tornado also marks the continued decline of active swing-wing combat jets in service around the world. The Tonka itself was never a big export success, with the only customer outside of the Panavia cooperative being Saudi Arabia. Italy is slated to replace its jets with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter by 2025. The Germans are looking to retire their entire fleet with an as yet unknown type by 2030. It’s not clear how much longer the Saudis, who are steadily acquiring more advanced combat jets , expect to fly their Tonkas. “It was an honor and a privilege to be the crew to fly this iconic jet for the very last time and the fact that we have been able to conduct these flypasts is testament to the hard work that has been put in by the engineers to ensure the jets were serviceable,” Squadron Leader Dornan said after finishing the final Tornado flight. “The skies over Norfolk and the U.K. are going to be a lot emptier without her.” Crown Copyright Unfortunately, nothing, no matter how “Tonka Tough,” lasts forever. But the Tornado certainty made its mark on the RAF and will be fondly remembered years from now as an essential part of the service’s history.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 22, 2018",8 F-15Xs For USAF And 22 F-5s For Navy In 2020 Budget Request,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has rolled out its budget today and although the fine details remain nearly non-existent, we are getting a look at the plan’s broader strokes. Two items in the 2020 budget request are especially important for us to follow up on—the official procurement of the F-15X and the purchase of 22 F-5E/Fs. The official F-15X procurement announcement is exactly as we predicted it would be going back to when we broke the existence of the concept last July. This includes the exact initial procurement number—eight F-15EX (two seat) aircraft for 2020, a metric that at the time didn’t match other outlets’ reporting—as well as the rough total dollar amount of $1,117.4B. A portion of this total will be used for purchasing the first eight aircraft and the rest will be used to fund limited development work to integrate a handful of systems not found on export variants of the Eagle, as well as standing up the official Air Force program and funding some spares and support. The bottom line here is that we don’t have a unit cost for the aircraft themselves yet and won’t until the USAF reaches a firm deal with Boeing. So that dollar figure clearly provides some wiggle room. F-15C’s wing is removed during depot maintenance. The F-15C/D fleet is rapidly aging and large sums of money will have to be funneled into the decades old airframes in the coming decade to keep them flying as planned.  , USAF With the F-15X’s inclusion in the budget came a whole new attitude toward buying any fighter but the F-35 from USAF officials. The message was clear—the days of the official DoD party line of “F-35 or nothing” are over. Major concessions about affordability and the need for a mixed force to claw back readiness and affordability are now spoken openly by Air Force officials. There is finally room for a balanced fight force procurement concept now. It’s a rare, but promising glimmer of logic and realistic decision making by the USAF brass that seems to have been living in wonderland for nearly two decades when it comes to fighter procurement and force structure planning. But still, the USAF is buying 48 F-35s in 2020 and that airframe will continue to be the unchallenged focus of the tactical fighter procurement equation for many years to come. Regardless of the fine details and the fact that the USAF has taken an about face when it comes to procuring an aircraft like the F-15X alongside the F-35—even if it is only to equip units already flying the aging F-15C/D that weren’t slated to get the F-35 anyway—Congress still has to approve of the deal. This may not be easy as there is already a group of lawmakers that have deep special interest ties to the F-35 that are already opposing the relatively humble acquisition . I am still working on a deep analysis piece that looks at the alternatives to the F-15X and gives an opinion on if the USAF should proceed with procuring it. It should be published soon, so stay tuned for that. Moving on to the Navy, one unique item in today’s budget materials was the inclusion of acquiring 22 F-5E/Fs Tiger IIs from the Swiss Air Force to fulfill fleet adversary support duties. The 44 F-5N/Fs that are currently flying with two US Navy and one Marine adversary squadrons came from surplus Swiss Air Force stocks. The delivery and refurbishment of those jets wrapped up roughly a decade ago and the fleet continues to age while demand for its services continue to rise. F-5N, USN Some of this demand is being offset by employing private contractors for adversary support duties, but the Navy will still have to shore up its F-5 force unless it plans on retiring the type as a whole in the future. Currently, the F-5 offers an incredibly economic and proven solution for a range of threat presentations, so if they were replaced with another type, it would likely come at a significant cost increase, not just in terms of acquisition, but especially in terms of operation and sustainment costs. That’s why it’s not surprising that the Pentagon is opting to take another 22 F-5s off Switzerland’s hands and have Northrop Grumman’s St. Augustine facility refurbish them so that they can provide years of aggressor support duty. In fact, the Navy may have had its hand forced to some degree when it came to snapping up those planes as private contractors are gobbling up viable and economical surplus fighter jet airframes available on the international market at a startling pace as the demand for such services balloons . Considering that TacAir just won the Navy’s own ‘4th generation’ adversary contract by proposing upgraded, but economical F-5s surely has made the type even more attractive to the major players in the commercial adversary support marketplace. You can and should read all about that landmark deal here. In other words, if the Navy waited to acquire the Swiss Tiger IIs, they may not have been available at all. It remains unclear exactly how the Navy will distribute these airframes once they are reassembled and refreshed back in the states. They could augment existing F-5 units to help increase capacity and spread flight hours over a larger pool of planes to allow the fleet to last longer as a whole, or they could end up being part of a new adversary unit structure. The official budget summary doesn’t give us much to work on, stating: The Department is procuring F-5E/F aircraft from the government of Switzerland in support of the USN and USMC adversary requirements. The F-5 is an agile, highly maneuverable, reliable supersonic fighter, combining advanced aerodynamic design, engine performance and low operating costs. But the Marines have already made it clear that they are looking to add roughly two dozen F-5s to their ranks and spreading those jets in small groups at training bases around the U.S. to support the rapidly increasing demand for air-to-air training. USN In the past, the Harriers that some of the F-35Bs will replace had only a defensive air-to-air role, with just the AV-8B+ jets gaining the ability to employ AIM-120 AMRAAMs this decade. Marine Legacy Hornet units also had concentrated heavily on their air to ground mission over the last decade and a half of the Global War On Terror, and Corps’ aging Hornets don’t represent cutting-edge in air-to-air capability anymore as it is. The F-35B/C fleet with its advanced sensor fusion and stealth, on the other hand, has an insatiable thirst for aerial bad guys in order to challenge its pilots. Even some of the best Hornets now slated to stay in the USMC’s ranks will be getting advanced active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars that will require more adversary capacity to develop pilots’ air-to-air skills. On top of this, with the Pentagon’s refocusing on peer-state warfare, air-to-air training is becoming a much higher priority than it was in the past. Hence the need for both organic and contracted aircraft to satisfy this demand. So, with all this in mind, grabbing the Swiss Air Force’s unwanted F-5s makes nothing but sense, regardless of how convenient the timing of their acquisition is, fiscally speaking. Yet the cost for the jets, and probably a bunch of parts and accessories that go with them, is just under one third the cost of a single F-35C, clocking in at $39,676,000. This equals roughly $1.8M per plane if you just divide the total across the number of the jets alone. In fact, just flying them back to the U.S. will be a comparatively substantial bill. Last time, the Swiss F-5s trickled across the Atlantic stuffed in the cargo holds of Navy and Marine Corps KC-130Ts! It will be interesting is seeing if these jets get major avionics upgrades along with their structural refurbishment. Maybe the Navy will just go with the off-the-shelf option that TacAir has developed, one that is open architecture and will allow for the installation of new sensors and advanced radars with relative ease. Giving the Navy’s aggressor F-5s new sensors—like a modern radar and bolt-on IRST —and capabilities like helmet mounted sights will go a long way to keeping them relevant for the years to come. We will know more about these acquisitions and so much more once we can actually review the line item details closely. Those have not been published yet, but when they do, you we will probably have a lot more to report on in regards to the Pentagon’s wishlist for fiscal year 2020.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 2, 2019",CIA Linked Plane Makes Brief Trip To Venezuela As American Diplomats Evacuate,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Lockheed L-100-30 cargo aircraft linked to the Central Intelligence Agency appears to have landed in Venezuela’s capital Caracas amid an increasingly severe political and economic crisis that threatens to bring down the regime of President Nicolas Maduro . The aircraft’s arrival follows U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s decision to withdraw all remaining American diplomatic personnel from the country, raising concerns that the United States may be preparing for a military intervention on behalf of Juan Guaido, the President of the country’s National Assembly, who has challenged Maduro’s authority. Individuals online using flight tracking software first noticed the L-100-30, a civilian variant of the C-130 Hercules , which carries the U.S. civil registration code N3867X, heading out into the Caribbean Sea around 8:00 AM Eastern Standard Time. Two and half hours later, the plane began descending toward Caracas. The aircraft had left Venezuela by around 1:20 PM. N3867X’s registration is tied to an entity called T3D&H LLC, based Wilmington, Delaware, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). T3D&H is widely understood to be a front for Florida-headquartered Tepper Aviation , which has long-standing ties to the CIA. In 1989, media reports said that Tepper had become involved in the Agency’s efforts to support rebels in Angola, commonly referred to by their group’s Portuguese acronym UNITA , as well as taking part in transporting cargo linked to the Iran-Contra scandal . That same year, another one of the company’s L-100s, N9205T, crashed in Angola , killing Bud Petty, the firm’s owner at the time, as well as another American, two West Germans, a British national, and multiple UNITA members. The aircraft was reportedly also carrying a shipment of weapons at the time. More recently, media reports have linked Tepper to the U.S. government’s extraordinary rendition program . FAA records show that T3D&H only officially took ownership of N3867X specifically in 2006, after acquiring it from South Africa’s Safair . What the plane, which presently flies in an overall light gray scheme with virtually no markings, was doing in Venezuela is unclear. At the time of writing, the Central Intelligence Agency has not yet responded to our queries about the flight. One possibility is that the aircraft could have been supporting the departure of American personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Caracas. “The U.S. will withdraw all remaining personnel from @usembassyve this week,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Tweeted out late on Mar. 11, 2019. “This decision reflects the deteriorating situation in #Venezuela as well as the conclusion that the presence of U.S. diplomatic staff at the embassy has become a constraint on U.S. policy.” At 1:30 PM on Mar. 14, 2019, as N3867X headed away from Venezuela, Pompeo Tweeted out again that all American diplomatic staff had left the country. There had also been an indication that the U.S. government had hired a Boeing 737 belonging to Kalitta Charters for this purpose. This same plane, with the US registration code N331CK, had retrieved U.S. diplomatic personnel from Moscow in 2018 in the aftermath of the Russian attempt to assassinate former intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom with a nerve agent. The CIA has historically operated from within American diplomatic sites or from facilities relatively close by . Regardless, the Agency could be withdrawing its own staff, or a portion thereof, to coincide with the State Department’s decision. At present, State remains the lead agency responsible for determining the risks to all U.S. government personnel and other nationals in Venezuela, something you can read about in more depth here . The other possibility is that the CIA could be bringing in additional personnel, equipment, and supplies to bolster its own presence in the country.  A combination of poorly maintained infrastructure and sanctions led to a major nation-wide blackout that resulted in looting, a further erosion of basic services in the country, and numerous deaths . Any American facilities in the country would have their own backup power supplies, but would need fuel to power those generators. The CIA could also have determined there was a need for additional security at any sites it is still operating, especially with the departure of State’s personnel. Still, it would be hard for the Agency to continue its activities at all without diplomatic cover. This, combined with the exact timing of the Tepper Aviation flight, much more strongly suggests that the plane’s presence was related to withdrawing CIA personnel and assets, not inserting them. But whatever N3867X was doing in Venezuela, it trip is certain to turn heads both in that country and elsewhere. On Feb. 7, 2019, Venezuelan authorities claimed they had seized a shipment of weapons and other equipment that had come into the city of Valencia, situated less than 100 miles west of Caracas, on a Boeing 767, with the U.S. civil registration code N881YV, from Miami. There is no hard evidence that the guns and other items were actually on this aircraft. North Carolina-headquartered 21 Air, which owns the plane, as well as GPS-Air, the company that chartered the aircraft, both subsequently denied being aware of any such cargo on board, oddly phrased statements that have only prompted more speculation about the incident. It’s worth noting that 21 Air’s chairman, as well as its director of quality control, have ties to a separate firm known as Gemini Air Cargo, according to a report from McClatchy . Like Tepper Aviation, advocacy groups have linked Gemini to the CIA and the U.S. government’s extraordinary rendition program. What’s even more curious is that records from online flight trackers show that N881YV only began making regular flights to Valencia in January 2019 and that these activities stopped, at least according to publicly available information , immediately after the purported discovery of the weapons shipment the next month. GPS-Air was the only company chartering the plane to fly to Venezula in this period, according to statements that 21 Air gave to McClatchy . Even more bizarre, 21 Air’s second aircraft, another Boeing 767 with the registration N999YV, appeared on the Dutch island of Curaçao, where the U.S. military also has a forward operating location , on Feb. 21, 2019, reportedly taking on humanitarian aid bound for Venezuela. But there’s no record in multiple flight tracking databases that this plane was ever there, according to Canada-based independent plane and ship watcher Steffan Watkins , who has been researching these flights in depth and keeping close tabs on the general situation. In fact, he’s found that there’s no record of this plane flying anywhere recently. Of course, none of this is hard evidence of CIA-linked activities aimed at unseating Maduro or otherwise helping Gauido officially assume power in Venezuela. Even before the opposition leader declared himself Interim President and received formal recognition from the United States and numerous countries in South America, Maduro had routinely accused the U.S. government, and the CIA specifically, without offering any proof, of seeking to undermine and overthrow his regime. Maduro notably blamed the United States, as well as Colombia, for an assassination attempt involving a pair of  explosive laden drones in August 2018. He also said that “high-tech” capabilities that “only the U.S. government has in the world,” a likely reference to reported American cyber warfare tools, were responsible for bringing down the country’s electricity grid. The United States has categorically denied being involved in either the assassination attempt or the blackout. Since the crisis of leadership between Maduro and Guaido erupted in January 2019, there has also been no shortage of curious aviation activities in Venezuela and elsewhere in the region, as countries conduct shuttle diplomacy and private companies and other interests look to secure their assets and personnel. There have been numerous reports that Maduro has been trying to sell off large amounts of gold from the country’s national reserves to keep bank rolling his regime amid increasing international pressure, or just simply for his own personal enrichment. But the activities of 21 Air’s 767s, and now the appearance of the Tepper Aviation L-100-30, do come amid mounting concerns that the United States is moving closer to launching an armed intervention into Venezuela. Though it was not clear initially that this was the case, it has become obvious that, since February 2019, U.S. Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint spy planes have been monitoring at least some portion of Venezuela while flying orbits off the northeastern coast of the country with increasing regularity. At least one U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II has flown in the same area. The RC-135V/Ws and EP-3Es are both capable signals intelligence platforms capable of detecting and geo-locating various “emitters,” such as radios and radars, and intercepting those transmissions. This allows the aircraft to collect and analyze communications chatter, as well as help build a so-called “ electronic order of battle ” of enemy air defenses based on the position of radars and other assets. You can read more about the capabilities of these planes in depth here and here . Pompeo’s comment that the continued presence of American diplomatic personnel was a “constraint” on American policy could indicate that keeping the U.S. Embassy open was seen as adding unnecessary risks to potential military operations. Venezuela security forces might have sought to seize the Embassy compound and take Americans hostages to stymie any intervention. The State Department has now said that it will hold Maduro and security forces loyal to him personally responsible for the safety of any American citizens still in the country. A satellite image of the US Embassy compound in Caracas., Google Earth In January 2019, National Security Advisor John Bolton had stoked similar fears about an impending military operation when reporters noticed him carrying a pad of paper with the note “5,000 troops to Colombia.” It remains unclear what this note was referring to at all. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to appoint Elliott Abrams as U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela has only prompted more speculation. As Assistant Secretary of State, Abrams was directly involved in controversial American activities in Latin America during the 1980s and was also convicted of crimes relating to the Iran-Contra Scandal. President George H.W. Bush later pardoned him. On Mar. 12, 2019, Abrams told reporters that “all options” remained on the table for how the U.S. government might proceed in regards to the crisis in Venezuela. At the same time, the extent of clear U.S. military activities related to the crisis in Venezuela has been intelligence gathering and the use of Air Force transport planes to deliver humanitarian aid to staging sites in neighboring Colombia. There has been no clear evidence any major American troop build up linked to an actual military intervention. US military personnel unload humanitarian aid from an Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft in Cucuta, Colombia in February 2019., USAF It remains to be seen whether N3867X’s sudden appearance in the country, or the departure of the remaining State Department personnel, is any indicator that American policy might be shifting in a new direction. We will definitely be keeping an eye out for any new developments. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 21, 2019",U.S. Special Operators Are Getting New Sniper Rifles For The Second Time In Six Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. military special operations forces are set to get new bolt-action Barrett Multi-Role Adaptive Design sniper rifles, or MRADs, which operators can readily reconfigure to fire any of three different calibers depending on the mission requirements. The new weapons will help U.S. Special Operations Command streamline its sniper rifle inventories and expand its capabilities, but comes less than six years after a previous contract for entirely different guns that was supposed to meet many of the same basic goals. The Pentagon first announced Barrett had received the contract for Advanced Sniper Rifles (ASR), with an estimated value of up to almost $50 million over five years, in its daily contracting announcement on Mar. 11, 2019 . The Tennessee-headquartered gunmaker subsequently confirmed it had gotten the deal and that the MRAD was the weapon in question in a press release posted on Mar. 12, 2019 . “The United States Department of Defense announced today that Barrett has been selected to provide their MRAD as the U.S. Special Operations Command Advanced Sniper Rifle system, designated as Mk 21,” the company’s statement said . “This marks the first time in history that a father and son have had rifle designs adopted by the US military: Ronnie Barrett with M107 and Chris Barrett with Mk 21.” Barrett is best known for its iconic .50 caliber M82 and M107 rifles , which have been in service across the U.S. military since the 1980s. The company now makes a variety of bolt-action, semi-automatic, and select-fire rifles, including its own derivatives of the ubiquitous AR-15/M16 family , as well as belt-fed machine guns . https://youtube.com/watch?v=yCVqf4Spq18 It is not clear from Barrett’s statement or from the Pentagon announcement what the exact configuration of the Mk 21 version of the MRAD will be. Since unveiling the rifle publicly in 2010, the company has offered it with a variety of different barrels, ranging in length from 20 to 27 inches. All of these can accept various different muzzle devices, including those that work with quick-detach suppressors. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has only released limited details about its requirements for the ASR since publicly announcing the program in late 2017 . The main requirement was for an individual to be able to rapidly and easily swap out a limited number of parts in order to convert the rifle to fire any one of three calibers – 7.62x51mm NATO, .300 Norma Magnum , and .338 Norma Magnum – as necessary. This eliminates the need for separate weapons to fire each of these rounds, offering special operations units added operational flexibility and reducing strain on the logistics and maintenance chains. An MRAD rifle in one of its many configurations., Barrett SOCOM also said that it wanted the rifles specifically to give snipers the ability to target opponents at ranges beyond 1,640 yards. The .300 and .338 Norma Magnum cartridges will help close the range gap between existing bolt-action sniper rifles in 7.62x51mm and .300 Winchester Magnum and larger .50 caliber anti-materiel rifles, such as Barrett’s own M107. The ASR is primarily slated to replace the remaining variants of the Mk 13 rifle family , which are derivatives of the Remington 700 in .300 Winchester Magnum. Being able to use older stocks of 7.62x51mm ammunition would allow snipers to readily use the rifles for low-cost training at shorter ranges. A Marine Corps sniper holds a Mk 13 Mod 7 rifle. This service is in the process of replacing its M40A6 rifles with these guns, which have been the primary arm of SOCOM snipers for years now., USMC The MRAD certainly meets SOCOM’s requirements. As its name implies, Barrett designed it from the outset to be able to accommodate a wide variety of different ammunition types. The company presently offers it commercially in any of eight different calibers, including the three SOCOM requested. In February 2019, Barrett won a separate contract from the U.S. Department of Defense for MRADs in a fourth caliber, .300 Precision Rifle Cartridge (PRC). It remains unclear who will receive these rifles, but this purchase appears to be entirely unrelated to SOCOM’s ASR program. The MRAD’s modular “adaptive” design also allows for the rapid removal of the trigger assembly for easy cleaning or replacement with another module altogether. This streamlines maintenance and also means that an armorer could install trigger packs with different characteristics, such as changes in the weight or length of the trigger pull, which better meet a shooter’s preferences or their mission requirements. The MRAD also has an accessory rail running the full length of the top of the rifle, as well as additional accessory attachment points on the side, for day and night vision optics, thermal imagers, and other accessories. But the purchase of the Barrett rifles raises questions about performance, or lack thereof, of rifles that SOCOM began purchasing in 2013 under an earlier program known as the Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR). That effort began four years earlier and called for a rifle that could accurately engage targets between 330 and 1,640 yards and could swap quickly between 7.62x51mm, .300 Winchester Magnum, and .338 Lapua Magnum . Remington won this competition with their Modular Sniper Rifle (MSR), a derivative of the 7.62x51mm M2010 sniper rifle the company had developed for the U.S. Army. Among the rifles that lost out was the MRAD, which Barrett had originally developed specifically for the competition. Remington’s MSR rifle, Wikimedia At the time, SOCOM confusingly announced that Remington’s rifle would also be designated the Mk 21. Though not unheard of, it is extremely rare for two completely distinct rifles to share the same base designation. The PSR contract was also supposed to include work through 2023, but there has been very little discussion about the introduction and use of these rifles since Remington won the deal. In 2015, SOCOM almost zeroed out the fifth delivery order – cutting more than $4.8 million from the option, which was originally worth less than $5.1 million – without offering a public explanation. There have been no other contract actions relating to the PSR deal since then, according to the Federal Procurement Data System . In 2018, U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Mark Owens, the Program Manager for Ammo and Weapons within SOCOM’s Program Executive Office for Special Operations Forces Warrior, made no mention of the PSR program whatsoever in a briefing he gave at the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference. The same presentation said that special operations forces would continue to use the existing Mk 13 rifles until they got phased out in favor of the new ASRs. This slide from US Army Lieutenant Colonel Mark Owens’ 2018 briefing makes no mention of the PSR program at all., SOCOM So, it remains to be seen whether the new Barrett Mk 21 rifles will supplement or outright replace the Remington Mk 21s. Depending on how many of the latter rifles SOCOM actually accepted delivery of as part the PSR program, it may be easy for the new ASRs to supplant them entirely. Whatever the case, the Barrett rifles will definitely give special operators more options and the ability to engage targets out to longer ranges and with greater precision over their older Mk 13 rifles.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 10, 2019",Japan Buying Joint Strike Missiles For Its F-35As Is A Much Bigger Deal Than It Sounds,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was recently announced that Norway’s Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace and Japan’s Ministry Of Defense have inked a deal to procure the first of what is likely to become a robust stockpile of Joint Strike Missiles (JSM). The cruise missile fits inside the confines of the F-35A’s internal weapons bays, and clearly, they are being bought with Japan’s F-35As in mind, but the acquisition gives its military far more capability than just a new anti-ship missile and it is yet another sign of Japan’s morphing military and strategic posture. The JSM is based on Naval Strike Missile (NSM) and was developed in partnership with Raytheon. The JSM has a top range of roughly 350 miles and a low altitude penetration range of about half that. It carries a 500lb warhead and is guided by a navigation suite that includes GPS, INS, and terrain mapping—the latter of which will help out greatly in GPS denied environments. JSM has an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker for extremely precise terminal homing. Kongsberg Defense describes how the missile’s targeting and terminal homing function works as such: “The JSM features sophisticated target acquisition with Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) facilitated by an imaging infrared seeker. Advanced recognition algorithms provide capability to identify targets to ship class and prevent attack of white/neutral shipping. There is a 100% confidence in separation of “white”and “red” shipping. The JSM mission planning system incorporates a national database with a library of potential targets. A sub-set of the target library is down-loaded to the JSM prior to launch. For each target class in the data base there will be a set of recognition characteristics, a default aim point position together with a corresponding warhead fuze profile, and default missile end-game tactics. Prior to launch, the operator may inspect and modify the end-game tactics and aim point. Kongsberg will provide customers with a software application package and training for target library development.” JSM seen during fit checks inside an F-35A’s weapons bay. , Raytheon It also has a two-way data-link for connectivity throughout its mission, allowing for the launch aircraft to keep tabs on its progress, abort its mission, or even retarget the missile in-flight. JSM is built to be very maneuverable and to be able fly a round-about path to its target in complex littoral environments in order to give it the best chance at surviving. All of this is packed into a stealthy and highly agile airframe that can be slung under the wings of just about any tactical jet or packed into the F-35’s weapons bays. So, we are talking about an incredibly flexible, near dream-like weapon here. But the most intriguing part of all is that it isn’t just an anti-ship cruise missile—it is also fully capable of attacking targets on land. Let me put that another way—Japan is arming itself with a very capable land attack cruise missile that can be fired from its most advanced warplane. F-16C from Edwards AFB flies with a test JSM under its wing., USAF Japan has never fielded a land attack capable cruise missile. Some would heavily argue that doing so goes against Article VI of its constitution. But the way Article IV is being looked at is rapidly changing within the Japanese political apparatus. Japan is shedding its passive, inward looking, self-defense oriented military posture for a new expeditionary and outward looking one. Maybe the biggest sign of this is the fact that the Japanese MoD has admitted that their Izumo class aircraft carriers are just that, aircraft carriers, not ‘helicopter carrying destroyers,’ by purchasing 42 F-35Bs to fill their decks. Not since World War II has Japan fielded a flattop with fixed-wing aircraft capability. Raytheon Japan has always been concerned with defending its island territory from naval attack. Part of this strategy has meant fielding fighter aircraft capable of delivering standoff strikes against naval targets with anti-ship cruise missiles has been a top priority. But, in the past, the tactical applications of Japan’s cruise missiles ended at the sea. With threats from North Korea, China, and even Russia growing, being able to strike targets on land via tactical aircraft at standoff distances is taking on a whole new imperative, especially as those foes’ anti-access capabilities, including advanced long-range air defenses, grow. JSM gives Japan the ability for its launch platform, the stealthy F-35A, and the missile itself, to penetrate deep into contested territory. Together, the F-35A—of which Japan plans on acquire at total of 105 at this time—and JSM combo allow for Japan to strike targets over a range of nearly 1,000 miles without refueling, and about 750 miles with the JSM flying its most stealthy low-level infiltration profile. This means that theoretically , this weapons combo could hit targets from Japanese territory as far away as Beijing, Hong Kong, and anywhere in North Korea, but it’s more accurate to figure it could put targets at risk over 150 miles inland from any coastline within the aircraft’s 600 mile combat radius. The JSM is most adept at hitting targets in the most challenging geographical environments, the so called ‘brown water’ areas—the complex littorals where land and sea meet. Yet when it comes to an anti-ship capability, its F-35A launch ship does it a lot of favors. It can penetrate closer to areas where enemy flotillas may be operating without being detected and pinpoint ships using its advanced sensors and information from third party sensors piped into its cockpit via data-link. It can then send the JSM on its way to do the most dangerous work, attacking the actual ships, which may be highly defended by air-warfare destroyers and cruisers or even carrier-based fighters. JSMs will also likely be carried by Japan’s F-35Bs once they get delivered and begin working off of the country’s refitted Izumo class carriers. In that case, they will have to be carried externally as the F-35B has smaller weapons bays. But still, the F-35B has a combat radius of some 450 miles and it has the same sensor fusion capabilities its land-based A model cousin. The JSM should, at least in some cases, give the B model enough survivability even when in non-stealthy mode for it to launch the missile at a standoff distance and retreat to safer territory even when prosecuting very well defended naval targets. So, the Izumo class and its F-35Bs will bring a whole new level of anti-shipping capability as well as stand-off land attack capability, especially when it comes to pinpoint strike on things like inland air defense radars, to the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force. Don’t be surprised if this weapon finds itself on other aircraft in Japan’s arsenal as well, such as the Mitsubishi F-2, a jet whose primary role is to lug anti-shipping missiles. In fact, the JSM would be a great companion to the ASM-3 anti-ship missile that is currently in development. This is a supersonic anti-ship missile currently in the late stages of development that will equip the F-2s in the future. It has a smaller range than the JSM, but layering them in with stealthy and subsonic JSMs during an attack on a flotilla would likely have very synergistic results. ASM-3., Hunini/Wikicommons Japan’s quad jet-powered P-1 maritime patrol aircraft that is currently equipped with the AGM-84 Harpoon is another very enticing candidate for the JSM. It would give the long-range jet the ability to hit targets in more complex geographical environments, such as pinpointing and striking ships in port or even land targets. P-1., Ronnie Macdonald/wikicommons The F-15J force is another possible ‘customer’ for the JSM. We have written extensively about Japan’s increasing interest in arming the F-15s with a standoff land attack missile system. JSM offers a lot of flexibility and now commonality in that department, although there are longer-ranged weapons available that could take better advantage of the F-15s heavy hauling capabilities. Above all else, the announcement that Japan has purchased a land attack capable cruise missile not only is another sign of the country’s changing strategic posture, but also of what is to come. Will an even longer-ranged cruise missile follow, like the air-launched JASSM-ER? Or maybe the Japan’s interest in multi-role Block IV Tactical Tomahawk missiles for its Mk41 vertical launch system-equipped destroyers and even possibly its Aegis Ashore missile defense sites will turn into an acquisition program (a VLS capable JSM is also available). We also previously discussed how Japan may develop its own family of land attack cruise missiles that can be launched from air, sea, or land. Such possibilities are far more plausible now than they were before Japan decided to buy the Joint Strike Missile.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2019",The USAF’s Plans To Buy Six Aircraft As Part Of Its Never Ending Light Attack Experiment,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s top officials insist that the service’s light attack aircraft program isn’t dead yet , revealing that their new budget request includes plans to purchase six planes for two new experimental detachments. The U.S. Marine Corps is also set to formally join the program. At the same time, they have made it all but clear that the Air Force will never fly these aircraft operationally itself and that the entire effort is focused on facilitating exports to allies . Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff of the Air Force General David Goldfein offered the updates on what had most recently been known as the Light Attack Aircraft (LAA) program during a hearing in front of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Mar. 13, 2019 . This followed the rollout of the overall Department of Defense budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year the day before. The Air Force has asked for $35 million in funding for continued light attack aircraft “experimentation” as part of its research and development budget for the 2020 fiscal cycle. The service is also planning to request around $400 million in additional funding for the light attack program through the 2024 Fiscal Year, Goldfein said at the hearing. Goldfein separately told Air Force Magazine that the service would use $60 million in research and development funds left over from the 2018 Fiscal Year and $100 million in procurement money from the 2019 fiscal cycle to buy three Sierra Nevada Corporation and Embraer A-29 Super Tucanos and three Textron AT-6C Wolverine turboprop light attack aircraft. In January 2019 , the Air Force announced it had indefinitely suspended its plans for a full procurement program to purchase up to just shy of 360 turboprop light attack aircraft. Owning the aircraft will allow the Air Force to “modify them anyway we want,” Goldfein explained to Air Force Magazine . A major focus of the Air Force’s light attack effort has been on integrating an “exportable, affordable, and commercially secure tactical datalink that supports line-of-sight/beyond line-of-sight real-time information exchange between the airborne and ground units.” At the Senate hearing, Wilson said earlier phases of the service’s latest round of light attack experiments had successfully incorporated this system. The six aircraft the Air Force now wants to buy in the 2019 Fiscal Year would go new units at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada and Hurlburt Field in Florida, Goldfein explained. Nellis is one of the Air Force’s premier test and evaluation and training bases, while Hurlburt is home to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). Goldfein also confirmed that the Marines would be joining the program. For at least two years now, the Marines have a had a standing requirement for a turboprop light attack aircraft, primarily to support various support training requirements, but which might also have a secondary operational role. A page from the 2017 Marine Corps Aviation Plan outlining a concept for composite training units incorporating turboprop light attack aircraft., USMC But both Goldfein and Wilson made it clear that “allies and partners” are the main focus of the light attack program. Their language strongly implies that the service has no plans to ever operate these aircraft in combat itself, despite assertions to the contrary over the past two and half years or so and in spite of the obvious demand for this capability from American forces. “Number one, this is about allies and partners,” Goldfein said in response to a question from Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, which was what prompted him to give the additional details about the light attack effort going forward. “This about how do we get more allies and partners in with us.” “We need to get more of our allies and partners involved from the get go or it may not work.” Wilson added. It is important to note that Textron builds the T-6 Texan II-series in Kansas. Moran has been part of a prominent lobby pushing the U.S. government to buy these planes for itself and allies and partners for years , including a failed attempt to scuttle the sale of A-29s to Afghanistan. Members of the Air National Guard look at an AT-6 light attack aircraft during one of many previous evaluations of such aircraft in 2010., USAF Regardless, the Air Force response to his inquires was hardly new. We at The War Zone have repeatedly highlighted the Air Force’s focus on international cooperation and potential exports in its most recent series of light attack experiments, which began in 2017 . It’s certainly fair to say that allies and partners often look to jump on programs the U.S. military has set up for itself first. Foreign countries piggy-backing on American defense procurement programs helps increase economies of scale and drive down costs all around, too. However, Goldfein’s response to Moran’s questioning, which simply regurgitated a host of previous arguments that simply do not hold water, something I have explored in detail previously , did not offer any new evidence for why the Air Force, or the U.S. military at large, needs a new budgetary vehicle for this sort of military cooperation. In fact, it did quite the opposite. In his testimony, the Air Force’s top officer specifically name-checked the Philippines and Nigeria as examples of countries that could be interested in the light attack effort, but declined to mention that both of them are already purchasing A-29s. The Nigerian Air Force is even getting their aircraft via the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. Goldfein also did not say why there was a need to establish two new detachments to experiment with the A-29 and AT-6C when his service already has conventional and special operations units tasked, in full or in part, with training foreign partners on light attack aircraft. The Air Education and Training Command’s (AETC) 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force base already has a fleet of A-29s dedicated to this specific purpose. One of the 81st Fighter Squadron’s A-29 Super Tucanos., USAF The squadron’s personnel have been expanding their knowledge base on the light attack and security cooperation missions, incorporating lessons learned from training Afghan and Lebanese pilots, since 2014. “The squadron is the only combat mission ready fighter squadron in AETC,” the unit’s official webpage declares . In addition, Hurlburt, where Goldfein says one of the new detachments will go, is already home to both the 492nd Special Operations Wing , previously known as the Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center, too. This is AFSOC’s premier training and development unit, which has employed light attack and light utility aircraft as part of courses preparing personnel for deployments that involve working with foreign partners. The 6th Special Operations Squadron at nearby Duke Field in Florida is also dedicated to advising and assisting foreign allies and partners, including in the employment of light attack aircraft. Just in February 2019, U.S. Air Force Captain Cole Geldernick, a Combat Aviation Advisor Air Liaison Officer from the 6th, received an award for setting up a program to train American special operations forces on how to work with the AC-208 Eliminator turboprop light attack aircraft. An undated photo of U.S. Air Force Captain Cole Geldernick in Lebanon., USAF The AC-208 itself is another example that calls into question why the Air Force’s internationally focused light attack effort is even necessary. The U.S. military has already facilitated the delivery of AC-208s to Lebanon, where Geldernick was deployed at the time, and Iraq. The United States also expects to help deliver these planes to Afghanistan in the near future . An AC-208 Eliminator., Orbital ATK/Northrop Grumman None of this takes into account the various previous light attack test and evaluation programs that the Air Force and its sister services have conducted since 2007 . The idea that the Air Force needs new planes and new units in order to further explore the light attack concept, for its own use or in order to support allies and partners, is almost impossible to believe. Even if this is true, as described now, the service’s light attack effort is duplicative of existing lines of effort and risks wasting money that it could use for other priorities – including establishing an actual, robust, and operational light attack fleet. Beyond all of this, the rhetoric from both Goldfein and Wilson just pointedly ignores the very real requirements and demand for light attack aircraft within the U.S. military, which have existed for decades , something you can read about in much more detail here . As The War Zone have been pointing out for years , light attack planes would offer the Air Force a cost-effective alternative to using higher-end combat jets and bombers for low-risk missions. The service has had to rely heavily on higher performance combat jets for these missions, which has had a visibly negative impact on the readiness and longevity of those fleets. Light attack aircraft also cost just a fraction per flight hour to fly and require less supporting infrastructure, which is especially valuable in austere environments. They can also persist longer over the battlefield without the necessity of expensive gas from aerial refueling tankers. The U.S. military has already demonstrated what light attack aircraft can bring to the table on multiple occasions , most notably with the deployment of a pair of heavily modified OV-10G+ Bronco aircraft to Iraq for an operational test in 2015. One of the two modified OV-10G+ Broncos., John Lequerica That the Marines, who have their own such requirement for light attack planes, are formally joining the program, only underscores this well-established demand within the U.S. military for this capability. So far, though, neither the Navy nor the Marine Corps have announced any plans so far to procure any such aircraft, either. All told, the Air Force’s light attack program might not be officially canceled, but there appears to be no plans at present for the service to fly the planes in combat itself. What the service is left with is a wholly unnecessary program to help allies do what they’re already doing while ignoring its own internal demands. In other words, the idea that there is more need for experimentation is laughable. We needed a fleet of these aircraft not just yesterday, but well over a decade ago.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 21, 2018",Marines Lay Out Plans For Their Own MQ-9 Reaper Drone Force In New Budget Request,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps is looking to buy its first ever MQ-9 Reaper drones in the 2020 fiscal year, which would significantly increase service’s organic unmanned aviation capabilities. This follows the Marines’ employment of contractor-operated MQ-9s in Afghanistan and the Corps sending personnel to train with the U.S. Air Force to fly the Reaper ahead of its plans to acquire its own large, long-endurance drone called the MUX sometime in the future. The U.S. Navy, which shares a budget with the Marine Corps, announced the plan during the rollout of its annual funding request for the 2020 Fiscal Year on Mar. 12, 2019. The proposal calls for $77 million to support the purchase of three MQ-9s, but it is unclear at present what this figure covers. The flyaway cost for a new Block 5 MQ-9 is around $20 million, according to U.S. Air Force budget documents for the 2019 Fiscal Year . The Navy plans to request an unspecified amount of funds to buy the Marines three more Reapers in Fiscal Year 2021, as well. Reapers fall into what the U.S. military refers to as “ Group 5 ” unmanned aircraft, which refer to drones with a maximum takeoff weight of 1,320 pounds or more that can fly at altitudes of 18,000 feet or higher. This the top tier, so it includes a wide variety of pilotless planes with very disparate capabilities, from the MQ-9 to the much higher flying and much longer endurance RQ-4 Global Hawk . But at present, the Marines do not have any drones more capable than “ Group 3 ,” which covers types with maximum takeoff weights between 56 and 1,319 pounds, that cannot fly higher than 18,000 feet, and that have top speeds slower than 300 miles per hour. The Corps’ most capable unmanned aircraft at present is the RQ-21A Blackjack , which weighs around 135 pounds and a maximum speed of 86 miles per hour. This puts it in Group 3, even though its service ceiling “less than 20,000 feet,” according to manufacturer Boeing Insitu . The Reapers will be able to provide a level of persistent surveillance that has proven to be extremely useful for denying terrorists, insurgents, and other armed groups the ability to operate with impunity, especially at night . In Afghanistan, where the Marines are still actively advising and assisting that country’s military and other security forces, aerial surveillance has been key to keeping the Taliban and other groups as contained as possible . But without their own Group 5 drones, the Marines have had to rely on other services, primarily the Air Force, to provide this support for its forces in places such as Afghanistan. As of January 2018, the Air Force had nearly three squadrons worth of MQ-9s at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan, making it the largest forward-deployed MQ-9 force to date. But that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily always available to the Marines in neighboring Helmand province when they might need them most. Reapers in a hangar at Kandahar Airfield., USAF The lack of a long endurance drone under direct Marine Corps’ control was what prompted the Navy to hire General Atomics, which makes the Reaper, to supply a single “orbit” of these drones to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support over Marines in Afghanistan’s southern Helmand province in June 2018. The War Zone was first to report that this plan was in the works five months earlier. It’s unclear what an “orbit” consisted of in this case, but, traditionally, a standard Air Force “combat air patrol” has consisted of four Reapers. In theory, this means one drone is heading out to relieve another one already on station just as a third one is returning to base to refuel. This provides constant coverage over a particular area, with the fourth unmanned aircraft being available as a reserve in case of an accident or if one of the drones is just in need of routine maintenance. However, the Air Force has also deployed smaller numbers of Reapers to meet more limited demands in austere locations. A General Atomics-owned MQ-9, carrying a US civil registration code, prepares to take off from Miroslawiec Air Base, Poland in March 2019., USAF In addition, the contractor-operated MQ-9s would have been limited legally to conducting only unarmed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Marine-owned Reapers would be under no such restrictions and would be able to fly missions carrying various precision guided munitions . So, despite their small numbers, the Marines’ new MQ-9s would offer an important capability boost and one that is more responsive the demands of the Corps. The service has already been sending personnel to train to fly the drones with the Air Force at Randolph Air Force Base since June 2018 , which would reduce the time it would take to stand up an operational unit. In addition, if the Marines continue to make use of this joint service training pipeline, it would eliminate the need to sideline any of its own Reapers for this purpose. The Marine Corps has also previously said that just training individuals to operate the Reaper would be a valuable part of the process toward developing a more robust Group 5 drone capability. The service still has plans to eventually adopt a family of more capable unmanned aircraft as part of its Marine Air Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System Expeditionary program, or MUX, which you can read about in much more detail here . An early official graphic showing some of the possible missions and aircraft configurations the Marines have been considering for their future MUX drones., USMC The Marines are pushing ahead with MUX, despite the fact that Congress approved less than half of the funding the Navy had initially requested for the program in the 2019 Fiscal Year. Legislators had expressed concerns that the Marine Corps was insufficiently prepared to quickly adopt a new and complex fleet of large vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aircraft. Acquiring the small force of MQ-9s first would give the service valuable experience that would also help mitigate those concerns going forward. MUX is still in the 2020 Fiscal Year budget request, as well, though we don’t know yet how much funding the Navy is asking for the program for this year. Of course, Congress will still have to approve the requests for both MUX and the Reapers before the Marines can move ahead with either.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 4, 2019","Navy’s Budget Requests Two Huge Missile-Laden Drone Ships That Displace 2,000 Tons","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy wants to buy as many as 10 Large Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessels, or LDUSVs, over the next five years at the cost of approximately $2.7 billion. These drone ships, which could be remarkably large and complex—up to 300 feet long and displacing some 2,000 tons—would be a major step forward for the service’s plans to develop unmanned surface fleets . The Navy unveiled the planned purchases as part of the rollout of the overall U.S. military budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year on Mar. 12, 2019. The 2020 Fiscal Year proposal itself includes $400 million to pay for the first two LDUSVs. The service would then ask for money to buy two more of these drone ships each fiscal year for the next four years. These drone ships “will serve as both a sensor and a shooter” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Randy B. Crites, the service’s Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Budget, said in a briefing on Mar. 12, 2019. They will be “smaller, … more attritable than conventional ships, in addition to being more affordable,” he added. The Navy is still developing its requirements for these vessels and concepts of operation (CONOPS) for it how might employ them, but has described the notional LDUSVs as longer than 164 feet in the past . Rear Admiral Crites would not say that there is firm, validated requirement for the drones ships, but did say that the Navy was presently working with a concept revolving around a hullform closer to 200 to 300 feet long with a displacement of around 2,000 tons. This would place the drone vessels in the same general size class as manned corvettes . The video below shows a concept for “medium unmanned surface vessel” that is still close in many ways to the Navy’s proposed LDUSV, with a length of approximately 164 feet and a fully loaded displacement of between 1,500 and 2,000 tons. The Navy has previously said the LDUSVs might fill the role of “ arsenal ships ” packed with stand-off missiles to provide additional firepower for a surface task force. Rear Admiral Crites said that a vertical launch system capability would be one requirement for the LDUSV. Crites comment that these ships will also be “sensors” indicates that they could also pack capable and diverse sensors suites, potentially including those not necessary found on manned ships . Doing so would offer commanders increased situational awareness across a broad front. The Navy over-arching unmanned surface vessel plan has three tiers – small , medium , and large – and the service has been very clear in the past that it expected the medium-sized types to fill the requirement for unmanned scouts operating ahead of larger surface action groups. All of these unmanned vessels will also be networked together with each other, as well as with manned vessels and other friendly forces. The Navy also expects them to be able to operate at least semi-autonomously . With this in mind, there could easily be multiple configurations of the designs in each tier. Some LDUSVs could potentially act as sensor nodes, providing targeting data for others optimized to carry the maximum number of missiles, with the drone ships acting an independent task group, as well. These are all questions the Navy will be looking to answer in the coming years. The service is asking for the initial $400 million in funding for the LDUSV program, at least, as part of its research and development budget , but it hopes to eventually transition the effort to an actual program of record before the 2024 Fiscal Year. This in many ways reflects the Navy’s general experience with the development of the smaller Sea Hunter unmanned surface vessel. That program originally began as a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) effort, but transitioned to the responsibility of the Office of Naval Research in 2018 . The service is now using it as a stepping stone toward buying its fleet of Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessels (MDUSV) and the lessons learned from operating it will surely also inform the LDUSV effort. The US Navy’s Sea Hunter unmanned surface vessel., DARPA At present, there is only one Sea Hunter, which the Navy is using to refine its requirements and CONOPS for the employment of long-endurance drone ships and especially those that can hunt and continuously track submarines. The service is also in the process of acquiring a second example to further support that research and development effort. The Fiscal Year 2020 budget proposal also includes additional funding for MDUSV program. “We’ve got to get through the details of concept of operations, command and control, how’s it going to work in a distributed environment,” Rear Admiral Crites explained regarding the future LDUSVs. “We need these test articles and we need to bring these things on quickly so we can actually see how this going to work.” In January 2019 , Navy officials separately raised the possibility of creating a dedicated experimental surface warfare squadron to help in the crafting of concepts of operations for both manned and unmanned vessels. Such a unit would be an obvious initial home for the first LDUSVs and their smaller cousins. The Navy’s budget plan for the 2020 Fiscal Year still needs Congressional approval, as will its requests going forward, which could impact the total number of large drone ships the service might buy in total or otherwise change the schedule for acquiring those vessels. For instance, the service has confirmed it wants to effectively retire the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman at least in part in order to help free up funding for developments such as unmanned surface vessels. We at The War Zone have already explored this decision in great detail and outlined why legislators are unlikely to allow it proceed, which could have an effect on final timeline for the LDUSV purchases. Still, the Navy’s desired course of action does show a serious commitment to dramatically expanding the size and scope of its unmanned surface fleets in the coming years, which could significantly change how it conducts operations in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 27, 2019",Russia Unveils Plans For Sleek High-Speed Arctic Rescue Chopper With Jet Thruster In Its Tail,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, also known by its Russian acronym TsAGI, says it is exploring concepts for a high-speed compound helicopter for rescue and light utility roles in the increasingly strategic Arctic region . The announcement also comes as the Kremlin is in the midst of a number of other projects to develop new fast-flying military rotorcraft, including gunships and transport types, which could also benefit from the institute’s new work. TsAGI announced the new research and development effort in a press release on its official website on Mar. 11, 2019. The institute said that the primary reason it was working on the new high-speed helicopter design was to support expanding civilian infrastructure , including various new oil and gas projects, in the Arctic. There is also the distinct possibility that there will be increased demands for search and rescue and medical evacuation services in this region as commercial maritime traffic increases as the period where seasonal pack ice threatens ships becomes shorter due to global climate change. Concept art of a notional high-speed helicopter that TsAGI released along with their statement shows an extremely aerodynamic design with a rigid rotorhead and what the institute says would be a small jet engine at the rear. This is a well-established general configuration for a compound helicopter , which has historically offered increased speed, range, and fuel efficiency over comparable conventional helicopters. The aviation research institute says that its goal is to develop a medical helicopter that can be on scene within 20 minutes of getting a request for assistance. That same rotorcraft should be able to ferry a patient with a life-threatening injury to a hospital within two hours. It is well-understood that the faster first responders can get a serious injured person to an established medical facility, the less likely that individual is to die or suffer serious complications. In 2015, the Russian government recieved the first of these Mil Mi-8AMTSh-VA helicopters for search and rescue missions in the Arctic region. TsAGI’s compound helicopter would be significantly faster and have greater range and fuel economy., Rostec “If we are talking about the Arctic zone with a very low population density or areas of oil and gas extraction that are very remote from the coast, then we must take into account that the maximum range of a helicopter flight can be over 1000 km [kilometers; approximately 620 miles],” Andrey Smirnov, who heads up research in the field of air transport at TsAGI, said in the press release . “All this testifies to the fact that it is impossible to do without high-speed rotary-wing aircraft.” Any high-speed rescue helicopter that meets this description and has the ability to take on various light utility roles, as well, could also been extremely important for Russia’s growing constellation of military facilities in and around the Arctic. In January 2019 , the Kremlin said that it planned to step up major military air activities in the region, which is known for extreme weather, very low temperatures, and extended periods with little or no sunlight. https://youtube.com/watch?v=RAsP1-AAcuo A dramatic crash of a Tu-22M3 Backfire bomber as it attempted to land in bad weather in January 2019 underscored many of the risks involved in flying above the Arctic Circle. Those same environmental factors would also limit the window available for a helicopter to be able to safely fly out to a remote base to deliver crucial supplies or make it back to a larger hospital with an injured individual, further highlighting the need for a high-speed, longer-range design. But TsAGI’s work on this light high-speed rotorcraft will also likely inform the development of future larger military transport and attack helicopters for use in the Arctic and elsewhere. Since at least 2008, Russian government-owned helicopter companies, primarily Mil and Kamov, have been working on faster compound helicopters for a variety of missions. The Kremlin has since grouped all of this work together under the umbrella of a program known variously as the Prospective High-Speed Helicopter or Prospective Speedy Helicopter, generally abbreviated PSV . The main goal of the PSV program is to develop a variety of new helicopter designs with top speeds between 220 and 250 miles per hour, significantly faster than existing types in Russian military service. This in many ways mirrors the U.S. military’s own search for new, high-speed rotorcraft as part of the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) and Future Vertical Lift (FVL) programs. In December 2015, Mil flew its PSV testbed, derived from the Mi-24/35 Hind gunship , for the first time. Known as the Mi-24K , not to be confused with the Cold War-era Mi-24K, the helicopter featured a more streamlined design compared to earlier Hinds. The Mil Mi-24K testbed., Timofey Nikishin It has rotor blades with curved tips, allowing for higher speed and greater stability, and the same Klimov VK-2500 turboshaft engines found in the Mi-28 Havoc and Ka-50/52 Black Shark/Alligator family. Mil said it hoped these additions, along with improved avionics and flight systems, would give the testbed a top speed close to 250 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour faster than the latest Hinds. It would also give the chopper an improved climb rate. Mil has since proposed a clean-sheet compound helicopter design, the Mil Mi-X1 , using many of these same features, as well as a rigid rotor and ducted propeller at the rear. The company also said it could serve as the basis for an unmanned rotorcraft, called the MRVK. The Russian design’s general layout to the American Piasecki X-49A Speedhawk , a compound helicopter derived from the UH-60 Black Hawk . An artist’s conception of the Mil Mi-X1., via GlobalSecurity.org Kamov has not yet flown a testbed, but it has shown a number of high-speed concepts since 2008. These include the sleek Ka-90 , a futuristic hybrid design that would fold its rotorblades into a stowed position after takeoff to fly like a normal airplane, and the portlier Ka-92 compound transport helicopter. A model of the Ka-90 concept., Vitaly Kuzmin A model of the Ka-92 compound transport helicopter., Vitaly Kuzmin In late 2018, images emerged online of another Kamov concept for a compound high speed attack helicopter.  The overall configuration featured more aircraft-like main fuselage with two large jet engines mounted at the rear together with a co-axial main rotor, along with internal weapons bays to help reduce drag. There was also a companion transport helicopter with a similar general layout. An associated presentation reportedly claimed that the design might be able to reach speeds up to 435 miles per hour, dramatically faster than existing conventional helicopters. At present, the world record top speed for a non-jet augmented compound helicopter is just under 300 miles per hour. A slide from a presentation showing the Kamov high-speed compound helicopter design that emerged in late 2018., via VK Another view of the design showing the internal weapons bays., via VK An exploded view of the conept showing the two engines linked to the main rotorshaft., via VK A general view, along with the a look at a companion transport helicopter design., via VK TsAGI is already heavily involved with both the Mil and Kamov projects. In November 2018 , the institute announced that it had developed further improved rotor blades for Mil as part of its PSV work. That same month , it announced it would collaborate with Kamov to develop its own high-speed testbed based on the Ka-52 helicopter. Still, it remains to be seen how far any of the more ambitious projects, especially Kamov’s fighter jet-like rotorcraft concept, might progress. Russia’s overall defense budget has been contracting in recent years under the weight of a stagnant economy and international sanctions over the Kremlin’s involvement in conflicts in Ukraine and Syria , among others . As of February 2018 , the PSV program was still in Russia’s future defense plans. At the same time, the research and development work the project has been conducting could provide a path to more cost-effective upgrades to existing helicopters. If new rotor blades and engines can offer major performance upgrades for helicopter such as the Mi-24/35 Hind, there simply may not be the same impetus to purchase all-new rotorocraft. Just in March 2019 , the Russian Ministry of Defense announced it would move ahead with plans for a major upgrade of the Hinds to the Mi-35MV standard, which includes new engines, as well as upgrades to the helicopter’s sensor and targeting suite, additional armor, and the President-S directional infrared countermeasures system. The Russian military is also slated to begin receiving new Mi-38T transport helicopters as a replacement for older Mi-8 and Mi-17 types in 2019. Again, these could be prime candidates for future upgrades based on developments from the PSV in lieu of adopting yet another new rotorcraft type. A pre-production Mi-38-2 helicopter in 2011., Alex Snow via Wikimedia The Kremlin could also look into compound conversions of existing helicopter types, based on design work TsAGI and others have done, as an easier and cheaper alternative to a clean-sheet design. Boeing is similarly developing a compound derivative of the AH-64 Apache gunship for existing customers, such as the U.S. Army, which promises a top speed of more than 250 miles per hour and significant improvements in range and fuel economy. Squeezing additional speed out of existing helicopter designs still doesn’t truly meet Russia’s established requirements for long-range, high-speed helicopters, especially to perform critical missions in the Arctic. At the same time, despite budgetary constraints, the Kremlin has rightly decided that this region is of immense strategic significance and it is using what resources it does have to bolster its force posture there . This could help drive the continued development of at least one high-speed design, especially one capable of performing multiple missions. All told, TsAGI’s latest announcement shows that Russia has a clear demand for high-speed helicopters, in the Arctic region and elsewhere, and that interest in various compound helicopter concepts remains high. But at the end of the day, the cash-strapped Kremlin may still have to settle for a less extensive fleet of new, advanced rotorcraft.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 2, 2020",SUV Plows Into Median Barrier Just As Presidential Motorcade Passes In Opposite Direction (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the Presidential Motorcade was traveling near Opelika, Alabama on I85, an SUV traveling in the other direction slammed into a highway median barrier just as the core of the procession was passing in the opposite direction. It is not clear at this time exactly what caused the motorist to steer into the motorcade at that exact moment, but it does seem awfully suspicious. President Trump was in Alabama to visit the site of a powerful tornado that did major damage to the town of Beauregard and claimed 23 lives. Although the Secret Service and local law enforcement clear the route the motorcade will travel on, the oncoming traffic that is separated by an open patch of grass for this stretch of the I85 appears to have been moving along unimpeded. Thankfully, the barrier between the two roadways worked and the SUV, a Jeep Liberty, was stopped from continuing on its path that seemed as if it would have taken it careened right into the heart of the motorcade if it was left to its own devices. We don’t know if this was a malicious act, a case of distracted driving, or some other bizarre coincidence, but it highlights just how quickly things can go from nominal to emergency for the technology-laden Secret Service agents tasked with making sure the President makes it to his destination safely. Even with all the preparation, these types of surprise events aren’t all that uncommon . They seem to happen so fast that even a barrage of hastily aimed bullets may have a hard time stopping the threat in time if it is truly of a malicious nature. Hence the need for an ever more heavily armored, cacoon-like limousine to chauffeur the President around. In the end, the passive protective measures afforded by the Presidential Limousine are there to thwart even the most unforeseen, fastest moving, and undefendable threats.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 15, 2018",Blue Angels To Get 18 Early Production Super Hornets And Revised Routine For 2021 Season,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy is hard at work preparing the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, aka The Blue Angels, to transition from legacy F/A-18 Hornets to Super Hornets. With a new mount comes a lot of work and planning, as well as some significant changes to the Blue Angels iconic routine and to the ‘new’ aircraft themselves. The transition, which will occur between the end of a shortened 2020 season and the beginning of a shortened 2021 season, will include providing the team with a whopping 18 Super Hornets. All of these jets will be low-rate initial production (LRIP) units—among the oldest around—that are not equipped for front line combat and are presently either in storage or being used as trainers or test airframes. Beyond the blue and gold paint and the smoke systems, there are a series of other modifications that will be made to the jets. According to Naval Aviation News , which is an official Navy publication, the Super Hornet’s computers will also be modified to help their pilots as they perform their demo routines and to reduce their cockpit task load overall for the unique mission set. F/A-18F climbing out with Mt. Rainier in the background. , Tyler Rogoway/Author The changes don’t stop there. While a transition team is hard at work in the simulator figuring out the Super Hornet version of the Blue Angels’ routine, replicating dramatic spectacle itself is not the only focus of the initiative. The new routine will be built around the Super Hornet’s attributes and limitations. It will also be designed to reduce risk and lower airframe fatigue. Naval Aviation Times writes: “While the differences may not impact the way the fleet employs the aircraft, the differences are important when it comes to designing a demonstration that’s, first and foremost, safe, but also exciting,” Bernacchi said. “The big takeaway is that every aircraft is different,” Weisser said. Those differences include the lift and drag, thrust-to-weight ratios and roll rates. “Some areas are more restrictive. For example, the Hornet can fly up to 60 seconds inverted while the Super Hornet has been cleared to fly 40 seconds thus far. Using the Manned Flight Simulator, we have figured out how to reduce the inverted durations for the show while preserving the quality of the maneuvers,” Bernacchi said. In many other ways, the Super Hornet offers improved performance—it has more thrust available, especially at low altitudes, enabling tighter turns and faster acceleration for some maneuvers, and better vertical and looping performance, Weisser said. In addition, the Super Hornet will significantly improve reliability and efficiency as the squadron travels throughout the country—historically to about 33 cities per year. These attributes make international venues beyond North America viable as well. Tyler Rogoway/Author Another big change will be a shorter demonstration overall. The full show currently runs 42 minutes and 30 minutes for the ‘low show’ where low cloud cover is present. These times will be reduced to an as yet to be decided duration. Supposedly, this was at the request of the air show industry, but also a major factor in limiting pilot fatigue and the wear and tear on the already far from new airframes: A multi-month collaborative study with NAVAIR engineers has allowed the transition team to understand where the current demonstration puts the most strain on the airframes and has helped them develop ways to reduce the strain while preserving the visual appeal of specific maneuvers. The net effect has been dramatic reduction in overall “stress” put on the airframes in the six pilot positions and is expected to allow the Navy to fly each airframe up to or possibly even beyond the 6,000 flight-hour design specification, Bernacchi said. “All of this is designed to create a safe, sustainable, efficient Super Hornet era. We expect the Super Hornet will be an incredible platform for the Blue Angels. It is going to be exciting to watch, and I expect it to significantly magnify the Blues’ mission impact all across the country and internationally as well,” Bernacchi said. F/A-18E executed a dirty roll upon takeoff. , Tyler Rogoway/Author The move to 18 aircraft is substantial. Today, the Blue Angels have roughly two thirds that amount of Legacy Hornets in their stable. The cost of conversion, just in terms of necessary modifications alone to the 18 jets, isn’t cheap. It cost $24M to design the kit needed to turn a Super Hornet into a Blue Angel jet, with another $17M for procuring those kits, and another $2.7M per jet to install them and paint the aircraft in the team’s glossy blue and gold motif. So, all in we are talking at least $89.6M in hard costs alone for the transition. The extra expense of retraining ground crews and pilots and developing all the new procedures and the routine itself will also add up fast. As it stands now, the first two converted Super Hornets won’t go directly to the team. Instead, they will be flown by Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 (VX-23). The squadron’s test pilots and past Blue Angel pilots will put each maneuver through a validation process before it gets incorporated into the revised final routine. So the big question at this point is what will the demonstration look like in light of time cuts, airframe fatigue limitation measures, and safety-related renovations? The squadron has had its share of tragic mishaps , but the whole idea behind the routine is that it is super engaging and thrilling to watch . We can hope the Super Hornet’s larger physical presence, unique slow-speed handling qualities, and extra thrust will offset any ‘softening’ of the existing routine. Tyler Rogoway/Author Overall, it’s good to hear that the team is making use of older airframes that are of diminished use to the fleet or the expansive training and development apparatus that supports it. With 18 jets, the team will be able to spread flight hours out across its larger inventory which should go a long way when it comes to readiness and the logistical stability of the squadron as a whole. These planes are likely deep into the back half of their service lives anyway, so squeezing the most out of their remaining hours will be key. We will keep you posted as the initiative to equip the Blue Blue Angels with Super Hornets marches on. Oh, and yes , the Blue Angels are still looking to replace their aging KC-130T that flies as Fat Albert with a secondhand C-130J Super Hercules from the Royal Air Force . If that deal finally gets done, the team may end up having an all ‘super’ fleet for the 2021 season.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 15, 2019",You’ve Never Seen Photos Of Low Flying Military Planes As Up Close And Personal As This,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You’ve most likely seen sweet shots of military aircraft hurtling through the lush valleys of the United Kingdom before, but you probably haven’t set your eyes on ones as close up and personal as those we are about to show you. Aviation photographer Don Jackson-Wyatt from North Wales has mastered catching various types of jet fighters, transports, and helicopters in a startling intimate manner as they roar low above the ground at hundreds of miles an hour. His hard work has resulted in spectacularly detailed images—moments frozen in time taken through very long lenses that leave little to the imagination. Above all else, the pictures often capture the human element—literally the folks in the cockpit that are still intrinsic to making such an extreme flying spectacle a reality. Don described his passion for this unique form of aviation photography and how he makes it all happen to us, stating: “I have around 12 years of photography experience but approximately four years of capturing shots of aviation, which varies from low-level photography to night shoots, as well as press events. I don’t tend to limit myself to a set niche within aviation. I spend many hours on hills around the UK in the hope of photographing low-level aircraft, which are exhilarating when they pass by. There are a number of factors that assist in capturing a detailed close up shot of various aircraft under these unique circumstances, firstly is equipment. Long focal reach combined with a large sensor in the camera is a great help towards this. Obviously, anticipation and tracking of the aircraft is also a crucial skill set and it’s not easy considering some aircraft are reaching approximately 400 knots when they blast by. If I am going for a close up detail shot, I tend to try and raise the shutter speed to ensure the capture is a success. Also, the weather can help a great deal with factors such as available sunlight, wind, and rain, all of which can affect your shot somewhat. I like to try and vary my shots greatly during each pass, trying to capture movement and speed along with a scenic shot if possible and if the location allows.” Here is just a taste of what he pulls in with his big lens as he stakes out the steep hills around the UK: WAH-64D Apache., Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org F-15C Eagle. , Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org Tornado GR4, Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org F-15E Strike Eagle., Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org Puma HC Mk2. , Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org A400M Atlas., Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org CV-22B Osprey., Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org F-15E Strike Eagle., Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org MC-130J Commando II., Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org F-15E Strike Eagle. , Don Jackson-Wyatt – The Don Photography – www.the-don.org Here are a few of Don’s gorgeous shots that are just slightly stepped back, but not by much!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been more than a week since a spike in tensions between India and Pakistan devolved into two days of aerial skirmishes over the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region, with an Indian pilot ending up briefly in Pakistani custody after his MiG-21 Bison got shot down . However, new satellite imagery has called India’s claims about their initial strikes on Pakistani territory into question. Beyond that, a host of other significant allegations from both countries remain unconfirmed, making it hard to say how the two nuclear-armed adversaries may or may not feel compelled to act going forward. In reporting between Mar. 5 and 6, 2019, Reuters used satellite imagery it had obtained from Planet Labs and other sources, along with photographs from individuals on the ground, to challenge the Indian government’s claims that strikes near the town of Balakot had destroyed a major site belonging to the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Indian Mirage 2000 combat jets struck the area on Feb. 26, 2019. The Planet Labs imagery from March 4, 2019, shows no clear evidence of bomb damage or strikes of any kind. The mountain-top site and the surrounding area looks virtually unchanged from the last image available through Google Earth, which is dated April 25, 2018. There have been suggestions that dark spots on the main building might indicate that bombs pierced through the roof and that those holes have been patched up since the strikes. Minimal damage to buildings is often seen in strikes involving special low-collateral damage munitions where the intended target is a small group of opponents or even a single individual. However, it’s highly questionable whether the imagery shows any damage at all and, even if it does, limited superficial damage doesn’t line up with official statements from the Indian government. India’s operation killed a large number of “terrorists, trainers, senior commanders,” including a team preparing for new attacks in India, the country’s Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale had said in an official statement on Feb. 26, 2019 . The Indian government has not given official details about the striking force, but unconfirmed Indian media reports have said that it included 12 Mirage 2000s, each carrying multiple Israeli-made SPICE 2,000-pound class stand-off glide bombs. Those same reports, all citing anonymous sources, claimed Jaish-e-Mohammed suffered between 200 and 300 casualties . The satellite imagery is simply incongruous with the extent of damage one would expect to see from such a large force striking such a small target. In addition, despite initial reports , India has not acknowledged strikes on any other targets in Pakistan proper or the areas of Kashmir under Pakistani control. The Pakistanis, for their part, have been consistent in their assertion that the Indian aircraft caused no significant damage and that the bombs that they did release failed to hit their targets. Pakistan’s military has released one set of pictures showing an purported bomb crater and other damage a relatively far distance from the Madrassa complex, but its questionable whether those actually show the impact of Indian ordnance. A photographer working for Reuters took pictures of another impact spot on the mountainside. At the same time, it is possible that Jaish-e-Mohammed has concealed some casualties in some way and has threatened locals who dispute the Pakistani government’s claims about the strikes. This still doesn’t explain the lack of visible damage in the satellite imagery. It is worth noting that there were similar disputes between Indian and Pakistani authorities about the body count after an Indian raid across the Line of Control, which formally separates the areas of Jammu and Kashmir that India and Pakistan administer, in 2016. Indian media, again citing unnamed sources and without independent corroboration, has claimed that the country’s operation destroyed up to 80 percent of its targets and that Indian authorities have their own satellite imagery and other data to prove this.  If India’s government does have this proof, they have so far declined to share it publicly. Questions about the actual scope and results of the strikes near Balakot only add to the confusing and conflicting reports regarding Pakistan’s retaliatory operation on Feb. 27, 2019. This resulted in an aerial skirmish where Pakistan claims it shot down two Indian combat jets and where India has claimed that it shot down a Pakistani F-16 Viper fighter jet . So far, there has only been hard evidence of Pakistan shooting down an Indian Air Force MiG-21 Bison. The Pakistani government released images from the crash site and, more importantly captured the pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman. Indian officials say that Varthaman was pursuing a Pakistani F-16 and brought it down, reportedly with an R-73 heat-seeking missile , before getting shot down himself. Pakistan has denied this and said that its F-16s were not involved in its retaliatory operation at all. India has publicly presented a fragment of an AIM-120C-5 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-air Missile (AMRAAM) that it recovered after the aerial brawl. We do not know if this fragment was from a missile that a Pakistani F-16 fired at Varthaman, or any other Indian aircraft, or if it broke off from the Viper the Indian Wing Commander reportedly shot down. But only Pakistan’s F-16s can carry this missile, proving that they were, at least, involved in the cross-border fighting in some fashion. The Indian claims in this regard have been credible enough for the U.S. government to begin investigating whether or not Pakistan violated the terms of the export control agreements on its F-16s and AIM-120s in its cross-border raid. Indian Air Force personnel show a fragment from an AIM-120C-5 during a press conference on Feb. 28, 2019. , AP Photo/Manish Swarup It also remains unclear what, if anything, Pakistan hit in its own strikes on targets in the area of Jammu and Kashmir under Indian control. Pakistani authorities say they deliberately aimed away from any particular targets and that their primary intent was to demonstrate their capability to respond. India has disputed this , saying the bombs fell inside Indian military installations. But neither side claims the strikes resulted in any casualties on the ground. The two days of air raids and skirmishes have provoked a deluge of misleading or outright false reports on social media and from regional media outlets. Virtually all of the local reporting on the conflict has cited anonymous sources and often makes extraordinary claims that demand additional and substantial evidence to be believed. There is nothing so far to independently confirm the claims that Pakistani villagers lynched the pilots from the shot down F-16 because they thought they were Indian aviators or that an Indian Mi-17V5 helicopter that crashed was actually the victim of friendly fire . Indian authorities have even had to make a public announcement that Wing Commander Varthaman has no social media accounts. They also complied a list of imposters on various platforms. An Indian Air Force message alerting people to fake social media accounts posing as Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman., Indian Air Force This sort of disputed reporting has extended well beyond the incidents in Jammu and Kashmir and Balakot, as well. On Mar. 5, 2019, Pakistani authorities released a video clip a maritime patrol plane had taken using an infrared camera the day before purportedly showing an Indian diesel electric submarine snorkeling close to the surface near Pakistan’s territorial waters. The Indian Navy refused to address the claims directly, but implied that the Pakistani claims were false. Still, subsequent reports that this was simply recycled footage from 2016 may not be accurate. The arrangement and shape of the masts in the two clips, which you can see below, do not appear to be the same. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uEe45nRTBHU But Pakistan’s assertion that the boat was heading toward its territorial waters also appears to be false. The 2019 clip includes coordinates that show the incident was well away from the Pakistani coastline and that the submarine was only inside Pakistan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). India is legally entitled to sail military vessels above or below the surface through the EEZ, which is still international waters. This also calls into question why the Pakistanis would have tried to pass off old footage as a new with a fake date stamp, but did not manipulate the location to try and place the submarine closer to its shores as they had claimed it was. The submarine incident does point to still heightened tensions between the two countries, though. The Indian Navy is deployed in high state of readiness and remains poised in all the three dimensions – on surface, under sea and in air,” Rear Admiral D.S. Gujral had said during a press conference on Mar. 1, 2019. On Mar. 7, 2019, Indian Air Force also released a statement saying that it continued to maintain “a strict vigil in the skies to detect and thwart any act of aggression from [the] Pakistan Air Force.” Both India and Pakistan have ordered a halt to commercial flights through the airspace along their shared border to try to prevent any dangerous confusion between civilian and military aircraft. Since the Indian strikes on Feb. 26, 2019, there has also been major exchanges of artillery fire across the Line of Control, which formally separates the areas of Jammu and Kashmir that India and Pakistan administer. There have been reports of civilian casualties in these skirmishes and villagers who live near the demarcation line on the Indian side are reportedly building thousands of new bunkers to shield themselves from the shelling. Though worrisome in the broader context of this latest crisis, this level of fighting is not necessarily uncommon . In the past, extended skirmishes along the Line of Control have not escalated into a larger conflict. In addition, on Mar. 7, 2019, there was another reported terrorist grenade attack on a bus stop in Jammu and Kashmir, which raises concerns about a new road of tit-for-tat strikes. It was Jaish-e-Mohammed’s attack on Feb. 14, 2019, on a military convoy in the region using a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, which killed 40 Indian soldiers, that precipitated the latest crisis. So far, however, this latest terrorist attack has only killed one person and it was not against a military target, which may not prompt the same level of outcry in India as a whole. Indian and Pakistani authorities, with the help of their respective international partners, have reportedly been trying to find a diplomatic solution to the latest crisis, as well. “I do not want to say it, but private diplomacy worked,” Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister, said on Mar. 6, 2019 . “U.S. through private diplomacy played a role in de-escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.” The two countries have already taken some steps to try to avoid further major escalations. On Mar. 1, 2019, Pakistan released Wing Commander Varthaman as a goodwill gesture without any public preconditions. India has also sent information to officials in Islamabad on terrorist groups operating in Pakistan, prompting a crackdown . Critics have pointed out that Pakistani authorities have conducted these sorts of police operations in the past. These responses have generally been limited and ineffectual, with terrorists quickly returning to business as usual afterward. The real question, as before, is whether domestic political forces in both countries might prompt further escalations, despite the apparent attempts to bring this latest crisis to a close. India will have nation-wide parliamentary elections between April and May 2019 and incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi has received a boost in his approval rating for his hard line against Pakistan. Modi’s government also appears to be leveraging the outcome of the aerial battles to push for military modernization and push aside allegations of corruption in certain defense procurement efforts. Public outcry has seized on the fact that Wing Commander Varthaman was flying a MiG-21 Bison, a heavily upgraded Soviet-era plane, when he was shot down. India has been trying unsuccessfully to upgrade its combat jet fleets for years now . This includes a purchase of new French-made Rafales that has become mired in controversy and allegations of graft. In the wake of Varthaman’s shoot down, Modi himself has said that this wouldn’t have happened had he been flying a Rafale. On Mar. 6, 2019, K. K. Venugopal, India Attorney General, separately threatened to bring charges against The Hindu newspaper over its reporting of the fighter jet deal, saying the daily had received stolen secret government documents. This, in turn, has prompted an outcry from media outlets and freedom of the press activists. The Indian Air Force also had to employ aging Mirage 2000s in the initial operation since they are the country’s only aircraft capable of carrying the SPICE stand-off munitions. On Mar. 5, 2019, reports emerged that the country would work to integrate these weapons onto its new Russian-made Su-30MKI Flankers . Indian Mirage 2000s., Indian Air Force Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, who only took office in August 2018, had already been facing his own string of political crises before this latest conflict with India erupted. He has since maintained calls for a diplomatic resolution to the situation, but has also made it clear that his country will continue to retaliate if necessary. The underlying fear remains that a series of further miscalculations or domestic political forces could lead to uncontrolled escalation between the two-nuclear armed countries. Even a limited exchange of nuclear weapons could have catastrophic impacts across the world. The competing official claims only further raises the possibility that both sides will feel compelled to prove just how serious they are about defending their respective positions. Modi’s comments about the Rafale show a dangerous willingness to try to exploit the situation to settle domestic political spats, as well. The avalanche of confusing and conflicting information risks creating further demands from the population at large in either country for additional action. The longer it takes for a clear narrative that both parties can accept to emerge, the more time there will be for spurious claims to inflame public opinion. In the meantime, we can only hope that Indian and Pakistani officials, working behind the scenes with their international partners, can continue to de-escalate the situation, regardless of what has or hasn’t actually happened.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Back in December of 2018, we reported on a mysterious chaff cloud that emerged over the Midwest. Just days later, we were first to point out a number of other similar and highly persistent formations that popped up across the eastern United States . In the first case, we were able to get the USAF to tell us where that cloud of metallic radar reflective material came from, at least according to them , but in the other cases we didn’t have as good of luck. Now, a new radar clip shows the formation of a big chaff cloud near Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico. The event occurred on March 5th, 2019 at around 19:20 UTC, which equates to roughly 12:20pm local time. Over a swath of sky beginning to the west of Cannon Air Force Base, the plume first appears, covering roughly 30 miles over a couple hours time. Cannon AFB is used by Air Force Special Operations Command and is home the 27th Special Operations Wing and its MC-130s, AC-130s, CV-22s, MQ-9s, U-28s, C-146s and other propeller-driven aircraft, some of which could have deployed the chaff from their expendable countermeasures systems. Cannon AFB continues to expand after being converted to a master base for USAF Special Operations Command aircraft. , Google Earth See the radar recording below. The weather was very mild at the time. With partly cloudy conditions and no precipitation whatsoever. NEXLAB There is the ‘Pecos’ cluster of Military Operating Areas (MOAs) just to the west of Cannon AFB that extends out nearly 100 miles, it seems as if this may have been where the release began from an aircraft. It took roughly two hours for the chaff to cross the state line into Texas. Like other chaff plumes we have seen as of late, it stayed remarkably cohesive over a long period of time. VFR sectional shows the Pecos MOAs located to the west of Cannon AFB. Even though the release may have begun there, it spread all across the county and into Texas., Skyvector We watched the aviation activity over the area at the time and didn’t see anything out of the ordinary or a culprit that could have released the chaff as part of a test or other unique operation. Keep in mind that most military aircraft aren’t tracked using the software. We also listened to radio recordings from the time period and didn’t hear Albuquerque Center communicate with an aircraft about the chaff release. We have reached out to Cannon AFB about the peculiar chaff cloud, but after 24 hours they haven’t gotten back to us yet. We will update this post if they do.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 10, 2019",Air Force’s Secretive XQ-58A Valkyrie Experimental Combat Drone Emerges After First Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just a week after Boeing unveiled their export-centric ‘loyal wingman’ combat drone concept , the Air Force Research Lab has announced that their own similar endeavor, dubbed the XQ-58A Valkyrie, has made its first flight. It also posted the very first image of the aircraft that has been developed under a veil of secrecy over the last two and half years. A press release from the USAF about the aircraft’s first flight reads : The XQ-58A Valkyrie demonstrator, a long-range, high subsonic unmanned air vehicle completed its inaugural flight March 5, 2019 at Yuma Proving Grounds, Arizona. The Air Force Research Laboratory partnered with Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems to develop the XQ-58A. This joint effort falls within the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) portfolio, which has the objective to break the escalating cost trajectory of tactically relevant aircraft. The objectives of the LCAAT initiative include designing and building UAS faster by developing better design tools, and maturing and leveraging commercial manufacturing processes to reduce build time and cost. Developed for runway independence, the aircraft behaved as expected and completed 76 minutes of flight time. The time to first flight took a little over 2.5 years from contract award. The XQ-58A has a total of five planned test flights in two phases with objectives that include evaluating system functionality, aerodynamic performance, and launch and recovery systems. “XQ-58A is the first example of a class of UAV that is defined by low procurement and operating costs while providing game changing combat capability,” said Doug Szczublewski, AFRL’s XQ-58A Program Manager. Beyond finally breaking cover as the USAF’s ‘attritable’ unmanned combat air vehicle concept, the XQ-58A is really the first Air Force UCAV concept we have seen since all the momentum towards fielding any sort of this type of hugely promising aircraft suddenly dematerialized the better part of a decade ago. The XQ-58A very likely represents the low-end on the USAF’s shadowy UCAV programs. The XQ-58A looks almost identical to its manufacturer’s XQ-222 concept that led to this experimental vehicle., Kratos Defense It is hoped that the XQ-58A will provide a low cost surveillance, strike, and electronic warfare support capability that can be operated independently, as a cooperative swarm, or as part of a so called ‘loyal wingman’ concept of operations a group of Q-58s would work under the command of a nearby manned combat aircraft. The stealthy drone, which supposedly has a range of well over 2,000 miles and is capable of carrying a pair of Small Diameter Bombs or electronic warfare and surveillance gear, is also capable of being launched using rocket boosters instead of relying on runways alone. Kratos Defense, the drone’s manufacturer that is best known for its catalog of highly respected target drones, and the AFRL have always envisioned the XQ-58, above all else, as being a disruptor when it comes to cost. We described this in an earlier piece on the program : LCASD aims to be able to eventually field a optionally reusable, highly adaptable, low-end unmanned combat air vehicle for $3 million apiece for batches of up to 99 aircraft per year, or $2 million each for yearly orders of 100 or more. In essence, the LCASD concept is “high-volume” both in the strategy behind it and in terms of procuring it affordably. USAF Keep in mind that the prices you are seeing in that quote are more aligned with advanced cruise missiles, not highly adaptable stealthy drones that can be reused many times. If the experimental program morphs into an operational one supported by full-rate production, the Q-58 has the potential to drastically expanding the Air Force’s combat punch and flexibility for a relatively modest price. The fact that it can be operated from places where a big pristine runway isn’t available also fits in perfectly with the Pentagon’s need to be able to fight a peer state in a highly dispersed combat environment where infrastructure may be all but non-existen t. The range on these drones also allows for a relatively low-cost and unpredictable option for piercing the enemy’s anti-access/area-denial bubble, something fighters that are notoriously dependent on vulnerable aerial tanker aircraft will have an increasingly hard time doing . So yes, the XQ-58A is truly an exciting X-plane that could change the way the Air Force fights in the very near future. And considering that foreign powers, both friendly and unfriendly , are rapidly working to field their own stealthy long-range combat air vehicle systems, the appearance of the XQ-58 couldn’t have come soon enough. But once again, this aircraft likely represents the low-end of the USAF’s UCAV initiatives—the tip of a largely invisible iceberg. At least we can only hope so.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Don’t Be So Quick To Blame Trump’s No-Show At WWI Ceremony On The President Himself,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Trump is taking a serious shellacking in the media and on social media for the cancelation of a planned trip to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in Belleau, France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I. The site is located roughly 55 miles outside of Paris. The optics of missing such an important event are undeniably bad and they play into other narratives about the President that are unflattering, but these types of decisions are not usually up to the President. The Secret Service and the White House Military Office who arrange presidential airlift with HMX-1 are the ones that decide to cancel helicopter or ground transportation for the President due to a wide variety of contingencies. Some will quickly point out that President Macron and Chancellor Merkel attended the ceremony, but Trump didn’t. Moving either of those dignitaries is not the same as moving the President of The United States. Neither is moving White House Chief Of Staff John Kelly or Chairman Joint Chief’s Of Staff General Joseph Dunford, both of which attended the ceremony. The massive footprint of the security and administrative apparatus that follows the American President around dwarfs anything else like it on the planet, much of which isn’t even visible to the casual onlooker. We can argue the merits of the tactics and procedures that go into these operations, but as it sits today, this is how the POTUS moves about and Trump is no different than Obama in this regard. If HMX-1’s Marine One crews and mission planners—literally the best the USMC has to offer—did indeed scrub the mission due to bad weather, how is that controversial? Would losing an aircraft and its occupants be worth the trip to that ceremony? Wouldn’t it be reckless if they decided to toss out their training and mission guidelines and pushed for the sortie anyway? The point being here is that if the mission was canceled by those who execute the presidential airlift mission day-in and day-out around the globe, that’s called doing their job and keeping their crews and passengers safe, not chickening out. Above all else, it’s not a political decision, it’s a safety decision. And yes, there are different rules for a major emergency, such as a continuity of government situation , than for a diplomatic flight to a memorial ceremony. VH-60N ‘Marine One’ landing in Davos at the World Economic Forum last February. , AP Usually, a ground transportation option via the Presidential Motorcade (the anatomy of which you can read all about here ) is available in the case that Marine One and its accompanying decoy helicopter and staff and press corps airlift aircraft cannot safely make it to the landing zone as planned. But a 55-mile trip is a long way for the sprawling Presidential Motorcade in a foreign country and there are a slew of issues that could slow or even stop such a motorcade from happening even if it was prepared as a contingency option. These include everything from mechanical issues with key vehicles in the motorcade to unforeseen route problems to actionable threat intelligence to scheduling issues. Well before a decision to use the motorcade or not is made, routes have to be mapped and inspected in detail with deep coordination with local police. Even objects that could conceal potential threats (mailboxes, trash cans , manhole covers etc.) need to be removed or sealed along the motorcade’s proposed path and alternate escape routes have to be figured out as well. And once again, due to the length of this voyage, in particular, we don’t even know if there was a motorcade option for certain at this time or why that option wasn’t executed if there was. The Presidential Motorcade is huge as it is, but it balloons in size to many dozens of vehicles when it heads overseas. , AP So unless there is any evidence that Trump literally told his aides that he refused to go to the ceremony, whether it be because he didn’t want to sit in the car for the extended drive or just didn’t feel like it, then maybe wait until all the facts are known before claiming it’s his fault or that the military and Secret Service weren’t doing their jobs as prescribed. If it turns out he didn’t want to go and this is all a cover story, then he deserves to be shamed on a grand scale. In the end, there are plenty of potential issues to take Trump to task on, we do it here when we see fit as well, but this isn’t one of those times—at least not yet—and the idiotic commentary and blind claims regarding Trump’s no-show at the event just highlight how many in the media will jump on him for anything, which makes their arguments against his actual policies and direct actions so much less impactful.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 25, 2019",Code Brown As This Gulfstream Jet Nearly Lands On Workers Repairing A Closed Runway,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you have ever been on a closed runway before it may have given you something of an eerie feeling. Crazy things happen in aviation, including accidental landings on taxiways, closed runways, and even at entirely different airports than intended. There is a reason that big and bright ‘X’ pendants are setup at the ends of runways in the U.S. that are closed for construction, they serves as a last warning to pilots that the landing area is fouled and touching down on it could result in horrific death and destruction. But regardless, this clearly wasn’t the case in the video below. The clip shows a group of workers fixing a section of the asphalt on Paraguay’s Asuncion Silvio Pettirossi International Airport’s single 11,000-foot runway when a Gulfstream V appears on final approach for the runway. The workers scramble out of its way just in time as the big private jet roars by. Here is a direct link to the Twitter video if it doesn’t propagate below automatically: A couple things of note here. First off, it’s not clear if the runway was actually closed when the incident took place. Instead, the runway’s threshold may have been displaced just forward of where the men were working. This seems insanely dangerous, and if that was indeed the case, the video serves as proof that it was. Otherwise, if the runway was officially closed, the jet shouldn’t have been using it to land under any circumstances. Asuncion Silvio Pettirossi International Airport., Google Earth Either way, the idea that pilots would have executed an approach to a landing area where workers, the aircraft, and its passengers would be put in danger is baffling. That GV probably needed every foot of the remaining runway to safely recover, hence the low-approach, but diverting to a safe runway is a far better option than turning into a giant fireball full of aluminum shrapnel tumbling down the tarmac. We are looking into the incident and will update this post when we find out more. Update: 5:40pm PST— So, apparently this video is a few years old, but has just now gone viral in Paraguay to the point that the head of the Dirección Nacional de Aeronáutica Civil (DINAC) that the workers were assigned to commented on it on Twitter: The Twitter thread basically talks how safety is first and the precautions that should be taken. But it doesn’t explain what happened in the video itself and implies that the incident is now under investigation. Gatechecked.com has a writeup about the incident, in which it talks about the investigation and translates the official’s response as such: In relation to the video that circled on various networks, in which an aircraft landing operation is observed a short distance from the track maintenance personnel in full work, it is pertinent to communicate that: The video dates from 4 to 5 years ago. Even one of the officials who is observed in the video celebrated his retirement on April 30, 2016. The maintenance works to the track are constant and with all the security rigor. Coordinated and informed with time via NOTAM, as required by the international procedure to which the Institution is submitted. Each operation is veiled by the Control Tower and each aircraft receives instructions for each action, this is independent of NOTAM, which is previously issued. The aircraft commanders are obliged to respond to the directives of the Air Traffic Controllers and it is their obligation to be aware of each NOTAM issued by the institution. The President of the DINAC, Dr. Edgar Melgarejo (@edgarmelgin) requested several reports about this video in order to clarify this event with more precision.” According to a Paraguayan publication ABC Color , the pilots involved were also made aware of the incident, however we have been unable to determine if there were any consequences as a result of their actions. The airport’s runway has always been a topic of concern due to poor construction and maintenance. The government has since announced plans to completely revamp the runway and its related facilities, as well as build a second terminal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 29, 2019",U.S. Sends THAAD To Israel For First Time As Both Countries Slam Iran’s Missile Programs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has sent interceptors and other components of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense ballistic missile defense system, or THAAD , to Israel for an exercise the first time. The deployment comes as both countries have been especially critical of Iran’s ballistic missile programs , but also reflects a contingency plan that has been in place for more than a decade. U.S. European Command said that deployment had occurred “in early March,” according to an official press release on Mar. 4, 2019. The date stamp on pictures the U.S. Army subsequently released indicated that the first elements had arrived at Nevatim Air Base in central Israel on Mar. 1, 2019. The notice also added that the exercise is occurring at the direction of Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and is a demonstration of the Pentagon’s “Dynamic Force Employment concept.” Secretary of Defense James Mattis first announced this operational concept , which aims to make it harder for the U.S. military’s opponents to predict its operations and other activities in advance, in 2018. “The purpose of the deployment is to practice rapid deployment across the globe of complex systems, and to enhance cooperation with the IAF’s [Israeli Air Force’s] Air Defense Systems,” a post on the Israeli Air Force’s official Twitter account said. “This is a defensive deployment that is not related to any specific current event.” This is the first time the Army has deployed a full THAAD system to Israel. A THAAD battery can include up to nine transporter-erector-launchers, each carrying eight interceptors at the ready, as well as a long-range AN/TPY-2 X-band radar , a mobile fire control and command and control center, and various supporting equipment. Additional interceptors would be available to reload the launchers during a combat deployment, as well. A briefing slide showing the general composition of THAAD batteries as of 2016., MDA The task force included Battery B, 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, assigned to the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade at Fort Bliss in Texas, as well as elements of the Ohio Army National Guard’s 174th Air Defense Artillery Brigade. The 11th oversees the bulk of the Army’s THAAD units, though two additional batteries are forward deployed semi-permanently to Guam and South Korea to defend against threats from North Korea . https://youtube.com/watch?v=baKqULdRm4g This Dynamic Force Employment exercise offers an opportunity to evaluate the entire process of packaging the system up, quickly shuttling it to Israel, unloading it, setting it up, and linking it together with the Israel Defense Force’s (IDF) integrated air defense network. In an actual contingency, the plan would be to augment Israel’s own layered ballistic missile defense capabilities . The drill is also well in line with the U.S. military’s latest Missile Defense Review , which the Pentagon released in January 2019 and that heavily emphasized cooperation with regional allies, such as Israel. “The United States will sustain its strong missile defense partnership with Israel, underpinned by a new U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),” the Missile Defense Review explained. “Taking advantage of various opportunities to conduct bilateral exercises …, the United States and Israel continue to improve their capability to cooperate operationally to address offensive missile threats in the region.” US Army personnel load a THAAD transporter-erector-launcher onto a US Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft at Fort Sill, Texas., US Army Though Israel faces the threat of missiles, as well as unguided artillery rockets , from various regional actors, including the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad , Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , but one of the greatest concerns is Iran’s expanding ballistic missile arsenal . “One of Iran’s primary tools of coercion and force projection is its missile arsenal, which is characterized by increasing numbers, as well as increases in accuracy, range, and lethality,” the Missile Defense review warned. So, while the U.S. military and the IDF insist that the THAAD deployment is unrelated to any specific event, it’s hard not to see it as a pointed signal to Iran. In January 2019 , Iranian authorities tried and failed to launch a satellite into orbit in a test that the United States and Israel both criticized as a cover for ballistic missile development efforts. The next month, The New York Times reported, citing anonymous sources, that the U.S. government had rebooted a clandestine effort to sabotage Iranian missile programs. Since pulling out of the multi-national deal over Iran’s controversial nuclear program in 2018 , President Donald Trump and his administration have taken an increasingly hard line against Iran in general, putting a raft of economic sanctions back into place. One of the Trump administration’s main complaints about the Iran Deal was also that it did nothing to tackle concerns about non-nuclear issues, including Iranian ballistic missiles. Iran has also demonstrated its own willingness and ability to employ its ballistic missiles in actual combat with multiple strikes against targets in Syria in recent years. These strikes send the Iranian government’s own signals to its regional opponents. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NxK2J9fNFec In addition, Iran has helped proliferate ballistic missile technology to its regional partners, including non-state actors such as Hezbollah and Houthi rebels in Yemen , further increasing the threats throughout the Middle East. In 2018, Israeli authorities, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accused Iran of supplying Hezbollah with GPS guidance packages for its missiles, though they did not provide any hard proof to support these claims. The Lebanese militant group quickly hid whatever evidence there might have been after Israel publicly identified buildings it said were missile factories. Of course, it is also important to note that while this is the first time the Army has actually brought a full THAAD system to Israel, it has included real or simulated components of it in exercises in the past. The service conducts annual drills, nicknamed Juniper Cobra , to prepare to rapidly move air and missile defense systems into Israel every year, typically sometime in March. The U.S. military did not specifically say that this new THAAD deployment was part of this year’s Juniper Cobra. These existing yearly exercises generally involves the deployment of Patriot surface-to-air missile systems to various sites in Israel. Since 2007 , however, the training scenarios have, on and off, included the simulated employment of the U.S. military’s THAAD and the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer -based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system. Juniper Cobra also includes Israel’s own Patriots and its Arrow family of ballistic missile defense systems. US Army radars associated with the Patriot surface-to-air missile system deployed to Israel during Juniper Cobra 2018., US Army At least since 2012, the United States has had an AN/TPY-2 forward deployed at a site on top of Mount Har Keren in southern Israel’s Negev Desert, also known as Site 512 . Images and video of the new deployment show that Battery B brought their own additional AN/TPY-2 for the exercise. In 2017 , the Army opened Site 883 within the Israel Defense Forces Air Defense School at Bislach Air Base, also in the Negev. This was another sign of growing forward deployed U.S. military air and missile defense capability in Israel. Since then, the Army has also activated the 13th Missile Defense Battery to manage operations at that site. A member of the US Army stands next to the American and Israeli flags during a ceremony marking a change in command of the 13th Missile Defense Battery in April 2018., US Army But sending the complete THAAD package, rather than simply simulating its presence, it’s a much more pointed signal to countries, such as Iran. It’s also a clear demonstration that this is a step the United States and Israel could take during a crisis, rather than just a notional capability. Given the Trump Administration’s efforts to not only continue, but expand missile defense cooperation with Israel, as well as its hard stance against Iran and its ballistic missile arsenal, it is possible that THAAD deployments to Israel may become more routine in the years ahead.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The biggest air show down under was underway last week and it always draws an exciting mix of military aircraft from around the region and beyond. A USAF C-17A Globemaster III from March Air Reserve Base in California was on hand to show off its unique abilities for the crowd of tens of thousands of people. During its takeoff roll for its Saturday demonstration, the muscular airlifter’s outboard right wing engine sucked in a big bird that was flying low over the runway. The ingestion resulted in a loud bang and large fireball prior to the C-17 crew executing a rejected takeoff procedure. The C-17 safely came to a stop on the runway moments later. The C-17 involved in the incident, tail number 05-5140, hadn’t flown the following day so it may have received some damage or required more detailed inspections before it could take to the skies again. Aviation photographer Mitchell Getson took the awesome shot seen at the top of this story. Here’s his firsthand account of the incident: “Throughout the day there had been birds congregating around the end of the active. A RNZAF C-130 almost had a strike with a large flock of birds early in the day’s displays. 05-5140 lined up for departure, it commenced it’s takeoff roll and ingested a large bird into the 4th engine (two flew across, only one was ingested). The crew immediately rejected the takeoff roll and returned to the apron. The C-17 didn’t fly again for the remainder of the show.” Mitchell Getson Here is an amazingly detailed video of the bird strike: The danger birds present to aircraft isn’t insignificant. The public is well aware of that after the Miracle On The Hudson incident. The military in particular takes the risk of bird strikes very seriously. It has led to the Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) program, which you can read all about in this previous piece of ours . Birds pose an especially elevated risk to military aircraft flying at air shows because the aircraft are often operating at very low altitudes—deep in the high-risk zone for bird strikes—and at the edge of their performance envelopes where margins for recovery can be slim to none. And these strikes do happen. Just look at this Blue Angel F/A-18 Hornet ingesting a bird during its routine. The C-17s Pratt & Whitney F117 high-bypass turbofan engines have been, like all modern engines, tested rigorously for bird ingestions. Certain threshold requirements exist for different weights of birds being ingested at different speeds while still allowing the engine to keep operating or at least contain a catastrophic failure. Below is a video of one of these kinds of tests. Clearly, the F117 on the C-17’s wing contained any damage caused by the strike to the engine itself. And it’s not like the jet is in some remote place with no support in case repairs have to be made. The Royal Australian Air Force operates their own fleet of C-17s , so it’s not as if help is far away. Still, the image is yet another reminder of the danger posed by mother nature’s winged creations to even the Air Force’s biggest jets.

We also had the F-117 Nighthawk make an appearance unlike anything we have seen in over a decade. Mark Cuban made a cameo on the page too and we brought a big dose of reality to the rumor mill surrounding the possible early retirement of the supercarrier USS Harry S. Truman . There was also our take on the second U.S.-North Korean summit in Hanoi that resulted in some lively debate in the discussion area. I have to stress that the MVP award goes to Joe this week for putting out the best India-Pakistan coverage on the net. It was amazing work that few could have accomplished. The amount of BS he cut through to build those reports was really quite amazing. Still, there were many subjects we didn’t get to. But it’s not too late. Welcome to Bunker Talk! This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t get to. In other words, literally an off-topic thread. We can talk more about North Korea and the Hanoi Summit, and especially about North Korea’s game of musical cars as Kim blew out of his meeting with Trump early: Or we can discuss the news that the F-35C has reached IOC. The Navy has finally gotten a stealth strike asset after the A-12 was ripped away from them nearly three decades ago. What about this crazy bastard who decided to take a stroll down a street in a private jet at hundreds of miles per hour. “Cocaine’s a hell of a drug!”: Then there is the fact that ICBMs sit in traffic jams in Russia: Once again, this is an entirely open exercise, so let’s enjoy some pointed debate and have some laughs.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 16, 2018","Trump Was Right To Walk On Kim, But Foolish To Have Gone To Hanoi In The First Place","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has been nearly eight months since the highly anticipated summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump took place in Singapore. That engagement was a missed opportunity and an astonishingly poor showing overall for the Trump Administration and especially for the President himself. This time around, in Hanoi, the mood was different. The excitement was a fraction of what it was in Singapore and even the President’s own image as a knowledgeable negotiator had notably changed over the last eight months. In the end, the seemingly inevitable stance held by the North Koreans became undeniable. But, instead of taking whatever scraps North Korea threw him via a weak deal or some phony joint declaration on what was already a very grim day for his Presidency , Donald Trump did the right thing. The hard thing. He walked on Kim. The glaring truth is that this should have happened in Singapore, not after months of grotesque flattering, many diplomatic meetings, and a trip around the world to Hanoi. For proper context, make sure to read our analysis from the Singapore Summit and our most recent piece on the negotiations. Over the better part of a year, North Korea had given zero signs that it had any plans to denuclearize or even give up anything substantial as show of goodwill. While this was going on, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo kept making laughable claims about the directions of the negotiations, but even those eye-rolling statements became more muted and skeptical in recent months. All the while, Donald Trump praised Kim Jong Un without end, even going as far as saying he was in love with the brutal dictator. The President childishly proclaiming the nuclear threat from North Korea was over after acting as if the hollow document he signed in Singapore was worth more than its weight in pulp was even worse. The document signed in Singapore, which the President wrongfully touted early on, was largely an empty gesture on North Korea’s behalf. , AP All the while, North Korea’s star has risen on the world stage. Its neighbors Russia and China have cozied up to Kim and even though big claims have been made about how hard the regime has been hit by international sanctions, consistent proof says otherwise . On top of that, external military pressure has been largely lifted on Kim and his goons. The huge military exercises that were the bane of the Kim regime’s existence have, for the most part, ended . Also, North Korea has continued to exploit South Korean President Moon Jae In’s naive hope for sudden denuclearization and a quick end to the long stand divisions on the Korean Peninsula, even going as far as stating over and over that North Korea was ready to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for peace and economic prosperity. There can be little doubt that it has been North Korea’s plan all along to drive a policy wedge between South Korea and its American strategic partners. North Korea knew that the deeper South Korea would dig into relations with North Korea, the harder it would be to make an about face and return to the heightened military standoff that has been omnipresent for nearly 70 years. Beyond small changes in force posture, just dialogue and presence alone have bought Kim a new and far more favorable reality to his country’s long-standing predicament. The price of this grand metamorphosis was next to nothing. He hasn’t given up a single nuclear warhead, missile, enrichment facility, or even halted the country’s nuclear weapons and long-range missile development programs. Moon Jae In and Kim Jong Un are all laughs during a meeting. Moon has bet huge on detante with North Korea. , AP Many will point out that Kim has not ordered live tests of missiles or nuclear devices in over a year. But he said before reaching out to South Korea for the Winter Olympics that all his missile and nuclear test objectives have been met and the next stage of his reign would be focused on economic development. Nowhere in there did he say that would include handing over his nuclear weapons or its delivery systems. He had his arsenal and his long-range delivery system in a place where it was finally a real deterrent threat to the United States. That was his goal. Once that was accomplished, it was time to work on a new set of objectives. In other words, North Korea has stuck to its own internal program. ‘Fire and fury’ had no impact on their aims. They had a schedule based on a core set of objectives and they stuck to that schedule before venturing down a new phase of their plan. Only after two tests of the giant Hwasong-15 ICBM and a test of a dramatically higher yield nuclear device did Kim enter into the detante stage of his plan. He had his deterrent in the bag., North Korean State Media When it comes to nuclear weapons, why on earth would Kim give them up? That arsenal is what has allowed him to share the world stage with the leader of the free world. Not once, but twice. In addition, the American President has become Kim’s biggest cheerleader on a personal level, vouching for his intellect, good intentions, and potential in ways the North Korean regime could never have even imagined. On top of that, Kim’s nukes eventually brought his neighbors closer into his orbit. But above else, they have kept him safe and his power assured even during the tensest time on the Peninsula in many years. There can be no doubt that history has played a big role in North Korea’s drive to achieve a credible nuclear deterrent. The fates of totalitarian leaders of countries that have relinquished their nuclear programs, such as Libya and Iraq, have not been pretty. More recently, Iran made a deal with the United States on its own nuclear program and it ended up being torn up when the political winds in Washington changed even though Tehran had remained in compliance. Ukraine turned over its nuclear arsenal following the fall of the Soviet Union and now it has Russia snapping up its territory and threatening its very existence. It’s abundantly clear that in most cases having nuclear weapons equates to more security for a regime, not less. Kim and Trump literally at the negotiating table in Hanoi , AP The fact is that there is no real reason for North Korea to give up the atomic weaponry it has worked so hard to acquire. If President Trump engaged the world community and presented a comprehensive deal that included massive foreign investment, energy supplies, food stocks, and security guarantees—one that could be enacted over a number of years—that would end with North Korea emerging as a prosperous state that is part of the world community, maybe there would be a chance. But none of that work was ever done by the Trump Administration. Instead, Trump himself thought he could just use nauseating charm, a tacky promo video, and his own ‘star power’ to make North Korea do something that is totally antithetical to its own interests. The whole thing has been a sad joke and makes you wonder what could have happened if Trump presented a comprehensive ‘best shot’ plan backed and funded by the world community and told him Kim to take it or leave it. Because now, after endless foreplay, we are still at leave it. With all that being said, Trump showed up in a very different form in Hanoi than in Singapore. He seemed to finally have a better understanding of the basic nuts and bolts of the North Korean denuclearization issue. This was made clear in his press conference. It seems that with this newly acquired knowledge, he was able to make the right call and to pull the plug on the negotiations when it was clear that Kim had no intentions of giving up his nuclear weaponry. Even more eye-opening was that Trump clearly stated what Kim wanted and what he was willing to give in return for it. North Korea was willing to dismantle its aging Yongbyon nuclear reactor facility in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Trump said Kim wanted the lifting of all sanctions while North Korea apparently now disputes this and says it was in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions. Either way, it doesn’t really matter. Taking the pressure of sanctions off North Korea to any substantial degree in exchange for that facility and some other small concessions would have been a terrible deal. It would have left huge swathes of North Korea’s nuclear program untouched, including other enrichment sites, as well as its entire nuclear arsenal, its delivery systems, and missile development programs. In addition, that facility, which was once the heart of North Korea’s nuclear program, is nearing 60 years old and it is supposedly in fairly poor condition. It no longer plays as critical a role in North Korea’s nuclear program, especially after the regime has already amassed dozens of warheads and an unknown amount of fissile material. So once again, we see North Korea only willing to give up expendable facets of its ever-expanding nuclear weapons ecosystem, but nothing that has to do with its existing weapons or delivery systems, or the material already stockpiled to make more bombs in the future. Even though Trump made the right call, the question remains, why did the President have to travel halfway around the globe and give Kim yet another international press blitz to learn what pretty much everyone with a working knowledge of the situation already knew? So it’s great that Trump seems to be learning the ropes of diplomacy regarding the North Korean problem, but we seem to be paying an extremely high price for that education. And Mike Pompeo is left with diminishing credibility after playing Mr. Positive for months about a situation that clearly wasn’t moving in a productive direction. The fact of the matter is that there should have been no second summit without a substantial deal of some kind already agreed upon by diplomats on both sides that have worked the issue over the last year. Instead, a love letter from Kim duped the President into another empty high-profile engagement. Quite frankly, Trump should have walked out on Kim in Singapore where the exact same issues could have been and likely were identified. Instead, he gave away what North Korea has always wanted most, that coveted handshake with an American President and an empty document that didn’t include a roadmap to denuclearization or even new language stating that North Korea actually intended to give up its weapons. What happens next? Well at this time, not much. The door has been left open for future talks and negotiations. Clearly, Trump hopes walking will push Kim back to the negotiating table, especially after a long train ride back to Pyongyang. But in reality, North Korea seems to have gotten exactly what they wanted. They have positioned themselves in a gray area, one where endless talk, declining military pressure, positive international exposure, increased interest in cooperation from China and Russia, and all the cache it could have ever imagine from two summits with the President of the United States have materialized. Oh, and that same president keeps singing Kim’s praises to an absurd degree. So, what is the incentive for North Korea to do anything at all at this point? Sanctions relief? Sure, but there is a good chance Russia and China will just call it a day in that department, anyway. What happens next in terms of South Korea-North Korea relations? Moon Jae In bet his administration on a denuclearization and normalization deal with North Korea. Now what? Does it continue on without a deal with the U.S.? If so, what would doing so mean for the U.S.-South Korea strategic partnership? Above all else, North Korea’s greatest aim is weakening the military and diplomatic cohesion between the U.S. and South Korea. Just how far Moon will go while being fully aware of this truth is anyone’s guess. Kim and Moon and their wives atop Mt. Paektu along the Chinese-North Korean border., AP With all this in mind, Kim did exactly what we said he would do following the Singapore Summit—play Trump at the negotiating table. Meanwhile, their arsenal grows and their weapons programs continue to advance. In return, the U.S. gets no missile or nuclear tests. Yet how is this a huge win? If the U.S. just went to North Korea during the tests and said “hey, we want to be friends, we will meet with your tyrant leader at the highest and most publicized levels, talk constantly about how incredible he is, and call off all major wargames, oh and you can keep your arsenal and even continue to develop it, if you just stop doing live tests,” do you really think Kim wouldn’t have taken that deal? In the end, we are left with a mixed bag. It’s good that the President finally wised up and walked, but that’s about it. And lack of preparation and offering North Korea a ‘best shot deal’ tied to a tight deadline will leave us asking what could have been. At the same time, aside from the sanctions, North Korea is in an incredibly good place the likes of which it is doubtful it would have ever imagined it would be in at this time. So yeah, Kim won. Bigly. Author’s note: I tried to keep this piece focused on the nuclear issue, but the fact that the President of the United States has come out and said he believes the dictator of North Korea when he said he had no idea of Otto Warmbier’s situation until after the fact is a national disgrace. Sadly, it fits right in line with Trump’s blind trust and affinity towards tyrants who have proven to be the absolute least trustworthy actors on the world stage.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s Air Warfare Symposium is underway in Orlando and part of the program is the final judging for this year’s Spark Tank innovation award . A special guest was on the panel who is no stranger to the pressure of picking winners—billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner and the star of ABC’s Shark Tank , Mark Cuban. Also among the judges were Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein, and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Kaleth Wright—so yeah, no pressure right!? During the judging, one competitor’s presentation, in particular, resulted in an absolutely classic exchange that was so glaringly truthful and so well timed, while also being a bit brave, that it stole the entire show. Staff Sergeant Travis Alton of the 19th Logistics Readiness Squadron at Little Rock Air Force Base came up with a novel piece of equipment that could really help with the reliability of air drops from cargo aircraft. An official USAF description of his invention reads: “M-1 Cargo Parachute: Staff Sgt. Alton developed a fail-safe device that physically prevents the timing mechanism from releasing in the event of a timer malfunction while not interfering, impeding or hindering current rigging methods and/or procedures. It’s designed to eliminate malfunctions created by the cargo parachutes releasing prematurely in the event of a timer malfunction.” When pitching his invention to the judges, Mark Cuban tossed Airman Alton a curveball question that he, in turn, smashed out of the park. The snappy reply might have been somewhat troubling for the Air Force power players on the stage if it weren’t so blatantly and notoriously true. Check out the exchange below: In fact, those four brilliant, but raw words were so damn relevant that Heather Wilson got up and gave him a hug as the crowd thundered with applause. And even after Mark Cuban jumped back in to grill him on his salesmanship abilities, or lack thereof, Staff Sergeant Alton pulled it together to deploy yet another hard-hitting comeback that resulted in another round of applause from a crowd that was clearly familiar with his sentiment. It turns out that Travis Alton’s invention didn’t take the title as this year’s Spark Tank winner , but I think it’s safe to say his genius rebuttal to Cuban’s question made him the true champion of the day. And in the end, Alton created maybe the most impressive Air Force invention of all—a way to tell the very top of the service’s leadership just how miserable the force’s procurement process is right to their faces while also being universally appreciated for doing so.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",India Shows Proof U.S. Made F-16s And AIM-120 Missiles Were Used By Pakistan In Aerial Brawl,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Indian military has publicly displayed a portion of an AIM-120C-5 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM , as evidence that Pakistani F-16 Viper fighter jets were at least involved in recent strikes on the Indian-administered portion of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region. India continues to say that it shot down one of the Vipers, which Pakistan denies, as the two nuclear-armed countries work to de-escalate a major spike in tensions and pull back from the brink of war. Regardless, this would be the first time Pakistan has used these American-made fighter jets in action against Indian forces, which could have serious ramifications for its relationship with the United States. Indian Air Force Air Vice Marshal R.G.K. Kapoor presented the piece of the missile at a joint press conference on Feb. 28, 2019 , regarding the state of the situation with Pakistan follow a series of tit-for-tat aerial engagements that left an Indian pilot in Pakistani custody. Pakistan says it plans to release Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman as a good will gesture on Mar. 1, 2019 . The Pakistanis shot down Varthaman, who was flying a MiG-21 Bison at the time, during an aerial battle on Feb. 27, 2019 , but deny F-16s were involved in any way. Other reports , citing unnanmed sources, say that a JF-17 Thunder was actually responsible for the shoot down. “Pakistan claimed they did not use F-16. There are enough evidences through electronic signature that F-16 was used,” Kapoor said at the press conference . “Parts of AMRAAM air-to-air missile, which is carried only by PAF [Pakistani Air Force] F-16, was recovered east of Rajouri within the Indian territory [in Jammu and Kashmir].” Pakistan has a fleet of around 76 F-16, which are a mix of A/B Air Defense Fighter (ADF), AM/BM Mid-Life Update (MLU), and Block 52 C/D models. These include jets acquired directly from the United States and from second-hand sources. It has also received AIM-120C-5 missiles to go along with them. India does not use any variant of the AIM-120. Indian Air Force personnel show a fragment from an AIM-120C-5 missile as evidence that Pakistani F-16s were involved in recent strikes on Indian positions during a press conference on Feb. 28, 2019., AP Photo/Manish Swarup Some claimed that the contract number shown on the missile fragment identified it as one shipped to Taiwan , suggesting the evidence was fabricated. However, this contract was actually a larger U.S. Foreign Military Sales deal that did involve deliveries to Pakistan . Kapoor said that Indian radars had identified a large strike package consisting of Pakistani F-16s and JF-17 Thunders heading toward the Line of Control, which separates Indian and Pakistani forces in Jammu and Kashmir, on Feb. 27, 2019. The force may have also included older Mirage III or Mirage 5 aircraft. He did not say whether it was Indian radars that had identified the signature of the Vipers or if another electronic intelligence system was involved. Indian Su-30MKI, MiG-21 , and Mirage 2000 fighter jets then moved to intercept. Separate, unconfirmed reports , citing anonymous sources, say that Wing Commander Varthaman was chasing a Pakistani F-16 in his Bison and shot it down with a Russian-made R-73 heat-seeking air-to-air missile. An Indian MiG-21 Bison. An R-73 missile is visible on the outboard pylon of the left wing., Sheeju via Wikimedia “Fact is that Indian Army units reported sighting two parachutes falling in PoK [Pakistani-occupied Kashmir] which were of two F-16 pilots shot down by the IAF MiG,” Air Vice Marshal Kapoor, said during the press conference. If true, this would indicate that the aircraft in question was one of Pakistan’s two-seat F-16B or D models. India has consistently claimed it shot down only one aircraft. A Pakistani F-16BM combat jet with a training version of the AIM-120 on its wingtip launch rail., Asuspine via Wikimedia Unconfirmed reports suggest that Wing Commander Varthaman may have pressed his attack on the Pakistani F-16 beyond the safety afforded by the larger Indian force, which also left his wingman vulnerable. Another Pakistani combat jet then shot down MiG-21. This may or may not have been another F-16. India has not made it clear they believe the fragment of the AIM-120C-5 was the result of a Viper firing it at an Indian aircraft or whether it broke off from the one Varthaman reportedly shot down. A Pakistani soldier stands guard next to some of the wreckage of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s MiG-21 Bison., AP Photo/Abdul Razzaq Separate reports have suggested a Pakistani JF-17 Thunder was responsible for actually shooting down the Indian MiG-21. A video has emerged of triumphant Pakistani Air Force pilots celebrating the air-to-air victory in front of one of these jets. If the latter is the case, it would be the first known aerial combat engagement by a Thunder, a light fighter that Pakistan developed together with China, and one that resulted in an air-to-air victory. The Pakistanis and Chinese have been marketing the aircraft heavily around the world and this combat outing could become a prominent feature in future sales materials regardless. A Pakistani Air Force JF-17., Shimin Gu via Wikimedia There remains no hard evidence of the F-16 shoot down itself. Pictures have emerged online purporting to show Pakistani personnel recovering wreckage of an F110 engine, but none of Pakistan’s Vipers use this engine. The images actually appear to show parts of Varthaman’s MiG-21. This is a prime example of very active the rumor mill in both India and Pakistan and how difficult it can be difficult to separate facts from the rapid-fire deluge of often misleading or outright false information online. For instance, in the aftermath of the Feb. 27, 2019, a video circulated widely across social media, making it into actual media reports , allegedly showing a second Indian pilot seriously injured after getting shot down by Pakistani aircraft. This video, however, is from an entirely unrelated accident at the 2019 Aero India airshow and exhibition involving two planes from the Surya Kiran Aerobatics Team. Pakistan also claims that it shot down a second Indian jet, which crashed on the Indian side of the Line of Control. India denies this occurred and there has been no clear evidence, so far, to prove otherwise. An Indian Mi-17V5 helicopter did crash in Jammu and Kashmir on Feb. 27, 2019, but Pakistani authorities have not claimed to have shot down a rotorcraft and India says the mishap was due to a mechanical fault . But even just an engagement between an Indian MiG-21 and a Pakistani F-16 would be significant in of itself. Though aging and increasingly hard to maintain, the Indian Air Force’s Bisons have received significant upgrades over the years, including the ability to carry Israeli-made Elbit EL/L8222 self-escort jamming pods. The Soviet-era design also benefits from a relatively small radar cross-section and visual signiture and Indian pilots have helmet mounted sights that give them the ability to launch R-73s high-off boresight at particularly opportune times. Indian MiG-21s and their pilots famously surprised U.S. Air Force aviators during a major air combat exercise called Cope India in the country in 2004. Working closely with other Indian combat jets, they were able to repeatedly get the drop on American fliers in F-15C Eagles. “The MiG-21s would be embedded with a [MiG-27] Flogger for integral protection. There was a data link between the [Su-30MKI] Flankers that was used to pass information,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Greg Newbech, a participant in the 2004 drill, said in a subsequent interview . “They built a very good [radar] picture of what we were doing and were able to make good decisions about when to roll [their aircraft] in and out.” Indian MiG-27 Floggers and US Air Force F-15C Eagles fly together during Cope India 2004., USAF Beyond the Bison presenting a challenge to the F-16 in a real life combat scenario, there could be serious political ramifications. An American-made plane firing an American-made missile could have political ramifications in the future as the United States drifts away from its historical relationship with Pakistan and looks to dramatically improve its ties , especially its military-to-military relationship , with India. F-16 sales to Pakistan have been controversial since the first examples arrived in the country in the 1980s. In 1990, Congress put measures into place to halt economic and military cooperation with Pakistan over its development of nuclear weapons, which blocked further Viper deliveries for a time. In 2005, the United States once again began approving F-16 sales to Pakistan, as well as allow the country to upgrade its existing aircraft, but with heavy export controls in place. There are reports that this includes limiting access to key systems on the jets, as well as Pakistan’s ability to service those components. Rumors of tracking devices and the ability to remotely disable the aircraft, or key systems on it, have also been circulating for years. Even so, in 2016, American legislators again held up Viper sales over Pakistan’s inability or unwillingness to tackle terrorist groups within its borders, including those conducting attacks on U.S. forces and their allies in Afghanistan. With the U.S. government now in the midst of a major push to expand relations with India and increase shared military activities with its forces in South Asia and beyond, members of Congress could see the latest exchange as even more reason to block future military aid to Pakistan. A Pakistani Air Force F-16C at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada during a training exercise in 2016., USAF Since taking office, President Donald Trump, as well as members of his administration, have also expressed their displeasure with Pakistan on a number of fronts, including the fact that terrorist groups continuing to use Pakistani territory as a safe haven. In September 2018 , the Trump Administration cut $300 million in aid to Pakistan over this particular issue. “The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools,” Trump had said in January 2018 . “They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” If the United States ended support for the Vipers and blocked third parties from supplying parts and other services, it could ground what are objectively Pakistan’s most capably combat aircraft in a very short amount of time. This could all help explain why the Pakistanis have been so keen to deny that their F-16s were even involved in their counter-strike on Indian positions Feb. 27, 2019, despite the high profile mission almost demanding their use. It’s also worth noting that as Pakistan has struggled to acquire new F-16s, Lockheed Martin has pitched advanced models to the Indian Air Force. The American defense contractor now looking to sell a rebranded advanced F-16 variant, dubbed the F-21 , to India and potentially move significant portions of the Viper production line to the country. This could make it even more difficult for Pakistan to support the jets in the future. A rendering of the Lockheed Martin F-21, which the company says it would manufacture in India if it won a major contract., Lockheed Martin It also remains to be seen just what impact the Indian insistence that F-16s were involved in the Feb. 27, 2019 aerial skirmish and that the Pakistanis lost one of these aircraft might have on efforts to de-escalate the present situation. Pakistan admitting it lost a combat jet publicly could prompt demands for renewed forceful action against India. Of course, it’s hardly the first time the two countries have disputed significant and central details regarding major cross-border military skirmishes. Pakistan’s pledge to release Varthaman without any public concessions will be a significant act toward defusing tensions. India has also sent information on terrorist groups plotting attacks on Indian territory to the Pakistani government, which has promised to act on any credible information about these militant activities. Pakistan, however, has long denied that terrorists launch attacks on India from within its borders despite decades of well-established evidence to the contrary. Whatever happens, the recovered piece of the AIM-120C-5 is strong evidence that Pakistani F-16s tangled with Indian jets for the first time in the air battle over Jammu and Kashmir. Correction: The original version of this story said that Pakistan had only 45 F-16s. The actual total is approximately 76, with 45 of them being the AM/BM variants.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a second day of major skirmishes , tit-for-tat air operations along the contested Line of Control in the Jammu and Kashmir region dividing India and Pakistan has resulted in reports of numerous shoot downs and left an Indian pilot in Pakistani custody. Both sides continue to dispute many of the basic facts of the incidents, prompting new concerns about the likelihood of further escalation and dangerous miscalculations between the two countries, both of which have nuclear arsenals . What is clear is that a number of unspecified Pakistani combat jets flew across the Line of Control into the portion of Jammu and Kashmir that India administers on Feb. 27, 2019. They released weapons at a number of targets before returning to their bases in Pakistan. In response, India launched a counter-strike into Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan insists that its strikes in Kashmir were not in direct response to India’s unprecedented strikes in Pakistani territory on Feb. 26, 2019 . This was the first time Indian combat aircraft had crossed the line of control publicly since the two countries fought a major war in 1971 and the first time this has occurred since both countries acquired nuclear weapons. “Pakistan has … taken strikes at non military target [sic], avoiding human loss and collateral damage,” according to an official Pakistani government statement. “Sole purpose being to demonstrate our right, will and capability for self defense. We have no intention of escalation, but are fully prepared to do so if forced into that paradigm.” Pakistan’s statement also seemed to suggest that the targets its aircraft struck were unspecified pro-India militant groups, which have existed in the past , but have been relatively small compared to pro-Pakistan or pro-independence factions, rather than the Indian military. This does not appear to be the case. In a separate press conference, Pakistani Major General Asif Ghafoor, a spokesperson for the country’s military, said that the targets had been six Indian military facilities . India also said that the targets were military posts . Ghafoor further claimed that Pakistan’s planes had bombed empty areas nearby, specifically to demonstrate their capabilities without causing any damage or casualties. There is no independent confirmation that the Pakistanis deliberately avoided hitting actual Indian positions. The Pakistani government’s mention of India-based paramilitary forces, combined with the use of the phrase “non-military,” appear to have been more aimed at mimicking India’s statement from the day before, which described its own operation in these terms because it targeted the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group. The Indian operation was a direct response to Jaish-e-Mohammed’s terrorist attack, using a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, on a military convoy in Jammu and Kashmir on Feb. 14, 2019, which killed 40 Indian soldiers. There are unconfirmed reports that India shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet during the strikes. Pakistan denies it lost any aircraft in the operation. Despite Pakistan’s insistence that its strikes were not intended to be escalatory, India did retaliate, sending its own jets flying back across the Line of Control. The Indian Air Force lost two planes in the process, one of which crashed in Pakistani-controlled territory, while the other hit the ground on the Indian side, according to the Pakistani military. India has since confirmed that it lost one plane, saying it was a MiG-21 Bison aircraft, but has not confirmed that another one of its planes got shot down. Pictures also emerged of the wreckage of the MiG-21. Pakistan captured the pilot of the Bison, who it identified as Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhi Nandan. They subsequently released images and video of him in custody, as well as of his personal effects. In an unrelated incident, an Indian Mi-17 helicopter also crashed in Kashmir, reportedly due to a mechanical issue , killing all six personnel on board. Amidst all the aerial activity and heightened tensions, India closed a number of airports in its northern regions. Pakistani authorities went even further and shut its airspace down entirely to commercial flights. The official Notice to Airmen, or NOTAM, says Pakistan’s skies will remain off limits until 2:59 AM local time on Feb. 28, 2019. In a formal statement, India has since rejected Pakistan’s assertions that its strikes were “non-military” in nature and described them as an “unprovoked act of aggression.” Indian authorities also criticized the Pakistani government’s “display” of Wing Commander Nandan, saying it violated international law with respect to the treatment of prisoners, and they have demanded his immediate and safe return. “It was clearly conveyed that India reserves the right to take firm and decisive action to protect its national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity against any act of aggression or cross-border terrorism,” the Indian statement said. “Due to our high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan’s attempts were foiled successfully,” Raveesh Kumar, a spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, said separately . The obvious concern is that the situation will continue to escalate between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. Pakistan, in an apparent attempt to deter further Indian incursions into its territory proper, has already declared its intention to “ dominate the escalation ladder ,” if necessary, and made references to the use of nuclear weapons. Though the aerial engagements have received the most attention, there has also been a spate of skirmishes on the ground along the Line of Control, which have reportedly led to numerous casualties and civilian deaths , though the exact details remain largely unconfirmed. Both India and Pakistan have reportedly been moving additional forces to or near to the front lines to reinforce their positions. Still, it is worth noting that these sorts of clashes are by no means rare and have led to deaths and injuries in the past on both sides without precipitating a larger conflict by themselves. After the written statement from Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the subsequent press conference by officials from that same ministry, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan himself made a renewed appeal for diplomacy with his Indian counterparts. In a televised address, he also warned that if the situation continues to escalate, it could take on a life of its own. “I ask India, given the weapons capability on both sides, can we afford a miscalculation?” Khan said. “It will neither be in my control nor [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi’s. We are ready to come on the table and talk about terrorism that affects both the countries.” Domestic politics in both India and Pakistan are sure to be key components of how this violent spat continues to evolve. India’s Modi is facing a general election in April and May 2019 and his popularity received a noticeable boost from taking a hard line against Jaish-e-Mohammed and Pakistan. Rahul Ghandi, an Indian parliamentarian who is the leader of the main opposition Congress Party, also came out in support of the Feb. 26, 2019 strikes. Public support for additional forceful action against Pakistan would seem to be high. Pakistan’s Khan only became Prime Minister in August 2018 and has faced significant political challenges from both opposition parties and his own bloc . This latest crisis, the most serious in South Asia in decades, now puts him in a position where he is also up against the powerful interests of the country’s military and main intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), as well as general public sentiment demanding a defense of the country’s national pride. It could be the fate of Wing Commander Nandan that determines where the brewing conflict goes next. Though it is unclear what the Pakistanis may be compelling him to say and what statements may be of his own volition, he has indicated that Pakistani authorities are treating him well and rescued him from mob violence after he parachuted down inside Pakistani-controlled territory. India and Pakistan could use Nandan as a vehicle for diplomacy and his safe return as a means of de-escalating the crisis. His release would certainly be a goodwill gesture on the part of the Pakistani government. At the same time, Nandan’s detention could prompt more calls from within India for action, especially if the Pakistanis continue to hold him for a protracted period of time and if there are any indications whatsoever that he is being treated poorly. The international community is also starting to wake up to the severity of the situation, with the United States, Russia, China, the European Union and other all urging both parties to exercise restraint. In particular, behind the scenes diplomacy involving China, a major Pakistani ally, and the United States, which ever-strengthening ties with India and historical connections with Pakistan, could help the two brawling neighbors reduce tensions. We certainly hope that cooler heads will ultimately prevail to prevent the situation from transforming into an all-out war between the two nuclear-armed powers.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 7, 2019","Yes, India And Pakistan Could End The World As We Know It Through A Nuclear Exchange","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A series of events starting with a major terrorist attack in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region has pushed India and Pakistan, and their nuclear arsenals, closer to all-out war with each other than they have been in decades. Though the two countries have significantly smaller nuclear stockpiles compared to the United States or Russia, even a limited nuclear exchange between them could lead to health and climatic issues on a global scale, a scenario known as Nuclear Winter, which would end life on the planet as we know it. We at The War Zone have been following the developments in South Asia closely and you can read our wrap-ups of the past two days of fighting here and here . The precipitating event was an attack by the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed that involved a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device ramming into a bus carrying Indian soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir, killing 40 and wounding many more. After a series of tit-for-tat air operations , both countries are on edge and have made threats to further escalate the situation. Pakistan has warned India directly about further attacks and implied that the situation could lead to a nuclear confrontation. “As you all know, Pakistani government has called a meeting of National Command Authority tomorrow,” Major General Asif Ghafoor, a spokesperson for the Pakistani military, said on Feb. 26, 2019 after the initial Indian strikes on Pakistan. “I hope you know what that means.” Pakistan’s National Command Authority is a top-level joint strategic command that most notably oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile. India has its own Nuclear Command Authority and dedicated Strategic Forces Command that fulfills the same general role in making decisions regarding the employment of its nuclear weapons. In both countries, the final decision to initiate a nuclear strike rests with civilian authorities. What’s in these arsenals? Though the exact numbers are not publicly available, Pakistan reportedly has between 140 and 150 total warheads, all of which are fission types, or atomic bombs, rather than fusion or thermonuclear devices, more commonly known as hydrogen bombs . Pakistan presently has a mix of nuclear-capable medium-range ballistic missiles . The longest range models in Pakistani service are the Ghauri-II and Shaheen-III . These have maximum estimated ranges of around 1,500 and 1,700 miles respectively. This allows Pakistan to reasonably target anything within India. Pakistan also has nuclear-tipped Nasr short-range ballistic missiles and Babur ground-launched cruise missiles. It’s combat jets can carry Ra’ad air-launched cruise missiles and nuclear gravity bombs, too. The Pakistani Navy is on its way toward getting a nuclear-armed submarine-launched cruise missile capability, as well. This could give the country a very austere ‘second strike’ deterrent. India is similarly secretive about the total size of its stockpile, but it reportedly consists of around 130 and 140 warheads , again all fission types. The Indian military has deployed nuclear-armed short-, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles , which form the core of its present nuclear force. India’s ground-launched ballistic missiles primarily fall into two families, the Prithvi and the Agni . The former are short-range missiles, while the latter includes medium- and intermediate-range types . Agni-III has a range of more than 3,100 miles, easily putting all of Pakistan in range, even from well within Indian territory. The still-in-development Agni-V and -VI are intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are intended to provide a more capable deterrent against China, another of India’s potential regional adversaries. An Indian Agni-II Medium Range Ballistic Missile on its trailer-mounted erector-launcher., AP Photo/Gurinder Osan India also has the nuclear-capable BrahMos cruise missile , which the country developed together with Russia. The Indians have deployed air-, sea-, and ground-launched versions of this weapon. The Indian Air Force’s combat jets can also carry nuclear gravity bombs. An Indian launch vehicle for the ground-based version of the BrahMos cruise missile., Indian Ministry of Defense Lastly, India has Dhanush ship-launched short-range ballistic missiles available, as well as a single nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, forming a limited naval nuclear capability. The Indian Navy eventually hopes to have four Arihant -class submarines , though the project has been beset by delays and technical difficulties. Still, this will provide the India with a robust second strike deterrent. A global threat India and Pakistan’s nuclear arsenals are tiny compared to those of the United States and Russia , and these weapons are focused primarily on deterring each other, but that does not mean they’re purely regional threats. Unlike conventional weapons, nuclear weapons create lasting and far-reaching effects that scientists have posited could upend life on Earth if warring parties were to use them in sufficient numbers. In 2012 , Alan Robock, a distinguished professor in the Department of Environmental  Sciences and Associate Director of the Center for Environmental Prediction at Rutgers University, and Owen Brian Toon, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and a research associate at  the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, argued that it might not take a large amount of nuclear weapons to create a scenario commonly known as “ Nuclear Winter .” In general, this hypothesized event occurs when smoke and soot from nuclear explosions block significant amounts of sunlight from reaching the earth’s surface, leading to a precipitous drop in temperatures that results in mass crop failure and widespread famine. Robcock and Toon summarized their findings, which were based in part on their previous work, in an article in the Bulletin of The Atomic Scientists , writing : “Even a ‘small’ nuclear war between India and Pakistan, with each country detonating 50 Hiroshima-size atom bombs – only about 0.03 percent of the global nuclear arsenal’s explosive power – as airbursts in urban areas, could produce so much smoke that temperatures would fall below those of the Little Ice Age of the fourteenth to nineteenth centuries, shortening the growing season around the world and threatening the global food supply. Furthermore, there would be massive ozone depletion, allowing more ultraviolet radiation to reach Earth’s surface. Recent studies predict that agricultural production in parts of the United States and China would decline by about 20 percent for four years, and by 10 percent for a decade. A graph from Robock and Toon’s 2012 paper showing changes in precipitation and temperature based on the amount of soot from generated from nuclear explosions., Bulletin of  The Atomic Scientists The bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima Japan, known as Little Boy , was an inefficient and essentially experimental design with a yield of around 15 kilotons. The reported results from Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing indicate that both countries can meet this threshold and both countries’ weapons programs have almost certainly matured in the decades since. In previous studies, Robcock, working with others, postulated that temperature changes could begin within 10 days of a limited nuclear exchange and the effects from the detonations of 100 nuclear weapons in the 15-kiloton class would directly result in the deaths of at least 20 million people . The second order impacts would be even worse in the years that followed. An animated image showing the density and spread of soot following the detonations of 100 15-kiloton class nuclear weapons during a regional conflict between India and Pakistan based on the models Robcock, et al. first developed in 2007., Luke Oman In 2014, Michael Mills and Julia Lee-Taylor, both then working at the federally-funded National Center for Atmospheric Research’s (NCAR) Earth System Laboratory, authored another paper with Robcock and Toon. This study concluded again that detonation of 100 15-kiloton yield bombs in a purely regional conflict would result in “multi-decadal global cooling” and “would put significant pressures on global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear famine.” A map from Mills, Taylor, Robcock, and Toon’s 2014 paper showing the average change in global temperatures for June-August and December-February over a two to six year period following a regional nuclear war involving the detonation of 100 15-kiloton nuclear weapons., NCAR It is important to note that critics have questioned whether the Nuclear Winter concept relies on too many assumptions and would ever actually occur. At the center of many of these rebuttals are debates about whether the nuclear explosions would truly create the amount of smoke and soot necessary for major climate change, as well as the specific conditions for those particles to remain in the atmosphere for a prolonged period of time. The studies here do indicate significant impacts based on a relatively limited number of nuclear detonations of smaller yield devices, though. But even if the impacts are less pronounced than projected in this particular scenario, they could be far more severe if India and Pakistan were to use a larger number weapons and/or ones of higher yields, which both belligerents readily have. In addition, Nuclear Winter is just one of the potential things that might happen following a nuclear exchange between the longtime foes. A detonation of dozens of nuclear weapons, even small ones, would throw hazardous nuclear fallout into the air that, depending on the weather pattern, could carry that material far and wide , causing both near- and short-term health impacts. The various ground zeroes themselves would be irritated and potentially hazardous for many years to come. Depending on where the detonations occur, a nuclear exchange could potentially cut people off from critical water and food supplies, putting increased and potentially unsustainable strains on uncontaminated areas.  After the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, situated in Ukraine, melted down and exploded in 1986, authorities established a 1,000 square mile restricted access “ exclusion zone ” that remains in place today. A map showing the recorded spread of radiation in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster., CIA There would also be a major danger of second-order “spillover” effects, as individuals fled affected areas, putting economic and political strains on neighboring regions. This could inflame existing tensions not directly related to the inter-state conflict between India or Pakistan or lead to all new and potentially violent competition for what might already be limited resources. India has already threatened to weaponize water access in its latest spat with the Pakistanis. Any serious impacts on food and water supplies, or other economic upheavals as a direct or indirect result of the conflict, would have cascading impact across South Asia and beyond, as well. The very threat of a potential India-Pakistan war of any kind already caused some negative reactions in regional financial markets. Those markets would certainly collapse after an unprecedented nuclear exchange actually occurred, and that is before the long-term physical impacts of such an event would even manifest themselves. Overall, we are talking about a sudden and dramatic geopolitical, financial, and environmental shift that would change our reality in a matter of hours. Even then, the darkness, both figuratively and literally, that could propagate over the weeks, months, and years would be far more damaging. How great is the risk? So far, India and Pakistan have not made any clear indications that the fighting is close to crossing their nuclear thresholds. Pakistan’s warnings about the risks of escalation seem more calculated to try and prompt India to back down. India itself has a so-called “no first use” policy, which means it has publicly pledged to use its nuclear weapons only in retaliation to a nuclear strike. However, experts have increasingly called into question whether this is truly the case and whether India might be developing delivery systems more suited to a first strike should there be a need to shift policies. Pakistan, however, does not have a no first use policy and has insisted on its right to employ nuclear weapons to defend itself even in the face of purely conventional threat. Pakistani officials have, in the past, specifically cited this policy as way of deterring India, which has a much larger and in some cases more advanced conventional force, and preventing larger wars. The concern, then, is that this policy appears to have failed, at least to some degree, with India’s strike on undisputed Pakistani territory on Feb. 26, 2019. India, however, did not target Pakistani forces in that instance and exchanges between the two countries have been limited, at least so far, to the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region, where violent skirmishes occur semi-regularly without precipitating a larger confrontation. We can only hope that the two countries will find a diplomatic solution to this latest conflict and avoid any further escalation. If things were to spiral out of control and lead to the use of nuclear weapons, it would be something that would threaten all of humanity.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s far from a secret, the F-117 is still flying over a decade after it was officially retired from service and put into storage at Tonopah Test Range Airport —its first operational home. The F-117’s unique status is something I have been reporting on and explaining in detail for years . Just as recently as last July, we got some video footage of an F-117 operating over the Nevada Test and Training Range . That same encounter also resulted in some great radio traffic that gave us new insights as to what the handful of flyable F-117s are up to. Fast forward seven months and we are blessed with absolutely the best photo of an F-117 in flight since the type’s retirement 11 years ago. The image comes to us from our good friends over at my favorite magazine on the planet, Combat Aircraft . And there are more where this one came from. Make sure to check out the whole set on their website . The amazing detailed image was taken on the R-2508 range complex near Death Valley in California. According to Combat Aircraft , a single F-117 was blasting through the area at low-level while a pair of F-16s were following in trail from above. To my knowledge, this is the first time a Nighthawk has been seen outside of the Nevada Test and Training Range since the type’s retirement. As for what exactly it was doing there, we can’t say for sure. But as I have stated for years , the F-117 is an incredibly valuable and well understood stealthy target to test new sensor systems against and new low-observable (stealthy) coatings on. The F-16s may very well have been putting a new infrared search and track (IRST) pod to the test or some other sensor system, or maybe they were just all out for a flight through the area to keep up basic competency. We just don’t know. The F-117’s story has been something of an obsession of mine over the years. As a result, I have covered some of its most prominent as well as its most obscure elements . From its developmental origins , to the prototype that predated it , to it’s early secret life at Tonopah Test Range Airport and even the futuristic hand scanners used there for security, to by far its strangest paint job , to previously unknown features , to its own “ Klingon cloaking device ,” to its only combat loss , and more. So to say the least, it is a personal joy to see a stunning photo like this snapped in the year 2019. F-117s stuffed five to a hangar at Tonopah Test Range Airport. The largely mothballed fleet is slowly being drawn down by four aircraft per year. , DoD You better soak this image up why you still can, though! The F-117s are slowly disappearing into the abyss. Congress’s former mandate to keep the fleet of roughly 52 jets in Type 1000 regenerative storage indefinitely at the high-security Tonopah Test Range Airport has ended. Four of the iconic ‘Black Jets’ will be removed from storage each year and disposed of in a way that remains undisclosed even though the process has been underway now for a couple years. As such, the 2020s will mark a final end to the game-changing Nighthawk’s amazing story. A big thanks for our friends over at Combat Aircraft for sharing the picture with us. If you don’t get the magazine you are seriously missing out. It is the perfect companion to this site and is packed with the best military aviation photography in the world. Read it on your Ipad, you will thank me! UPDATE: 2/27/18 2:40pm PST— The F-117 is back in Death Valley today oddly enough, resulting in this awesome clip. Returning for a second day over the same location is very intriguing and seems quite uncharacteristic of how we have seen these aircraft operated over the last decade. We are looking into the peculiar situation and will report back when we find out more.

The past 14 hours or so have been particularly tense in South Asia after India launched the first air strike on Pakistani territory in nearly five decades. Pakistan has now vowed to retaliate, while also threatening the potential use of nuclear weapons, and there are already reports of clashes along the Line of Control that divides the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region, raising concerns about a larger potential conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries . There are still many conflicting and otherwise unconfirmed details about the Indian operation, but what is clear is that Indian Air Force Mirage 2000s crossed the Line of Control and subsequently struck targets near Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region in the early hours of Feb. 26, 2019 local time. This is the first time that India’s aircraft have publicly entered Pakistani airspace on a combat mission since the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War . India says that strikes destroyed a camp belonging to the Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed, which claimed responsibility for a deadly vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack on Indian troops in Jammu and Kashmir on Feb. 14, 2019. Indian media and politicians have already nicknamed the mission “ Surgical Strike 2 ,” a reference to a cross-border ground raid across the Line of Control in 2016 , which was also aimed at neutralizing terrorist camps in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. A map showing Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, at left, and the Poonch sector of Jammu and Kashmir, at right. Some initial reports suggested that the Indian strikes might have occurred in the similarly named Balo Kote in Poonch, but this does not appear to have been the case. The dotted line that snakes above the “Jammu and Kashmir” title on the map effectively marks the Line of Control between Indian and Pakistani forces., Google Earth Though Indian authorities say they are still assessing the results, the operation resulted in the deaths of a significant number of “terrorists, trainers, senior commanders,” and a group of individuals who were preparing for new attacks in India, according to an official statement from India’s Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale on Feb. 26, 2019. India also claimed that the camp near Balokot was under the command of Maulana Yousaf Azhar, brother-in-law of Masood Azhar, who is head of Jaish-e-Mohammed. India has described the strikes as “pre-emptive” rather than defensive, but said that they were limited to “non-military” targets, meaning that they were targeted non-state actors rather than Pakistani forces. Indian authorities have blamed Pakistan for persistently refusing to even acknowledge that terrorist groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed use the country’s territory to launch attacks. “I want to assure you that the country is in safe hands,” India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a rally later on Feb. 26, 2019 . “I vow that I will not let the country bow down.” The exact size and scope of the operation remain unclear. Indian media reports, citing anonymous sources, say that as many as a dozen Mirage 2000s took part in the mission. One of the country’s EMB-145 Netra airborne early warning and control aircraft, an Il-78 Midas aerial refueling tanker, and at least one Israeli-made Heron drone were also reportedly involved. Initial stories suggested that the aircraft had employed laser-guided bombs, but this conflicted with official Pakistani statements that the aircraft had only flown between three and four miles into Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, dozens of miles to the east of Balakot, before turning back. The planes would have had to have been close to their targets to have employed this type of precision-guided munition. India’s NDTV subsequently reported that the Indian jets had employed Israeli-made Smart, Precise Impact, Cost-Effective (SPICE) standoff glide bombs . Though this is still unconfirmed, it would make sense since the plan would have allowed the aircraft to strike their targets without spending any time in undisputed Pakistani airspace. This tactic would have also reduced the risks to the Mirage 2000s from Pakistani air defenses or aircraft scrambling to intercept them. There may have also been up to five strikes on additional targets, including camps belonging to Lashkar-e-Taiba , the group behind the spectacular 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, and Hizbul Mujahideen , which is fighting for an independent, Islamic Kashmiri state. But the Indian government has not officially stated that it conducted these other strikes. So far, the operation has reportedly been a major boon for Prime Minister Modi’s approval rating . Modi, and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, are facing significant political challenges ahead of a general election that will occur between April and May 2019. For it’s part, Pakistan has primarily chosen a strategy of denying and minimizing the strikes, claiming that the Pakistani Air Force chased away the Indian jets and that there were no casualties or significant damage to targets in Balakot. Reports from local villagers said that the Indian aircraft did appear to target a madrasa, or Islamic religious school, that Jaish-e-Mohammed runs in the area, but missed, wounding only a single individual. Those same reports , however, said that these individuals were hesitant to talk more about the terrorists. In a press conference on Feb. 26, 2019, a Pakistani military spokesperson invited the Indian press to come to the area and see for themselves that the strikes had had no meaningful impact. This response is very similar to Pakistan’s reaction to the cross-border raid in 2016. However, in that case, the entirety of the action was limited to Jammu and Kashmir, the status of which has been in dispute for more than a half century. Balakot is inside Pakistan proper, which could make it difficult, if not impossible for the Pakistani government to avoid feeling compelled to retaliate. That India was able to strike deep in Pakistani territory with apparent impunity could only further drive demands for a more forceful response. “We will respond and we will surprise you,” the Pakistani military spokesperson, addressing India directly, added at the press conference in the aftermath of the Indian strikes. That “response will come at a point and time of our choosing.” Pakistan has publicly announced that there will be a meeting of the country’s National Command Authority (NCA) on Feb. 27, 2019. This high-level, joint command oversees Pakistan’s strategic components, most notably the country’s nuclear arsenal. The disclosure of the NCA meeting was clearly meant to be a threat of nuclear retaliation. “I hope you know what that means,” the Pakistani spokesperson said. They also declared that Pakistan would “dominate escalation ladder.” It seems unlikely that this incident would actually precipitate a nuclear exchange by itself and it’s more likely that Pakistan is looking to take an especially hard line immediately to discourage further Indian incursions. Whether or not Pakistan looks to conduct its own conventional strikes on Indian soil remains to be seen. Since Pakistani forces were not on the receiving end of the Indian strikes it is unclear what targets Pakistan could even engage and still claim their actions are a proportional tit-for-tat response. Indian combat aircraft have been patrolling near the Line of Control and air defenses on the ground are reportedly on high alert since the strikes to guard against potential Pakistani retaliation. Cargo aircraft have been flying regular missions into Jammu and Kashmir, as well, possibly carrying reinforcements or additional supplies. An EMB-145 has also been seen in the area, which would provide additional radar coverage in the mountainous region to help spot any incoming aircraft or low-flying cruise missiles. There are reports of sporadic exchanges of fire at various points along the Line of Control. Though there appears to be an increase in these incidents, it is also worth noting that Indian and Pakistani forces have historically fired artillery and other weapons at each other in these areas with some regularity. Between the cross-border incident in 2016 and 2018, there were dozens of violent skirmishes , many of which ended in the deaths of Pakistani and Indian soldiers. None of these confrontations provoked a larger conflict, though. At the same time, as already noted, fighting limited to the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region has not historically demanded a broader response. There was also reports that Indian forces shot down a small Pakistani drone intruding into India’s Gujarat region, much further to the south. Gujarat, which sits along the Arabian Sea, has a direct border with Pakistan. One of India’s Israeli-made Surface-to-air PYthon and DERby ( SPYDER ) surface-to-air missile systems reportedly brought down the unmanned aircraft, which, if true, would mark its first operational use. All told, whatever the exact outcome of the strikes in Balokot, it is hard not to see there being increasingly vocal demands for some kind of Pakistani military response, especially given the jubilant reaction in India. We will be continuing to keep an eye on the still-evolving situation and update this story as new information becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 26, 2019",Boeing Will Unveil This ‘Loyal Wingman’ Combat Drone For Australia’s Air Force Tomorrow (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As The War Zone was first to report , Boeing is set to unveil a stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle, or UCAV, for the Royal Australian Air Force at this year’s Avalon Air Show in Australia. The pilotless plane appears to be a previously unseen clean sheet design and will be capable of operating as a “loyal wingman” with manned aircraft, such as Australia’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighters . The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) was first to get the details of the new drone on Feb. 26, 2019. The day before, Boeing had teased the official reveal of the unmanned aircraft, which is still scheduled to come on Feb. 27, 2019. The unmanned aircraft in the picture has a twin ‘taileron’ configuration similar to the YF-23 Black Widow , as well as wings centrally mounted on either side of the fuselage. The wings are similar to those found on General Atomics Predator-C/Avenger and more recently on a set of mysterious Scaled Composites test airframes . It also appears to have travazoidal air intakes on either side of the fuselage, likely feeding a single jet engine recessed at the rear to minimize infrared signature. The drone’s planform is distinct from the company’s MQ-25 Stingray drone tanker for the U.S. Navy and appears to be completely unrelated to the earlier Phantom Ray flying wing design. Beyond the picture, seen at the top of this story and below, ABC obtained few additional details as to the drone’s capabilities. The report suggested that the UCAV could be close to 40 feet long and feature a modular payload bay capable of accepting sensors, electronic warfare systems, and ordnance. Boeing’s new loyal wingman UCAV for Australia’s RAAF., Boeing via ABC Boeing has reportedly been developing the unmanned aircraft locally in Brisbane, Australia, as a part of a classified “Loyal Wingman” program for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Australia’s Department of Defense (DOD). Australia’s Defense Minister Christopher Pyne will be the one to formally unveil the drone tomorrow, according to ABC. Deputy chief of the RAAF Air Vice-Marshal Gavin Turnbull alluded to this project in an interview that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank published on Feb. 27, 2019 . The service is otherwise in the midst of a major modernization effort known as Plan Jericho, which is focused in part in working to exploiting artificial intelligence, machine learning, and manned-unmanned teaming to make up for its relatively small overall force structure. “In terms of bang for buck, it’s how we can have the biggest effect in making our people successful in any combat environment that they may have to enter,” Turnbull explained. “We have to be able to provide a level of deterrence that means, if you snap at us and we have to bite, it’s going to hurt.” “So into the future you have to give consideration to what the force mix looks like between manned and unmanned combat entities,” he continued. “And there will always be a synergy in mixing them in some way.” The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway touched on exactly these potential benefits of Australia acquiring a UCAV capability in yesterday’s article, writing : An unmanned combat air vehicle that is capable of some semi-autonomous missions and can operate in the loyal wingman role, where it is ‘tethered’ to and takes directions from a nearby manned platform via data-link, makes a lot of sense for Australia as it would boost their air combat capabilities without needing to buy additional high-cost fighters or train new aircrews. It also would also make all their fighter force more survivable and capable of adapting to hostile threats on the fly. In addition, it would also increase their fighter cadre’s magazine capacity, sensor diversity, range. The drones themselves can also be networked together in a swarm, giving them greater capability than the sum of their parts. These concepts can be manifested in distinct aircraft, or potentially blended together in a single airframe, albeit with some compromises. But still, they should be less expensive than a very stealthy, high-end, flying-wing UCAV that is built for semi-autonomous or even autonomous operations deep in enemy territory. A full-on fighter-like UCAV is also possible, but due to cost and the investment Australia has already made in their growing fleet of F-35s, this seems doubtful at this time. Also, high kinetic performance would mean sacrificing stealth and range, something that makes little sense really. And we know by the features Boeing has shown that this aircraft is designed for fighter-like speed and maneuverability, not extreme stealthiness and long range. Boeing was the first to openly prove the incredible potential of unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) nearly two decades ago, but has since struggled to bring their vision into an operational state. With this in mind, tomorrow’s announcement will be a huge coup for the Chicago-based planemaker and is only likely to open up new opportunities. In addition, considering Boeing also won the Navy’s MQ-25 contract, the company is now sitting firmly on the leading edge of advanced unmanned aircraft development. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 3:25pm PST— Looks like someone got a peak in the Boeing tent at Avalon. There is what appears to be a mockup. A prototype is possible due to the poor quality of the image, but it’s doubtful. Still, it gives us a sense of scale. Now Boeing just posted this video showing CGI of the aircraft in actions in manned-machine teaming mode alongside an Aussie Growler and an E-7 Wedgetail. Oh, and its name is officially the Boeing Airpower Teaming System: A clearer image of the mockup: UPDATE: 3:47pm PST— Some basic facts about the Air Airpower Teaming System: It is built in Australia and intended for export around the globe. Exports will be easier without having to go through U.S. FMS process. A prototype is being built now. Can fly with or without a manned partner. Has a range of roughly 2,000 miles. Is 38 feet long and uses a bizjet class engine. Will team with E-7, EA-18G, F/A-18E/F, and P-8 Poseidon. Modular design for ‘snap-in’ payloads and rapid reconfiguration capability. Initial configuration will be sensor/intelligence and electronic warfare focused. Controlled via ground station, other aircraft, and has some level of autonomy that can scale for the mission. Design was based mainly on what would be attractive to a global market full of cash-strapped air arms. Will be tested over Australia’s vast deserts where there is tons of room for experimentation. (Probably based out of Woomera) The technology and development will be sourced locally in Australia. Boeing will be able to adapt the technology for foreign customers far easier than developing and building in the United States. You can read more here at Aviation Week’s embargoed exclusive . I will be doing a big picture analysis soon that addresses issues not discussed in that report. Editor’s Note: Boeing informed us that a dollar figure for money spent on the program by Boeing in Australia (AU$62M) was not accurate, so we removed it from our post. The figure came from the Aviation Week exclusive linked above.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 10, 2019",Moscow Has A “Syrian Fracture” Propaganda Train Loaded With War Trophies Crisscrossing Russia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A special train carrying a propaganda roadshow is currently wending its way through the Russian countryside carrying trophies the country has collected after more than four years of fighting in Syria . The spectacle is certainly “on brand” for Russia, already well known for its huge military parades , and in line with President Vladimir Putin’s growing appeals to nationalist sentiment to sustain his regime. The entire “experience,” which consists of 10 coaches with various small items and exhibits, nine flatbed cars carrying captured vehicles of various descriptions, and an empty flatbed car to act as a rolling stage for song and dance routines, is dubbed “Syrian Fracture.” The associated circular logo features a light blue silhouette of an Su-34 Fullback combat jet on top of a red, white, and black of the Syrian flag. One of the “Syrian Fracture” coaches with the logo and images of Russian K-4386 Typhoon-VDV armored vehicles on the side, along with the Russian Army’s own red star logo., RIA FAN Operated by the Russian military, the train left the Moscow area on Feb. 23, 2019, which is Defender of the Fatherland Day in Russia. The plan is for the train to hit a total of 61 cities, including in the country’s Far East regions, during a run that will last 75 days. At the end, the procession will have returned to Moscow just in time for the country’s major annual Victory Day celebrations , commemorating the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, which occurs every year on May 9th. The vehicles and items on board, which include everything from tanks to small drones to deactivated improvised explosive devices, had previously been at the Kremlin’s Patriot Park military theme park at Kubinka just outside the country’s capital. The train carries just a portion of the full collection of war trophies, which first went on display in 2018. You can see a full breakdown of the “Syrian Fracture” train and its contents from Zvezda, the Russian military’s official newspaper, below: Zvezda The limited space on the train didn’t prevent the Russians from putting together a representative selection of items. The most eye-catching is probably the “Eagle Head” improvised armored truck that the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, also known by the Kurdish acronym YPG, had operated in northwestern Syria. The Eagle Head armored truck at Patriot Park., Vitaly Kuzmin There are a number of other unusual items that speak to the number of armed factions and terrorist groups involved in the conflict in Syria and their various international supporters. One of the train cars has a Scottish-made Aardvark mine-clearing vehicle of unclear origin. It seems probable that this came to one of a number of militant groups by way of Jordan. There are also some curious small arms, including at least one example of a World War II Nazi StG 44 assault rifle . The Syrian government acquired these, along with a number of ex-Nazi armored vehicles and other weapons, from East Germany in the 1960s. The small arms collection in one of the coaches also includes older American-made M16A1 rifles that the United States or its Middle Eastern allies likely distributed to one of many Syrian groups fighting the regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad or ISIS terrorists. There are heavier infantry weapons, too, including mortars, recoilless rifles, and a TOW anti-tank guided missile launcher, a weapon that has become particularly iconic in Syria . The Aardvark mine-clearing vehicle on the propaganda train., RIA FAN pic.twitter.com/kB889s4XM6 — Rob Lee (@RALee85) February 24, 2019 There is also a Soviet-era T-55MB tank and a Czechoslovakian OT-64 SKOT wheeled armored personnel carrier. Rebels captured these from Assad’s forces before the ended up back in the hands of pro-regime elements. Pro-Assad units captured a huge number of T-55s, OT-64s, and other armored vehicles near the Jordanian border in July 2018. Rebels had abandoned them after government-aligned forces launched a major offensive to retake the southern city of Daraa and the surrounding environs, backed by Russian airpower . As far as larger armored vehicles go, the train also has a Turkish ACV-15 tracked armored personnel carrier, which is based on the American M113 . This was almost certainly abandoned by Turkish forces during one of that country’s campaigns in Northern Syria . The train during one of its stops, with the T-55AM, closest to the camera, followed by the OT-64 and ACV-15., Russian MoD The bulk of the rest of the vehicles are a mix of common armored and unarmored trucks found across Syria. These include the ubiquitous Humvee and Toyota Land Cruiser . The United Arab Emirates-made Panthera F9 and the South African-designed RG-31 represent some of the more purpose-built, mine-resistent armored vehicles found in the Syrian conflict. There is also a less well known Chinese ZX Grand Tiger pickup and a civilian American-made Jeep Cherokee that some faction converted into a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED). A Toyota Land Cruiser with a recoilless rifle mounted in the back., RIA FAN A ZX Grand Tiger pickup, at left, with an aircraft rocket launcher set up as an improvised artillery piece on the bed. The Land Cruiser can be seen again at the right., RIA FAN The RG-31 mine-resistant truck, at left, and the Humvee., RIA FAN The story behind the black Humvee is particularly indicative of the fighting in Syria. The United States originally supplied this example to Iraqi special operations forces. ISIS then captured it and turned it into a VBIED, which Assad’s forces subsequently captured and turned over to the Russians. But as interesting as the artifacts certainly are, the train’s obvious purpose is to paint a picture of a triumphant Russian military in Syria, despite the conflict continuing to drag on without any clear end in sight. Russia has certainly solidified Assad’s position over the past four or so years, but the regime in Damascus still has a long way to go to regain full control over the country. U.S. President Donald Trump recently committed to leaving a token force in the country, despite earlier pledges for a full withdrawal , which will continue to work with American allies and local partners in the eastern portion of country. An American garrison near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders that has been a thorn in Assad’s side for years doesn’t look to be going anywhere any time soon, either. This is to say nothing of Iran’s involvement in Syria , which has led to a low-grade, persistent conflict between the Syrian regime and Israel , and Turkey’s occupation of significant portions of Northwestern Syria. Russia itself has been jostling with Iran for the title of Assad’s primary benefactor. None of this is particularly in line with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most recent declaration of complete victory over anti-regime terrorists in December 2017. Russian President Vladimir Putin, second from the right, stands next Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, in the blue suit, during a visit in December 2017 in which Russia’s leader claimed absolute victory over terrorists in the country., Office of the President of Russia The vehicles on the train that originally came into Syria as aid to forces the United States or its allies support also feeds the Kremlin’s narrative that the U.S. government is backing terrorist groups in the region. Russian officials routinely make these conspiratorial claims without providing any evidence to deflect from its own malign behavior in Syria and complicity and active participation in the Assad regime’s brutal offensives . But beyond the Syria conflict itself, the train-based show is also just part of Putin’s ever-increasing appeals to national sentiment to cement his own position in Russia. This has included weaponizing history , especially that of the Second World War and the Soviet Union, and state sponsorship of movies and other popular media that espouse the Kremlin’s various foreign and domestic policy positions. Despite the name, Russian authorities are clearly billing the “Syrian Fracture” as a family event, sure to bring smiles to adults and children alike. From the pictures of the train’s stops so far, people certainly seem to be braving the winter weather to come out and see the spectacle for themselves. A child sits on a motorcycle Russian forces captured in Syria that is now part of the train-based propaganda tour., Russian MoD Just using a train for the propaganda tour at all seems particularly Russian, with rail remaining a particularly important mode of transportation in the country for both civilian and military purposes. In 2016, the Kremlin reactivated a pair of special armored military trains and, for a period, Russia considered plans for new rail-based intercontinental ballistic missiles . The train-based exhibits certainly help bring the general ambiance of Patriot Park to Russians in more remote areas who can’t make the trip to Kubinka. In January 2019, the Russian military acquired a number of World War II-era T-34/85 tanks from Laos as part a sale of newer tanks to the small Southeast Asian country. The Kremlin shipped them from the Far East to a depot closer to Moscow via train, which became an impromptu propaganda tour itself and may have prompted the decision to kick off the new rail-based show. If the “Syrian Fracture” garners enough interest on its country-wide trip, it seems likely that we might see more propaganda trains roll out in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 27, 2019","Boeing Just Teased A Big Reveal For Australia’s Avalon Air Show, What Could It Be?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing Australia’s Twitter account posted a glitzy, but straight-up cryptic video teasing what it says will be a big announcement coming on February 27th, 2019 at this year’s Avalon Air Show in Australia. The video shows a few sections of a CGI rendered aircraft and ends with the statements: “Force Projection. Force Protection. Force Multiplier.” So what is this all about? Well, it’s impossible to say for sure, but clearly, Boeing has something unique to unveil, even if just in concept form, or they wouldn’t hype it to such a high degree. Last time they did something similar, it was to unveil the MQ-25 Stingray tanker-drone prototype. At first glance, the pieces of an aircraft they do show seem to be similar to those found on Boeing’s T-X next-generation jet trainer aircraft that successfully took the prize of becoming the USAF’s replacement of the venerable T-38C Talon. There is potentially a tender approaching from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for just such a craft. Their current fleet of Hawk 127 trainers has gone through a mid-life update giving them extended life and relevancy, but eventually, these aircraft will need to be replaced or their lives extended through a deep upgrade. With this in mind, a jet trainer with far higher performance and more advanced avionics than what the current Hawk 127 offers, one that is more representative of what RAAF pilots will face flying the Super Hornet, Growler , and Joint Strike Fighter , could soon be on Canberra’s weapons wish list. RAAF Hawk 127., Robert Frola/Wikicommons Defense journalist Mike Yeo spelled out Australia’s modernization plans in a recent article as told by a recent Australian government whitepaper. The piece specifically highlights the looming requirement for a new or improved advanced jet trainer, stating in part: The whitepaper also flagged the potential replacement of the RAFF’s lead-in fighter training system. The replacement program was expected to begin in 2022 and last until the end of the next decade. The service is currently operating the BAE Systems Hawk 127 as its lead-in fighter trainer, with the fleet nearing the end of an upgrade program to keep the type relevant for training pilots who will go on to fly advanced fighters. The Hawks are expected to continue service in Australia until around 2026. But Steve Drury, BAE Systems Australia’s director of aerospace and integrated systems, told Defense News that the service life of the aircraft could be extended by another 10 years. During an interview last year, the chief of the RAAF, Air Marshal Leo Davies, told Defense News that the service was considering several different options for a future fighter trainer, and that extending the Hawk’s service was also under consideration. Clearly, there is an opportunity here for Boeing to step in with its T-X aircraft—a plane that was recently given the USAF’s coveted seal of approval—and make a strong case for the RAAF moving to a higher performance advanced jet trainer than investing more money in its decades-old Hawks. Commonality with the USAF trainer fleet will also provide certain synergies and ensure a steady logistics and upgrade pipeline for decades to come. In addition, Boeing could offer the T-X in a ‘TF’ configuration, where the plane is basically configured as a light fighter, as well as an advanced jet trainer. The T-X taking on other non-undergraduate pilot training roles has always been discussed as part of the T-X program and the quick migration of Boeing’s design to a light fighter/trainer configuration is something we have posited since Boeing won the contract. Boeing is now openly discussing making a light fighter version of the T-X for export. Not only does such a configuration provide an even more capable advanced trainer, but it can also take on lower-end tactical roles, such as close air support, and even air sovereignty missions, to some degree. Boeing’s winning T-X design., Boeing The only thing that doesn’t add up here is that the imagery we see in the video doesn’t line up perfectly with Boeing’s T-X design. It is similar, but the tails have a slightly different rudder configuration and shape and the leading-edge root extension shown isn’t found on the T-X as we know it today. These could just be a product of artistic license or even a more refined, production representative T-X design that has yet to be shown to the public by Boeing. This would be in no way unheard of. Often times proof of concept aircraft or technology demonstrators can look remarkably less refined in their production configuration, although we have had no indication that this would be so for Boeing’s two T-X aircraft currently flying. Another possibility is that this is an unrelated unmanned aircraft. In particular, one that can be used as either a 5th generation aerial target (5GAT) or as an unmanned combat air vehicle, one most likely designed for high performance and to serve in a ‘loyal wingman’ role. In fact, the features shown look similar to the design of the 5GAT that the Pentagon is currently developing . That craft is envisioned to work as an affordable 5th generation fighter surrogate. One that is transonic speed capable and threat-representative, but also relatively simple to manufacture and low cost. 5GAT is envisioned as serving to train pilots and radar operators on land and at sea. The craft will also be used for high-end live-fire destructive testing. Currently, the QF-16 Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) can only provide a 4th generation threat representation. With foreign adversaries putting low-observable fighters into operation, this is no longer enough. The recently released 2018 DOT&E report includes 5GAT and its progress towards an operational capability, stating: “DOT&E has been investigating the means to develop a full-scale aerial target to represent the characteristics of fifth-generation threat aircraft in order to adequately assess the performance of current and future U.S. air defense weapon systems. The 5GAT study effort began in 2006 and examined the design and fabrication of a dedicated 5GAT. The 5GAT team – comprised of Air Force and Navy experts, retired Skunk Works engineers, and industry experts – completed the preliminary design in 2016. The fully owned Government design includes the aircraft outer mold line, internal structures, loads analysis, propulsion, and subsystems. The DOD provided additional funding in FY18-19 to complete the final design, tooling, fabrication, and fight tests (FY19), and to build a second prototype. The 5GAT effort is currently building the first demonstration prototype, including flight propulsion, system integration, and flight simulation/verification activities. The team built one full-scale, flight-representative wing that will be used for structural load tests and a system integration laboratory, as well as a full-scale test article for radar cross-section testing. The prototyping effort will provide cost-informed alternative design and manufacturing approaches for future air vehicle acquisition programs, and verified cost data for all-composite aircraft design/development, alternative tooling approaches, and innovative management applications. The 5GAT effort can also be used to assist with future weapon system design/development, planning and investment, and future analysis of alternative activities. It is also intended to demonstrate reduced signature, basic aerodynamic performance, alternative cost models for aircraft development, and provision for special mission systems.” Kratos Defense and Security Solutions and 5-D Systems have both acknowledged their involvement on the Pentagon-owned 5GAT program. Conceptual rendering of 5GAT. Almost its entire airframe is built out of carbon fiber material. , Sierra Technical Services Clearly, Australia would have an interest in this capability to train its aircrews and air defense system operators, including those at sea, how to fend off stealthy high-performance aircraft, especially considering China has two stealth fighters currently flying , and the most advanced of which is operational . China also is very active in the stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle development space. At the same time, Australia has been working and spending to drastically boost its air combat capability. This has included the procurement of high-end electronic warfare aircraft , giving them a capability in this space only rivaled by the US. In fact, a 5GAT like aircraft concept that can carry even a small payload begins to merge with an attritable (optionally disposable/low cost) unmanned combat air vehicle concept. This is another capability the U.S. is working on bringing to fruition via a number of initiatives , including Kratos Defense’s X-58 drone , which you can read the latest on here. An unmanned combat air vehicle that is capable of some semi-autonomous missions and can operate in the loyal wingman role , where it is ‘tethered’ to and takes directions from a nearby manned platform via data-link, makes a lot of sense for Australia as it would boost their air combat capabilities without needing to buy additional high-cost fighters or train new aircrews. It also would also make all their fighter force more survivable and capable of adapting to hostile threats on the fly. In addition, it would also increase their fighter cadre’s magazine capacity, sensor diversity, range. The drones themselves can also be networked together in a swarm, giving them greater capability than the sum of their parts. The USAF has repeatedly said that it wants man-machine teaming with UCAVs in the loyal wingman role in the not so distant future. , USAF video Screencap These concepts can be manifested in distinct aircraft, or potentially blended together in a single airframe, albeit with some compromises. But still, they should be less expensive than a very stealthy, high-end, flying-wing UCAV that is built for semi-autonomous or even autonomous operations deep in enemy territory. A full-on fighter-like UCAV is also possible, but due to cost and the investment Australia has already made in their growing fleet of F-35s, this seems doubtful at this time. Also, high kinetic performance would mean sacrificing stealth and range, something that makes little sense really. And we know by the features Boeing has shown that this aircraft is designed for fighter-like speed and maneuverability, not extreme stealthiness and long range. Yet the possibility that Australia wants some sort of advanced drone force of some kind shouldn’t come as a surprise. The UK just announced they would be pursuing similar capabilities in the near term. Still, we don’t know of any information that states Boeing is actively working on any type of unmanned system that fits any of these descriptions at this time. It would be surprising if they weren’t working on a high-performance loyal wingman drone, at least to a conceptual degree. But once again, we have to state that these are just guesses based on the limited information we have at this time. Maybe it could end up being something else entirely. What do you think?

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 28, 2018",Northrop Grumman Is Vying To Give B-52 Bomber A Game-Changing New Radar,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman’s AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) that is already slated to be installed in F-16s from five countries, including the U.S. , is now in the running to give the USAF’s venerable B-52H Stratofortress fleet a massive upgrade in sensor capability. The current radar installed under the B-52’s radome, the AN/APQ-166 mechanically scanned array radar, is relatively ancient, with its last major update occurring over 30 years ago. Fast forward to today and the B-52 is slated to serve into the second half of the century. In order to do so, it is getting a slew of enhancements. These include new smart weapons racks , heavy-weight weapons pylons , new engines , and upgraded communications systems and avionics. A new radar is also a central part of this upgrade pathway. This is where SABR comes in. In a press release dated February 26th, 2019, Northrop Grumman laid out its case for furnishing a new radar to the B-52 fleet: Northrop Grumman’s SABR system design leverages proven, fifth-generation Active Electronically Scanned Array radar capabilities of the AN/APG-77 on the F-22 Raptor and the AN/APG-81 on the F-35 Lightning II. SABR provides a reliable, cost-effective, off-the-shelf, low-risk radar upgrade solution for multiple platforms. “The SABR and SABR-Global Strike family of radars provides differentiating capability for air dominance and strike missions,” said Tom Jones, vice president and general manager, airborne C4ISR systems, Northrop Grumman. “Our hot production and sustainment lines are already in place to support our current and future customers’ needs for decades to come.” Northrop Grumman’s SABR is under consideration by Boeing for the B-52 Bomber Modernization Radar System, which includes engineering, manufacturing, development and delivery of an initial seven radar units. The USAF has expressed a desire to upgrade the entire B-52 fleet with a new radar system. Additionally, a version of SABR has been developed for the B-1B fleet. USAF The version of SABR being eyed for the B-52 is truly off-the-shelf. It is the same radar system that is being installed in F-16s. A more capable version of SABR with a scaled-up array— nearly three times the size of a fighter-sized SABR—is also available and has been installed on a B-1B. It is known as the aforementioned SABR-Global Strike. But Boeing, who is running the upgrade program, not the USAF, seems more interested in the most cost-effective plug-and-play solution that will require minimal customization, which is the baseline SABR with the fighter-sized antenna. The original AN/APG-164 passively scanned array (PSA) radar fitted to the B-1B fleet (Right) and the SABR-GS (left)., Northrop Grumman The addition of a modern AESA radar to the B-52’s sensor suite would be a game changer. A radar like SABR offers a dramatic boost in range, fidelity, and flexibility and it would enhance the B-52’s targeting, surveillance, and situational awareness capabilities. The ability to make detailed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) maps of the surface of the earth and to provide advanced ground moving target indicator (GMTI) capabilities alone would result in synergistic effects not only for the B-52 itself, but also for other platforms and weapons that can exploit that data in near real-time via data-link With a radar like SABR, the B-52 could far better identify and engage ground targets in all weather and at standoff ranges. It would also allow the B-52 to be a better anti-ship weapon than it already is, being able to spot vessels and classify them from long distances so that it can employ advanced anti-ship missiles against them. You can read more about this type of scenario here. SABR being installed on an F-16. , Northrop Grumman In addition to the core functions of a bomber radar, an AESA upgrade could give the B-52H advanced electronic attack capabilities—a latent capability of advanced AESA radars—and the ability to send large amounts of data to other platforms over long distances—another lesser known potential capability of AESA radars. And yes, SABR could give the BUFF an organic and very potent air-to-air capability. Providing the B-52 with the ability to defend itself from aerial threats would give it better survivability in anti-access/area-denial environments. This doesn’t necessarily mean operating in ‘enemy territory,’ but in vast expanses that could be considered contested—where air superiority is not guaranteed. So even though the threat may be limited, giving the B-52 the ability to swat down enemy fighters if they pop up would allow the big bombers to roam more freely without taxing what are certain to be overstretched fighter assets and the tankers that go along with them during a conflict. Closer to the front lines, B-52s could be used to haul outsized , very long-range air-to-air missiles that stealthy fighters can’t carry, and certainly not in significant numbers. These weapons would be networked to take advantage of stealthy targeting assets , like fighters and UCAVs, operating deep within enemy territory. But with its own capable radar onboard, the B-52 would be able to target hostile aircraft and cruise missiles that break through and head toward friendly forces. It’s also worth mentioning that these various activities can be performed simultaneously by an advanced AESA radar. This means that some of the B-52’s six-man crew can use the radar for different functions at the same time. In other words, one crewman can be sweeping the skies for airborne threats while another maps a target area far ahead of the bomber. This seamless multi-mode operation simply isn’t possible with mechanically scanned array radar systems and is especially beneficial for bomber crews with diverse roles. A USAF technician tests one of the B-52’s relatively archaic AN/APQ-166 radars. , USAF So, with all this in mind, giving the B-52 new and far sharper ‘eyes’ will really unlock an exciting new concept of operations for the 60 year old jet, not just provide an upgrade to what it already has. When combined with all the other enhancements it is getting as part of a deep remodeling program of sorts, the Stratofortress will become remarkably ready to take on the threats it will face in the decades to come and will serve as the perfect companion to the soon to be flying B-21 Raider stealth bomber . SABR seen installed on Nothrop Grumman’s Sabreliner testbed jet., Northrop Grumman It’s also worth pondering the opportunity that exists when it comes to plugging these radars into other aircraft, including non-traditional assets that have an aperture large enough to accommodate them. Basic private jets and airliners-types could be relatively easily converted to radar-toting information, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft. Even USAF tankers, like the new KC-46 , could potentially be fitted with a modular AESA that would provide enhanced awareness, ISR, and other functionality for use during or when their tanking functions are not needed. The same could be said for C-130s. It’s really something to think about as the USAF pushes to migrate some of its high-end ISR capabilities away from a small number of purpose-built and expensive assets, and instead relying on a larger constellation of diverse and highly networked platforms. In the meantime, Northrop Grumman’s SABR team seems ready for a duel to the death to see that their radars end up on any and all the platforms the Pentagon wants to install an AESA on, and considering Raytheon will be also looking to do the same , it won’t be a cakewalk for either of them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 27, 2019",Pakistan Says It Scrambled Fighters To Intercept Indian Jets Violating Its Airspace (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but Pakistan claims that Indian military aircraft crossed the Line of Control separating both countries in the hotly contested Jammu and Kashmir region and violated its airspace, possibly in an attempt to strike targets on the Pakistani side. If true, this incident could threaten to provoke a major conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations , who have seen a precipitous decline in relations since a car bomb killed 40 Indian soldiers in Kashmir earlier in February 2019 . Pakistani Major General Asif Ghafoor announced the violation, via his official Twitter account, early on Feb. 26, 2019, local time. He did not say how many Indian aircraft , or what type, had been involved in the reported incident or what the Pakistani Air Force’s response consisted of afterward. An unconfirmed video appeared to show at least one JF-17 Thunder fighter jet heading off into the night at full afterburner. “Indian Air Force violated Line of Control. Pakistan Air Force immediately scrambled. Indian aircrafts gone back,” Major General Ghafoor’s Tweet read. “Details to follow.” Ghafoor subsequently said that the Indian aircraft had head into the “Muzafarabad sector,” which is a narrow portion of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. The Pakistani general added that the intruding planes had jettisoned unspecified stores, which landed near Balakot, which is in Pakistan’s adjacent Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. There were “no casualties or damage.” So far, there does not appear to be an official statement from the Indian government regarding the incident. Online plane spotters using flight tracking software did notice that there was an Indian Air Force Embraer EMB-145 airborne earlier warning aircraft in the skies near the border of Jammu and Kashmir and the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the south. The EMB-145s carry a large domestically-developed active-electronically scanned array radar that is especially adept at looking down from on high and detecting aircraft or cruise missiles. This would make the aircraft ideal for watching for any counter-attack, especially considering the mountainous terrain, which limits the coverage of land-based radars. Another one of the aircraft, of which the Indian Air Force only has two, was spotted over the country’s capital New Delhi in the aftermath of the incident, as well. An Il-78 Midas aerial refueling tanker was in the area, too. On Feb. 24, 2019 , Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan, head of the Pakistani Air Force, had said his service was ready to “thwart any misadventure by the enemy,” referring to India. Relations between the two countries have been at an all-time low since a terrorist drove a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device into a bus carrying Indian soldiers on a major highway in the Jammu and Kashmir region on Feb. 14, 2019 . The Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed 40 Indian military personnel and injured dozens more. The Indian government subsequently accused Pakistani authorities of being complicit in the bombing. The final status of Jammu and Kashmir has been at the center of a long-running and often violent dispute between India and Pakistan since the United Kingdom partitioned its Indian colony in 1947 and subsequently granted independence to both countries. “The next steps will be taken by our armed forces,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said on Feb. 16, 2019 , raising concerns that the two countries, both of which have nuclear weapons , might be headed toward another major conflict. “What should be the time, what should be the plan, and what should be the form, they have been authorized to take all these decisions,” he added. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan had promised to take action against Pakistan-based groups if India provides “actionable intelligence,” but Indian authorities dismissed this offer as “lame excuse,” given Jaish-e-Mohammed’s known history of operating from Pakistani territory. Khan also threatened “retaliation, without even thinking,” in response to any unilateral India strike. Update: 10:25pm EST— There is no official statement from the Indian government about the incident so far, but Indian news outlets and defense analysts, citing anonymous sources, are reporting that a flight of Indian Mirage 2000 combat jets struck at least one Jaish-e-Mohammed camp across the line of control. It is still unclear exactly where the strike or strikes may have occurred and whether or not the stores that fell near Balakot were part of the operation. Pakistani Major General Ghafoor did post pictures to Twitter showing the remains of the stores that the Indian aircraft released in the vicinity of Balakot. An actual strike in that area would be significant since it is not in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, but in Pakistan proper. Regardless, this appears to be the first time the Indian Air Force has crossed the line of control to hit targets on the other side since the 1971 war between India and Pakistan. There are also unconfirmed reports that clashes have erupted on the ground along the Line of Control. Online plane spotters also noticed an Indian Air Force C-17 Globemaster III and an An-32 Cline had flown to Jammu and Kashmir, possibly carrying reinforcements. In 2016, India did launch a cross border raid into Pakistani-controlled Kashmir targeting terrorist camps. Update: 11:00pm EST— Unconfirmed reports say that as many as 200 to 300 Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists may have died in the strikes. Update: 11:20pm EST— In what appears to be the first statement from an Indian government official, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, India’s Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare, has Tweeted out a statement appearing to confirm the strikes. The social media post also includes “#Balakot” and “#SurgicalStrike2,” which appears to confirm the location was in Pakistan proper and making a reference to the 2016 cross-border raid, commonly known as the “ Surgical Strikes .” There has still not been an official Indian government statement on the incident. Update: 11:50pm EST— Rahul Ghandi, an Indian member of parliament and head of the country’s main opposition Congress Party, has Tweeted out his own message appearing to confirm the strikes, but without any further details. Update: 1:20am EST— Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale has given the first formal Indian government statement on the incident. In it, he confirmed India conducted strikes on Jaish-e-Mohammed in Balokot and has said they were preemptive and based on actionable intelligence that the group was planning another attack. Gokhale also said that the Indian military was still assessing the results of the strikes, but said that “a very large number” of terrorists, including a senior commander, had died as a result. He offered no details on the strike force composition or the munitions employed.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 1, 2019",Here’s What It Looked Like Inside The Airbus That Was Wing Rocking Violently Over Gibraltar,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A crazy video of British Airways Flight BA492, an Airbus A320 flying from London Heathrow to Gibraltar, appeared online today showing the aircraft climbing while its wings rocked violently back and forth. At first, many thought the video was a fake, but it turns out it was real and now we have additional footage of what it looked like for passengers riding inside the teetering jet. The video shot from the ground was taken shortly after a go-around was initiated during an attempt to land at Gibraltar International Airport . You can see the aircraft rolling hard from left to right as it climbs away. Supposedly, high winds were the cause of the go-around, but there aren’t any reports of extreme weather in the area beyond 25-knot winds. These are nothing to slouch at, especially if they came from a direction that would result in a high crosswind component for the landing, but the explanation of those winds pushing a large jet like the A320 into such a sudden, violent, and extended wing rocking motion really doesn’t make all that much sense. https://youtube.com/watch?v=78ZDaQ0UYZg From the looks of the videos, a few factors could be at play here beyond just a wind gust or wind shear. The violent and uncontrolled wing rocking motion is somewhat indicative of the beginning of a stall. During a stall, the inner part of a swept wing ‘stops flying’ first, which can induce an uncontrolled wing-rocking motion as the outer sections maintain lift and the aircraft’s ailerons continue to function, albeit in a more sluggish manner. Catalyzed by a gust from one side of the plane, this could be at least a partial answer to what we are seeing. In addition, while counter-acting this condition or just a major gust of wind itself, the Airbus, which uses a fly-by-wire flight control system, may have entered into something of a pilot-induced oscillation , further exacerbating the rolling motions, albeit briefly. We have to stress that any or a combination of these factors, including a very unique and focused burst of wind/wind shear magnified by the massive outcropping, could be at fault here. There could also have been other issues in the cockpit at the time that we are not aware of. We are reaching out to our airline pilot contacts for their take on the incident. After the aborted approach, BA492 was diverted to Malaga in Spain where it landed without incident. In the end, everyone walked away ok and the plane wasn’t damaged. In fact, the passengers seemed to take the sudden rollercoaster ride in stride if the audio from the onboard videos is anything to go by.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 13, 2018",Iran Claims It Tested A Submarine Launched Anti-Ship Missile Capable Of Standoff Strikes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran recently released footage showing one of its Ghadir -class submarines firing a new Jask-2 submarine-launched anti-ship cruise missile during a major drill stretching from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, including in the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz . This came less than a week after the country commissioned the first of its larger Fateh -class subs, which reportedly also have the ability to employ these weapons. The Jask-2 launch occurred on Feb. 24, 2019 . This was the third and last day of Velayat 97, an annual exercise that included naval, air, and shore-based elements, which began on Feb. 22, 2019. The Fateh -class submarine , which is still undergoing trials, also reportedly took part in the drills, as did the Iranian Navy’s new corvette Sahand . Iran said that the missile hit a mock target, but there is no indepedent confirmation of the test’s success. “Our Qadir-class submarines have so far fired cruise missiles and Fateh has this capability too and we will display it in future drills,” Iranian Navy commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi had told the semi-official Fars News Agency ahead of the exercise on Feb. 18, 2019 . This implied that Iran had previously tested the Jask-2, either at sea or using a land-based test fixture. https://youtube.com/watch?v=T3t8-DM76_Y Jask-2 is variant of derivative of the existing Nasr-1 anti-ship cruise missile and has a “different” range, according to Khanzadi. The Nasr-1 is itself a copy of the Chinese C-704 , which can hit targets out to around 20 miles. An Iranian Nasr-1 flies from a shore-based launcher during the Velayat-90 exercise in 2012. , Mohammad Sadegh Heydari via Wikimedia The video footage seemed to suggest that Iran had only fired one Jask-2 during the exercise, but it may have launched additional missiles. Joseph Dempsey, Research Associate for Defense and Military Analysis at the U.K.-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies noted on social media that the background features in different clips within the video montage indicated Iranian submarines fired at least two of the missiles. Iran has been working on a submarine-launched cruise missile capability for some time. In 2017, there were reports that the Iranian Navy had tried and failed to launch a Jask-2. Two years earlier, Iran released footage that it claimed was of a submarine firing a cruise missile. It’s not clear if the weapon in that case was the Jask-2 or a separate, earlier design. We also don’t know how mature the Jask-2 design is. The video shows a Ghadir -class firing a Jask-2 while apparently running on the surface, while other clips show the submarine semi-submerged. An Iranian Ghadir -class submarine., AP Photo/Fars News Agency, Ebrahim Norouzi Reports from the failed 2017 test said that the missile malfunctioned during an underwater test-launch. Launching the weapon closer to the surface could have reflected the Iranian’s still being unsure about whether the Jask-2 would fire properly from any significant depth. The ultimate goal, of course, would be for submarines such as the Ghadir s, or the new Fateh -class, to gain a stand-off anti-ship capability while submerged or almost fully-submerged, where they are hardest to detect and least vulnerable. Both of these boats are diesel-electric, making them very quiet when submerged. They do, however, lack other advanced features , such as an air-independent propulsion system , that would allow them to remain underwater for protracted periods of time and otherwise make them difficult to spot. Iran’s new Fateh -class submarine prior to its launch., IRNA Even if the range of the Jask-2 is shorter than that of the Nasr-1, it could still provide a very useful capability to the Iranian Navy, especially in the narrow Strait of Hormuz. Iran has routinely threatened to blockade this strategic waterway , which a substantial portion of the world’s oil exports rely on to reach their destinations, particularly in response to American threats of additional sanctions or other actions against the regime in Tehran. The regime in Tehran also regularly criticizes the presence of the U.S. Navy in region, especially its carrier battle groups , in general. On Feb. 1, 2019, Iranian state television broadcast the video below, showing a cartoonish approximation of a Ghadir -class submarine sinking similar caricatures of an American aircraft carrier and its escorting vessels. “This strait will be open if Iran can sell its oil,” General Alireza Tangsiri, in charge of the naval arm of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, told the semi-official Tasnim News Agency on Feb. 25, 2019 . The clearly implication is that the Iranians could seek to shut down the waterway if the United States succeeds in its efforts to push its allies and partners to stop buying the country’s oil. There is a real question about how capable the Ghadir -class might be a missile boats, with only two torpedo tubes and little internal space for additional weapons. With more than 20 of the submarines, Iran might look to make up for their extremely limited magazine depth by employing them en masse to launch barrages of the missiles. Jask-2 offers Iran a means to launch submarines attacks outside the inner most anti-submarine defenses of naval surface task force, such as an American Carrier Strike Group. Of course, the missile would still have to survive a multi-layered anti-air defensive umbrella to score a hit. Still, a submarine-launched anti-ship cruise missile capability of any kind would only add to the array of threats Iran can bring to bear in the region, including ship- and shore-launched anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles , naval mines , swarms of small boats , including suicide craft , and more. We at The War Zone have explored these very real threats in detail on multiple occasions in the past. The Fateh -class boats could present an even more significant challenge given their larger size and greater endurance. At present, Iran only has one Fateh , with a second undergoing initial trials. It seems likely that this fleet will expand as time goes on, though. https://youtube.com/watch?v=EL4W4FkRTsQ These submarines can reportedly conduct patrols up to 35 days long and could have a total range of around 4,200 miles. If true, this could give Iran a true domestically-produced regional submarine capability that would allow operations well out into the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and the Red Sea. The new boats could present an added threat in the equally strategic and narrow Mandeb Strait that links that links the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. At present, only Iran’s three Russian-made Kilo -class submarines have this kind of range. In addition, the Jask-2, along with the Fatehs , are simply another important demonstration of the capabilities of Iran’s defense industrial base, even under international sanctions and growing pressure from the United States, including reports of a reinvigorated American effort to actively sabotage advanced Iranian weapons programs. Though its purported achievements in the defense sector are often nothing more than propaganda and bluster , the Iranians do continue to field new weapons that do present real threats to their opponents. Iran’s work on a submarine-launched cruise missile and its growing submarine force are decidedly in the latter category. The two together present a new challenge for foreign naval operations, including the activities of the U.S. Navy, in the Persian Gulf and potentially beyond.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",This Containerized Missile Launcher Could Give Almost Any Ship Short-Range Air Defenses,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. European missile consortium MBDA is now offering a containerized short-range air defense system utilizing the Mistral heat-seeking missile . The multi-national company is pitching the system as ideal for use on support ships , such as naval supply vessels that do not have their own fixed defenses, but it could have other roles, including on land. On Feb. 17, 2019, MBDA unveiled what it calls the Self-Protection Integrated Mistral Module ( SPIMM ) at the Navdex exposition in the United Arab Emirates. The company derived the system from their existing SIMBAD-RC naval mount for the Mistral missile, which has been in production since 2014 . “The SPIMM enables the urgent and rapid adaptation of supply vessels or landing platform docks to cope with new threats, or for using them in contested areas,” Christophe Leduc MBDA’s Naval Defense Systems Product Executive, said in a statement on Feb. 17, 2019. “This system illustrates MBDA’s ability to understand its customers’ needs and to quickly come up with effective and functional solutions.” SPIMM consists of the same turret as the SIMBAD-RC , which has two ready-to-launch missiles, on top of a two-man control station. The container also has storage space for four additional missiles. An artist’s conception of a containerized SPIMM firing a Mistral missile., MBDA A 360-degree panoramic infrared camera system detects targets and cues the missiles. Each Mistral, which has a maximum range of close to four miles, then uses its own imaging infrared seeker to home in on the target. This guidance system means the weapon can hit threats with relatively limited thermal signatures and has added resistance to being duped by decoy flares and other countermeasures. In the maritime role, Mistral has the ability to engage low-flying combat aircraft, helicopters, and small unmanned aerial vehicles , as well as act as a point-defense system against incoming anti-ship missiles. In January 2019, the company announced it had successfully tested the weapon against surrogate small surface targets , representing threats such as fast attack craft and suicide boats . Unlike with SIMBAD-RC, SPIMM does not require a ship to have anything besides space to accommodate the container and an electric connection linking it to the vessel’s own power supply. Built to conform the general dimensions of an ISO-standard shipping container, existing cranes and forklifts can readily move and reposition the seven-ton, 10-foot long system. The entire system offers an immensely flexible self-protection system for ships that don’t already have close-in defenses. Though SPIMM wouldn’t be capable of tackling high threat environments by itself, it could add an extra layer of protection on otherwise unarmed support ships operating in those area together with surface combatant escorts. Shore-based anti-ship missiles are increasingly proliferating, even among non-state actors, which only increases the value of being able to rapidly install the SPIMM on supply vessels with with limited defenses. There is also an increasing need to be prepared to defend against swarms of manned and unmanned small surface craft , including boats laden with explosives , even in relatively low-risk environments. There is a similarly growing risk of mass drone attacks or hostile drone swarms , as well. Various countries , including the United States , have already taken to positioning ground-based short-range air defense systems , including “soft-kill” electronic warfare systems, on the decks of amphibious ships to provide this kind of capability when necessary. SPIMM offers a more robust “hard-kill” punch, something more capable than an individual with a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile for instance, to go along with soft-kill systems. The containerized system would also offer this sort of protection to vessels without embarked ground forces or ships that had just delivered those units to their destination. The video below shows Egyptian Avenger short-range surface-to-air missile systems on the deck of one of the country’s Mistral-class amphibious assault ships. SPIMM isn’t the first containerized air defense system concept, either. After the Falklands conflict in 1982, the United Kingdom considered a concept for turning container ships into impromptu aircraft carriers, known as the Ship Borne Containerized Air Defense System ( SCADS ). This proposal, which didn’t come to fruition, involved a containerized Seawolf surface-to-air missile system. The U.K. Ministry of Defense recently announced plans to acquire new Future Littoral Strike Ships (FLSS), a concept that also appears to use militarized commercial vessels. The Royal Navy might again containerized air defense system, such as SPIMM, as a way of rapidly adding close-in self-defense capability to those ships. The containerized system could be ideal close-in defense add-on for ships configured as sea bases , as well as unpowered barges and offshore platforms . The containerized system might also present a cost-effective alternative to more purpose-built fixed air defense systems on ships, in general. A country’s navy would not necessarily have to purchase SPIMMs for every ship in need of these defenses, instead swapping them between vessels in between deployments. The SPIMM’s flexibility also means that MBDA may soon be looking to offer it in the land-based role. The European consortium already offers a number of different vehicle-mounted Mistral options with manned and remote-control turrets. Mistral’s most basic launch option is a man-portable, shoulder-fired system. But the container-based version, which would need an external power source, could be attractive to countries interested in rapidly setting up fixed point air defenses at established bases or more austere forward operating locations . Any truck capable of carrying ISO-standard containers would be able to reposition them as necessary, too. It is possible that a future SPIMM variant with self-contained power source could completely negate the need for a dedicated host vehicle. There has been a growing trend toward the development of containerized weapon systems of various types in recent years, in general, due to the flexibility this type of packaging offers. There are already examples of containerized remote-controlled sentry systems , turreted mortars , anti-ship cruise missiles , and even short-range ballistic missiles . We at The War Zone were first to report in October 2018 that Northrop Grumman had revealed a concept for a containerized ground-based anti-radiation missile launcher to destroy enemy air defenses, as well as other targets. This system will be able to use either the company’s AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) or the up-coming Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range ( AARGM-ER ). SPIMM’s appearance on the market only adds to this vast array of containerized weapon options. The system’s ability to engage a variety of air, missile, and surface targets only adds to its flexibility and could definitely make it very appealing in a variety of roles at sea and on land.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 9, 2019",Picture Of Newest M1 Abrams Tank Variant With Previously Unseen Turret Armor Emerges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A picture has popped-up online showing the latest variant of the Army’s M1 Abrams tank with what appears to be a new armor package on its turret. The U.S. Army is already in the process of adding the Trophy active protection system to the vehicles, which will help guard against anti-tank guided missiles and infantry anti-tank rockets . But the service is also interested adding additional passive armor in light of the threat of potential adversaries, such as Russia, with their own upgraded tanks and new armor-piercing shells. The Army’s Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona posted a picture of an M1A2 System Enhancement Package Version 3 tank, or M1A2 SEPv3, with both Trophy and the add-on armor package, as well as explosive reactor armor , on its Facebook page on Feb. 21, 2019. It was one of a series of pictures marking a visit by U.S. Army Sergeant Major Michael Crosby, the Command Sergeant Major for the service’s recently activated Futures Command , to the facility. The proving ground is supporting a number of that command’s modernization initiatives. The Army took delivery of the first updated M1A2 SEPv3, also now known as the M1A2C, in October 2017 . General Dynamics Land Systems is in charge of the upgrade program. “This version is the most modernized configuration of the Abrams tank, having improved force protection and system survivability enhancements and increased lethality over the M1A1 and previous M1A2 variants,” U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Justin Shell, then the Abrams Product Manager, said at the rollout in 2017 . “The Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 tank will be the foundation for future incremental system upgrades and can host any mature technology the Army deems operationally relevant.” The M1A2 SEPv3 prototype at the time of the rollout in 2017, without any additional armor., General Dynamics Land Systems There do not appear to be any specific announcements about improved passive armor for the M1A2 SEPv3 in the past beyond statements that the variant would include added ballistic protection . Earlier pictures of the prototype M1A2 SEPv3s show weights on the front of the turret, as well as similar weights on the hull front. These surrogates were supposed to simulate the added weight of the SEPv3’s Next Generation Armor Package (NGAP).  There had been no indication, however, that the final turret shape would change significantly. The M1A2 SEPv3 prototype with weights on the front of the turret and hull., General Dynamics Land systems An image of the M1A2 SEPv3 prototype, now with the M1A2C nomenclature, also showing the weights in place., US Army The prototype for the preceding M1A2 SEPv2 variant was also tested with surrogate weights to simulate that version’s new Heavy Armor Package 3 (HAP-3) passive armor upgrade. The final design, however, did not feature any radical changes to the turret general shape. The M1A2 SEPv2 prototype with weights on the turret and the hull to evaluate the added stress of the then-new HAP-3 armor package., US Army It could also be an additional applique armor package that the Army is simply evaluating at this time and might not end up in the final M1A2 SEPv3 configuration. The added passive armor would just be the latest in a series of defensive additions to the M1A2 SEPv3 configuration. In March 2017, the Army announced that it would begin installing explosive reactive armor (ERA) packages, known as the Abrams Reactive Armor Tile (ARAT), on tanks in Europe, which will also be a feature on the new variants. ERA works by placing “tiles” filed with explosives over specific portions of a tank. When an incoming projectile hits them, they explode outward, helping to prevent it from penetrating into the vehicle. https://youtube.com/watch?v=i3Q1Mj7HHL4 But ERA works best against tank shells, anti-tank guided missiles, or other anti-tank weapons that use high-explosive anti-tank warheads. These warheads need to detonate at a very precise point from the side of their target to be most effective. The explosive tiles can destroy or prematurely detonate them, causing them to malfunction. The Trophy active protection system that will go onto the latest M1A2 SEPv3s is another “hard-kill” system that works by firing a shotgun-like blast to knock down incoming threats. The Army first announced it would install the Israeli-made defensive system on its tanks in September 2017 . Unfortunately, these systems are far less effective against fast-flying kinetic penetrators , such as those in modern armor-piercing discarding-sabot tank shells, which rely on sheer force to break through armor. So, there is still a need for a passive armor layer to defend against these threats. That the Army might now be interested in additional armor protection beyond what it had previously planned for the M1A2 SEPv3 would make sense. There has been a general shift in focus within the U.S. military toward being prepared for a potential high-end conflict against “great power” adversaries, such as Russia and China, in recent years. Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, followed by the Kremlin’s active and conventional intervention elsewhere in that country on behalf of Ukrainian separatists , had already prompted the Army to begin pursuing efforts to rapidly revitalize its armored forces . At the same time, Russia has been working on a fleet of upgraded tanks, as well as continuing to work on the new T-14 Armata . Though the Russian Army looks years away from acquiring any meaningful numbers of the T-14, it has made significant improvements to its existing T-72, T-80, and T-90 tanks. The latest T-90MSs use the same 2A82 125mm main gun as the T-14, which allows them to use higher-velocity ammunition. The Russians developed the 2A82 specifically to not require any additional internal space inside a turret over the previous 2A46, which makes it readily adaptable to existing tanks with the older gun. It seems likely that the improved T-72B3s and T-80BVMs , or future iterations thereof, will also get new main guns. A Russian T-90MS tank., Vitaly Kuzmin The problem with more passive armor is that it also adds significant additional weight to the Abrams, which could limit its mobility. The existing variants of the tank tip the scales at more than 70 tons, making them some of the heaviest main battle tanks in the world. Separate upgrades to help the M1 simply out-range opponents might help mitigate the need for further passive armor upgrades to defeat increasingly threatening kinetic ammunition. The Army is in the process of developing the next iteration of the Abrams, known variously as the M1A2 SEPv4 or M1A2D , which is set to feature greatly improved sensors to increase the range at which it can spot and engage threats. An improved gun, either a longer barrel variant of the tanks existing 120mm, or a larger caliber design altogether, will probably be part of the new variant, as well. The Army has talked in the past about networking the tanks together with other vehicles, including unmanned ground vehicles , as well as unmanned aerial vehicles, in order to use precision-guided rounds against targets beyond its own line-of-sight. The M1A2 SEPv3 already includes an ammunition data link to support re-programmable ammunition, including the future XM1147 Advanced Multi-Purpose (AMP) shell. The multi-function AMP will replace four different existing rounds, including two variants of the M830 high-explosive anti-tank shell, the M908 high explosive shell for destroying fortifications and other “obstacles,” and the M1028 anti-personnel canister shell. But added range is not something that armored units will always be able to take advantage of, especially in dense urban environments, which the U.S. military views as an increasingly likely setting for future conflicts. On the other hand, discarding-sabot tank shells are not necessarily as much of a threat in these types of contrained battlespaces. Regardless, Abrams at their current weight already tear up paved roads and have difficulty safely crossing smaller bridges and adding any more heavy armor would only exacerbate those issues in an urban fight. In the period following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the Army did developed what became known as the Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) specifically for Abrams-equipped units operating in city environments. It’s possible the armor package that Sergeant Major Crosby saw is a new modular or otherwise readily reconfigurable kit that the service can install or remove from the Abrams depending on the threat level. From the latest picture of the M1A2 SEPv3 prototype, if nothing else, we can see that the Army is continuing to at least evaluate its passive armor options to ensure the M1’s hide is a tough as possible, and as is practical, to guard against the newest threats from potential adversaries.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 21, 2019",Oregon F-15 Eagle Fired Millions Worth Of Missiles Into The Sea Before Emergency Landing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, we reported on an emergency arrested landing made by an Oregon Air National Guard F-15C from the 142nd Fighter Wing . The jet had been in the air for some time before it made its way back to its home base at Portland International Airport and landed via catching the emergency cable with its tail hook on runway 28L. Now, The War Zone has learned that the aircraft in question was part of an alert training mission and was fully armed with live air-to-air missiles when it took off. During the emergency, the decision was made to fire off all of its armament into the Pacific Ocean before returning to land, an operation that is apparently quite rare in the F-15 community. The aircraft, which had the callsign “ROCK 42,” a moniker associated directly with the alert mission , had a gear issue upon takeoff with one of its main gear failing to retract. Our sources close to the F-15 community have told us the particular issue with this aircraft’s landing gear was of questionable severity. We won’t go into any more detail on that aspect of the story at this time, but the diagnosis of the issue, or lack thereof, ended up prompting the F-15C to fly out over the Oregon Coast and into the vast military operating areas (MOAs) that Eagles from Portland frequent on a daily basis, and fire off its missile load on a ballistic trajectory into the sea below. The jet was limited to roughly 250 miles per hour the entire trip due to the overspeed limitation on the F-15’s landing gear when extended. The missiles were fired instead of dropped for a number of factors. First, the underwing missiles cannot be jettisoned without also dropping the pylons and the aircraft’s wing tanks. Second, hitting the water at high mach speeds damages the missiles severely, if not destroying them altogether. But dumping the Eagle’s weapons load came at a very high cost. Depending on how many missiles were carried and of what type, the price of sending that F-15C’s entire arsenal to Davy Jones’s locker added up to millions of dollars. Usually, alert F-15s will go out with six or eight missiles. Traditionally, such a configuration will include four AIM-120C AMRAAMs and a pair of AIM-9X Sidewinders. Alternatively, they will fly with a full loadout of six AIM-120 AMRAAMs and two AIM-9X Sidewinders . Here is an exact unit cost of each missile and the sub-variants that are in production and/or are presently carried by F-15C Eagles. The numbers are taken directly from various fiscal year Pentagon budgets: AIM-9X Block II (as of FY19 budget): ~$408,000 AIM-9X Block I (as of FY09 budget): ~$250,000 (~$292,000 in 2019 dollars) AIM-120D (as of FY19 budget): ~$1.5 million AIM-120C-7 (as of FY09 budget): ~1.0 million (~$1.16 in 2019 dollars) So at the very least, we are talking about $4.5M worth of missiles here, but that figure is likely somewhat higher. For fighter aircraft that experience sudden emergencies, punching off drop tanks and air-to-ground weaponry does occur. The idea being that doing so makes the jet much lighter, which can help with certain performance or mechanical issues. A byproduct of this is that makes it so a crash landing doesn’t turn into a detonation of high-explosive ordnance designed to cause massive destruction. But firing off a fighter’s air-to-air loadout during an emergency seems to be a far less established practice. In fact, sources that we talked to in the USAF fighter community had never even heard of such a thing occurring in the past. We reached out to the 142nd Fighter Wing for comment and they did confirm that the aircraft’s weaponry was indeed jettisoned before landing, but they weren’t prepared to offer additional details at this time. Our sources have noted that an inquiry is underway as to what exactly happened, what decisions were made, and why they were made. Keep in mind, that the Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) of NORAD was also closely involved with this incident as the alert fighters were under their control as events unfolded. In the end, what matters most is that everyone walked away safely from the emergency landing. But there could be important lessons to learn from this incident and they may not have come cheap considering the amount of advanced air-to-air weaponry that was blasted into the waters off Oregon on Wednesday afternoon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 13, 2022",France Tests Huge 140mm Tank Gun As It Pushes Ahead With Germany On A New Tank Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. French defense contractor Nexter has reportedly been testing a modified Leclerc main battle tank with a massive 140mm main gun as part of the development of a future Franco-German tank, known as the Main Ground Combat System , or MGCS. For decades, France, as well as Germany, among many others, have considered adding bigger cannons to its tanks to improve their armor penetration and range capabilities, but have repeatedly decided not to do so. So, it still remains to be seen how seriously they’ll pursue this course of action now. Jane’s 360 reported the news , which the outlet had learned at the International Armored Vehicles (IAV) 2019 conference in London, on Jan. 24, 2019. The up-gunned Leclerc has fired more than 200 rounds successfully and Nexter claims the weapon is 70 percent more effective than existing NATO-standard 120mm tank guns. The MGCS program, which began in 2012, aims to replace France’s Leclercs and Germany’s Leopard 2 tanks with a common design by 2035. It is unclear if the Leclerc configuration that Jane’s is referring to is materially different from the one that first emerged in 2016. “This is understood to be the first time that a 140 mm gun has been successfully integrated onto a 50-ton MBT [main battle tank],” according to the story, but this could be a reference to a development program that has now been ongoing for multiple years. French defense company GIAT , which subsequently transformed into Nexter, first proposed mounting a 140mm gun onto the Leclerc back in 1996, four years after the tank first entered French service. The company specifically developed an enlarged turret to house a gun of this caliber that France’s Arsenal de Bourges had developed. The French military passed on this T4 turret and it went into storage. Circa 2015, Nexter reportedly reinstalled in onto a chassis that had belonged to a turretless Leclerc MARS armored recovery vehicle. It is pictures of this combination, dubbed Le Terminateur , or The Terminator, which first appeared in a French magazine two years later. Since then, additional images of the tank, now wearing a hard-edged tan-green camouflage scheme known as Scorpion have also appeared online . Regardless, the testing of the gun does point to renewed interest in a larger caliber main gun the final MGCS tank design. In 2016, Germany’s Rheinmetall, which is working together with Nexter on the Franco-German vehicle, also publicly displayed a 130mm gun at that year’s Eurosatory military trade show in France. Rheinmetall had previously worked on a 140mm design, as well. Rheinmetall’s 130mm tank gun. Note the difference in the size of the ammunition, at left, compared to a standard 120mm round., Rheinmetall A reported requirement for the MGCS is for its gun to be at least 50 percent more capable than the existing 120mm types on either the Leclerc or Leopard 2. A larger 130mm or 140mm gun would certainly offer improved range and armor penetration capabilities. The driving force behind this demand appears to be, at least in part, the appearance of Russia’s T-14 Armata tank, which features an improved 125mm 2A82-1M main gun with more capable ammunition. The 2A82M-1M is apparently sized to fit in the same space in a turret as the older, Soviet-era 2A46 125mm gun, meaning that it could potentially be an upgrade option for Russia’s existing designs, such as the T-90 . There have also long been reports in Russian media that the Kremlin is considering adding a larger 152mm main gun onto the Armata, as well, which could out-gun existing NATO tanks and their 120mm guns. Russia’s T-14 tank., Iliya Pitalev/Sputnik via AP China has reportedly been testing larger caliber main guns , as well. So far, though, none of these Russian or Chinese efforts have led to an actual operational design. There are also very real questions about how much the Kremlin can even afford to modernize its tank fleets , at all. While a new 130mm or 140mm gun certainly offers a counter to these developments, real or not, it is not without its drawbacks, too. The most immediate issue is the size of the rounds, which will be bigger than their 120mm counterparts and require larger ammo storage options within any future tank. The 140mm-armed Leclerc, with its enlarged turret, reportedly still requires two-piece ammunition, with the shell separate from the propellant. Even then, it can only hold 31 rounds, nine fewer than the standard version of the tank. A standard Leclerc main battle tank., Wikimedia Bigger rounds have second-order logistical impacts, as well. Each shell weighs more and takes up more space, requiring more effort to deliver the same amount of ammunition to units in the field. A 130mm or 140mm also obviously wouldn’t be able to use existing stockpiles of 120mm ammunition and wouldn’t have ammunition interchangeable with other tanks still using the smaller guns. France and Germany are both members of NATO and this could potentially cause problems with the alliance’s standardization and interoperability requirements . In addition, in the past, the added range and penetration offered the bigger guns offered was relatively modest compared to what engineers could squeeze out of longer 120mm cannons with faster-flying ammunition. In the 1990s, Germany was among many countries to go this route with the Leopard 2A6 variant, which introduced a longer 120mm gun from Rheinmetall that extended the maximum range of the tank by around 1,600 yards – almost a mile – and significantly increased its ability to penetrate enemy armor. These various factors contributed to decisions not just in France, but also in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, to abandon previously plans to add larger caliber main guns to their respective main battle tank designs. The end of the Cold War and a reduced emphasis on conventional ground operations also played a part in the death of those programs. At the same time, these developments may be reaching the limit of how much performance it is possible to get out of a 120mm gun and still have that weapon be practical. Lengthening the barrel is a relatively easy way to increase range and muzzle velocity, but creates new problems the longer it gets. A longer barrel might require higher-pressure ammunition to ensure the shell reaches a consistent peak speed before leaving the muzzle, which would put more strain on the entire gun. The extended proboscis would also increase the tank’s physical footprint, potentially making it more difficult to transport. The U.S. military has had to contend with similar issues in the development of its extended-range 155mm howitzers , which also feature significantly longer barrels than their predecessors. A size comparison of Rheinmetall’s original 120mm gun, its extended L55 variant, and its earlier, proposed 140mm type. It’s new 130mm design is shorter than the 120mm L55., Rheinmetall It may become increasingly attractive then to go to a larger caliber, but shorter main gun instead, regardless of the design demands and logistical issues this might create in the process. It’s worth noting that Rheinmetall’s experimental 130mm gun is shorter than its improved 120mm gun, but is more capable. There has already been a broad level of renewed interest in the potential of larger caliber main guns for tanks across NATO since 2014, when Russia seized of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and subsequent began actively supporting for separatists in that country. After that, the United States and other members of the Alliance rushed to reinvigorate their more traditional combat capabilities , with a particular emphasis on improved armored vehicles , among other things . Beyond tanks, various NATO members have been similarly looking to up-gun lighter armored vehicles to either better match or outrange their Russian counterparts, too. The U.S. Army alone has added a 30mm cannon to some of its Stryker wheeled armored vehicles , which previously only had a .50 caliber machine gun or 40mm automatic grenade launcher. That service is also looking to replace its tracked Bradley Fighting Vehicles and its 25mm main gun with a new design that might come armed with a 50mm cannon . At present, Nexter and Rheinmetall have yet to publicly unveil their proposed design, even in mockup or model form, with or without a new, larger main gun. Nexter and German armored vehicle maker Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, which merged to form KMW+Nexter Defense Systems (KNDS) in 2015, did debut what they called European Main Battle Tank (EMBT) at the Eurosatory arms fair in 2018, but this vehicle featured a Leopard 2 hull with a standard Leclerc turret with a 120mm gun. KNDS said this tank was a technology demonstrator and meant to show off what the new multi-national conglomerate was capable of producing. However, the firm did suggest it could be an attractive option for smaller countries, especially those with bridges and other infrastructure that simply cannot handle the weight of larger main battle tanks. All told, it still remains to be seen whether any new Franco-German tank, or any other upcoming Western design, will come armed with a 130mm or 140mm main gun or whether this concept will end up being shelved yet again.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the Portland based F-15Cs belonging to the 142nd Fighter Wing had some landing gear trouble after a morning training mission today. As a precaution, the 41-year-old jet (78-0473) made an emergency barrier engagement landing on Portland International Airport’s runway 28L. As is custom in the fighter community, the wingman flew alongside the stricken jet on final approach, before accelerating off just before touchdown. Thankfully the plane’s gear didn’t fail and the F-15C pilot was able to make a beautiful arrested landed. Check out KOIN 6’s sweet video coverage of the landing below. Here is a direct link to the video in case it does not propagate below on your mobile device: These types of landings don’t all go that smoothly, depending on the aircraft’s malfunction and the environmental conditions, they can be quite violent . But incidents like this are exactly why the BAK-12 arresting gear is embedded towards each end of the south runway at PDX. It retracts into its surface when commercial and general aviation aircraft are using the runway and is deployed by the tower remotely when fighter operations are taking place. When 28L/10R is closed for repairs, emergency landings under most circumstances have to be diverted to McChord Air Force Base, which is located 100 miles to the north of PDX. America’s F-15C/D fleet is made up of its oldest fighters in service, with the newest being 33 years old. The decision to continue upgrading the fleet so that it can fly and remain tactically relevant for decades to come, something that will come at a substantial cost, or replace it with new F-15X advanced Eagles appears to have finally been made. As it sits now, the Defense Department will ask to begin procuring the F-15X as part of the 2020 defense budget. Congress still has to approve that request. Over the past couple of years, the debate was centered on divesting the C/D Eagle fleet entirely and having upgraded F-16s or even F-35s take its place. This was before the F-15X initiative came to light, a story that we broke last July . Inflight emergencies, called IFEs in military aviation parlance, are far more common than most would think across the tactical fighter community. But the F-15C/D fleet, in particular, has been hit hard by these events as the oldest jets march towards a half century in age. In January, two F-15Cs based out of Kadena Air Base in Okinawa actually had to make emergency barrier engagement landings in opposite directions on the same runway. You can read about this crazy incident in this previous article of ours. The 142nd Fighter Wing remains one of the USAF’s premier fighter units . Their jets, which now feature APG-63V3 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars and the ability to carry the Sniper targeting pod for long-range visual identification day or night, are tasked with defending American airspace from Northern California to British Columbia . A pair of fully armed primary quick reaction alert (QRA) jets and two backup aircraft are ready to launch within minutes to intercept potential threats or aircraft in trouble, as they famously did during the theft of a Horizon Air Q400 at SEATAC airport by a troubled ground support agent last summer. You can see exactly what an aerial  intercept by the 142nd Fighter Wing looks like in the exclusive video posted below and read about the procedures that go along with it here . Thankfully man and machine came out of this incident unscathed, but it is another reminder of just how dangerous the fighter jet flying business can be.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 15, 2019",Airbus’s Record-Setting Compound Helicopter Could Become The Army’s New Armed Scout Chopper,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Airbus recently confirmed that it had proposed a design derived from its world speed record-holding X3 compound helicopter demonstrator for the U.S. Army’s new attack reconnaissance rotorcraft program . The service has outlined requirements for a pilot-optional “ knife fighter ” able to operate heavily defended areas and densely packed urban environments , which could also help fill the glaring gap left by the premature retirement of the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior . Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, offered the new details in a briefing for the media on Feb. 18, 2019 . The Army first announced its plans for what it officially calls the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Competitive Prototype (FARA CP) in June 2018 and formally began accepting proposals in October 2018. The service hopes to evaluate between four and six designs initially before down-selecting to just two in 2020 for an actual fly off competition. “We are looking at the FARA demonstrator program based on the technology we have developed in terms of a high-speed platform, based on the X3 in particular,” Even explained, according to Rotor and Wing International magazine. “This competency, this technology we have developed … clearly we want to leverage, then, in order to propose a competitive solution first at the demonstrator phase for the U.S. DoD [Department of Defense] program.” Eurocopter, now known as Airbus Helicopters, first flew the X3 demonstrator in 2010. Based on the company’s AS365 Dauphin , the new design eliminated the tail rotor in favor of a pair of propellers on either side of the aircraft. Two Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 turboshaft engines provided power to the propellers, as well as the five-bladed main rotor system. In test flights and demonstrations between 2010 and 2013, the X3 showed off record-setting performance. On June 7, 2013 , the rotorcraft reached 293 miles per hour in level flight and more than 300 miles per hour in a shallow dive, becoming the fastest non-jet-augmented compound helicopter in the world, which remains the case to this day. Sikorsky’s X2 technology demonstrator , another advanced compound helicopter concept, had previously held this record. The X2 has since evolved into the S-97 Raider and this rotorcraft, or a derivative thereof, will also likely be a competitor in the Army’s FARA CP program. In 2017, Airbus announced its own new compound helicopter, the Rapid And Cost-Effective Rotorcraft (RACER), which it had developed based on experience gained with the X3. Though RACER is aimed at civilian and commercial markets, the belief is that the X3-derived concept the company is pitching to the Army will have at least a related design. “You can also envision a military path for that technology as well,” Scott Tumpak, Airbus’ chief of military programs in North America, also said at the briefing, according to Vertical magazine. “We’re in a competitive phase right now, so we don’t want to get too far out in front by going into too much detail as to what the specific offer is.” RACER is similar to the original X3 in basic configuration, but has the propellers pushing aft, rather than pulling forward. The fuselage design appears to be related to Airbus’ advanced H160 helicopter . Airbus says that RACER will have a cruising speed of almost 250 miles per hour, significantly faster than most traditional helicopters. The Army’s says the FARA CP rotorcraft should have a speed of at least more than 200 miles per hour. By comparison, the Army’s AH-64E Apache gunship has a top speed of more than 170 miles per hour. That helicopter’s manufacturer Boeing, however, is in developing a compound helicopter conversion that could boost the Apache’s speed to over 255 miles per hour. Of course, the RACER concept would need other significant modifications and additions, including provisions for weapons, secure communications systems, and other military equipment, to meet the Army’s various requirements. The service also has demands for a design capable of operating in highly contested environments full of enemy air defenses. This could include the need for advanced features to reduce its radar and infrared signatures . The Army has said that the FARA CP contenders will have to have robust electronic warfare capabilities, as well. “We want [these rotorcraft] to be able to spoof those radars, jam those radars, hunt those radars and kill those radars,” U.S. Army Brigadier General Walter Rugen, in charge of the Army’s Future Vertical Lift Cross Functional Team (CFT), said at the Association of the United States Army’s Global Force Symposium in March 2018 . In addition, any submissions to the Army’s FARA CP program will need to be able to fly in an unmanned mode. Separately, the service, together with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is testing autonomous and semi-autonomous helicopter capabilities as part Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program, which you can read about in more detail here . Just the ability to utilize a “digital co-pilot” would help ease aviators’ mental and physical workloads, in turn reducing fatigue and improving their mission performance. The systems ALIAS is testing also offer additional backup help in an emergency, including situations where the crew might be incapacitated. For Airbus, the FARA CP could also offer the company a pathway back into contention for major future U.S. military rotorcraft programs. In 2013, what was then Eurocopter, announced it no longer planned to submit a proposal for the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) technology demonstration program, which will inform at least a portion of the broader Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort to acquire replacements of basically all of the U.S. military’s rotorcraft. At that time, the company said the cost of developing an advanced clean-sheet rotorcraft was prohibitive and that it preferred to focus efforts on winning the Army’s Armed Aerial Scout (AAS) program aimed at finding a near-term replacement for the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. Eurocopter’s AAS-72X did not win that competition, but the program turned into a larger debacle, with the Army retiring the OH-58Ds entirely without procuring a direct replacement, something you can read about in more detail here . FARA CP is not directly related to the future FVL effort officially, but many of the existing contenders are also expecting to compete for that various portions of that larger program with related designs. Airbus could potentially leverage a win in the FARA CP program to make a late bid for one or more portions of the FVL project, which also includes a light scout helicopter requirement. The European aviation conglomerate is facing steep competition, though. This includes the aforementioned S-97 from Sikorsky, as well as a Bell offering, which could be derived from its V-280 Valor tilt-rotor, and a still unseen proposal from a partnership between L3 and AVX . Airbus, so far, is the only foreign bidder for the program. At present, the Army will reportedly pick the initial group of competitors between June and July 2019. As such, we should expect to see more of what Airbus’ final proposal looks like, as well as the pitches from its competitors, sooner rather than later.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2018",Canada Is Officially Trying To Buy Germany’s Unwanted And Unflyable RQ-4E Euro Hawk Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Canada has become something of a collector of second-hand military aircraft as of late after purchasing 25 surplus F/A-18A/B Hornets from Australia to augment their own tired Hornet fleet of a similar vintage. Now they are officially trying to get their hands on Germany’s single defunct and totally inoperable RQ-4E Euro Hawk, a variant of the RQ-4 Global Hawk high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drone. German officials had characterized the aircraft as worth very little due to its present state, one in which major components have been stripped from its airframe, stating that it is worth not much more than “scrap value.” You can read a complete background on Germany’s failed RQ-4E program, what state the defunct airframe exists in, and Canada’s odd interest in it in this past article of ours . Today’s news that Canada is actually moving forward with an attempt to acquire the mothballed airframe was first reported on by Reuters . The report states that Canada, which doesn’t operate any Global Hawk variants at all, has indeed placed a bid on what’s left of the aircraft, according to an official statement from the German Ministry of Defense. The dollar figure of the potential sale remains unknown. Canada is thought to be interested in the aircraft to monitor its vast and remote territorial holdings and the expanses of water surrounding the country, including in the increasingly contested Arctic . Missions would include monitoring shipping and fishing and the migration of icebergs, among many others. The Canadian government had hoped to have a fleet of drones flying these missions by now, but the program to acquire them is now being pushed into the coming decade, with an operational capability occurring sometime in the first half of the 2020s, at the soonest. Euro Hawk during better days. , Philipp Hayer/wikicommons Reuters notes that NATO may also end up bidding on the aircraft. The North Atlantic military alliance has ordered its own fleet of five Global Hawks, under what is known as the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) program. AGS is shared capability between 15 of the 29 NATO members and is expected to be operational and available to them by the end of this year. But the configurations of these aircraft and Germany’s RQ-4E are not the same, as Germany’s aircraft is designed primarily to collect signals intelligence. NATO’s aircraft, known as RQ-4Ds, have a high degree of commonality with the U.S. Air Force’s Block 40 RQ-4Bs, which are primarily focused on ground surveillance. With this in mind, it is most likely that Germany’s aircraft would be used for spare parts by NATO. Germany also acquired a number of ground control stations as part of the RQ-4E program, which could be compatible with NATO’s RQ-4D s. If so, the alliance would look to buy them along with what’s left of the Euro Hawk airframe as part of a package deal. NATO AGS version of the Global Hawk, Northrop Grumman A sale of the RQ-4E airframe and any remaining associated equipment to either party would allow Germany to finally wash its hands of the Euro Hawk debacle for good. Nearly two decades ago, the German government had planned on buying five RQ-4Es, but European aviation authorities repeatedly refused to certify the aircraft to fly over the continent due to concerns about the risks the unmanned aircraft could pose to civilian air traffic. Combined with big cost overruns and long delays, Berlin decided to nix the program in 2013 after spending a whopping $793.5 million and getting just one prototype to show for it. Now Germany just wants to unload the craft in order to get any money back from the boondoggle. A new Global Hawk with the necessary ground support equipment costs roughly $120M new. It’s unclear how much utility Canada thinks it can get out of the hulk of a single one-off Global Hawk derivative or just how much money it will take to return the aircraft to an operational state and refit it with sensors applicable to the surface surveillance mission set. It’s not even clear how valuable it would be to NATO for spare parts at this point, either. With all this in mind, the Trudeau government might be bargain hunting for another second-hand aircraft, but in the case of the Euro Hawk, they could end up just adding a new and equally sad chapter to its already depressing history.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 11, 2018",Israel Turns Ballistic Missile Surrogate Into Air Launched Bunker-Busting Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israeli firm Rafael has unveiled what appears to be a new air-launched ballistic missile, which has features in common with both an existing family of precision-guided bombs and a ballistic missile defense target. The company says the weapon will be able to find its target even in the midst of an enemy jamming its GPS-enabled navigation system , a threat that is already very real . The ‘Rocks’ missile first appeared at the Aero India 2019 aerospace and defense exposition, which began on Feb. 20, 2019. Gideon Weiss, the Deputy General Manager for Business Development, Marketing, and Strategy for Rafael’s Air & C4ISR Division, told Jane’s that the company had already certified an Israeli Air Force F-16I Sufa test aircraft to carry the weapon and had carried out a number of trials using the jet as a launch platform. “Rocks provides a cutting-edge and cost-effective solution that combines several combat-proven technologies inherited from our latest-generation SPICE system,” Said Yuval Miller, the Executive Vice-President and General Manager of the Air & C4ISR Systems Division, told Airforces Monthly in a separate interview. “Rocks effectively answers a growing demand for long range, GPS-independent air-to-ground precision-strike capability.” Miller was referring to Rafael’s Smart, Precise Impact, Cost-Effective (SPICE) family of precision-guided bombs . These bombs use a GPS-enabled Inertial Guidance System (INS) navigation system to direct them to the general target area before switching over to an imaging infrared seeker for the terminal stage of flight. Rocks, on display in front of a SPICE bomb, at Aero India 2019., Rafael Though we don’t yet know the exact specifics about Rocks’ guidance capabilities, SPICE can operate in an autonomous mode, using an image recognition algorithm to spot the target and home in on it. It can also be manually directed through a so-called “ man-in-the-loop ” functionality, a hallmark of Israel’s precision-guided missiles and bombs. This means that the crew in the aircraft that releases the bomb and maneuver it right until it hits the target. This allows for extreme accuracy, even against moving targets, and allows the operator to quickly shift the bomb away from the target if a better one appears or if it becomes apparent that the strike would put innocent bystanders at undue risk. The added precision makes it more viable to pursue the target even in densely packed areas full of innocent civilians, as well. It also means that the weapon can hit targets that have fled from their original position. Traditionally, the launch aircraft carries a data-link pod for these operations. It is not clear if Rocks actually has the same level of man-in-the-loop functionality. But with the SPICE-based guidance package and its automated image matching functionality, it wouldn’t necessarily need to rely on the GPS/INS guidance system during the terminal approach to its target actually hit it with pinpoint accuracy. Rafael has not yet disclosed the range of Rocks, either. The company has said the missile has “a very significant standoff range” and “a high-velocity trajectory towards the target,” according to Airforces Monthly . However, judging by its external design, the weapon appears to be a hybrid of the SPICE guidance package and a missile body derived from the company’s Black Sparrow . This latter system is an air-launched target intended to simulate the characteristics of a short-range ballistic missile. Israel has utilized these in the testing of its Arrow family of ballistic missile defense systems in the past . There is scant information on the Black Sparrow’s range and flight envelope, but it is supposed to mimic Soviet Scuds and derivatives , the longest range examples of which can hit targets out to around 430 miles. However, the surrogate ballistic missile wouldn’t necessarily need to have anywhere near this range to stand in for a Scud for test purposes. In addition, though Israel is not a formal member of the Missile Technology Control Regime arms control bloc, it has publicly stated that it follows those parameters. The MTCR places severe restrictions on the export of missiles that can carry payloads of more than 1,100 pounds to distances of more than 190 miles. If Rafael hoped to export Rocks, these parameters could be the very upper limits of the missile’s potential capabilities. The use of the Black Sparrow design as a starting point also strongly suggests that Rocks operates like an air-launched ballistic missile. As such, the missile would be the latest example of a growing worldwide trend toward the development of this class of weapons . In 2018, Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) unveiled their own air-launched ballistic missile, called Rampage , derived from the EXTRA ground-launched guided artillery rocket. Rafael has also said that the missile will be able to carry a penetrating type warhead capable of striking at hardened, sub-surface targets, as well as a blast-fragmentation design for engaging opponents in the open. We don’t know the specifics of the design of either payload or their weight classes. The different warhead options suggest that the weapon’s payload section might be modular to some degree. It could be that the missile can accept any standardized warhead in certain weight classes, as is the case with SPICE bombs. There are readily available 2,000-pound class bunker buster and blast-fragmentation warheads for instance. Due to the ballistic nature of its flight, its high velocity during the terminal stages of flight would greatly help it penetrate deeper into a target, as well. “We have completed full-scale development and testing – including airborne and homing – but we have not yet completed the qualification of the missile,” Rafael’s Weiss also told Jane’s . “This will be the final part of the development process, which will be completed according to our customer requirements.” He did not say who this customer or customers might be. But given the certification of the weapon on an Israeli Air Force F-16I, which can carry up to four Rocks at once, it seems very likely that Israel is among them. The Israeli Air Force’s F-15s , many of which are specifically configured as long-range strike aircraft , would be able to carry these missiles, too. An Israeli Air Force F-15 carries a Black Sparrow surrogate ballistic missile. , IAF For Israel, having a standoff, hardened-target penetrating weapon, could be especially valuable. The country faces a number of opponents in the region who rely heavily on bunkers and other hardened structures, as well as tunnels underground, to try and reduce their vulnerability to Israeli air strikes. This includes Hamas in Gaza , Hezbollah in Lebanon , and various adversaries in Syria , including Iranian and Iranian-backed forces. These targets are often in built-up areas full of civilians, where the added precision of the SPICE-based guidance package would be invaluable. The stand-off range of Rocks would help reduce the launching platform’s vulnerability to advanced air defenses, as well. Israeli jets already routinely launch missiles and bombs from Lebanese airspace along the Syrian border to minimize the time they spend exposed to hostile forces. Depending on the range of the launch aircraft to threats on the ground or in the air, this method doesn’t entirely eliminate risk, particularly to non-stealthy fourth generation combat jets . With this in mind, Rocks adds an entirely new level of capability to these existing aircraft, even in the face of the proliferation of ever more threatening enemy air defenses . As such, there could also be a role for barrages of Rocks against more strategic targets, such as elements of Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs , many of which are underground and protected by long-range surface-to-air missiles . An air-launched ballistic missile with a maximum range at the edge of the MTCR restrictions would allow the launch platform to stay outside the engagement range of virtually all current air defense systems. At the same time, its speed would make it hard, if not impossible to for an opponent to intercept the incoming threat with higher-end point defense systems . Some of these systems, such as the Russian-built Pantsir S1 , are touted as capable of shooting down slower-moving cruise missiles and glide bombs. The high-supersonic speed and steep trajectory of a ballistic-type missile makes intercepting them with short-range air defenses all but impossible. And these types of defenses, often placed near high value target areas, are increasingly popular among Israel’s most notable enemies. Beyond busting bunkers and fortified structures, as well as other fixed targets, Rocks will be especially well suited to neutralizing enemy air defenses. It’s ability to give 4th generation fighters the ability to rapidly engage threatening air defense sites over long distances, and in a way that is hard to counter once the missile is in the air, means destruction of enemy air defenses can be provided without putting the launch platform at great risk. The fact that it can even continue its attack as mobile SAM systems flee makes it all that much more relevant. Hardened targets in heavily protected areas and the threat of increasingly advanced air defense systems are hardly limited to Israel’s opponents, either. Depending on its exact capabilities, Rocks could be appealing to export customers, as well. By using so many well-established components from existing systems, the unique missile might turn out to be comparatively low-cost. It’s not the first time the company has mated a SPICE-based guidance package with another weapon system to produce a relatively cheap guided munition, either. In May 2018, the Israeli defense contractor revealed the Electro-Optical Precision Integration Kit (EPIK), a bolt-on guidance kit derived from SPICE that would work with the popular 122mm artillery rocket . If Israel is indeed the launch customer for Rocks, it may not be long before it employs those weapons against various regional opponents. If the missile proves successful, it could help Rafael pitch it abroad, if the company hasn’t lined up other buyers already.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 15, 2019",Lockheed Martin Deletes Claim That Its Rebranded F-21 Could Be A Path To Indian F-35s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has rebranded its latest advanced F-16 offering for India as the F-21 and has shown the jet would have new features, including a revised glass cockpit and other advanced features. But the pitch appears to be much more about opportunities industrial cooperation in India, a major factor in the latest iteration of India’s fighter jet tender , than technological enhancements. It might even pave the way for the country to join the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program – a claim the company scrubbed from its official F-21 webpage shortly after it went live. The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor revealed models of the F-21 and released a computer-generated video presentation about the jet to coincide with the beginning of this year’s Aero India trade show on Feb. 20, 2019. Lockheed Martin’s fighter jet is squaring off against Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , France’s Rafale , the European Eurofighter Typhoon , Sweden’s Gripen E , and Russia’s MiG-35 Fulcrum and Su-35 Flanker for India’s Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) competition. The Indian Air Force hopes to eventually purchase at least 115 aircraft through this program, a deal that could be worth up to $18 billion, which has been a more than decade-long saga that you can read about in more detail here . “The F-21 is different, inside and out,” Dr. Vivek Lall, Vice President of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said in a statement . “The new designation highlights our commitment to delivering an advanced, scalable fighter aircraft to the Indian Air Force that also provides unrivaled industrial opportunities and accelerates closer India-US cooperation on advanced technologies.” So far, Lockheed Martin has not specifically explained the origins or meaning of the F-21 nomenclature. The U.S. military originally assigned F-21 in its aircraft nomenclature system to a small fleet of ex-Israeli Kfir fighter jets that the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps operated as “red air” aggressors between 1985 and 1989. Today, a U.S. contractor flies still flies Kfirs in adversary support roles and still refers to the type as the F-21. Highly upgraded Kfirs are also still flown by a number of air arms around the globe. The origins of the new designation may be similar to the decision-making process behind the B-21 nomenclature for the U.S. Air Force’s future stealth bomber . In 2016, the service announced it had picked B-21, an out-of-sequence designation, to reflect its acquisition of the “first bomber of the 21st century .” As for what exactly is different “inside and out” between the F-21 and earlier F-16s, Lockheed Martin has offered few specifics. The jet is only the latest in a string of India-targeted Viper offerings that began with the development F-16IN Super Viper in the late 2000s, also known as the F-16 Block 70 . Features from this variant then ended up part of an upgrade package for older Vipers, known as the F-16V . Lockheed Martin has now effectively blended these two separate efforts together . The most notable and apparently new feature in the F-21 video presentation is the consolidation of the cockpit displays into a single large flat panel screen. Previous glass cockpit configurations for the F-16IN, Block 70, and V model aircraft featured three separate digital multi-function displays. This is similar in some general respects to the single panel design in Lockheed Martin’s stealth F-35. It also mirrors the decision Boeing made with regards to the cockpit configuration in its latest Block III Super Hornets and F-15QA Advanced Eagles for Qatar. This type cockpit arrangement will make it easier for pilots to rapidly find the information they’re looking for and offers additional flexibility over fixed “steam gauges” or even smaller digital displays. It makes it easier to add new features to the display itself and link it new and improved sensors and other systems in the future, as well. During a media briefing on the Super Hornet that we at The War Zone attended in 2018 , Boeing noted that an aviator could move and resize certain display elements on the screen, just like shifting things around on a computer desktop, to better suit their particular style. It would also allow the rapid resizing of certain displays, including video feeds from targeting pods, to make it easier to positively identify targets or other items of interest. It seems likely that the F-21’s display will have similar functionalities. An artist’s depiction of the new large panel display in the F-21., Lockheed Martin The F-21 notably has a big dorsal spine that has only appeared previously operationally on advanced two-seat F-16 derivatives. This addition can accommodate avionics, communications equipment, countermeasures systems, and more. The jet also has a probe-and-drogue refueling system that extends from the starboard conformal fuel tank, as well. However, Lockheed Martin first demonstrated this system , known as the Conformal Air Refueling Tank System, in 2010 as part of the development of the F-16IN. It also reduces the total amount of fuel that the tank can carry. Lockheed Martin personnel use a Block 60 F-16F to test the Conformal Air Refueling Tank System in 2010. The logo of the company’s Skunk Works advanced projects division is visible on the side., Lockheed Martin The video presentation does show the F-21 carrying three AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) missiles on new racks, which gives the jet added air-to-air magazine depth even when carrying underwing fuel tanks or other stores. The outboard underwing pylons will also be able to deploy the AN/ALE-50 towed decoy , but this had been a previously announced feature for the F-16s Lockheed Martin was offering to India and was first seen on Block 50/52 Vipers. A look at the trip AIM-120 arrangement, as well as the outboard pylon with provision for the AN/ALE-50 decoy from the F-21 video., Lockheed Martin capture The F-21s in Lockheed Martin’s video are also each carrying a Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) and an Infrared Search and Track (IRST) pod on their chin stations. The latter system would give the jets an improved ability to spot stealthy threats. It’s not otherwise clear how much the F-21’s configuration might differ from previous existing Block 70 and F-16V variants. These Vipers featured a host of significant improvements over existing variants, including Northrop Grumman’s AN/APG-83 active electronically scanned array radar, also known as the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR). They also had new avionics, improved navigation equipment, updated mission computers and data links, and compatibility with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System II (JHMCS II). The advanced F-16 variants had more powerful electronic warfare suite for self-protection, too. A page from a Lockheed Martin brochure on its previous F-16 Block 70 proposal for India describing, in part, how the aircraft’s added capabilities improve its operational performance. The “threats” depicted are notably Chinese J-20 stealth fighters , which are a growing concern for the Indian Air Force., Lockheed Martin But the real thrust of Lockheed Martin’s F-21 push seems to be to promote the potential for significant industrial cooperation that comes with its bid versus that of its opponents. The MMCRA competition requires bidders find a local partner and the American firm has been working with Indian industrial giant Tata for its proposal. The U.S. defense contractor has long said it plans to shift its F-16 production lines to India in cooperation with Tata. It has gone so far as to suggest it could establish an F-16 production line in the country regardless of whether it wins the MMCRA deal or not. The first thing you see in the video presentation Lockheed Martin released on Feb. 20, 2019, is a stylized depiction of this notional Indian Viper plant with Tata branding. There are also clips showing an F-21 refueling from a KC-130J tanker, an aircraft Lockheed Martin has already sold to India and that features made-in-India components . F-21s refuel with a KC-130J in Lockheed Martin’s video., Lockheed Martin capture But more curiously, Lockheed Martin initially implied that the F-21 could be a stepping stone to Indian participation in the F-35 program, something that has been a sensitive topic of discussion over the years. “The F-21 has common components and learning from Lockheed Martin’s 5th Generation F-22 and F-35 and will share a common supply chain on a variety of components,” Lockheed Martin initially said on its F-21 webpage , which first appeared online on Feb. 20, 2019. “Approximately half of the F-21 and F-16 supply chains are common with the F-22 and F-35.” However, the official F-21 page no longer makes those claims or that the fighter jet is “India’s pathway to F-35.” It now says instead that the jet would “strengthens India’s path to an advanced airpower future.” There does not appear to be an archived copy of the original webpage, but the details have been widely reported . The F-21 product card, which is still available online, only says that “Innovative technologies derived from Lockheed Martin’s F-22 and F-35 – the world’s only two operational 5th Generation fighters – strengthen India’s path to an advanced airpower future.” It has no mention of the shared supply chains or potential sale of F-35s to India. This graphic, with an F-35 leading a flight of F-21s, is the only remnants of Lockheed Martin’s initial comments about the latter fighter jets serving as a stepping stone for India to join the Joint Strike Fighter program., Lockheed Martin It wouldn’t be the first time that Lockheed Martin has had to backtrack on public statements regarding India’s involvement in the F-35 program. In January 2018, the company swiftly denied that it had offered the stealth fighters to the Indian Air Force. This was in response to the Press Trust of India publishing an interview with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics executive Lall, the same individual who made the F-21 announcement, that had appeared to suggest India-specific F-35s were on the horizon. The next month, however, Indian media reported that the country’s Air Force had formally requested a classified briefing on the F-35. There was no official confirmation of these reports. An F-16C and an F-35A fly together., Lockheed Martin Then, in March 2018 , now-retired U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, then head of what was called U.S. Pacific Command, re-raised the possibility of selling F-35s to India. The Pentagon has since retitled that command as U.S. Indo-Pacific Command specifically to highlight American involvement in South Asia and ties with countries in the region. In 2018, India had also indicated that the winner of the MMRCA competition would have to also assist with the country’s development of its own indigenous stealth fighter, known presently the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). Earlier in February 2019, there were separate reports that the Indians had requested a classified briefing on the United Kingdom’s Tempest stealth fighter program. In addition, in 2018, the Indian government reportedly terminated their participation in Russia’s long-troubled Su-57 stealth fighter program , which was supposed to lead to an India specific variant. This further leaves the door open for a replacement, nearer term stealth fighter acquisition effort to fill the gap and potentially frees up the necessary funding to do so. The War Zone has long noted the possibility that the Indian Air Force might turn to the F-35 as it is the only in-production fifth generation fighter at present. A dated chart showing plans for the Su-57, previously known as the Su-50 or PAK-FA, including the Su-50E and Su-55 variants for India., Sukhoi These latest official statements, though they are now removed from Lockheed Martin’s website, do indicate a renewed possibility that the company is proposing the purchase of its F-21 as a gateway to acquiring F-35s down the road. The Indian Navy is also shopping for new fighter jets for its existing and planned future aircraft carriers and could be interested in acquiring short- and vertical-takeoff and landing capable F-35Bs or carrier-focused F-35Cs , as well. The possibility of F-35 sales to India clearly remain a sensitive issue, both in that country and in the United States. It could be even more complicated now that the Indians have purchased S-400 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia. America’s NATO ally Turkey is also buying S-400s, as well as F-35s, which, among other things , has provoked a major dispute with the United States, which you can read about in more detail here . The U.S. government has expressed concerns that this will give the Russians an opportunity to evaluate the Joint Strike Fighter’s capabilities against their air defense systems and otherwise gather sensitive details about the aircraft. A transporter-erector-launcher for the S-400 surface-to-air missile system., Vitaly Kuzmin These concerns may become less of an issue as time goes on, but at present, the U.S. government is now looking to block F-35s deliveries to Turkey. Members of Congress might seek to do the same with regards to India. Of course, India is also not a NATO ally, which Turkey is, and already operates a variety of Russian-made aircraft and other military hardware. The United States would be approving any F-35 sales to the Indian Air Force knowing this going in. This would be similar to the considerations that the U.S. government would have to take into account if it decided to go ahead with potential sales of Joint Strike Fighters to the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia , too. Furthermore, American relations with India are at a relatively high point, however, and President Donald Trump has been a major advocate of increased U.S. arms sales abroad in general. The Pentagon actively pushed for the U.S. government to grant India a waiver to buy the S-400s without incurring sanctions in order to avoid upsetting ties. With all this in mind, despite Lockheed Martin’s latest retraction, it seems increasingly clear that the United States and India are actively in discussions, at least some level, about F-35 purchases in the future. Whether or not the rebranded F-21 will actually serve as a stepping stone to buying the stealth fighters remains to be seen, but that sure seems to be the idea.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Whistleblowers have warned Congress that current and former members of President Donald Trump’s Administration, including some with serious conflicts of interest, may have tried to rush the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in ways that may violate U.S. law. There are now concerns that those efforts may still be ongoing, despite existing concerns that the Saudis, fearful of Iran’s nuclear ambitions , may be seeking a pathway to acquire their own nuclear weapons. Even more worrisome, Riyadh appears to be working on developing indigenous ballistic missile capabilities that could eventually carry these warheads already. On Feb. 19, 2019, Representative Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and present Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, announced the beginning of investigations into the White House and other federal agencies regarding the Trump Administrations efforts to cut a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia based on new information that multiple individuals had submitted to his office. The Oversight and Reform Committee also released an initial report on the allegations and copies of the documents it was based on. “Multiple whistleblowers came forward to warn about efforts inside the White House to rush the transfer of highly sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in potential violation of the Atomic Energy Act and without review by Congress as required by law – efforts that may be ongoing to this day,” the executive summary of the report noted . “The whistleblowers who came forward have expressed significant concerns about the potential procedural and legal violations connected with rushing through a plan to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.” “They have warned of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes,” it continued. “They have also warned about a working environment inside the White House marked by chaos, dysfunction, and backbiting.” Representative Elijah Cummings speaks to reporters in January 2019., AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File In 2010 , Saudi Arabia established the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy to oversee the country’s planned civilian nuclear power program, as well as other alternative energy sources. The Saudis have since outlined plans for building two nuclear power plants by 2020 and having 16 in total by 2030 . The publicly stated goal is to reduce domestic oil consumption to maximize oil exports and make the country less dependent on fossil fuels. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), a major Saudi partner in the region, is also pursuing nuclear power for many of the same reasons. The Kingdom is hoping to finalize deals to build the first of those power plants by the end of 2019. The contracts will surely be lucrative and pave the way for additional work. Companies from the United States , as well as China , Russia , France , and South Korea are all on the short list now to bid on the projects.

South Korea’s Korea Electric Power Corporation is in charge of the project., Arun Girija/Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation/WAM via AP Conflicts of Interest The Saudi nuclear power program has also created an opening for corruption and graft in the United States, according to the whistleblowers who contacted Cummings’ committee. A key issue is that Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was an advisor to a company called IronBridge Group, Inc., between June and December 2016. During this time, he was also a member of Trump’s presidential campaign and subsequent transition team. IronBridge is a wholly owned subsidiary of a consortium called IP3 International , which appears to solely exist to represent a group of American firms in bidding on the Saudi nuclear projects. After The Washington Post first reported this link in 2017, IronBridge denied Flynn ever had an official role in the company and said he never received any monetary compensation from them. The whistleblowers now say that Flynn, a former U.S. Army Lieutenant General who once ran the Defense Intelligence Agency , failed to disclose on a security clearance renewal form that he had traveled to Saudi Arabia on behalf of IP3’s predecessor company in June 2015. He also did not disclose that this firm had sponsored a second trip in October of that year. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn arrives at federal court in Washington, D.C., in December 2018., AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster Regardless of Flynn’s technical relationship with IP3 and its predecessors, in the week after Trump took office, Derek Harvey, the Senior Director for Middle East and North African Affairs within the National Security Council, told other officials that the Administration would endorse IP3’s proposal for nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia, dubbing it the “Middle East Marshall Plan,” according to the Oversight and Reform Committee report. This decision had apparently originated with Flynn personally. “Both career and political staff inside the White House reportedly agreed that Mr. Harvey’s directive could violate the law,” according to the House Committee report. “One senior political official stated that the proposal was ‘not a business plan,’ but rather ‘a scheme for these generals to make some money.’ That official stated: ‘Okay, you know we cannot do this.’” More ties to the Kingdom Beyond Flynn, there were other potential conflicts of interest, as well. Thomas Barrack, a personal friend of Trump’s who was also Chairman of his Inaugural Committee, as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a White House advisor with a significant portfolio, were also reportedly involved in the Middle East Marshall Plan. In 2017, Barrack had considered purchasing a stake in Westinghouse Electric , a manufacturer of, among other things, nuclear reactors, which had filed for bankruptcy, according to the Congressional report. In 2018, Westinghouse’s parent company, Japanese conglomerate Toshiba, sold it to Brookfield Business Partners , a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management . Brookfield took a 100 percent leasehold interest stake in Jared Kushner’s troubled 666 Fifth Avenue property venture in New York City that same year. Thomas Barrack waves from a car during President Trump’s inauguration day parade in January 2017., Vladimir Astapkovich/Sputnik via AP The Oversight and Reform Committee’s report also re-raised general concerns about Kushner’s personal visit with now-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, during President Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017. Though not specifically about nuclear projects, MbS reportedly bragged that Trump’s son-in-law was “ in his pocket ” afterward, though the Saudi royal denied this later . Both Barrack and Kushner have substantial financial ties to Saudi Arabia, raising further questions about conflicts of interest. Barrack was responsible for Trump’s hiring of Paul Manafort as campaign manager, as well, and suggested that Manafort could meet with the Saudis over the nuclear proposal. The U.S. government has since convicted Flynn of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation over interactions with Russian officials. Paul Manafort has also pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States and witness tampering. He continues to find himself in legal trouble over accusations that he has failed to abide by the terms of his plea deal by continuing to lie to federal officials. Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C. in April 2018., AP Photo/Andrew Harnik Legal concerns In addition, the whistleblowers further allege that they informed Harvey, the National Security Council official, that any nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia would have to abide by the terms of the Atomic Energy Act , specifically Section 123 of that law, which would require safeguards to prevent proliferation of nuclear technology and prevent the development of nuclear weapons. A so-called “ 123 Agreement ” with the Saudis would, for instance, have to require clauses banning enriching uranium above the level necessary for power generation and the production of plutonium . Harvey reportedly brushed aside these concerns and talked about the Middle East Marshall Plan as if it was already a done deal. If the White House wanted to transfer nuclear technology to the Saudis, it would not technically require approval Congress, but the Senate could look to block the deal from going ahead. Legislators might be especially inclined to do this if it becomes apparent that the Trump Administration sought to go ahead with the plan without abiding by the terms of the Atomic Energy Act. On Feb. 16, 2019, U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette did deny that there was any intent to circumvent Section 123 in order to speed up nuclear cooperation with the Saudis. “We won’t allow them to bypass 123 if they want to have civilian nuclear power that includes U.S. nuclear technologies,” he said in an interview with CNBC on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. “As you know this technology has a dual use and in the wrong hands it becomes a dangerous, dangerous world.” This followed a move by a bipartisan group of Senators on Feb. 12, 2019, to introduce a resolution that would legally require the Trump Administration to implement a 123 Agreement with the Saudis as part of any nuclear deal. That same day , Trump and other officials met with representatives from various U.S. energy companies, including IP3, to discuss the approval process for the sale of nuclear reactors abroad to countries such as Saudi Arabia.

On top of that, U.S.-Saudi relations are already at an all-time low after the brutal murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by government security forces at the country’s consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, and the Kingdom’s subsequent attempts to cover that up, in 2018. Proponents of a deal contend that if the United States doesn’t aid the Saudis in their nuclear ambitions, someone else, such as the Chinese or the Russians, will. Those countries may be far less scrupulous in their efforts to ensure Saudi Arabia doesn’t utilize the technology to develop nuclear weapons. There is a significant and growing fear that the Saudis could feel steadily more compelled to acquire nuclear weapons regardless in order to counter their main regional opponent, Iran . It remains the public opinion of the U.S. Intelligence Community that Iran is not actively building nuclear weapons , but that the country does retain the knowledge base to do so if it decides to. At the same time, the Iranians do have a very active and extensive ballistic missile program , as well as a tangential space launch vehicle program , both of which could support the development of a delivery system for nuclear weapons. The Saudis, like the Iranians, insist that their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only . However, the Kingdom’s officials are on record saying that they will pursue nuclear weapons if the regime in Tehran does. “Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb,” Saudi Arabia’s MbS said in an interview in March 2018. “But without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.” There are other indications that the Saudis may be quietly laying the groundwork for a nuclear weapons program, if they haven’t already, too. Saudi Arabia reportedly acted as a major financier for Pakistan’s nuclear weapon program , dating all the way back to the 1970s, with the belief that this gave them access to, at least, technical information about those developments. In recent years, Saudi Arabia and Iran have competed for growing influence in Pakistan, but ties between Riyadh and Islamabad remain strong. Just on Feb. 18, 2019, MbS signed some $20 billion worth of memorandums of understanding for future cooperation with Pakistan during a trip to the country. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, at left, personally drives Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to his accommodations after the Saudi royal arrived for his state visit on Feb. 17, 2019., Pakistan Press Information Department Saudi ballistic missiles In 1987, Saudi Arabia also purchased hundreds of DF-3 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM) from China. China developed these weapons to carry nuclear warheads and their limited accuracy has long called into question how the Saudis could ever expect to employ them effectively with conventional payloads outside of massive barrages against broad area targets. The Royal Saudi Strategic Missile Force has never publicly tested one of these weapons and only showed them off to the public for the first time in 2014. In 2014, Newsweek reported that the Saudis had purchased newer and more capable DF-21 MRBMs from China six years earlier, but with the blessing of the U.S. government on the understanding that these weapons would be somehow rendered incapable of carrying nuclear weapons. This remains unconfirmed. Most recently, in January 2019, The Washington Post , citing analysis of satellite imagery by experts at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, reported that there was a high likelihood that the Saudis had or were in the process of building a ballistic missile factory. This apparent facility was situated within the Strategic Missile Force base at Al Watah in central Saudi Arabia. This development already raises concerns that the Saudis might be engaged in an arms race with Iran that could further push both parties to consider building stockpiles of nuclear weapons, which could be dangerously destabilizing across the Middle East. The two countries are already engaged in a number of proxy conflicts , most notably in and around Yemen , and have exchanged increasingly charged rhetoric in recent years. If nothing else, it shows that Saudi Arabia is working toward a domestic ballistic missile production capacity, if it doesn’t have one already. This would allow officials in Riyadh to avoid having to engage in the same sorts of secretive methods they’ve used in the past to acquire this class of weapon and would give them more flexibility to rapidly expand their missile force. Even conventionally armed ballistic missiles would offer the Saudis a valuable capability boost, including as a deterrent, especially in the face of Iran’s growing missile arsenal . Iran has already demonstrated its own ability and willingness to use ballistic missiles in the conventional role with strikes in Syria and has assisted Houthi rebels in the development of their own ballistic missile force . The latter group has used those weapons to attack Saudi Arabia directly . Increasingly accurate ballistic missiles with conventional warheads would give the Saudis a viable first rapid strike capability, as well. The experience from building these domestic weapons, combined with Saudi Arabia’s own familiarity with Chinese designs, would also help support the development of nuclear-capable missiles, or at least push the country closer to a breakout capability in this regard. The experts at the Middlebury Institute suggested that China or Pakistan could be assisting the Saudi missile program at Al Watah, too. An Iranian Khorramshahr MRBM , one of the country’s most advanced ballistic missiles., AP Photo/Ebrahim Norooz Persisting concerns All of this taken together raises additional concerns about whether it is prudent for the United States to assist the Saudis in the development of nuclear capabilities of any kind that could potentially lead to nuclear weapons. American lawmakers from both parties are increasingly worried about the lack of transparency from the Trump Administration about the present state of negotiations with the Kingdom, as well. “[There are] serious concerns about the transparency, accountability, and judgment of current decisionmakers in Saudi Arabia,” Republican Senators Marco Rubio, Todd Young, Cory Gardner, Rand Paul, and Dean Heller, wrote in a joint letter to Trump in the aftermath of the Khashoggi assassination in October 2018. “[W]e remain concerned that the Saudi Government has refused, for many years, to consider any agreement that includes so-called ‘Gold Standard’ requirements against pursuing technologies to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium-laden spent nuclear fuel.” The missive called on Trump to halt the discussions about the transfer of nuclear technology to the Kingdom indefinitely. However, the meeting in February 2019 shows that the Trump Administration has not abandoned plans to approve the sale of nuclear power plants to the Saudis. But with the new allegations about potential legal and ethical problems with the Trump Administration’s plan for transferring nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, plus continuing concerns about the Kingdom’s interest in acquiring nuclear weapons, it looks increasingly hard to see how Congress would allow any American deal to go ahead unchallenged, at least in the near term. All told, there is significant evidence that Saudi Arabia wants to at least lay the groundwork for a nuclear weapons arsenal and, if it becomes more obvious that this is the case, other countries in the region might follow suit. This could include Saudi partners, especially the UAE and Egypt , as well as opponents beyond Iran, such as Qatar . A nuclear arms race in the Middle East would turn an already perilous region into one that could single-handedly have the power to end the world as we know it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 25, 2018",Is A Batch Of Russia’s Most Advanced Surface To Air Missiles Sitting On The Sea Floor?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has confirmed that it did indeed sell long-range 40N6 surface-to-air missiles to China as part of a sale of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. At the same time, the Russians have revealed that none of those interceptors ever reached their destination after the ship carrying them got caught in a storm that resulted in the loss of the entire shipment, possibly with some of the missiles physically going overboard into the sea. On Feb. 18, 2019, Sergei Chemezov, the CEO of the state-owned industrial conglomerate Rostec , which includes the state-run arms broker Rosoboronexport , offered up the new information at a press conference at the 2019 International Defense Exhibition & Conference (IDEX) in the United Arab Emirates. Aviation Week ’s Defense Editor and our good friend Steve Trimble Tweeted out a full transcript of the exchange. “The contract was signed quite long ago. We were to supply [the 40N6 missiles,] but there was a failure,” Chemezov explained. “The vessel that was transporting those missiles – it was caught in a storm. So they have to liquidate all the missiles that were on the vessel and now we are manufacturing new ones.” China signed the contract to buy S-400s from Russia in 2015, but since then, there has been little concrete information about what interceptors the deal would include. It’s worth noting that the Russian military only officially accepted the 40N6 into service itself in October 2018. The 40N6 is one of three types of missiles presently available for the S-400 system , the others being the 48N6 and the 9M96. It also has the longest range of any of these interceptors, able to engage targets up to around 250 miles away, according to the manufacturer, Almaz-Antey. Variants of the 48N6 have maximum stated ranges between 120 and 160 miles, while versions of the 9M96 can hit targets out to between 20 and 75 miles. Russia had previously acknowledged that a storm had forced a ship carrying cargo related to China’s S-400s to return to port in January 2018 . However, at the time, the Russian Federal Service of Military-Technical Cooperation, abbreviated FSTVS in Russian, which oversees foreign military-technical cooperation, had described the damaged components as “support equipment.” As of Jan. 19, 2018, Russian authorities were assessing the damage for insurance purposes, FSTVS said in an official statement, according to state-run media outlet TASS . The Kremlin planned to send any undamaged S-400 related cargo to China at the earliest possible convenience. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0rUEALTJvy8 In April 2018 , Russia announced that it had successfully delivered the first of two “regimental sets” of S-400s to China, but there was still no confirmation about the specific interceptors the Chinese had received. Unconfirmed reports at the time suggested that the deliveries came with shorter-range 48N6E2 missiles and that 40N6s would arrive later, according to The Diplomat . Chemezov’s revelation about what cargo got lost in the January 2018 accident would fit with these reports. It remains unclear exactly what happened to the earlier shipment of 40N6 missiles. Chemezov’s description of the accident would seem to imply that the missiles simply suffered catastrophic damage during transport and ended up scrapped, at least in part. Russia never identified the vessel in question, making it harder to assess the exact scope of the accident. Ship spotters noted that the Nikifor Begichev , a general-purpose cargo ship heading for China from the Russian port of Ust Luga in the Gulf of Finland, experienced unspecified trouble with cargo on its open deck after running into a storm in or around the English Channel. On Jan. 3, 2019, it turned around and subsequently returned to port. Two days later, the Ocean Power , a roll-on/roll-off cargo ship known to be involved in Russian arms shipments, also made an abrupt turn around in the Baltic Sea. It then sailed back to the port of Koskolovo, also in Russia in the Gulf of Finland. This is a possibility that the cargo physically came loose and fell off the ship. The Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the English Channel are all well known for bouts of extreme weather and heavy seas. In 2009 , a Russian freighter notably lost 1,500 tons of timber in the Channel. Container ships regularly lose some of their loads in bad weather, in general. In 2017, the World Shipping Council conducted a study that indicated, on average, 1,390 containers had ended up in the ocean every year in the previous three years. Other estimates have been significantly higher , up to 10,000 lost containers annually, or around 27 every day . So, while we don’t know for sure what happened, it certainly wouldn’t be unreasonable for the 40N6s to have fallen off the ship entirely. Still, if this was the case, after more than a year, there doesn’t appear to be any clear indications that the Russians have sought to bring anything up from the seabed in either the English Channel or the Baltic Sea. However, Russia does have its own fleet of special mission submarines that could potentially have carried out such a mission, or at least inspected the state of the lost cargo, covertly. If there are containers full of 40N6s sitting on the bottom of the sea, they could be goldmines for Western intelligence services – if they can recover the interceptors or at least parts of them. The U.S. Navy, in particular, has extensive deep-sea salvage and intelligence-collecting capabilities, including the specially modified Seawolf -class submarine USS Jimmy Carter . USS Jimmy Carter returns to port in September 2017, flying a pirate flag , a symbol associated with the successful completion of a mission. The submarines activities, however, are highly classified ., USN Cold temperatures and the potential for new episodes of poor weather, might make such a recovery operation especially complicated or outright impractical. For comparison, since November 2018, Norwegian authorities have struggled against the elements to try and raise the almost completely sunken frigate Helge Ingstad , even though it is in relatively shallow waters near the port of Bergen. Earlier in February 2019, divers removed missiles and torpedoes, and blew up the latter with explosives, out of concern that they might be dangerously unstable after weeks sitting the water. Any 40N6 missiles submerged for months could be equally hazardous to handle. But it wouldn’t be the first time the United States has deemed the potential risks worth the effort to collect valuable hard intelligence about an opponent’s capabilities. In the 1970s, Central Intelligence Agency famously employed the Hughes Glomar Explorer recovery ship to recover a portion of the Soviet Golf II -class ballistic missile submarine K-129 from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Navy salvors also have experience in this regard from retrieving lost American munitions. In 1976 , the deep-diving nuclear research submarine NR-1 located and recover a live AIM-54 air-to-air missile in the North Atlantic off the coast of Scotland. But whatever the fate of the lost shipment, China is undoubtedly eager to get a batch of replacement interceptors. As already noted, the difference in capability between the 40N6 and 48N6 is significant. For China, what this means is that S-400 batteries armed with the former missile and positioned on the mainland near the Taiwan Strait can cover the entire airspace over Taiwan. An annotated map showing the range of certain Chinese surface-to-air missile systems and short-range ballistic missiles in respect to Taiwan. The maximum range of the S-400 with the 40N6 is twice that of the green line shown here., DOD Various factors might limit the target detection capabilities and engagement envelope for the S-400s against aircraft operating over Taiwan, but the additional coverage would still be a significant new threat to the Taiwanese Air Force . The Taiwanese military already has to contend with an increasingly capable mix of Chinese land-based ballistic missiles , as well as combat aircraft and warships armed with land-attack cruise missiles , which can now effectively target sites on the Pacific Ocean-facing side of the island. S-400s with 40N6 missiles would be a powerful anti-access and area denial tool for Chinese forces in other contested regions or potential hotspots. This could include batteries situated on China’s man-made islands in the South China Sea or positioned along the country’s lengthy border with India . Depending on the extent of the losses, Almaz-Antey might find itself having difficulties meeting the demands for replacement missiles, or having to divert production from other customers to fulfill the Chinese order sooner. There has been such a surge in sales of and general interest in the S-400 that, in May 2018, the state-owned company said its plant responsible for building the surface-to-air missile systems was fully booked with orders through 2025. With Chemezov’s comments now on the record, it will be interesting to see how long it takes China now to actually receive its 40N6 missiles. Whenever the Russians put the delivery together, maybe they’ll consider sending it by train the second time around.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 21, 2020",Navy’s First Stealthy Zumwalt Class Destroyer Photographed With 30mm Guns Fitted,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) has been undergoing trials and combat systems outfitting in and around her home port of San Diego. The ship’s metamorphosis into an operational combat ship is something we have been following closely . Recently, we reported on additions to her stealthy frame that would only hurt the size of radar signature. These included an exposed mast and a number of communications aerials bolted directly onto her deckhouse instead of being integrated into it seamlessly. Now, a new photo shows her fitted with twin 30mm Bushmaster cannons for the very first time. The Zumwalt class, as we know it today, is a shadow of what it was originally envisioned to be. The vessel’s capabilities and low-observable design have been progressively watered-down as part of an ongoing initiative to save money. With just three of the vessels being built, all of which are now in the water, the Navy decided to largely cut their losses and move on from trying to make the once billed as transformational Zumwalt class ships all that they could be. You can read all about this saga in this past special feature of ours . Zumwalt replenishing while underway. You can see all the bolt on systems that have been added. These have compromised the original stealthy vision for the ship to some degree., MSC The ramifications of producing just three vessels of the class and the cost cuts that came with it have gone so far as making the ship’s 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS), which takes up nearly the forward third of the entire ship, totally useless. Its ammo became too expensive to purchase in small quantities. Not long after this revelation, the Navy changed the class’s mission to focus more on standoff strike and anti-surface warfare. It is possible that even nuclear strike could also be added sometime in the future. Regardless, at this point, there is a real possibility that the AGS will be torn out of the ships entirely without ever firing a shot. Mk46 cannon being fired aboard a San Antonio class ship., USN Another one of these cost cutting measures was swapping out the 57mm Mk110 guns mounted in stealthy cupolas above the ship’s hangar with 30mm Bushmaster cannons that were not specifically adapted to conform to the ship’s reduced radar signature. The Bushmasters were quite literally ‘off the shelf’ as they are found on the service’s Littoral Combat Ships equipped with the Surface Warfare Mission Package and on San Antonio class amphibious assault ships. The idea was that money could be saved by switching to the far less capable system, both in terms of acquisition and integration, as well as sustainment over time. MK110 gun system firing away aboard the Littoral Combat Ship USS Freedom. , USN It’s worth noting that the 57mm Mk110 deck guns are also in service aboard the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ships, so it’s not as if an entirely new system was being added to the Navy’s logistical network. The 30mm Bushmasters are cheaper in every respect, but they are also in a completely different class, capability-wise. USNI News noted that the 57mm guns fire at a rate of 220 rounds per minute and have a range of over nine miles, while the 30mm Bushmaster fires at up to 200 rounds per minute and has a range just over two miles. The 57mm also has far greater destructive power and some very exciting ‘smart’ ammunition options that the 30mm lacks entirely. The Mk110 guns would have been integrated into the Zumwalt’s advanced combat system. The 30mm Bushmaster, on the other hand, is a standalone and self contained system that is as close to ‘plug and play’ as you can get for the capability it provides. The operator literally sits inside the cupola and directs the cannon using thermal and electro-optical sensors built into the turret. The Navy issued the following response to USNI’s 2014 report on the matter: At the time of DDG 1000 Critical Design Review in 2005, the MK110 (57mm) close-in gun system (CIGS) was selected to meet the DDG 1000 ORD Key Performance Parameter. The basis of that decision was the expected performance of the gun and its munition, coupled with desire for commonality in USN and USCG. Through 2010, various analysis efforts were conducted to assess the performance of potential cost-saving alternatives to the Mk 110 CIGS, for both procurement and life-cycle costs. The results of the analysis for alternative systems to the MK110 CIGS were not conclusive enough to recommend a shift in plan. A follow on 2012 assessment using the latest gun and munition effectiveness information, concluded that the MK46 was more effective than the MK110 CIGS. Based on that assessment, approval was received to change from the MK 110 CIGS to the MK 46 Gun System. In addition to the increased capability, the change from MK110 to MK46 resulted in reduction in weight and significant cost avoidance, while still meeting requirements. DDG 1000 is planned to have two medium range MK46, 30mm Close-in Gun Systems that will provide a robust rapid fire capability and increased lethality against hostile surface targets approaching the ship. You can take this statement anyway you like, but similar ones have been par for the course when it comes to justifying the Zumwalt class’s decaying capabilities. Everything from the ship’s drastically downgraded radar system to its low-observable design have been justified ambiguously by the term ‘still meeting requirements,’ albeit the exact nature of those requirements, or how fluid they have been, remain largely undisclosed. MK46 Bushmaster cannons seen aboard a Freedom class LCS with Surface Warfare Mission Package installed. , USN It’s also unclear what level of impact the installation of the Bushmaster cannons will have on the ship’s radar cross-section. The 57mm guns were designed to be encapsulated in stealthy turreted cupolas when not in use. The fact that they were integrated into the ship’s combat system also meant they were mounted lower on the upper hangar enclosure in their wedge-shaped, faceted cupolas. The 30mm guns will not be concealed at all, they sit higher atop a trapezoidal structure with their turrets and barrels always exposed. Mk110 gun system in a stealthy copula seen on a Swedish Visby class corvette. , Poxnar/Wikicommons Still, the 30mm cannons will help the Zumwalt class put up some defense against potential small boat attacks. The ship’s stealthy design made incorporating 25mm chain guns, which are the primary heavy-duty force protection armament on US Navy surface combatants, not possible. But the added capabilities the Mk110 offered, from possessing four times the range and far more stopping power than the Bushmasters, to being able to potentially counter some aerial threats if the Navy wished to integrate that capability, that were lost by the switch is significant regardless of how the Navy tries to spin it. Installing the MK46 Bushmaster 30mm gun system aboard a San Antonio class amphib., USN We also have to stress that all of these cost reduction measures have a cumulative impact on the Zumwalt’s ability to wage war and where they can do it. In fact, maybe the persistent degradation of the vessel’s low observable design is a good metaphor as any for its overall combat capability. Each small change may not be damning in itself, but they add up over time to the point that one really has to ask what did the Navy buy here after spending tens of billions of dollars on the program? And most importantly, after spending all that money developing and building these ships, is spending a comparatively tiny amount more to get these vessels to perform as they were originally envisioned to really not worth it? DDG-1000 seen with her new 30mm cannons installed while in port in San Diego. , MrWasabi In the end, the Zumwalt class will likely prove itself to be hugely capable even in its final downgraded form. But with just three vessels built, the tiny fleet is more likely to be part of an experimental force that eventually cannibalizes itself just to stay alive in any form than the game-changing fleet of stealthy ships that the program was originally envisioned to be. But even lessons learned from their existence will be more limited because of their compromised state. It’s just troubling that even before they set sail operationally, the DDG-1000s already have us wondering ‘what could have been.’ Editor’s note: A big thanks to our friend MrWasabi for letting us use his photo for this piece.

This has included close air support exercises with B-52H Stratofortress that hopped over from their temporary base on Guam, as well as MV-22 Ospreys from Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 268 (VMM-232) ‘The Red Dragons’ based out of MCAS Kaneohe Bay on the island of Oahu. Thankfully, public affairs brought along a photographer for a cooperative sortie with A-10s and MV-22s, with stunning results to show for it. The MV-22s and A-10s teamed up for a joint escort insertion training mission, in which the A-10s would provide direct cover for MV-22s as they practiced infiltrating into a target area and dropping off forces once there. This type of sortie shares some similarities to the Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP) mission set—a form of combat search and rescue focused on the recovery of downed aircrew that the Marines and their Ospreys amazing at. A-10s and MV-22s are quite wonderfully paired. The A-10 offers a heavy-hitting and hardy armed escort and close air support capability that, unlike attack helicopters can, keep up with the tiltrotor Ospreys. It is also far more adept at open operating at very low levels and has superior endurance than other fixed-wing tactical jets. The A-10 crews are masters at employing their airframes in the ‘Sandy’ role, scouting and clearing landing areas and providing overwatch and fire suppression as the rescue crews go about their business on the ground. See this past article of mine for more info on the A-10 and this unique mission. Marine Osprey crews have been experimenting with pairing with different fixed-wing platforms for the escort insertion missions, including turboprop light attack planes. You can read more about this in this past piece of ours. Regardless, here are some gorgeous shots of the Missouri-based A-10s escorting Ospreys during training around Hawaii: USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC USMC The A-10s presence at MCAS Kaneohe Bay is slated to last into the first week on March. An official advisory reads: From February 11th to March 2nd, there will be an increase in aircraft activity aboard Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Marine Corps Base Hawaii.  Oahu residents may see and hear increased aircraft activity surrounding the base. Maintenance may occur overnight to ensure the safe operation of all aircraft. The increase of aircraft activity is in support of the installation producing readiness for our service members stationed and or visiting the installation. The U.S. Air Force’s 442d Fighter Wing will be deployed to the base and supporting U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force unit training aboard the PŌHAKULOA TRAINING AREA, Hawai‘i.We truly appreciate the understanding and continued support of local communities for our service members and their mission. Oahu has seen a major uptick in military aircraft exercises as of late, some of which are more publicized and others. Most notably, the B-2 Spirit force has started to make Hickam Air Force Base a temporary home as of late. This has resulted in some incredible photos too, but let’s hope we get some more pics and maybe even some videos of the ‘Hog’s visit to paradise!

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 18, 2018",That USAF RC-135 Rivet Joint Caribbean Spy Flight Was Far More Common Than Most Think,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For weeks now, Venezuela has been in the grips of a political battle between President Nicolás Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido, who the United States and dozens of other countries have recognized as the country’s legitimate head of state. The plane spotting community is now among those intently watching the situation for signs of curious air traffic, or a potential U.S. military intervention. So, it certainly turned heads when a U.S. Air Force RC-135V Rivet Joint spy plane made an unusually public appearance recently in the Caribbean Sea. But Rivet Joint missions in the region are more common than many people might know and this sortie may not necessarily have been related to the crisis in Venezuela at all. Expert military aviation tracker and friend of The War Zone @aircraftspots was first to notice the RC-135V, serial number 63-9792, using the callsign Gismo 84, in the Caribbean on Feb. 14, 2019. The airliner-sized intelligence gathering platform subsequently linked up with a KC-10A Extender tanker, Spur 57. This isn’t uncommon for Rivet Joint flights, which can be many hours long as the planes fly long tracks close to target areas gathering valuable intelligence. Rivet Joints, which include the RC-135Vs, as well as the functionally equivalent RC-135Ws, are among the most capable aerial intelligence gathering platforms the Air Force has at present. The aircraft fly with crews of more than 26 individuals and can perform a variety of task simultaneously. The aircraft have powerful signals intelligence suites that allow them to detect and listen in on enemy communications, as well as geolocate those transmitters. Among the Crypto Linguists onboard, there will be individuals who are fluent in various languages relevant to the mission at hand so that they can begin analyzing the content of what the plane’s sensors pick up immediately. Other personnel man stations to categorize the emitters and keep an eye out for anything new or unusual. An RC-135V/W Rivet Joint., USAF Lastly, electronic warfare officers can use the same signals intelligence systems to geolocate and categorize radars and other systems associated with integrated air defenses, allowing the Rivet Joints to help build a so-called “ Electronic Order of Battle ” of enemy or potentially hostile forces in a given area. In the lead up to the U.S.-led missile strikes in Syria in April 2018 , Rivet Joints flew regularly off the coast of that country to grab the latest information about the Syrian military’s air defense posture. The information gathered is essential to allied combat mission planning, greatly enhancing the survivability of manned tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, and drones. A robust array of data links and communications systems allow the RC-135s to send information back to base, to regional command centers, or forces on the ground, in near real time. Altogether, the Rivet Joints have an impressive mix of highly-proven strategic and tactical surveillance capabilities. An official graphic showing the internal configuration of the RC-135V/W Rivet Joints and the tasks assigned to the various members of the crew. The not at the bottom refers to the plane’s ability to perform “processing, exploitation, and dissemination,” or PED, of intelligence data on board and then send that information along in near-real time. , USAF So, it is possible that Gismo 84 might have been heading to a station off the Venezuelan coast to monitor the Maduro regime’s recent deployment of various air defense assets. There have been various sightings of Russian-made S-125 medium-range surface-to-air missile systems, among other anti-aircraft artillery, moving toward the country’s shared border with Colombia, a major U.S. ally that has routinely criticized Maduro. Venezuelan forces also recently conducted what appeared to be an exercise with their long-range S-300VM surface-to-air missile systems, which the country also acquired from Russia. Venezuela’s very public displays of its air defense capabilities can only be seen as a signal to the United States, in particular, that the country’s military remains loyal to Maduro and is prepared to respond to any American intervention . It’s also part of a broader propaganda push to present the embattled leader as firmly in power. The RC-135 could have been in the area keeping its electronic ears open for relevant communications chatter, too. The Rivet Joint passed near Cuba, which is one of Maduro’s few supporters in the region. While Cuban authorities are almost certainly advising the Venezuelan leader, some members of the U.S. government have accused Cuban authorities of more actively directing his actions and policies, but so far there is no hard evidence that this is the case. Regardless, the United States would have to be very interested in know what the two countries might be coordinating. While it was unusual for the Rivet Joint to pop up on public accessible flight tracking software, at least historically, it’s certainly not unusual for the aircraft to be flying in the region. When it comes to Cuba, for instance, Rivet Joints have long flown routes from bases in the United States to gather strategic intelligence about that island, run by a regime that is a long-time American adversary, irrespective of any ties it has to Venezuela. These sorties were, at least for a time, were given the nickname Bitter Wind. Mention of Bitter Wind “sensitive reconnaissance operations” sorties, with the exact details entirely redacted, from a 2007 US Air Force internal history., USAF via FOIA RC-135s, flying from sites in the United States and forward bases in Latin America and the Caribbean, including the Dutch island of Curaçao , also routinely take part in counter-narcotics operations in Central and South America. Beyond Bitter Wind, we know that intelligence gathering sorties as part of missions nicknamed Beach Wind, Seminole Wind, and Shula Wind have all taken place in or around Central or South America thanks to documents the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. Front to back, two US Air Force E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) radar planes, an RC-135V/W Rivet Joint, and two KC-135R Tankers at the US forward operating location on the Dutch island of Curaçao., USAF RQ-4 Global Hawk flights nicknamed Beach Axe have occurred in areas under the purview of both U.S. Southern Command and U.S. Northern Command. The former oversees operations in Central and South American, as well as the Caribbean, while the latter is responsible for the area around the United States itself, as well as Canada and Mexico. A portion of the table of contents from a 2009 US Air Force internal history describing various Global Hawk missions, including Beach Axe and Seminole Axe “in support of,” or ISO, US Northern and Southern Commands., USAF via FOIA The Air Force has also nicknamed U-2 Dragon Lady sorties over Colombia, specifically, as Seminole Emerald and Seminole Game. With all this in mind, the Beach Wind missions most likely involved Rivet Joints operating in areas adjacent to the Caribbean, at least in part, while Seminole Wind missions may have involved flights directly over Colombia. Mention of Seminole Game “ multi-intelligence ” U-2 flights over Colombia, as well as Lake Game flights over Haiti and the Dominican Republic, from a 2010 US Air Force internal history. The Lake Game missions were in support of the humanitarian response to the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which also impacted the neighboring Dominican Republic to a lesser extent., USAF via FOIA Beyond intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, the U.S. Air Force also regularly deploys a wide variety of combat aircraft, even including B-1 and B-52 bombers , to the Caribbean to support counter-drug operations. These missions, which you can read about in more detail here , are billed as training exercises that give aircrews a unique opportunity to search for and track real-world targets in a maritime environment. Also, on Feb. 14, 2019, @CivMilAir , another active online plane tracker and friend to The War Zone spotted a B-52 making a somewhat unusual flight over Florida. Gismo 84 and this bomber might have been part of a larger surge of assets to support a particular counter-narcotics operation. In August 2016, the Air Force took part in a similar effort, known as Operation Big Week. This involved the deployment of B-1s, B-52s, E-8C Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management command and control aircraft, among other assets, in the Caribbean. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0Aq6KNpYaLQ None of this is to say that increased attention from plane spotters on the region due to the crisis in Venezuela hasn’t uncovered curious and suspicious aerial activity . But it has also shone a light on the extensive and routine , if largely unpublicized activities of U.S. government aircraft , including U.S. military planes, across Latin America , as well. So, Gismo 84’s trip into the Caribbean could have been tied to the crisis in Venezuela, but it may well have been just business as usual.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 16, 2019",Photos Show F-14 Used In Top Gun 2 Production Snared In Carrier’s Crash Barricade,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just yesterday, we reported that the F-14 Tomcat used in the production of Top Gun 2 , as well as Tom Cruise, were spotted aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt . Now, new photos have come to light showing that same aircraft entangled in the ship’s crash barricade. As we noted in our previous piece, this is the first time a Tomcat has been on the deck of an operational U.S. Navy carrier in years. In addition, we have also obtained more information on where this particular Tomcat, which is now dressed-up for the film with phoenix-like insignias, came from. The fact that the F-14 is set up to appear as if it made an emergency landing into the ship’s barricade indicates that this is likely the culmination of a tense action sequence in the film. The barricade is a nylon net that is attached to the ship’s arresting gear system that ‘catches’ a stricken airplane that cannot, or has a very low probability of, ‘trapping’ normally aboard the ship by catching one its arresting wires. The ship’s barricade risers are erected on the USS Theodore Roosevelt during Top Gun 2 two production. , Source The barricade is also used if an aircraft has only one shot at landing and there are no other divert airfields available that it can safely make it to. The usual alternative to a barricade engagement is an ejection, a dangerous affair that is even more perilous out in the open ocean and especially in bad weather conditions. An ejection also means the total loss of an aircraft, the airframe that may be packed with packed with sensitive technologies sinking to the ocean floor. You can read more about the barricade and watch other videos of it in action by checking out this past article of mine . It’s worth clarifying again that this aircraft is not flyable. There are no flyable Tomcats anywhere in the world outside of Iran. Getting one back in the air in the U.S. would be nearly impossible due to bureaucratic red tape and cost, among other factors. As for the origins of the Tomcat used in the production, the jet is F-14A #159631, the 178th Tomcat Grumman built , which has called the San Diego Air And Space Museum’s Gillespie Field Annex in El Cajon home for years. F-14A #159631 at Gillespie Field in El Cajon, California. , San Diego Air And Space Museum Multiple sources have told us the elements had taken their toll on the jet, which has sat outside for years. It was in need of restoration with certain components showing alarming signs of corrosion. Clearly, lending the plane to star in Top Gun 2 would give the beleaguered airframe stardom unlike any other Tomcat that calls a museum or gate guard position home. Lending the jet to be used in the movie would turn the F-14 in need of help into a top attraction and the production budget of the film clearly helped clean it up for shooting. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xkHrPIZOtKA With that in mind, the phoenix symbols now painted on its airframe sort of have a second meaning outside the movie’s plot. This retired plane was really given a second shot at life and will surely be treasured going forward.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 16, 2019",An F-14 Tomcat Has Returned To The Deck Of An Operational Carrier For Top Gun 2 Production,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have been following the production of the highly anticipated sequel to Top Gun closely , a movie that is now deep in production. Last time we discussed the movie’s development was in regards to the revelation that the F-14 Tomcat would make at least a cameo appearance in the film, if not having a starring role. This came as photos leaked of Tom Cruise interacting with an F-14 at a snow-covered aircraft shelter at an airport near Lake Tahoe and also shooting some scenes in the vicinity around it. The jet, which was a real aircraft that was likely pulled from a museum, had special phoenix markings unique to the movie, as well. Now that same jet has appeared aboard an operational U.S. Navy aircraft carrier at Naval Station North Island in San Diego. Images of the jet show Cruise and a production crew working around the Tomcat that is positioned on one of the carrier’s two bow catapults. So it, is quite likely that this aircraft will be seen operating from an aircraft carrier in the film and is more than just a single scene plot tool within the script. Apparently, the airframe was also used for scenes shot at NAS North Island, which is colocated with the naval base. Source In the photos, the Tomcat is also packing an AIM-9 Sidewinder with orange bands, indicating it is a live round. This is certainly for the purposes of filming. The USS Theodore Roosevelt is rumored to be used for the movie’s production, so that is likely the carrier we are seeing the Tomcat on. There is a chance that it will set sail with it onboard, which would indicate extensive shooting of the Tomcat while at sea. Also, keep in mind that this is not a flying aircraft. It is being used as a static prop for ground footage. There are no flying Tomcats anywhere in the world aside from in Iran. The Navy retired the type in 2006 and most were either chopped up or demilitarized and sent to museums. Getting one flying for the movie would be very costly and nearly impossible due to red tape surrounding the Tomcat’s sensitive export controls due to their continued use by Iran. There are plenty of other issues as well. Source In other news, I have heard from two sources that aerial filming is ongoing and actual footage of aircraft in flight be used extensively in the movie. This is great news as it was worried that nearly all of the flight sequences would be fabricated with CGI, negating one of the original film’s best attributes. Regardless, the Tomcat is back aboard an operational supercarrier for the first time in over a decade which is bound to warm the hearts of many who remain superfans of Grumman’s swing-wing Fleet Defender.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 21, 2020",Boeing Is Building Big Orca Drone Subs For The Navy To Hunt And Lay Mines And More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has hired Boeing to build four Orca extra-large unmanned undersea vehicles, or XLUUVs. The service plans to use the Orcas to explore and refine future concepts of operation for underwater drones of this size, which could include gathering intelligence , emplacing or clearing naval mines , attacking other ships or submarines, conducting stand-off strikes, and more. The Pentagon announced that the Navy had awarded Boeing the contract for the Orcas, worth $43 million, in its daily service-wide contracting announcement on Feb. 13, 2019. Separately, the Chicago-headquartered defense contractor said it is partnering with shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls on the project in a Tweet on Feb. 15, 2019. “The Orca XLUUV will be modular in construction with the core vehicle providing guidance and control, navigation, autonomy, situational awareness, core communications, power distribution, energy and power, propulsion and maneuvering, and mission sensors,” the Pentagon announcement said. It “will have well-defined interfaces for the potential of implementing cost-effective upgrades in future increments to leverage advances in technology and respond to threat changes.” In 2017 , the Navy awarded XLUUV developmental contracts to both Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The latter firm had proposed a vehicle with a shape more in line with an enlarged torpedo. An artist’s conception of Lockheed Martin’s Orca proposal., Lockheed Martin Boeing’s Orca design has a boxier hullform more akin to a small submarine and is derived from an earlier private venture known as Echo Voyager . This XLUUV was itself an evolution of previous work done the company had done on large unmanned undersea vehicles called Echo Seeker and Echo Ranger . The most obvious difference between the Echo Voyager and the new Orca, at least based on Boeing’s concept art, is the replacement of the earlier undersea drone’s propeller with a shrouded propulsor . This improves propulsion efficiency and reduces noise , the latter factor being especially important for underwater military craft, where silence is essential to survival. Many modern military submarines, including the U.S. Navy’s Seawolf – and Virginia -classes , have similar propulsors for exactly this reason. Otherwise, it looks likely that the new Orcas will borrow significantly from the 51-foot long, 50-ton Echo Voyager’s design, including its modular payload bays. The Orca’s basic performance may be similar, as well. Boeing experimental Echo Voyager., Boeing The diesel-electric Echo Voyager has a maximum speed of around nine miles per hour underwater and can dive to depths up to 11,000 feet deep. Its batteries give it range of more than 150 miles at a speed of around 3 miles per hour, before it needs to surface and use its air-breathing diesel generator to recharge. Boeing has said that Echo Voyager could carry enough fuel to allow it to operate autonomously for up to six months at a time, covering total ranges of around 7,500 miles. With just one fuel module in its modular payload bays, it would still have a full range of more than 6,500 miles . It has its own sonar-enabled obstacle avoidance system, as well as an inertial navigation system. Orca may also leverage experience Huntington Ingalls gained while working on its own large unmanned undersea vehicle project, called Proteus , in cooperation with Bluefin Robotics and Battelle. Proteus is a significantly smaller vehicle, though, at around 25 feet long, and is limited capability-wise compared to Echo-Voyager . The range and payload capacity of Boeing’s earlier design would have already made it attractive to the Navy, which has been actively looking at potential missions for a drone submarine of this size since at least 2000. That year, the service issued its first unmanned undersea vehicle strategy white paper. In 2004 , it released a new Unmanned Undersea Vehicle “master plan.” As of 2011, there was reportedly yet another update to the overarching strategy, but it has remained classified. But public briefings since then have shown that the Navy’s plans for future XLUUVs remain largely unchanged. A US Navy briefing slide from October 2018, outlining unmanned undersea vehicle plans in the near- and long-term. The concept art of notional XLUUV configurations has been around since at least 2017., USN Orca’s immediate mission will likely be mine and counter-mine warfare. The threat of naval mines is only increasing and proliferating to even non-state actors . The Navy itself recognizes the value these weapons would have in various operational scenarios and is looking to expand its own capabilities in that regard, which you can read about more here . The Navy already uses much smaller unmanned undersea vehicles to scout for hostile mines without necessarily having to put manned ships at risk. Even the relatively large Orca would be better able to get into harder to reach areas, especially narrow and shallow waterways, where traditional minesweepers simply may not be able to maneuver. With their endurance and autonomy, multiple Orcas could help clear a broader area in less time, as well. Naval mine hunting and sweeping have historically been a slow and painstaking affair that would be especially difficult to do rapidly under enemy fire. The ability of the Orcas to operate across extended ranges and do so autonomously and discreetly, means they offer a novel way to deploy mines, as well. The underwater drones could not only help set up maritime minefields quickly within strategic chokepoints, but they could also potentially penetrate into denied areas well away from conflict zones to threaten enemy ports, shipyards, and other facilities. A US Navy graphic from 2004 describing potential XLUUV payloads, including mines and mine-neutralizing systems., USN This could include seeding mines in rivers and canals, as well. This kind of distributed mine warfare could only hamper the free movement of hostile naval forces, disrupt maritime logistics chains , and otherwise force an opponent to diverse limited resources to protecting rear areas. These same qualities also open up the potential for a far greater array of missions in the future. If Orca can slip into enemy territory to plant mines, it can also do so to gather intelligence, already a well-established mission for larger manned submarines. It might also be able to act as a decoy, mimicking the signature of larger ships or submarines. The Navy has expressed an interest in finding a way for XLUUVs to carry electronic warfare packages to otherwise blind enemy sensors to incoming threats, but it is hard to see how this would work unless they’re while running on the surface or very close to the surface. Beyond that, there’s the possibility that the Orcas, or a follow-on XLUUV design, could carry weapons themselves to carry out attacks on surface ships or submarines. The Echo Voyager’s payload bay was already large enough to accommodate light and heavyweight torpedoes and Boeing says that design could accept external payloads, as well. Combined with their autonomous capability and long range, packs of future XLUUVs networked together might also be able to persistently monitor and track potential threats, such as increasingly advanced Russia or Chinese submarines, holding them perpetually at risk across a broad region, such the Pacific. This is a mission the Navy has also envisioned for its future fleets of unmanned surface vessels . The service would require an underwater drone that could travel much faster than Orca to adequately perform this particular mission, though. Lastly, Orcas might even eventually be able to launch strikes against targets ashore using stand-off cruise missiles. The Navy has described the ability for underwater drones to rapidly and discreetly position themselves close to a crisis area could make them valuable for time-sensitive strikes. It has also said that in the past that this particular mission set is a relatively low priority for XLUUVs. Another US Navy graphic describing potential time-critical strike missions for future XLUUVs and how they might carry the stand-off weapons., USN The Navy’s ongoing plans for an over-arching network architecture , part of which is known as the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), that will link all of its ships, submarines aircraft, and other assets, means that XLUUVs might perform any combination of these missions in direct cooperation with manned platforms, as well. It also means that a group of the underwater drones might include various versions carrying only sensors packages or just weapons, to maximum payload space while working together as a team. The Orcas are also set to be a stepping stone in the Navy’s plans for what it calls Large Diameter Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (LDUUV) that submarines such as the Virginia-class could launch and recover much closer to the actual target area. The service is working on concepts for more robust submarine motherships as part of its Large Payload Submarine program, which you can read about more here . There’s nothing to say that the Orca, or a future XLUUV, couldn’t work in conjunction with a submarine mothership either. Using a larger, manned platform to deploy any sort of large underwater drone would let designers trade range for added payload capacity. The arrangement would also allow the unmanned vehicle to loiter in and around the target area for a longer period f time, which could be very useful for intelligence missions. The Navy does not have a fixed schedule for when XLUUVs like the Orcas might actually take on any of these missions operationally. But the four drone submarines will give the service the test force it needs to fully explore the capabilities of this new category of craft. In 2017, it stood up its first ever dedicated unmanned undersea vehicle unit , Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron One (UUVRON 1), specifically to take the lead in the development and testing of craft such as the Orca. The Pentagon’s contracting announcement says that Boeing and its partners will have built all four Orcas by 2022. If this schedule holds, the next few years look to be an exciting time for the Navy and the development of new and impressive undermanned undersea capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Commander That Fired First Female USAF Demo Team Leader Made This Crass Video 15 Years Ago (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On February 12, 2019, news that the first woman to lead an Air Force demonstration team was fired after just two weeks in the position sent shockwaves through the aviation community and made headlines in the mainstream press . We still don’t know what the cause was behind the firing, but it has come to our attention that the commander who did the deed made a very low-brow video with his squadronmates while deployed to Kunsan Air Base in Korea during the mid-2000s. Colonel Derek “Maestro” O’Malley is the commander for the 20th Fighter Wing. The unit is based at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina. He is also the base commander. His official bio, which you can read in full here , states his responsibilities as such: “He is responsible for the mission readiness of the wing’s aircraft, 17 wing staff agencies, stewardship of Shaw, and the health and welfare of 6,576 active duty Airmen and civilians and more than 8,000 family members. Further, he supervises the support of the 31,000 local military retirees and 29 geographically separated units across nine states.” Colonel Derek “Maestro” O’Malley, USAF O’Malley, a highly accomplished fighter pilot, also oversees the F-16 Viper Demonstration Team that calls the base home, the same unit that Kotnik was relieved from. Here is the Colonel’s letter announcing her dismissal: I removed Capt. Kotnik from her position as the commander of the Viper Demo team yesterday, because I lost confidence in her ability to lead the team. I know that loss of confidence is a common response from the Air Force, whenever someone is removed from a command position, and I think it’s important to understand why we take this approach. We have thousands of Airmen across our Air Force serving our country, and not one of them is perfect. As good people, like Capt. Kotnik make mistakes, I want them to have the opportunity to learn from them without being under public scrutiny, and to continue to be a part of this great service. They’ll be better for the experience, and in turn, we’ll be better as an Air Force. In these types of situations, I never forget that we’re dealing with real human beings, that I care deeply about, and that we are charged to take care of. This will be a difficult time for Capt. Kotnik, but she’s surrounded by wingmen that will help her every step of the way. It was exciting to have the first female demo team pilot here at Shaw, but I’m also just as excited about the many other females that are serving with great distinction across our Air Force. I’m proud to serve with them, and I’m inspired by them. Even as I speak, another female pilot from the 20th Fighter Wing is flying combat missions in the Middle East. Maj. Waters, last season’s Viper Demo pilot has resumed command, so the team is in great hands, and the show will go on. We’re looking forward to another amazing season with this team. Col. Derek O’Malley Commander, 20th Fighter Wing Maybe O’Mally’s approach to announcing what has to have been heartbreaking news for Kotnik, regardless of the circumstances, stems from the fact that he helped mastermind and starred in the video below while serving as the Chief Weapons Instructor for the 35th Fighter Squadron, a unit based in South Korea. The video includes song, dance, repeated references to genitalia, a big penis and testicles puppet, and is based around discomfort of the male genitalia while flying on missions and a particular brand of talcum powder that is a solution to those issues. It’s stupid and maybe funny in an immature way, and I mean real immature. It’s worth noting that the female pilot in the video is not Zoe Kotnik. This was made years before she served in the same squadron. From what we can tell, even in the mid-2000s, this video caused quite a stir, although we are unaware at this time of the exact disciplinary actions taken by higher-ups in the chain of command. Since then, the video been referenced in multiple military and aviation forums around the net. Maybe some will think the video is humorous and just a product of servicemen and women blowing off steam while stationed half a world away from home. Others will find it unbecoming of the positions and responsibilities of some of the people most prominently featured in it. The culture within the USAF has changed to some degree since its inception, but it stands as an incredibly stark reminder that really talented and valuable people can make really dumb decisions. In Colonel O’Malley’s case, this little sojourn into blue humor movie making didn’t seem to hold him back much. He went on to partake in the most prestigious opportunities the USAF has to offer its pilots.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 31, 2019",Navy’s Newest Carrier Needs Critical Updates To Launch And Recover Aircraft With Certain Loadouts,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has revealed that personnel aboard the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford carriers do not even have the necessary technical information to reliably launch and recover all configurations of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jet and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft. This follows a new Pentagon report that says the flattop’s advanced electromagnetic catapults and improved arresting gear remain as problematic as ever . On Feb. 14, 2019, USNI News was first to report on the lack of information, which only further speaks to Ford ’s, at best, limited capabilities to perform its core mission of conducting naval aviation operations nearly two years after delivery. In January 2019 , the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, released its latest annual review of the carrier’s progress, covering developments during the 2018 Fiscal Year. The report was highly critical of the state of Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG). “In a couple of months, they are on a path to publish the fully fleet-representative recovery bulletins that will give us the capability to recover any weapons configuration which F-18 or a Growler can have on a Nimitz -class,” U.S. Navy Commander Mehdi Akacem, Ford ’s Air Boss, told reporters visiting the carrier earlier in February 2019, according to USNI News . “So, when we next get to sea, we’re going to have tests pilots come out to do one real validation on the actual aircraft carrier, but then once that’s complete then we will be able to have fleet aircraft to come out and operate with us.” The Navy needs to develop these so-called launch and recovery bulletins in order to be able to properly set the parameters on the EMALS and AAG. These systems are highly automated so that the carrier’s crew can fine tune the launch and recovery process better than they could with the steam-powered catapults and arresting gear on the Nimitz -class carriers. At least on paper, the idea is that, with sufficient data, these systems can be set to very precise parameters that are specific to a certain type of aircraft and its loadout. There are many benefits to doing this, including reducing the wear and tear on both the carrier and its aircraft. In principle, the catapults will only need to use just enough force to throw a plane into the air and the arresting gear will only put the minimum amount of strain on the airframe to bring it safely to a stop. For example, the EMALS settings would be for an F/A-18E/F carrying a purely air-to-air loadout won’t be the same as one loaded down with 10 1,000-pound class precision-guided bombs. Differences in total fuel load, the exact configuration of the particular airframe , and other factors might come into play, as well. This would all apply to the AAG recovering returning aircraft, which might have partial stores and fuel loads. Concerns about how much stress the EMALS, in particular, puts on heavily laden aircraft has long been an issue. In 2017 , the Navy had announced it had finally developed a software fix to prevent the catapults from over-stressing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers specifically when carrying the 480-gallon centerline drop tank. “[But] there is no urgency to apply the fix, as shipboard launches of F/A-18s with [external fuel tanks] will not be conducted until 2019, following  CVN-78’s Post Shakedown Availability,” Rob Koon, a spokesperson for Naval Air Systems Command, told USNI News at the time. “There will be no impact because the aircraft launched prior to that time will not have [external fuel tanks]. [Post-shakedown availability] is the next availability for incorporating the software updates aboard  CVN-78 without disrupting its upcoming test schedule.” The problem is that until the Navy has sufficient data points, and has conducted flight tests to confirm their validity, Ford will still be limited in not only what kinds of aircraft it can send up, but what they can carry at all. Commander Akacem told the assembled reporters that the goal was to have all of the necessary information about the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G by the end of 2019. Unfortunately, neither the EMALS nor the AAG have come close to meeting the Navy’s basic requirements after years of development. Akacem and the rest of Ford ’s crew will have to contend with the extremely poor reliability of both systems as they try to confirm the launch and recovery data. As of September 2018, Ford had conducted a total of 747 launches using EMALS, with the system suffering 10 critical failure over the course of those tests, according to DOT&E’s latest report . The Navy’s requirement is for the catapults to be able to launch an average of 4,166 aircraft before experiencing a serious fault. The AAG’s performance was even worse. In 763 attempted recoveries, the arresting gear also suffered 10 operational mission failures. This included one instance in which the backup barricade system , primarily meant to stop an aircraft experiencing some sort of inflight emergency, also failed. The barricade system in place on the Nimitz -class carrier USS Ronald Reagan ., USN DOT&E noted that this rate was not only exponentially lower than the Navy’s established requirement of one failure every 16,500 recovery attempts, but also didn’t meet the requirements laid out in a new “re-baselined reliability growth curve.” What this means is that the service has outlined a new, delayed schedule for when the AAG should be making progress and the system isn’t even meeting those demands. In its report covering the 2017 Fiscal Year , DOT&E said that problems with the AAG meant Ford had just a one percent chance of being able to get through a typical day of flight operations without a problem. For testing purposes, the Navy had defined a normal day as recovering 84 aircraft during a 24-hour period. To make matters worse, crews still have to power down the entire EMALS or AAG system in order to troubleshoot problems, instead of being able to just cut off electricity to specific components. This effectively brings flight operations to a halt while trying to assess and fix the fault. It takes an hour and a half just to spin down the EMALS generators and motors before any repair work can begin. An F/A-18F Super Hornet comes in to land on Ford during testing., USN These problems also raise the question about how representative the data the Navy is collecting will be in the long term if there becomes a need for significant changes to the EMALS or AAG in the future. Major modifications to either system could require the service to have to re-validate the settings all over again. With two more Ford -class carriers already under construction , and the Navy having just agreed to purchase another pair after that, one can only hope that the service will be able to certify that all of the carrier air wing’s aircraft will be able to fly from their decks at all as soon as possible. But the ongoing difficulties with the EMALS and AAG present a definite risk of more delays,. If nothing else, this only underscores the extremely limited operational capability Ford has at present and further calls into question when it might be able to make any sort of meaningful contribution to real-world missions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",India Reportedly Looks To Buy Unfinished Soviet-Era MiG-29s To Stave Off Fighter Shortage,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Facing a steady decline in available fighter jets, the Indian Air Force is now reportedly in talks to buy 21 unfinished Soviet-era MiG-29 Fulcrums from Russia and have them completed in a modernized configuration. The proposed deal comes as India continues to struggle with a host of other fighter jet procurement efforts, most notably a more than decade long effort to purchase of more than a hundred new fighter jets, which is now effectively in its third incarnation . The Times of India was first to report on the possible acquisition of the MiG-29 hulks, which date to the late 1980s and have apparently been in storage since at least around the fall of the Soviet Union. India received around 70 early model MiG-29s from  Russia between 1986 and 1990, of which around 62 remain in service. Since the early 2010s, Indian aerospace contractor Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), in cooperation with MiG in Russia, has upgraded about half of these two the MiG-29UPG standard , with Russian assistance. The UPG variant is similar to the Russian modernized MiG-29SMT , featuring the Zhuk-ME electronically scanned slotted planar array radar, as well as engine improvements and an expanded capability to conduct air-to-ground missions. Where the UPG reportedly differs most from the SMT is in its non-Russian avionics upgrades. The Indian Navy also flies MiG-29Ks that have many updated features in common with the SMT and UPG variants. The new potential deal with Russia would see the incomplete MiG-29s finished in a configuration similar to either the SMT or UPG versions, according to The Times . An Indian MiG-29 upgraded by MiG in Russia to the UPG standard., MiG “These fighters were built in the 1980s but never assembled and flown,” an unnamed Indian Air Force officer reportedly told the Indian daily. “Our team visited Russia last month and found the MiG-29 skeletons to be in good condition.” The individual offered no further details on the state of the aircraft parts, which have been in storage now for at least around 30 years. Beyond the officer saying India had been offered “a good price,” there is no word on how much the Russians want for the unassembled planes or to finish building them to a modern standard. But it is hard to see how the proposal would provide India, at least in the near term, with the additional fighter jet capacity it desperately needs right now. The jets not only need to be assembled, but have to be brought up to a significantly different standard. The SMT and UPG variants both feature an enlarged “hump” behind the cockpit, for example, which holds extra fuel. A Russian MiG-29SMT., Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia Making the changes necessary to internal wiring and other changes necessary to accommodate the new radar and other electronics could be particularly labor intensive. To underscore the potential complexities of the updates, the Indian Air Force’s entire MiG-29 fleet was originally supposed to be in the UPG configuration by 2013 . The amount of effort it might take to get just 20 additional aircraft into service seems excessive when the Indian Air Force has had a firm requirement for more than 100 additional aircraft since 2001 . The Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft competition, or MMCRA , which has been officially ongoing since 2007, is still supposed to provide the bulk of the capacity, but still seems years after from leading to the acquisition of actual aircraft. The fact that India has dropped its participation in Russia’s fledgling Su-57 program that was supposed to result in an Indian-specific variant called the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) only adds more uncertainty to the country’s future fighter force structure. The chronically underperforming domestically-produced Tejas fighter jet was also supposed to help replace dozens more Cold War-era jets. So far, the Indian Air Force has around a dozen Tejas Mk 1s and 40 more still on order, as well as plans to acquire more than 80 substantially improved Mk 1A variants . A HAL Tejas Mk 1., Venkat Mangudi via Wikimedia However, the Mk 1A isn’t even supposed to make its first flight until 2020 . The Indian Air Force’s plans to acquire a further upgraded Mk 2 variant, as well as a domestically designed stealth fighter, known as the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), are still very much in the conceptual phase. In the interim, India had inked a deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets from French manufacturer Dassault. The first of these aircraft are in flight testing in France with the expectation that they’ll get delivered later this year . However, years of allegations of corruption with regards to that contract have let to a bitter political and legal battle that threatens to upend the purchase entirely . With all this in mind, the Indian Air Force may feel it has no choice but to resort to less optimal avenues to acquire any additional fighter jets. The Indian government says that the service needs at least 42 squadrons of fighter jets to meet its operational requirements, most importantly the need to continue presenting a realistic challenge to ever-growing Chinese and Pakistani airpower . At present, it has just 31 squadrons. Even more worrisome, many of these are equipped with increasingly geriatric Soviet-era MiG-21 and MiG-27 and European Jaguar and Mirage 2000 tactical jets. Though these planes have all received upgrades over the years, the basic life expectancy of the airframes is increasingly in question. It was just announced that India is looking to acquire another 18 Sukhoi Su-30MKI kits to assemble in-country as an additional measure to help further shore up the country’s rickety fighter force. Nearly 300 Su-30 aircraft, in the form of kits or otherwise, will have been delivered to India once the deal runs its course. Indian firefighters hose down the remains of a MiG-27 after a crash in 2016., Ramji Vyas/Hindustan Times/Sipa via AP Just so far in February 2019 , the Indian Air Force has lost one MiG-27 and one Mirage 2000 in accidents. The pilot on board the MiG was able to eject, but the two aviators in the Mirage died. In the past, Indian media has referred to the MiG-21s and -27s specifically as “ flying coffins ” and “ widow makers ” on account of regular and often fatal crashes. The Indian Air Force definitely needs more fighter jets to fill these growing gaps, which will only continue to expand as time goes on. But it’s not clear if pulling unfinished MiG-29s out of storage and bringing them up to a modern standard is a realistic path toward helping alleviate those issues. It’s also possible that India could just use the old airframes for parts, but doing so would only have a chance of increasing the readiness of the existing MiG-29 fleet, not growing its size as a whole.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 15, 2019",Air Force Sacks First Female To Lead A Fighter Demonstration Team After Just Two Weeks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States Air Force has removed Captain Zoe Kotnik, the first women to lead one of the flying force’s demonstration teams, after being in the position for just two weeks. Kotnik took the reins of the F-16 Viper Demonstration Team in parallel to a potent media blitz on behalf of the Air Force. The announcement was seen by many as an exciting example of how women are becoming an ever more dominant force within the service’s ranks and pilot culture. You can read all about Kotnik and her rise to such a prominent flying position in this previous piece of ours . Suffice it to say that in a year when the Air Force is set to make a major media splash with the highly anticipated blockbuster action film Captain Marvel , which stars Brie Larson as a superhero that has a fighter pilot past, axing its first female demo team lead is far from convenient. A posting on the team’s highly active Facebook page from the Commander of the 20th Fighter Wing who oversees the team reads: I removed Capt. Kotnik from her position as the commander of the Viper Demo team yesterday, because I lost confidence in her ability to lead the team. I know that loss of confidence is a common response from the Air Force, whenever someone is removed from a command position, and I think it’s important to understand why we take this approach. We have thousands of Airmen across our Air Force serving our country, and not one of them is perfect. As good people, like Capt. Kotnik make mistakes, I want them to have the opportunity to learn from them without being under public scrutiny, and to continue to be a part of this great service. They’ll be better for the experience, and in turn, we’ll be better as an Air Force. In these types of situations, I never forget that we’re dealing with real human beings, that I care deeply about, and that we are charged to take care of. This will be a difficult time for Capt. Kotnik, but she’s surrounded by wingmen that will help her every step of the way. It was exciting to have the first female demo team pilot here at Shaw, but I’m also just as excited about the many other females that are serving with great distinction across our Air Force. I’m proud to serve with them, and I’m inspired by them. Even as I speak, another female pilot from the 20th Fighter Wing is flying combat missions in the Middle East. Maj. Waters, last season’s Viper Demo pilot has resumed command, so the team is in great hands, and the show will go on. We’re looking forward to another amazing season with this team. Col. Derek O’Malley Commander, 20th Fighter Wing It’s not all that uncommon for the Air Force to remove people from command, but it is quite rare that something like this occurs after just a matter of days of taking up the new position.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 6, 2019",Let’s Talk About The U.K.’s Sudden Move To Field A Drone Swarm Squadron,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has revealed plans for a new Royal Air Force squadron that will operate a fleet of unmanned aircraft able to fly networked together as a swarm . Depending on how the program evolves, it might involve the fielding of a true unmanned combat air vehicle , or UCAV, or at least serve as a stepping stone to realizing such an operational capability. U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson briefly mentioned the swarm project in a wide-ranging speech on the future of the country’s armed forces at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank on Feb. 11, 2019 . The drones were among the many programs the Ministry of Defense is paying for through a new, flexible “Transformation Fund,” which has the intended goal of helping speed up the development of new and advanced capabilities across the country’s armed forces as a whole. “I have decided to use the Transformation Fund to develop swarm squadrons of network enabled drones capable of confusing and overwhelming enemy air defenses,” Williamson said in his remarks. “We expect to see these ready to be deployed by the end of this year.” His stated schedule for when the drones might enter service has already caused some confusion. An official statement from the Ministry of Defense has contradicted this timeline, saying that the unmanned aircraft are still years away from being ready for actual missions. “The RAF will form a new squadron with a new concept, able to deploy swarms of network-enabled drones,” a Ministry of Defense spokesperson told U.K. Defense Journal later on Feb. 11, 2019. “The details of who will build the drones, the tender process and the technology which will be employed, will be developed over the 3-year program.” A “tender process” means that the United Kingdom plans to hold a competition to pick a winning design rather than issue a sole-source contract to one particular company. It is possible that Williamson was actually indicating that the final selection of a particular drone would occur before the end of 2019. The Ministry of Defense could conceivably approve a more limited buy of unmanned aircraft that meet a minimum of basic requirements in order to help quickly stand up the new RAF squadron and begin the process of training personnel on their new mission ahead of the full tender process. Williamson’s might be using the Transformation Fund to support this initial effort and jumpstart the program. The RAF recently began receiving new Protector unmanned aircraft , derived from the MQ-9 Reaper, which are not capable of performing the missions that Defense Secretary Williamson outlined in his recent speech., Crown Copyright Beyond the exact nature of the procurement process being unclear, neither Williamson nor the Ministry of Defense has given any further details about the desired size and configuration of the drones themselves. The Secretary of Defense’s comments about their primary mission being to defeat enemy air defenses does not necessarily offer any clear indications about the required capabilities. Swarms by their very nature are inherently threatening to enemy air defenses, overwhelming sensors and their operators with too many targets to properly prioritize and with reaction times and coordinated assaults that are beyond the abilities of human aircrews. Drones equipped with electronic or cyberwarfare packages could further disrupt or confuse an opponent’s defensive networks. The swarms could also act as decoys , emitting signals similar to larger aircraft and distracting the enemy from higher value threats. Armed with conventional munitions or directed energy weapons , these unmanned aircraft could destroy air defenses themselves, helping to clear a path for follow-on strikes by more conventional aircraft. Of course, drone swarms can perform missions unrelated to enemy air defenses, too, and have a host of other highly beneficial qualities, in general, which you can read about in more detail here . The video below depicts the possible capabilities the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Gremlins drone swarms, which provides a good general overview of the concept of employment and utility of swarming unmanned aircraft, in general. The plan to establish a full squadron to operate the aircraft does point to drones that are larger than various air- and ground-launched systems presently under development around the world, especially in the United States and China , and are reusable. This would suggest Williamson was not referring to smaller missile-like systems, such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy-X (MALD-X) that the U.S. Air Force and Navy are developing. It is possible he could have been describing a smaller, but recoverable system along the lines of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has in the works under the Gremlins program . But from what we do know, it sounds more like the United Kingdom is interested in something more along the lines of the stealthy XQ-58 Valkyrie from American drone manufacturer Kratos. The U.S. Air Force is planning to test the XQ-58 as part of its own Low-Cost Attritable Strike Demonstration (LCASD) program and envisions the aircraft as operating in swarms and as “loyal wingmen” where they would fly networked together with manned aircraft. An artist’s conception of the XQ-58 in a reusable configuration with retractable landing gear., USAF The XQ-58, depicted in concept art as having aircraft-style tricycle landing gear, is an evolution of Kratos’ ground-launched XQ-222, also known as the Valkyrie. The company estimated that each XQ-222 would cost around $3 million , less than a quarter of the fly-away cost of the Air Force’s non-stealthy MQ-9 Reapers. Despite its relatively low price tag, this earlier design could carry a pair of 250-pound class GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs , electronic warfare systems, sensors, and more. When the firm unveiled this earlier Valkyrie design in 2017 , it said that the unmanned aircraft would have a maximum range of more than 3,000 miles and a combat radius of up to 1,500 miles, depending on the payloads inside. Jane’s subsequently reported that the maximum distance the drone could fly was closer to 2,100 miles. For some context, a straight shot from London to Moscow is around 1,500 miles and fighter aircraft generally have a combat range of around 700 to 1,100 miles. The XQ-222 itself was an outgrowth of Kratos’ previous work with the Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform-22 ( UTAP-22 ), also known as the Mako. The ground-launched UTAP-22 is a ground-launched derivative of the BQM-167A aerial target drone that has demonstrated its ability to operate in swarms and as a loyal wingman. You can read more about both of these drones here and here . https://youtube.com/watch?v=lcP66syzQls Kratos also notably received permission to sell the UTAP-22 to foreign customers in Europe and Asia who otherwise meet the requirements of American export regulations, in March 2018 . The company also said that it had at least four previously unannounced tactical drone projects in the works in a call with investors and media to discuss quarterly earnings in November 2018 . One of these in-development designs is probably a derivative of the XQ-58 with a swarming, autonomous capability. The American company would seem to be a leading contender for the U.K.’s new swarming drone tender, if it hasn’t already proposed its XQ-58 or a derivative thereof. Since 2017, the RAF’s own Rapid Capabilities Office has been exploring options for a lower-cost attritable UCAV as part of the Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) program. “The conversation is open,” RAF Air Vice-Marshal Simon ‘Rocky’ Rochelle, Chief of Staff, Capability and Force Development, told the Royal Aeronautical Society in 2018. “It’s for everybody to come and show us what can be delivered its effectiveness. We are truly looking for disruption in that area too.” Work already underway as part LANCA may be part of Defense Secretary Williamson’s optimistic schedule for the new drone swarm squadron, as well. Any developments the RAF is pursuing under that project would almost at least help inform the service’s drone swarm requirements. However, LANCA’s stated emphasis has been more focused on the development of a higher-end UCAV than the XQ-58 that would have greater capabilities overall and fighter jet-like performance. This unmanned aircraft would be able to work closely with future sixth generation manned fighters, such as the U.K.’s now-in-development Tempest . The BAE Systems’ led Tempest program already envisions “scalable autonomy,” suggesting the design will be pilot optional and capable of operating as a UCAV itself., BAE Systems Since 2005, U.K.-headquartered BAE Systems has been working on a proof-of-concept UCAV testbed called Taranis , which could serve as the basis for a design that is better suited to meeting this more robust requirement. It could also offer an upper-tier capability for any new drone-swarm unit. It may turn out that the Ministry of Defense’s rush to establish a drone swarm squadron with a lower-end type of aircraft, such as the XQ-58, would serve as the stepping stone to establishing full UCAV squadrons, as well. In the past, BAE has stated that an operational UCAV based on Taranis would be operational “ post 2030 ,” which is the same timeframe when the United Kingdom hopes to begin taking deliveries of the Tempest fighter jets . Completing the tender for the initial drone squadron and the full development of the selected system within the next three years would give RAF personnel ample time to begin developing tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing full on UCAVs in the following decade. The need for an attritable system, which would be a lower-cost, high-volume fleet, would be somewhat less pressing after the acquisition of a costlier and lower-density high-end platform, but It is becoming ever more apparent that one really doesn’t fully displace the other capabilities wise. Another possibility is that the U.K. Ministry of Defense has bought into an ongoing, but clandestine American unmanned combat air vehicle program. You can read all about how the U.S. proved the game-changing technology nearly two decades ago, before seemed to disappear entirely from view and from the USAF’s vernacular and vision of the future, in this past special feature of ours. USN Fast forward to today and there are many indicators that this technology was dragged into the ‘black’ world of compartmentalized programs. If this was indeed the case, it is an unfortunate move for a number of reasons we discussed in our previously linked feature, but there are signs that this may be coming to an end. These include a big hiring push for an unnamed production program at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth facility and persistent silence from the U.S. Air Force’s leadership on the topic even as peer state competitors around the globe are now openly developing this capability themselves . By joining forces on a UCAV initiative, the United States and the United Kingdom could pool their resources and achieve better economies of scale and deeper levels of interoperability. There is a long history of this between the two countries, but it’s becoming an increasingly common arrangement as of late. In recent years, the Royal Air Force has adopted the RC-135 Rivet Joint , P-8 Poseidon , and MQ-9 Reaper instead of developing indigenous solutions to satisfy those mission sets. The F-35B Joint Strike Fighter is another example of this. US Air Force and RAF MQ-9 Reapers together at Kandahar Air Base in Afghanistan., USAF The U.S. government offering its friend with a ‘special relationship’ access to one of its most secretive and cutting-edge combat aircraft programs that is in a pre-operational, but maturing state wouldn’t necessarily be unprecedented, either. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan personally invited Prime Minister Magret Thatcher into the F-117 stealth fighter program. You can read all about this historic and at the time very secret overture here . When the offer was made, the F-117 program was growing and evolving into an operational capability under a veil of darkness at its desolate base in Tonopah, Nevada . This is the same place where a pocket force of semi-operational networked UCAVs would most likely live today and there continues to be evidence of just that being the case. In order for shared UCAV program to grow into a scale that would be strategically impactful and would truly leverage its unique swarming concept, moving it from the shadows and into the light for full-rate production would be essential. Williamson’s comments could reflect this reality. Also, by taking part in an American UCAV program, the Royal Air Force would be far better prepared to introduce an indigenous one, potentially based around a Taranis successor, in the years to come. Moving a greater share of the aerial combat burden from manned to unmanned aircraft is already attractive for many smaller countries due to the savings in pilot training and infrastructure on top of the lower cost of these platforms compared to manned aircraft, in general. As time goes on, UCAVs will only become more advanced and more autonomous, offering capabilities very close to manned fighter jets and other combat aircraft, all at a lower cost . Based on how they’re programmed, a UCAV swarm can also act far faster in a coordinated manner than a human-controlled team and better exploit its capabilities to their maximum potential at all times. The drones in the swarm also offer added range and lower observability that manned platforms can’t provide, as well. It’s even less surprising that the United Kingdom is increasingly interested in pursuing this type of unmanned air combat capability in light of the economic uncertainty surrounding the country’s upcoming departure from the European Union . Existing budget austerity and defense cuts already call into question how realistic it is for the country to develop a new manned stealth fighter at all, even with possible foreign cooperation . Taranis alongside a RAF Typhoon., BAE Systems The swarming drone program will also help ensure that the United Kingdom can continue to compete in the air combat space with peer competitors in the future. This is especially true with regards to China , but also to a lesser extent Russia , as both of these countries continue to invest significant resources into UCAVs and swarm capabilities . All told, the United Kingdom’s new drone swarm plans could be the beginning of a more significant transformation of the RAF with a greater emphasis on unmanned platforms going forward.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 29, 2019",Royal Navy Wants Amphibious Ships That Looks Just Like Secretive U.S. Spec Ops Mothership,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United Kingdom is developing a Future Littoral Strike Ship concept for the Royal Navy, which looks almost identical to the U.S. Navy’s secretive M/V Ocean Trader special operations mothership. The War Zone has been first to report on various sightings and new information regarding this ship in recent years. However, the British vessel’s mission would be to support a broader array of operations, including crisis response and disaster relief, as part of an ambitious plan to reinvigorate the country’s amphibious capabilities . U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson announced the Future Littoral Strike Ship (FLSS) plan, as well as associated amphibious developments, in a speech at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank on Feb. 11, 2019 . Royal Navy Admiral Sir Philip Jones then Tweeted out additional information, along with concept art of the proposed ship. A new “multi-million-pound Transformation Fund” is paying for the FLSS program among other initiatives, according to Williamson. “[We are] investing now to develop a new Littoral Strike Ship concept. And, if successful, we will look to dramatically accelerate their delivery,” Williamson said in his speech. “These globally deployable, multi-role vessels would be able to conduct a wide range of operations, from crisis support to war-fighting.” “By accelerating the Future Littoral Strike Ship development via the Transformation Fund, we have the chance for more rapid introduction of this valuable capability into the Fleet, significantly enhancing our ability to act in support of Defence & cross-government objectives,” Jones posted on Twitter. “Designed to support the unique capabilities of @RoyalMarines Future Commando Force, FLSS offer a dramatic increase in the range, mass & lethality of forces that can be projected from sea to land, delivering decisive military effect anywhere in the world, at a time of our choosing,” he continued. The ship Jones’ social media post depicts as representative of the FLSS concept is a dead ringer for the aforementioned Ocean Trader . Danish shipbuilder Odense Steel Shipyard originally built this ship in 2011 as a roll-on/roll-off cargo ferry, derived, at least in part , from a design from German shipbuilder Flensburger Schiffbau . In 2014 , the ship, previously known as the Maersk Line’s M/V Craigside , arrived at BAE Systems’ shipyards in Mobile, Alabama for conversion into what the Navy described as a “Maritime Support Vessel.” What this actually meant was gutting the vessel, which displaces some 30,000 tons, and rebuilding it as a special operations sea base. The result of the $143 million-dollar conversion was dramatic. Ocean Trader has living quarters that can support up to around 200 special operators at a time and can operate independently for up to 45 days. It can use a ramp at the stern to quickly load and unload vehicles and other cargo in ports or to floating barges. It also has a spacious forward flight deck able to support large helicopters and hangars big enough to hold at least two of them internally. On the starboard side, there are four hangars capable of launching various small craft, including stealthy speedboats . The ship also received substantial communications and data sharing upgrades, has the ability to launch and recover smaller drones , and much more, all of which you can read about in more detail here and here . M/V Ocean Trader with three of the four hangars on the starboard side open showing stealthy special operations Combatant Craft Assaults (CCA) , David Kozdron “They [the FLSS] would support our Future Commando Force,” Williamson added, referring to a separate plan to restructure the Royal Marines. “Our world-renowned Royal Marines – they’ll be forward deployed, at exceptionally high readiness, and able to respond at a moment’s notice bringing the fight from sea to land.” In April 2017, First Sea Lord Jones first announced the overhaul of the Royal Marines, the bulk of which are presently situated within its 3 Commando Brigade, which included a planned ability to deploy specialized “ Maritime Operations Commando ” task forces in the future. A ship configured along the lines of Ocean Trader would be a logical and cost-effective choice to support this sort of rapid response force and enable it to use both helicopters and small landing craft to get ashore in the absence of readily accessible port facilities. In 2016, Canada’s Irving Shipbuilding pitched another conversion of a roll-on/roll-off ship similar to Flensburger’s designs, known as the Maritime Support Ship, which was primarily geared toward humanitarian aid and disaster relief missions. The general proposed configuration is also similar to the one BAE delivered to the Navy. Irving said the total cost to the Canadian government would be less than $250 million per ship, making the concept especially attractive as a low-cost option for lower-risk missions. Irving Shipbuilding’s proposal for a Maritime Support Ship that is similar in many respects to BAE Systems’ conversion of the M/V Ocean Trader ., Irving Shipbuilding Acquiring an FLSS using BAE Systems’ conversion concept for Flensburger’s designs also makes good sense for the United Kingdom, specifically, which has had access to smaller ships of a similar design known as the Point -class through a Private Finance Initiative since 2002. Flensburger built four of the six ships in this class, while Harland & Wolff in Northern Ireland built the other two. The U.K. Ministry of Defense then signed a deal with Foreland Shipping that it could call upon these vessels as contractor-operated naval auxiliaries in times of need, but that the company can otherwise operate them commercially. It is possible that the United Kingdom might outright purchase any of the four remaining Point -class ships that it has under contract and convert them into the FLSS configuration. These vessels, which are similar to Ocean Trader displacement and configuration before its conversion, may require more extensive and costly modifications than Ocean Trader due to the broader mission set the U.K. Ministry of Defense has in mind and some slight differences in their design. But depending on the modularity of the conversion, whatever the exact base ship design turns out to be, the Royal Navy might be able to readily reconfigure the vessel between various combat and non-combat missions. This would give the Royal Navy a more flexible platform, for a relatively low price compared to a more traditional amphibious ship. The Point -class M/V Hartland Point carries British military vehicles and equipment in support of the Response Force Task Group deployment in 2012., Crown Copyright The Point -class ships have already previously served as elements of the Royal Navy-led very-high readiness Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime) , previously known as the Response Force Task Group, but only in the general cargo carrying role. The flagship of these task forces, however, had previously been the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean . The United Kingdom officially decommissioned Ocean in 2018 and sold her to Brazil. Since then, the Royal Marines have had to rely on the Royal Navy’s two Albion -class landing platform docks and the three Bay -class landing ships. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), a civilian mariner service akin to the U.S. Military Sealift Command , operates the latter ships. From left to right, HMS Albion , the at-sea replenishment ship RFA Fort Rosalie , and HMS Ocean . , Crown Copyright “Our vision is for these ships [the FLSS] to form part of 2 Littoral Strike Groups complete with escorts, support vessels, and helicopters,” Defense Secretary Williamson explained in his speech at RUSI. “One would be based East of Suez in the Indo-Pacific and one based West of Suez in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Baltic.” What Williamson is describing is a lower-end task force for less demanding missions that don’t require larger Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime) task forces, which could include the Royal Navy’s new supercarrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , and her sister HMS Prince of Wales , in the future. During those missions, the carriers could carry a “ Littoral Maneuver ” force also consisting of Royal Marines and helicopters. It’s an ambitious plan, but it is in line with other statements from the British government about plans to expand the U.K. Armed Forces’ operational reach and cooperation with allies and partners abroad, especially in Europe and Asia. Just in January 2019, the Royal Navy conducted drills alongside the U.S. Navy in the highly contested South China Sea to challenge Chinese claims over the region. The first operational deployment for country’s new supercarrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , scheduled to occur in 2021, will include trips to the Mediterranean, Middle East, Pacific region “making global Britain a reality,” Williams also said in his speech. The Defense Secretary’s comments also reflect a significant change in tone regarding the U.K. armed forces amphibious capabilities. In 2017, there were reports that the Ministry of Defense might have to cut the more than 8,000-strong Royal Marines’ overall size by more than 10 percent and retire the two Albion class amphibious ships to help pay for other priorities, most notably the Royal Navy’s pair of Queen Elizabeth -class carriers. Williamson did not speak directly to the future of the Albions or the total size of the Royal Marines, but did say that the existing two amphibious ships were still part of broader plans for British amphibious capability going forward. In addition, though Defense Secretary Williamson and First Sea Lord Jones did not specifically mention it in their respective comments, the FLSS would also be ideally suited to serving as a floating launch platform for special operations missions. U.K. special operations forces, such as the elite Special Air Service and Special Boat Service , routinely train and otherwise liaise with their American counterparts and it is very likely that they at least have a good understanding of Ocean Trader ’s capabilities, if they haven’t actually spent time on board the vessel. Still, it remains to be seen how far the United Kingdom will actually pursue the FLSS program and how many ships it might acquire in total. Williamson was very careful in his speech to hedge that the plan was very much conceptual at present and might not proceed if it doesn’t meet the Ministry of Defense’s expectations. While the FLSS concept certainly aims to be cost-conscious, the ships themselves are unlikely to be able to provide a particularly robust amphibious capability. Ocean Trader can only hold 200 special operators after its conversion. By comparison, the Albion -class ships can carry a standard complement of more than 400 Royal Marines, and more than 700 if absolutely necessary, and they also have a well deck to carry more readily launch amphibious vehicles and larger landing craft. As converted roll-on, roll-off ships originally built to commercial standards, they would be more vulnerable to hostile fire and battle damage. With a smaller crew more in line with commercial vessels than warships, dealing with that damage also becomes a major issue. At present, there is no indication from the concept art that the proposed ship would have anything but the most minimal defenses. Ocean Trader, for instance, is only equipped with machine guns for force protection. Increasingly advanced anti-ship missiles , naval mines , and other threats , which are steadily proliferating even to non-state actors , would pose a serious risk to a similar ship operating in an amphibious assault combat environment. This is true even inside a larger task force, but especially during more independent operations with minimal or no escorts. As such, there is also a very real question about how realistic the proposal for two new standing, forward-based Littoral Strike Groups actually is for the United Kingdom, especially in light of economic concerns surrounding the impending departure of the country from the European Union . At present, the core of the Royal Navy’s surface fleet consists of six Type 45 destroyers and 13 Type 23 frigates . Even if each Littoral Strike Group only has just one frigate assigned to it as an escort, this means that 15 percent of the Royal Navy’s entire Type 23 fleet would be otherwise unavailable for other missions. The service has already had difficulty keeping up the availability rates of these ships due to their advancing age and personnel shortages . Combined with the simple need for routine maintenance, all 13 of the ships are unlikely to be available for deployments at any one time. Without escorts permanently in place, it could be difficult for the United Kingdom to rapidly deploy the FLSS to anywhere but the most low-risk conflict areas around the globe. This is not much of a concern for a special operations focused mothership, but it is for one tasked with traditional amphibious operations. HMS Queen Elizabeth sails with a pair of Type 23. , Crown Copyright This is before taking into account the Royal Navy’s emerging requirements for escorts and other ships to assist the Queen Elizabeth -class carriers on their deployments. A typical U.S. carrier strike group includes a Ticonderoga -class guided-missile cruiser, three Arleigh Burke -class destroyers , and at least one Los Angeles -class attack submarine. In an attempt to mitigate this issue, the United Kingdom has already made arrangements with allies to provide additional capacity during the flattop’s first patrol. The Royal Navy is planning to replace the aging Type 23s, but with eight new Type 26 and five Type 31e frigates, which will not grow the overall size of the service’s surface fleet. Those ships are still years away from entering service and the United Kingdom hasn’t even picked a final Type 31e design. None of this will alleviate the issues of recruitment and retention of sailors to man these ships, either. Even with these issues to contend with, Williamson was right to note the demand for increased amphibious operations capacity in his speech at RUSI. The FLSS concept certainly could help fill in some capacity gaps, at least for certain operational requirements, even though going with a converted commercial ship design for the demanding amphibious operations mission set will inject higher operational risk. Providing a proper surface combatant escort for these vessels will be key and that won’t be easy considering the tasking and availability issues the Royal Navy already is dealing with in regards to its relatively small surface combatant fleet. Still, letting these ships do some of the lower-end tasks might help free up the Albions, the Royal Navy’s new carriers, and other ships for more demanding amphibious missions. When a major amphibious operation is necessary, these converted vessels can augment those vessels and other Royal Navy fighting ships as part of an overall task force that will come with plenty of escort firepower. But it remains to be seen whether the Royal Navy will have the other resources necessary to make the most of the added capabilities these new ships would have to offer. Then again, there is probably just as much of a case for the Ministry of Defense investing in at least one of these unique vessels for special operations focused missions with amphibious support and disaster relief as secondary functions. The country has some of the finest capabilities in the world in this regard. Pushing those capabilities out to sea on a specially modified, but somewhat affordable mothership seems like an equally attractive proposition.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 31, 2018",This Test Force Highlight Video Shows The B-2 Spirit As You’ve Never Seen It Before,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s amazing to think that the B-2 Spirit’s first flight was nearly three decades ago. On July 17, 1989, the world’s first stealth bomber took to the skies for the very first time. What came next was years of intricate testing that brought the Air Force and industry together to transform the bat-winged bomber from an exotic flying machine into America’s deadliest flying weapon . A video montage recently posted online shows this process, and the B-2 in general, like you’ve have never seen them before. We were recently treated to a series of beautifully produced videos celebrating the B-2’s creation from the jet’s manufacturer, Northrop Grumman. Those videos were great, but this B-2 Combined Test Force highlight reel is absolutely awesome for a number of reasons. First off, it shows so many unique elements of the B-2’s development, many of which we have never seen before. Beyond that, it has a surprisingly good ‘vintage’ soundtrack that is paired with some sweet editing that really works to capture the esprit de corps among the sprawling team of people who gave birth to the Spirit. https://youtube.com/watch?v=LkyaPA6EM_E As the video notes, at its peak, the B-2 test program involved over 2,000 dedicated people, six B-2s, and a C-135 avionics testbed. It completed over 23,600 individual test points that occurred over 989 missions and 5,242 flight test hours. In the end, all this work was done for just 21 airframes, but to this very day, the small fleet of B-2s is considered a national treasure and linchpin of national security that is capable of executing a surprisingly wide array of missions. These include nuclear and conventional strike missions . flyingtigerantiques.com The video’s timing is somewhat topical as America’s next stealth bomber’s Combined Test Force is already spinning up . Its job will not be easy . Even though thirty years of technological development and knowledge gained from operating the B-2 have helped, the B-21 Raider will have a fairly compressed testing schedule . The advanced stealth jet is slated to enter service in the middle of the coming decade when it will also begin to replace B-2s and B-1s at a steady pace into the 2030s. With that in mind, it’s good to remember those who blazed the stealth bomber trail and how they did it. It’s also worth noting that the B-2’s own development continues till this very day with the 72nd Test and Evaluation Squadron playing a central role in those efforts. Maybe what becomes most clear when watching the test montage video is that the B-2 still looks totally alien even after plowing the skies for 30 years. In fact, the plane remains so technologically sensitive that even disposing of it will be a major logistical undertaking . Thankfully, we still have years to marvel at the B-2 before she heads to the boneyard or meets the scrapper’s blade.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 16, 2019","What Sanctions? Kim Jong Un Gets Another New Limo, This Time An S600 Mercedes-Maybach","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As many continue to claim international sanctions are crippling North Korea’s economy and leaving the Kim regime starved of cash and luxury goods, we continue to get glaring indications otherwise. Case in point, Kim Jong Un being filmed rolling around Pyongyang in yet another new super high-end limousine. Last time it was a Rolls Royce Phantom, this time it’s a late body armored Mercedes-Maybach S600. The revelation comes just weeks before another summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump will be held, one in which the North Koreans are demanding sanctions relief before proceeding with nuclear disarmament to any tangible degree. The new armored limousine based on the Mercedes-Maybach S600 first appeared in a broadcast , seen below, on state-run Korean Central Television (KCTV) on Feb. 1, 2019. One clip showed Kim standing next to the car on Jan. 31, 2019, during a visit to see performances by the DPRK Friendship Art Delegation, which had recently returned from China. Another showed the vehicle driving to the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) Central Committee building in the North Korean capital Pyongyang. The segments in question begin at 40:00 in the runtime in the video below. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YQxU8TgGQts Kim’s affinity for Mercedes limos is well documented. He notably used armored S600 Pullman Guard limousines to travel to his historic summit with South Korean President Moon Jae In in April 2018 and then to his equally historic meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore two months later. This attraction to western automobiles, and Mercedes in particular, is something the younger Kim shared with his father Kim Jong Il, as well as his grandfather, Kim Il Sung. In 2001 , the elder Kim reportedly purchased some 200 luxury cars and smuggled them into the country in the face international sanctions against the regime in Pyongyang, which are in place in response to its nuclear weapons program , ballistic missile developments , and horrendous human rights record , among other things. Mercedes limousines were also a staple of Kim Il Sung’s transportation. The connection between the Kim family rulers and their various modes of transportation is so strong that the vehicles they used are displayed prominently in their mausoleums. Below is a screencap from a video (also posted below) of Kim Jong Un’s tour of Kim Jong Il’s mausoleum, which even has his yacht and train car on display: One of Kim Jong Il’s armored Mercedes. , Youtube Screencap https://youtube.com/watch?v=SSNDDEKyUG4 Flaunting these vehicles is an obvious act of defiance for the North Korean regime, which is an international pariah, but has developed an elaborate network of foreign contacts , shell companies , and illicit enterprises around the world to skirt sanctions and continue to function despite foreign pressure. The regime deliberately allowed state news crews to film Kim and his new car ahead of his upcoming second summit with Trump, where the issue of relaxing sanctions is set to be a hot topic. As for the new cars themselves, it’s not clear how many Mercedes are in the North Korean government fleet at present. At least a pair of S600s reported arrived in the country in 2009 and went into service in 2010. Two years later, another handful in a different configuration appeared at a military parade in Pyongyang. Yet another lot emerged between 2013 and 2014, again in configurations different from the other vehicles. In 2015, a panel of experts investigating sanctions violations for the United Nations Security Council reported that the second set of S600s were not actually Pullman guards, but had been armored by an unspecified North American company before making their way to North Korea. The third pair was also not factory standard, with “body characteristics suggest that these vehicles are not Pullman versions of the S-class vehicles but were modified by a third-party.” UNSC The following year , the panel of experts issued new findings, saying the customization of at least two of the cars had occurred in the United States before the vehicles arrived in China and were then transported into North Korea. A firm known as Seajet International, run by Chinese businessman Yunong Ma, also known as George Ma, allegedly arranged the deal. Ma, who was also a representative for North Korea’s flag carrier Air Koryo, and Seajet, have been linked to illicit North Korean arms sales and other foreign deals, according to the U.N. report. Then, in October 2018, it looked as if Kim’s association with the iconic Mercedes limos might be coming to an end when he appeared at meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a Rolls Royce Phantom. You can read our writeup on this surprise unveiling here. Kim’s Rolls is visible in the brief video below. North Korea’s fleet of active Mercedes VIP vehicles dates back to 1990s model years, with older vehicles that are no longer needed to transport Kim and the regime’s top officials being used for other diplomatic transport duties. So, it’s not like the regime just uses these vehicles during their prime and tosses them away. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents surround a late 1990s S600 used to transport State Department head Mike Pompeo to meet with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. , State Department Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents surround a late 1990s S600 used to transport State Department head Mike Pompeo to meet with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. , State Department It was not clear at the time of the Phantom’s arrival if Kim was intending to replace his top Mercedes limousines with Phantoms, but at this point, it seems as if the Rolls Royce may be a one-off, or it isn’t being chosen for primary transportation missions outside of benign circumstances for operational concerns raised by Kim’s Guard Command that is tasked with protecting him. These can include the vehicle’s level of armor, parts availability, reliability, maneuverability, and weight and space concerns for traveling via train or airlifter to meetings abroad . The vehicles may have simply proven too easy to track and too hard to smuggle for the North Koreans. To this point, in 2017 , Bangladeshi authorities seized another Phantom – falsely declared to be a BMW – belonging to the former First Secretary of the North Korean Embassy in that country. Officials in Bangladesh had expelled the diplomat the year before for smuggling cigarettes Regardless, it seems that Kim has returned to form with the acquisition of the new Mercedes-Maybach. NK State Media screencap As with the previous S600s, it is also unclear whether or not this car is actually a factory standard armored Guard model or came via a third party concern. The unarmored Mercedes-Maybach S600 sedan has been on the market since 2015 and the armored VIP Guard version appeared the following year. The list price for the S600 Guard model is more than $500,000. Video caption: Executive limousines became a point of connection between Trump and Kim at the Singapore summit last June when Trump showed Kim the inside of the “The Beast,” the most famous limousine in the world. Kim has an established love for transportation and vehicles and the fact that the U.S. , Russian , and Chinese presidents have all received new limousines over the last year seems to have sent his regime looking to do the same: “The correct export of products in conformance with the law is a fundamental principle of responsible entrepreneurial activity,” Ute Wüest von Vellberg, a spokesperson for Daimler, which owns the Mercedes and Mercedes-Maybach brands, told NK Pro in response to a query about how the car had made its way to North Korea. “Our company has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with EU and U.S. embargoes.” Video published by RT in May 2018 showed a Mercedes S600 in the background. , RT Screengrab via NKnews.org NK Pro also noticed slight differences in the armored surrounds inside the door jam from Kim’s car to a stock S600 Maybach Pullman Guard. So yeah, the Kim regime isn’t exactly crumbling due to a lack of cash from international sanctions. And there is a very good chance that this new car shows up in Hanoi where Kim will meet Trump on February 27th, 2019 for their second round of attempted detente. North Korea has long claimed that sanctions don’t work, while also claiming they cause hardship on the North Korean people. As such, they argue they should be lifted. Considering Kim’s new super-expensive whips, this seems at least partly true. The facts show that the regime has its ways to get the products it wants, and with China and Russia cozying up to Pyongyang, it seems more likely we will only see less enforcement of the international sanctions regime that is supposed to bring North Korea to the bargaining table and punish them for their dangerous behavior, not more.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 17, 2018",Behold These Incredible New Images Of Dutch F-35s Soaring Over California,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of our favorite flying photogs , Frank Crebas of Bluelife Aviation , has awesome new photos to share from his latest missions with F-35As from the Royal Netherlands Air Force’s (RNLAF) test unit located at Edwards Air Force Base in California. As the F-35 continues to evolve in an international manner, the jet is being put through ever more complex trials, but sometimes there is a bit of fuel left over to after the testing is done to snap some great pictures. Frank took the time to share with us how he captured these sweet photos and to talk about a very special moment in the cockpit that he thought would never happen: I am the most fortunate person in the world as I do most of the photo work for the 323 Test and Evaluation Squadron . This is a Netherlands Air Force unit that is co-responsible for the F-35 operational testing at Edwards AFB. The squadron owns and operates two F-35s based there. Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com In mid-January, I was invited to come over to the US (I live in the Netherlands) to do photo chase work during tests that I will not explain any further. During the flights that we did, we had some time to do some extra photo setups and this resulted in a large batch of new F-35 images of which I am quite pleased with. All of these shots where not pre-briefed, something I would absolutely do on normal photo flights, but not this time since I wasn’t sure how much time I would have for fancy photos and since I took off from Tucson, Arizona in an F-16 and the F-35s were flying out of Edwards Air Force Base in California. The Netherlands Air Force has a detachment of 10 F-16s under the 148th Fighter Squadron/162nd Fighter Wing of the Arizona Air National Guard. Once airborne, we met up with the F-35s in the airspace surrounding Edwards AFB. Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com It’s important to tell that I was flown by and flown next to buddies that I’ve known for a long time and we had already done quite a bit of photography together in the past. My pilot was Joost “Niki’ Luijsterburg. ‘Niki’ has more than 4,000 hours in the F-16 pilot with the highest numbers of any pilot in the Netherlands Air Force. Your readers might remember ‘Niki’ from a B-52 image with an F-16 shadow that I had shared with you in the past. That was ‘Niki’ and he is also the commander of The Netherlands detachment in Tucson. Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com The F-35 was flown by Lt Col. Ian ‘Gladys” Knight. ‘Gladys’ is the commander of 323 TES. On the second day, the F-35 was flown by Maj Pascal “Smiley’ Smaal. ‘Smiley’ is the DO for 323 TES. A personal highlight for me was flying the Sidewinder low flying route , and more specifically, through Starwars Canyon . The boys found it cool to give me a glimpse ‘from the other side’ that I was used to (sitting and waiting in the canyon with my camera). Fortunately, we had plenty of fuel after our mission to fly the route. Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com Flying the Sidewinder is by far the coolest thing I have experienced in the cockpit so far. It’s not even that a dream came true… It was so unreal and beyond my imagination that I never ever dreamt about flying through the canyon myself. It’s a big check in the box for me! You have no idea how thankful I am for these opportunities. A RNLAF F-35A flying over ‘Star Wars Canyon.’, Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com I have made a short in-cockpit video of this once in a lifetime event: A huge thanks to Frank for sharing the latest and greatest images from his flying photography adventures with the Royal Netherlands Air Force with us.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 11, 2019",Army’s Elite Night Stalkers Quietly Stood Up A New Unit Ahead Of Getting New Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time in nearly a decade, the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment has added a new unit to its ranks. The creation of the additional separate company comes as the Regiment, also known as the Night Stalkers, which is best known for providing premier special operations helicopter support for U.S. special operators, is expanding its drone capabilities. On Aug. 16, 2018, Company F, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment stood up at Fort Campbell in Kentucky, according to an order from U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), which we obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. Fort Campbell is already home to the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 160th, as well as the Regiment’s headquarters. The remaining 3rd and 4th Battalions are based at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia and Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, respectively. US Army via FOIA US Army via FOIA Censors redacted the unit’s so-called “Table of Order and Equipment” code, or TOE, which defines its size, structure, and mission, as well as the total authorized personnel for the new company. We do know that the company is assigned directly to the regimental headquarters rather than placed under the control of any one of the 160th’s existing four battalions. This is the first new unit USASOC has created under the control of the 160th since it activated Company E in October 2010. The Army had shuttered the previous incarnations of both Companies E and F, which were both equipped with MH-47 Chinooks at the time, in 2007. The personnel and helicopters from these units subsequently became part of the new 4th Battalion, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment as of 2015. The ERMP unit, standing for Extended-Range Multi-Purpose, is Company E., SOCOM Though we don’t know for sure what Company F’s composition or mission set is, it seems very likely that the unit will take control of 160th’s future fleet of MQ-1C Gray Eagle Extended Range (GE-ER) drones. The order, somewhat confusingly, says that personnel destined for the new company would first go to the unrelated Company F, 2nd Battalion, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. In September 2018 , the Army publicly acknowledged that special operations aviators from this other Company F, which is the battalion maintenance company, had taken part in testing of the GE-ER drone at Fort Hood in Texas. The most recent annual report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, also stated that the Army would establish a company of the improved MQ-1Cs within the 160th. In development since at least 2013, the GE-ER, previously known as the Improved Gray Eagle (IGE), is larger and significantly more capable than the original MQ-1C. The Army completed Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation of the GE-ER variant in October 2018 , the last step before operational units begin receiving the aircraft. An MQ-1C GE-ER during testing at Fort Hood in 2018., US Army The GE-ER’s maximum gross takeoff weight is 600 pounds greater, primarily due to its more powerful Lycoming DEL-120 Heavy Fuel Engine (HFE). It also has a deeper fuselage that can accommodate 50 percent more fuel and a payload bay that is 50 percent larger. This means the GE-ER can stay aloft for more than 40 hours, almost an entire extra day compared to the earlier MQ-1Cs, while also carrying a more robust suite of sensors and weaponry. It’s easy to spot the new variant from the new winglets on the end of each wing and the relocation of the vertical mount with data link antenna on top from the middle of the fuselage to the rear. The added endurance of the MQ-1Cs will allow a single platoon of three of the drones to perform persistent surveillance of a particular area 24 hours a day without interruption, according to the latest annual DOT&E report . The extra internal space in the upgraded model will also make it easier to integrate new sensor systems or other payloads, such as electronic warfare systems, as they become available in the future. The Army is already buying signals intelligence packages for its existing Gray Eagles, as well. It will also have improved performance with various underwing stores. As with the earlier MQ-1Cs, it can carry up to four AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, as well as wide-area persistent surveillance systems, electronic warfare packages , and more. The Army is also exploring adding dispenser pods that can each carry a dozen of Northrop Grumman’s Hatchet precision-guided miniature munitions to the Gray Eagle’s arsenal, which you can read about in more detail here . An earlier model MQ-1C with components of a wide area persistent surveillance system mounted in pods underneath each wing., US Army A company of GE-ERs will significantly boost the 160th’s drone capabilities. Company E also has a mix of earlier model MQ-1Cs and pre-production Warrior Alphas , the latter of which are only capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The 160th has used the unmanned aircraft for armed overwatch during operations, as well as communications relays. A single drone can operate in multiple modes at once, too. The added endurance and payload capacity of the GE-ER will only add to this flexibility. Have a company of the improved Gray Eagles will also expand the total force of medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aircraft available within the U.S. special operations community in general. At present, the vast majority of this capability comes from MQ-9 Reaper squadrons assigned to both Air Force Special Operations Command and the non-special operations Air Combat Command. There are also conventional MQ-1C units across the regular Army. Still, the demand for this category of unmanned aircraft support has perpetually outstripped the capacity of these existing units. The Air Force has resorted In 2018, the U.S. Navy hired General Atomics , who builds the Gray Eagles and Reapers, to fly their own unarmed MQ-9s in support of U.S. Marines. With this in mind, if Company F is indeed slated to become the 160th’s new GE-ER company, it could easily find itself very busy when it reaches initial operational capability with the type. By every indication, Company E has been heavily deployed since 2010, as well, though the Army has been very secretive about its operations. One of Company E’s MQ-1C’s on display in 2013., US Army The service did not even publicly announce its activation until 2013, at which time it was situated at Fort Huachuca , the Army’s hub for aerial intelligence and drone training, in Arizona. Later that year, it relocated to Fort Campbell, at least officially . By that time, that unit had already received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for supporting special operators in Afghanistan. Next we heard, in 2016, Company E had deployed Gray Eagles to Garoua, Cameroon to support operations in that country, as well as neighboring Nigeria, against the terrorist group Boko Haram . Company E’s Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations in Afghanistan., US Army In 2018, the Pentagon also revealed that Gray Eagles were flying in the Philippines as part of a special operations forces-led mission to support the Armed Forces of the Philippines battle ISIS-linked terrorists in that country. Though we don’t know for sure, it seems very likely that these drones are also from Company E. Whether or not it turns out that Company F will be flying the 160’s GE-ERs, the Regiment’s future looks set to involve increasing unmanned operations in addition to its trademark helicopter assaults.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 27, 2018",Navy To Field Cruise Missile Variant Of Its Smart JSOW Glide Bomb That Will Fit Inside F-35C,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it will begin deploying a cruise missile derivative of the stealthy AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon glide bomb, or JSOW, no later than the end of 2023, as an option for its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and F-35C Joint Strike Fighters . The weapons will give these jets a significant additional extended-range strike capability, which is important given the increasingly advanced nature of integrated air defenses among potential opponents, especially Russia and China . On Feb. 7, 2019 , Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced its intention to issue a sole-source contract to Raytheon for work related to the new weapon, known as the JSOW-Extended Range, or JSOW-ER, on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps. The Massachusetts-headquartered defense contractor developed the unpowered JSOW and you can read about it and the cruise missile derivative in depth in a previous feature from The War Zone . The notice also said that the JSOW-ER would be compatible with the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighter, but it is not clear if that service actually intends to purchase the missiles. “The Requirements for the JSOW-ER includes: extending the range of the existing JSOW [AGM-154]C-1 variant while maintaining targeting and performance capabilities, carriage on F-18 and internal carriage on F-35A/C while minimizing any changes to existing aircraft integration and limitations, hardware and software modifications to optimize midcourse and endgame performance for the powered variant of the JSOW, and deployment to the fleet no later than FY23,” the announcement explains. The Navy has been actively working with Raytheon on the development of the JSOW-ER since June 2017. In April 2018, the service announced it was moving the program to a more advanced phase . An F-35C with its weapons bays open to show a pair of AGM-154C-1 JSOWs during a test., Lockheed Martin That same month, Raytheon declared that the unpowered AGM-154C-1, or JSOW-C, was fully compatible with the F-35C’s internal weapons bays. “This is absolutely a critical opportunity for the Navy because now this is their top-line, medium-range precision strike weapon that is capable now of being integrated internally on JSF,” Mark Borup, a member of Raytheon’s Medium-Range Strike and Attack Air Warfare Systems Division, said in an interview with Military.com at the time. But the JSOW-ER concept actually dates back more than a decade. Raytheon had pitched the idea of a powered version with the Williams International WJ24-8 turbojet to the United Kingdom as part of the Conventionally Armed Standoff Missile (CASOM) program. This weapon lost out to European consortium MBDA’s Storm Shadow cruise missile . In 2009 , Raytheon flight tested a second iteration of the JSOW-ER using the Hamilton Sundstrand TJ-50 turbojet. The company also uses this engine to power its ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) system, which you can read about in more detail here . The design can also reportedly hit targets out to distances of nearly 265 miles, nearly four times the maximum range of the unpowered JSOW-C when released from a high altitude. The rear end of a JSOW-ER., Raytheon That added range is important given that potential opponents are only fielding surface-to-air missiles , as well as associated radars and other sensors , with ever-increasing range and precision. In turn, adding extra stand-off range to air-launched weapons will only become more vital to reduce the vulnerability to launching aircraft as time goes on. Combined with the Navy’s stealth F-35C, in particular, the JSOW-ER will also give the Navy an additional means of targeting those defenses directly. The Joint Strike Fighters could then cut a path open for non-stealth platforms to follow through for subsequent strikes. The stealthy features of the JSOW-ER itself only help reduce its own vulnerability to enemy defenses . This combat doctrine would only be more potent with the help of electronic warfare support from EA-18G Growlers. It is not clear if the latest JSOW-ER design still uses Hamilton Sundstrand TJ-50, as well as the flush-mounted intake that helps keep the weapon stealthy, from the 2009 design. It would make good sense that Raytheon would have continued to refine this version, though, which reportedly has the same basic dimensions as the unpowered AGM-154C-1. This would make it relatively easy to integrate into the F-35C’s internal weapons bays. The JSOW-ER will otherwise retain many of the features of the existing JSOW-C, including its guidance package, according to NAVAIR’s notice . The latest Block III AGM-154C-1s added an imaging infrared seeker to the weapons existing GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) targeting system. This additional feature allows it to spot and home in on targets in the terminal stage of flight and, as a result, engage moving vehicles, like ships. A Block III AGM-154C-1 about to hit a floating test target., USN NAVAIR also says it is looking for additional “hardware and software modifications to optimize midcourse and endgame performance,” which could include things such as a two-way data link that would allow the launching aircraft to send course corrections and other targeting updates to the missile in flight. A networked capability would also allow the weapon to work within the Navy’s Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) construct, meaning that other platforms in the air or at sea could help direct the weapon more accurately to its target, as well. Another potential addition might be improvements to the missile so that it could make course corrections and avoid potential threats and hazards autonomously or semi-autonomously. This would be especially valuable for dodging pop-up air defenses. One of the biggest benefits of the unpowered JSOW’s design was, and still is , its spacious modular payload bay that can accept any warhead based around the standard 500-pound-class low-drag bomb design. The JSOW-ER’s need to accommodate a jet engine and fuel will have an impact on the maximum warhead size, but it’s not clear whether it might still be able to readily accept new payloads that fit within those constraints. The JSOW-ER offers all of this capability in a package this is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to larger air-launched cruise missiles, such as Lockheed Martin’s AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM). In 2008, Raytheon said that the JSOW-ER would have a unit price of around $350,000, less than half the price of a single JASSM. JSOW-ER’s stated range would almost be equivalent to that of JASSM, too. The powered JSOW would still have a significantly shorter range than the AGM-158B JASSM-Extended Range , or JASSM-ER, though. By the same token, JSOW-ER, with its moving target engagement capability, might be able to act as a low-cost anti-ship missile compared to the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). The Navy is already in the process of integrating this weapon with its Super Hornets. The service expects to reach initial operational capability with the LRASM on the F/A-18E/F in 2019. An LRASM sits in front of an F/A-18 Hornet carrying another example of the anti-ship missile., USN But Lockheed Martin has not yet demonstrated that any of the JASSM family of missiles can fit internally in the F-35C’s weapons bays, which would only make the JSOW-ER more attractive for when the jet’s need to be in full-stealth mode. In this case, the ability for a Joint Strike Fighter to penetrate through hostile air defenses to get closer to the target would further mitigate the more limited range of the JSOW-ER. It still remains to be seen whether the powered JSOW will still match Raytheon’s decade-old cost estimate after it adds in any additional features the Navy wants, too. The need for additional hardening against GPS jamming and spoofing , or other types of electronic warfare attacks , given the current threat environment , could easily raise its overall price point. If the Air Force does decide to join the JSOW-ER program, it might help spread any additional cost burden around. Foreign JSOW operators, especially those that also fly the F-35, such as Australia and The Netherlands , could also be very interested in a cruise missile that shares many of the same features as they’re existing glide bombs. If the Navy wants to get the first missiles out to operational units within the next four years, we’ll hopefully be seeing more publicly of the latest JSOW-ER design, in general. By all accounts, the service’s F/A-18E/Fs and F-35Cs look set to add an important and deadly new weapon to their arsenals in the near future.

From massive, sound-stage like missile seeker testing facilities, to rocket sleds, to electronic warfare ranges and a runway dedicated to unmanned aircraft operations , NAWS China Lake offers militaries and their associated industry partners from around the world a huge menu of testing capabilities. But above all else, NAWS China Lake’s expansive and diverse set of live-fire ranges are truly a national treasure. It is on these ranges that the latest and greatest weapons and sensors have been tested over the better part of a century. From the advent of Sidewinder air-to-air missile in the 1950s, to the dawn of GPS guided weaponry decades later, the live-fire ranges have provided a diverse array of target types and recording capabilities to fine tune even the most outlandish tactical weaponry. Every year these facilities bustle with activity, and much of that action is loud and explosive in nature. NAVAIR isn’t shy about touting their loud and exothermic accomplishments, hence this awesome 2016 highlight real put together to show off just a tiny bit of what China Lake weapons testers were up to last year.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Let’s Talk About The Reports And Theories Circulating Around What Crashed Near Area 51,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last Friday we reported on the tragic and mysterious death of one of the USAF’s elite test pilots somewhere on the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range between Tonopah Test Range Airport and Area 51. The fatal incident was strange to begin with as it was reported days after it occurred, meanwhile two A-10 Warthogs crashed on the range a day later and that accident was quickly disclosed. Then the fact that the Air Force would not identify the aircraft type in its belated media releases turned the event from strange into a full on mystery. Speculation of what aircraft was lost in the incident began picking up steam after our initial report. Over the weekend the top officer in the United States Air Force commented that the aircraft involved in the mishap definitely wasn’t an F-35. The public affairs operation at Nellis AFB also focused their statement to make it clear that Lt. Col. Eric “Doc” Schultz—a decorated combat and test pilot and the 28th pilot to fly the F-35—was flying a “classified aircraft.” Although the loss of such a skilled test pilot is emotionally shocking, really none of the secrecy surrounding it should come as much of a surprise. Nearly two entire air bases, along with secretive operations at satellite installations throughout the region, are dedicated to the clandestine development of new high-end air combat capabilities and aircraft. If the USAF can find a way not to disclose one of these programs after a major mishap it won’t, and in this case the remote crash didn’t demand such openness. Lt. Col. Eric Schultz at the controls of and F-35. He was just the 28th pilot to fly the F-35, a task that seemed to end around 2013. From then on it seems as if he began working in the clandestine flight test world., Lockheed Martin Area 51 in particular didn’t earn its secretive reputation for nothing and the base has continued to grow dramatically over the years. In fact, the installation is so busy that just having a family occasionally access their own historic property within line of sight of its runways is no longer acceptable—not just on secrecy grounds but on fiscal ones as well. The Air Force claims that millions of dollars are racked up as a result of delayed flight testing when the family is present on their property and that ongoing operations are also a safety concern with them present. All this, along with an outlandish history between the family and the federal government, has resulted in a bitter and incredibly bizarre land dispute case. Over the years open source intelligence has also given us some insight as to the volume of classified programs being executed in and around area 51 at any given time, and that number seems to be closer to triple digits than otherwise, with large but murky operational budgets set aside for the facilities that host them. We also know of a handful of aircraft that have escaped Area 51’s classified abyss over its sixty plus year past, like the U-2 , A-12 , F-117 , Tacit Blue , Bird of Prey, and RQ-170 . These aircraft were largely game changing and history making vehicles that helped to significantly mold not just the future of air combat but also the course of human events. These amazing planes represent just the tip of the metaphorical classified iceberg of projects that have been tested clandestinely over and around the Nevada Test and Training Range complex over the years. With this background in mind, let’s take a look at a few of the most prominent theories that have been circulating regarding the identity of the classified aircraft involved in the deadly crash on September 5th, 2017. Red Hats The most popular theory is that Schultz died flying a foreign fighter aircraft while working for the current iteration of the historically famous “Red Hats” squadron that secretly flies foreign tactical military aircraft for test and training purposes. These aircraft, which include MiG-29s and Su-27s, are flown not just to better understand their unique strengths and weaknesses, but also to test new sensors against them, as well as to support Weapons School classes at Nellis AFB, and to help train USAF adversary pilots. Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport’s affiliation with the flying of foreign military hardware dates back nearly half a century and the fact that these aircraft continue to have a presence over the National Test and Training Range today has been well known and documented. The Red Hats are known to operate out of a set of hangars known as the “Red Hat Hangars” or “Red Square” located at the northern portion of Area 51’s sprawling apron. But still, the Red Hats’ mission remains a closely guarded compartmentalized program within the USAF. So called Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) programs are run by the Air Force Materiel Command—the same command that Nellis AFB officially says “owned” the aircraft that crashed last Tuesday along with most other test aircraft in the USAF’s inventory. FME programs are sensitive by their very nature as they are meant to gather hands-on intelligence on enemy hardware and even put it through trials against U.S. gear. But since decades of Cold War history about FME and related foreign aircraft testing and operations were declassified around the end of the last decade, FME operations have become far more widely known, at least unofficially. A MiG-23 Flogger flown by the 4477th Test And Evaluation Squadron flies over the Nellis Range Complex during the 1980s. The aircraft was part of a then highly classified program known as “Constant Peg.”, USAF Defections and international espionage were originally the ways the U.S. got its hands on the latest Soviet aircraft. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, access to large amounts of once prized Soviet fighters become a possibility, and in the case of Moldova’s nuclear capable MiG-29Cs , it was even a good non-proliferation play. Even though the Pentagon supposedly had its hands on Su-27s since at least the early 1990s—they have been flying over Groom Lake for decades since—today, with an active private fighter aircraft market that specializes in Soviet era hardware, snapping up even fourth generation Russian fighters can be far less of cloak and dagger affair than it once was. Case in point—two cream-puff Ukrainian Su-27s were put up for sale in the U.S . only to disappear to some undisclosed “wink-wink” buyer. It is widely assumed that the US government bought the aircraft through a third party shell corporation. And why wouldn’t they considering the ongoing mission of the Red Hats? If anything else, the idea that the Air Force continues to need fresh Flanker airframes long after the type was fully tested and its qualities well understood is an indication that the Red Hats’ mission is not only alive and well, but that it is likely less test oriented and more training centric today. https://youtube.com/watch?v=d4lE6HcBPxw After being officially disestablished as the 6513th test squadron in the late 1980s, the Red Hats became part of 413th Flight Test Squadron’s “Detachment Three” that operated out of Groom Lake from 1992 to 2004. The 413th “Bombcats” were headquartered out Edwards North Base, which itself is a highly secretive installation. The 413th had an electronic warfare mission, with the sub-unit handling those capabilities at Groom Lake and Tonopah being called the “Nutcrackers.” But Electronic Warfare seems to have been just a portion of their responsibilities, with the Red Hats also falling under their purview during that time. Note the Nutcrakcers’ patch with 4 red stars and one white star symbolizing Area 51, and the three blue stars symbolizing Detachment Three., Official unit art via Trevor Paglen The 413th was officially disestablished in 2004 but the unit has carried on at least partially under the more general “Electronic Warfare Directorate” Moniker. The Red Hats are thought to have gone on as an unnumbered and undisclosed unit within Detachment Three of the Air Force Test Center (AFTC) and seem to be also closely associated with 53rd Test and Evaluation Group, Detachment 3 which is officially based at Nellis AFB. According to the USAF the detachment’s mission is fairly clear: “Detachment 3 of the 53d TEG at Nellis AFB is the representative for ACC interests in FME testing with AFMC. The detachment’s primary mission is to ensure USAF combat aircrews are prepared to fight with the latest knowledge available through FME. It maintains an active involvement with AFMC and other agencies such as the National Air Intelligence Center and the Adversary Tactics Group for data analysis and to ensure FME test results are reported to the CAF. In addition, Detachment 3 is the liaison for FME training conducted on the Nellis Range Complex, providing procedures and acting as subject matter experts on key systems.” Aviation Week’s Guy Norris filed a report on Monday, September 11th, 2017 stating that sources told him Schultz was not only flying a foreign jet belonging to the Red Hats when he died, but that he was actually the commander of the unit. This could very well be true or it could be completely untrue, not that Norris would intentionally lead any readers astray, we just don’t know the source, and frankly, when it comes to the murky world of classified programs and aircraft, the self perpetuating rumor mill can infect even the best of sources. One also can’t discount the disinformation operations that have helped keep Area 51’s flying tenants largely anonymous for so many years. It could even be that one part of this report is true but not the other. For instance, maybe Schultz was a commander of a secret flying unit, but that unit flies a classified operational or semi-operational platform instead of the foreign aircraft flown by the shadowy Red Hats. Maybe another reason why many seem to jump to the theory that the mysterious aircraft involved in the crash was a foreign fighter is because a similar and quite famous situation has occurred before. Lt. Gen. Robert M. Bond , vice commander of the Air Force Systems Command, died while flying what in 1984 was described by Air Force officials as ”an Air Force specially modified test craft.” Media reports shortly after the crash said it was in fact a MiG-23 Flogger being evaluated by Air Force pilots. Those reports ended up being true, and this was long before America’s classified FME programs of the Cold War were officially disclosed. F-15 with a MiG-23 during the Constant Peg program., USAF At the time the Air Force had serious fears that the media’s investigations into the crash could out the then highly classified stealth F-117 Nighthawk program that was also operating out of both Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport. Two and a half decades later the whole story of General Bond’s death could be told along with those of the various units and programs that bravely tested Soviet fighters during the Cold War. This history has been accounted for in multiple books and the Red Hats and Red Eagles’ exploits remain top of mind in modern military aviation lore. F-117 Nighthawk The legendary F-117 Nighthawk is still flying out of Tonopah Test Range Airport today and although that fact is public knowledge, the USAF does not want to openly admit it. Some think the aircraft that crashed was an F-117 and that would seem like a possibility at first glance but I have written about the F-117’s past and present extensively and have heard one constant message from various sources regarding the jet’s ongoing flight program, and it relates to who flies them. Supposedly the only remaining active F-117 “Bandits” are contractors. In other words, no active USAF pilots, test or otherwise, are flying the famous “black jets.” Instead ones working for the F-117’s original manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, are flying them. Maybe this has changed, which is possible, or maybe it wasn’t the case at all in the first place and USAF pilots still do fly F-117s. But either way, under current plans, the F-117s will be pulled from storage at a rate of four per year, demilitarized and likely disposed of. USAF So could Schultz have perished while at the controls of one of the USAF’s nearly 40 year old and largely mothballed stealth attack jets? We can’t say definitely no, but if the F-117s are primarily flown by contractors, that would be quite unlikely. Also, the USAF may keep the F-117s flight operations quiet, but the fact that the jets are stored at Tonopah is no secret and calling the F-117 a “classified aircraft” following the death of an accomplished test pilot doesn’t make much sense at all. Future Bomber Others seem to be drawn to the conclusion that an aircraft related to the B-21 program—formerly the B-3, Next Generation Bomber, and LRS-B—was lost in the mishap that took Eric Schultz’s life. By nearly all accounts, no B-21 aircraft are flying today, but at least one technology demonstrator—supposedly of Northrop Grumman origin—was built for America’s future stealth bomber ambitions in the mid to late 2000s. Lockheed may have also fielded a self-funded demonstrator using an existing airframe and/or components as well. A technology demonstrator does not have to be the same size or have anywhere near the same capabilities as a loosely associated operational bomber partially derived from it. It would be used to prove new design elements and manufacturing techniques, as well as to test advanced sensors, communications and other capabilities. This in turn would reduce risk, help to better define a capabilities requirements list, and generally help make the case for a full-up follow-on procurement contract. That contract ended up turning into the B-21 Raider which is being developed now by Northrop Grumman. It remains unclear just how much presence the B-21 program has at Area 51 today. Hiding the bomber’s initial flight testing at Area 51 may be possible for a short period of time—it would at least make it impossible for anyone to get a close-up view of the new super weapon—but more advanced testing with multiple early production aircraft will almost certainly occur at Edwards South Base which has been going through major remodeling in advance of an “upcoming program or programs.” Still, key technologies directly related to the B-21 could and likely are being flown on surrogate test aircraft out at Area 51. B-21 Rendering, Northrop Grumman Some close watchers of air traffic in and around Area 51 over at Reddit’s Special Access forum noted the massive and highly unusual drop off of Janet flights bringing workers in and out of the base following last week’s mystery crash. What were normally 30 flights a day were cut down by a factor of 10 in the days following the incident. Some have speculated that this was indicative of a huge program operating at the base being put on hold temporarily following the mishap. The B-21 is the largest known classified program underway today. On the other hand, maybe this had to do with security issues following the crash or maybe it was due to an operational pause being executed by the installation’s commander. Also, the USAF’s official statement said the location of crash was roughly 100 miles north of Nellis AFB. This could have been a very rough number based on the approximate location of the range complex and the shadowy bases located there.  Maybe the crash occurred at Area 51 itself and needed to be cleaned up before normal operations could resume. Frankly we just don’t know for sure the reasoning behind the drop in flights, although we can safely assume it’s related to the crash. The fact that Schultz was a fighter pilot may make the idea of him working on a bomber development program sound off, but the very nature of the test pilot’s job is to be able to competently test various types of airframes, not just the ones they are most familiar with. Additionally, technology demonstrators and surrogate test aircraft may have more in common with tactical aircraft than with lumbering bombers and can be comparatively sub-scale in size. Still, even with all this in mind, we have little if no real evidence that anything associated with the B-21 program was involved with this incident. The best theory is that we just don’t know, and that’s largely the idea Red Hats fighters, F-117s, and possibly next generation bomber related assets all represent just a portion of the aircraft that call lands north of Creech AFB in the southern Nevada desert home. By almost all indications, there are many compartmentalized flying programs underway at any given time. The aircraft associated with these programs may not fly on a constant basis like their operational “white world” counterparts, but flights are conducted often—both during daytime and nighttime hours depending on the conditions, the type of program, and where it is in its development cycle. Although the idea of the existence of cutting-edge manned tactical test aircraft seems somewhat passé in an era of increasingly unmanned warfare, the USAF seems to be wanting to continue its manned tactical aviation tradition into the future to some degree, for better or for worse . And for testing purposes—like for technology demonstrator aircraft and surrogate test platforms, manned aircraft still have their advantages over unmanned ones. Complex drones have a larger payoff and reach greater efficiency on the back half of their development curves than manned assets. In fact, it is overtly common to test flying systems such as sensors that are intended for unmanned aircraft on manned aircraft until they are ready to be fully integrated onto said drone. Also, the existence of a small fleet or two of highly classified operational manned platforms is entirely possible if not probable as well. I have talked about all these possibilities and more at great length in more posts than I can link . Such a unit would require top pilots and a uniquely capable commander to execute what would likely be a very dangerous and dynamic mission set. In other words, not just experimental aircraft and Russian Sukhois may be zipping around over and around Area 51. The F-117 force lived at Tonopah Test Range Airport for nearly a decade in such a secretive yet operational state. Even the Black Hawk helicopters that enabled the raid against Osama Bin Laden were flying out of Area 51 and its surroundings before they were used for the mission. The ever expanding Area 51., Google Earth Tonopah Test Range Airport. , Google Earth Suffice it to say that Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport have many untold secrets to give up. It’s widely thought that throngs of developmental aircraft from past programs are still stored there ( see Dyson’s dock ) or are buried in the desert nearby. These bases have unique amenities that draw secretive programs of all sizes to their runways and hangars. This diversity and temporary nature of operations also helps with the base’s ability to maintain their visitor’s anonymity. Few if any aircraft destined for normal operations fly from their runways forever. The steady rollover of programs executed and test planes and systems flown makes pinning down details of current activities at these installations very difficult. And many of these diverse and highly classified programs need highly capable and trustworthy pilots. Just look at what is known about Lt. Col. Eric Schultz’s background. He was an incredibly talented and wickedly smart guy with a diverse flying and engineering background. It is hard to imagine what program couldn’t benefit from his expertise. From his obituary : “Prior to joining the military, he was the senior scientist and business development manager at the Pratt & Whitney Seattle Aerosciences Center, and a rotary wing flight test engineer at the Naval Air Warfare Center. He achieved six degrees including a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from California Institute of Technology and a Masters of Business Administration from Penn State University.” Schultz also was also involved in systems engineering for the Airborne Laser program. Solid-state lasers and how they integrate into an aircraft’s tactical capabilities are now an attainable leading edge of air combat technology for both strategic and tactical airborne platforms . Future fighter aircraft, manned or otherwise, will almost certainly be armed with them at least for defensive purposes. Considering that testing is ongoing in the unclassified world for various airborne tactical laser systems, imagine what could very well be under development in the classified world at sites like Area 51. In the end I would posit that it is too early to claim to know exactly what Schultz was flying out on the Nellis ranges last Tuesday evening or why he was flying it. He could have very well been the boss of the Red Hats flying a Su-27 to its max against an American fighter. On the other hand, he could have been trolling around in a highly exotic technology demonstrator with anemic performance when things went terribly wrong. Eventually we may find out what really happened to Lt. Col. Eric “Doc” Schultz and why. But until more definitive information becomes available we can only be certain of one thing—the decorated test pilot who took a winding and tough road to accomplish his dreams was doing what many of us and even other fighter pilots only dream of, and something that he clearly believed in dearly. And for that we can all be eternally grateful.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Once in a while, a crazy photo comes across my screen that seems too cool to be true. This was the case this afternoon when I saw a picture of an MH-6 Little Bird hovering in the dead of night over the Port Of Long Beach as special operators begin to fast rope to whatever laid below. At first glance, the photo looked like a fake, as it is shot at nearly eye level and capturing what would be largely invisible for even the naked eye to full take in, but on closer examination, I was able to geolocate the photo exactly where the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR)—better known as the Night Stalkers—were thought to be working last night, over the western tip of Long Beach Harbor. The Night Stalkers have been executing a high profile exercise in the Los Angeles area since Monday evening when the tell-tale signs of their arrival mysteriously began to materialize on plane tracking software. Since then we have reported on Little Birds buzzing down the streets of Downtown Los Angeles at treetop level and MH-6s and MH-60s making incredible formation landings on various roads and structures around big landmarks, like the Staples Center. You can read all about why the 160th does this type of training and where they tend to do it in this past piece of ours . But last night the action clearly moved to Long Beach as plane trackers showed the various fixed-wing surveillance assets, namely a P-8 Poseidon and a pair of U-28s —set up large circular orbits over the harbor there. This incredible photo offers a far more intimate view of what the shadowy unit and their special operator ‘customers’ were up to while there. Unknown You can see precisely where the photo was taken in the Google Earth and Google Maps imagery below. The building used was the Port Of Long Beach Administrative Building, a seven-story structure not far from the Queen Mary . The building where the photo was taken is seen at the very bottom-center of this image. , Google Earth Google Maps Synthetic view from atop the building that matches the image. , Google Maps Here is the building via street view. Note the pole seen in the MH-6 image is also visible atop the structure. , Google Maps After digging a bit deeper into youtube, we came across a local CBS affiliate’s video showing the same building being used last night for the training, including explosive breaching operations: As for what unit the special operators hitching a ride of the Little Bird belong to, we can’t say for certain. But their quad-tube night-vision goggles, HK416 rifles, and attire seem to point to SEAL Team Six , also known as DEVGRU. Being the Navy’s top counter-terrorism unit, and considering the port setting that last night’s drills took place in, this really wouldn’t be much of a surprise. It’s also worth noting that the Little Bird appears to have some sort of nose art right above their FLIR sensor, although we can’t make out exactly what it depicts. The Night Stalkers and special operators are slated to continue with their training around the Los Angeles area through Saturday, and considering the amazing visuals that have come out of the exercise so far, this probably won’t be our last report on the topic! A hat tip to @ chairmanhao19 for giving us a heads up about this awesome image. Update: 9:37pm PST— Many of our wonderful readers chimed in with an answer to the nose art question regarding this Little Bird. It turns out the Night Stalkers have an affinity to 1990s pop culture!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday I posted a picture on my personal Twitter account showing the Reconnaissance Systems Officer (RSO) “office” in Skunk Works boss Kelly Johnson’s legendary creation, the SR-71 Blackbird . The photo intrigued many to say the least, and who could blame them? The rear cockpit in the “Sled” looks like something out of a Cold War era science fiction thriller, and in reality, it was just as cool. Readers know I have written extensively on the SR-71, including articles about the jet’s most spectacular flyover and air show maneuvers , among many other topics, and have even had guest posts on the subject, including one particularly amazing story told by a decorated Blackbird pilot himself. After seeing the picture, multiple people asked me to explain the different dials, screens, and buttons in the jet’s busy cockpits. Luckily, instead of posting some third party account, I found a something way better—a complete tour of the jet’s crew stations given by a guy who sat in the front seat while traveling at Mach 3.2 and 80,000 feet while MiGs circled below him. SR-71 pilot , former 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing commander, and successful author Richard Graham gave the following in-depth video tour of the Blackbird’s front and rear cockpits to aviation videographer Erik Johnston , and it’s simply outstanding. At first glance the SR-71’s front cockpit may look somewhat conventional, but what you’ll notice is that the small details Graham describes—like the periscope, laser horizon system, fuel transfer panel, liquid chemical engine start injectors and so on—are anything but. The RSO had a more roomy work area, which featured controls for the aircraft’s astro tracker navigation system, canvas curtains, and a wall of instrumentation. Oh and that thing that looks like a flip-down tray, it’s actually the moving map projection screen, and under it is the SR-71’s radar sensor display. Then there are the lights that tell the RSO to begin his ejection checklist, and then to eject should the pilot lose communications with him during an emergency. Intense stuff! You can also see front and back SR-71 cockpit 360s by our friend Lyle Jansma and the National Museum Of The USAF by clicking here and here . The video series also includes a tour of the J58 turbojet engine that powered the A-12 and SR-71 to amazing speeds and altitudes, and most importantly, an interview with Richard Graham about his experiences flying the Blackbird, and boy is it worth watching in full. In it, Graham gives a ton of unique details about Blackbird operations. Some highlights including how the aircraft will become unrecoverable and will snap in half and disintegrate if it goes over 17 units of angle of attack. Or how they learned to taxi, takeoff, tank, and fly all around a hemisphere without ever speaking one word on the radio. As for the SR-71’s still debated top speed, Graham says it was really Mach 3.4 and pilots were allowed to do 3.3 if doing so could possibly save their lives and the aircraft. I can’t overstate enough that this is a must watch video for any Blackbird enthusiast.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 3, 2019",Watch Night Stalker Choppers Descend In Unison Into Small Parking Lot Near Staples Center,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Another night, another round of special operations exercises in the Downtown Los Angeles area (read all about this unique training here ), with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , better known as the Night Stalkers, providing transportation for special operators in their heavily modified MH-6 Little Bird and MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. Last evening marked the second night of this exercise, so local citizens and news stations were far more aware of what to expect. As a result, news choppers were listening closely to the radio and combing the city for some rare real-world blockbuster movie-like action. They were quite successful in their hunt, which resulted in some awesome video. One clip, in particular, is especially awe-inspiring. While Monday’s most amazing clip of the spec ops helicopter action featured blacked-out Little Birds buzzing down city streets at treetop level, on Tuesday night, the Night Stalkers and their counter-terrorism special operations passengers seemed to focus on areas around two high-profile sporting venues—Staples Center and Dodger Stadium—executing operations around both locales with a pair of MH-60s and the usual quartet of MH-6s. The best video available looks like it could have come right out of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. It shows a formation of the helicopters descending past the Staples Center and into a small parking lot nearby where special operators quickly run out, strap on the MH-6’s planks and fill a MH-60’s cabin, and then take off again. Here are two versions of the video. The Twitter version is higher definition, but if you can’t access it the youtube version is also posted below: https://youtube.com/watch?v=wBfH7GyRTzI The video doesn’t really tell the whole story though. This quick operation underscores just how complex this training is and why it can’t be replicated in any sort of fake MOUT training site . As you can see below, the landing site sits among a dense set of buildings, some of which are very tall. Even the parking lot that the helicopters quickly used as a landing zone has poles, trees, and wires that could spell disaster for a helicopter. Google Earth The parking lot they used sits next to an urgent care facility and if you look carefully in the video, one of the MH-6s actually lands inside the tight confines of the open court-yard like parking area. Google Earth Google Earth Google Earth Also, in the video, you will notice that a military working dog boards the Black Hawk with his handler and the same Black Hawk is also equipped with a fast rope . So, where they were heading next probably required that infiltration technique. Another video from the previous evening is also worth posting, as well. This one shows a pair of MH-60s landing in succession on a Downtown Los Angeles street, at 1136 Wilshire Blvd to be exact, and picking up full loads of operators that appear to be carrying a couple heavy objects. Here is the building the special operations soldiers were in before being picked up. It may be empty based on the information we can find, which makes sense. Google Earth Google Earth Some have asked me if the Army would tell local news helicopters that they wanted to be left alone. That clearly isn’t the case judging by the video we are seeing here, in addition to other footage that only aired live. But the radio call posted below that was made just as the exercise was beginning on Tuesday night makes it abundantly clear that 160th SOAR pilots could care less about the news choppers, as long as they didn’t get in their way. There are still a few nights of the training to go in and around Downtown Los Angeles. Long Beach is another area that local authorities disclosed would be used for similar training as what we are seeing in Los Angeles, and live explosives will be used as well. Considering that Long Beach is a huge port, it will likely serve as an ideal training ground for scenarios that include expansive shipping facilities and vessels—an ideal playground for U.S. Navy SEALs. We will keep you informed as the high-profile exercise continues to unfold.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2019",The Pocket-Sized Black Hornet Drone Is About To Change Army Operations Forever,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than four years of experimentation and evaluation, the U.S. Army is beginning to send out FLIR Systems’ tiny Black Hornet nano drones to operational units, which will fundamentally change how the service conducts itself on the battlefield. The miniature unmanned helicopter will give the elements as small as infantry squads a significant boost in situational awareness and allow them to scout ahead without having to automatically put soldiers at risk. On Jan. 9, 2019 , the Army revealed that the Soldier Sensors and Lasers (SSL) division of Rock Island Arsenal’s Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center (RIA-JMTC) had delivered the first 60 complete Black Hornet systems to unspecified units. Then, on Jan. 24, 2019 , FLIR Systems announced it had received a contract worth up to $39.6 million to deliver thousands more of the drones to the service, along with associated equipment, in the coming years. “The equipment is getting smaller and the reason it’s getting smaller is so the Soldier can be equipped with this,” Sunny Koshal, the chief of the Soldier Support Branch at RIA-JMTC said in an official interview in January 2019. “This thing, you can really pocket it and just carry it.” The latest Black Hornet 3, which FLIR Systems also calls the Personal Reconnaissance System (PRS), weighs less than a tenth of a pound and is just under seven inches long. The complete system comes with a docking station for two drones that keeps them protected when not in use, as well as a hand-held touchscreen device and a controller. All of this, along with a number of other more minor parts, as well as the user’s manual, comes inside a foam-lined, ruggedized container. But the basic components necessary to use the Black Hornet in the field could easily fit inside a soldier’s backpack. For its compact size and weight, the system, which the Army officially calls the Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS), offers impressive capabilities. Each Black Hornet has two daytime video cameras, as well as a thermal imager. All of these systems can capture still images for further analysis, too. During nighttime operations, the drone fuses the feeds from both its electro-optical the thermal imaging system to create higher fidelity imagery. This makes it easier for the operator to positively identify individuals as hostile, rather than just innocent bystanders, or otherwise examine other objects of interest in the dark. A good look at the contents of each complete Soldier Borne Sensor system package., US Army It can stay aloft for up to 25 minutes and has a maximum range of 1.24 miles, allowing the operator to send it well ahead of their position to look for threats and other items of interest. It’s very quiet, too, allowing troops to use it regularly, day or night, without being worried that it might give their position away. Black Hornet has a line-of-sight link, as well as a GPS-enabled beyond-line-of-sight navigation capability. The operator can use the controller to pilot the unmanned helicopter manually, observing its activity through the cameras in its nose via the touchscreen display. The drone is also capable semi-autonomous operation, following preset waypoints, and can return to the user as programmed or on demand. It also has a feature that will send it back in the direction of the operator’s position if it gets jammed or the encrypted control link otherwise ends up broken. FLIR Systems offers a Vision-Based Navigation capability for GPS denied environments and for operating indoors, where the control signal could easily get blocked, but it’s not clear if the Army has purchased Black Hornets with this specific capability. Vision-based navigation is an autonomous mode where the drone uses the feeds from its cameras, coupled with a computer algorithm, to determine its relative position and avoid obstacles. A closer look at the Black Hornet and its features., FLIR Systems It would certainly be a valuable feature given the growing threat of enemy electronic warfare systems , as well as the U.S. military’s increasing interest in being prepared to fight in dense, built-up areas . The Army, among others, is also preparing for the possibility that subterranean warfare , involving fighting through caverns and underground complexes of various types, could be another significant component of future warfighting. “The main purpose of this mission is to provide security, safety, and alertness to the Soldiers where the enemy is at all times,” Koshal, the branch chief at Rock Island Arsenal said. “Bottom line is it will keep the Soldier safe.” Even just in day-to-day operations, Black Hornet will give Army soldiers an impressive boost in awareness about their surroundings, allowing them to make better-informed movements and out-maneuver opponents. It also offers a new way to reduce vulnerability to a host of threats, including ambushes, improvised explosive devices, or just what might be hiding on top of a roof or the other side of a wall. It could also help small units to more quickly and accurately assess the impact of artillery or air strikes and determine whether more fire support is needed and where. It’s a relatively cost-effective way to upgrade the capability of small units, too, with a unit price per complete system of between $15,000 and $20,000, according to the Army’s budget request for the 2019 Fiscal Year . The service’s hand-launched RQ-11 Ravens , among the service’s most common small drones in widespread service now, cost around ten times more each and are exponentially larger than the Black Hornet. It’s a capability that’s been some time in the making, too. The Army’s Natick Soldier Research Center first began experimenting with what was then known as the Prox Dynamics’ PD-100 Black Hornet in 2014 as part of the Cargo Pocket Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (CP-ISR) program. A Prox Dynamics’ PD-100 during Army testing circa 2014., US Army Two years earlier , the U.K. Armed Forces began using the very early versions of the Black Hornet in Afghanistan. The U.K. Ministry of Defense said that the system had been withdrawn from use sometime between 2016 and 2017 in favor of larger hand-launched drones, such as the Lockheed Martin Desert Hawk III , that offer significantly greater capability over the first generation PD-100s. As of 2016, the Black Hornet was reportedly in service or under evaluation in nearly 20 different countries. FLIR Systems also bought Prox Dynamics in 2016 and has been continuing development of the drone since then. The latest Black Hornet is a far cry from the original PD-100, featuring a significantly more robust design and improved performance. Since then, U.S. special operations forces and the U.S. Marines have also evaluated the Black Hornet as part of similar efforts to improve the situational awareness of small units in the field. For special operations forces, which might be operating well away from friendly lines and larger conventional forces, having a good, real-time picture of their surroundings could be essential. It could also increase their ability to conduct special reconnaissance operations, potentially deep in denied areas, but allow for a greater standoff distance to the actual target, reducing the risk of the mission getting compromised . In 2018, FLIR Systems also unveiled a larger dock/launcher for up to eight Black Hornets that a user could mount on a vehicle, as well. Armored vehicles, in particular, typically offer poor visibility when the crew is “buttoned up” inside, which can increase their vulnerability to dismounted infantry attacking from the sides or the rear, especially in confined spaces, such as urban environments. Known as the Vehicle Reconnaissance System (VRS), FLIR’s vehicle-mounted system could help reduce the risk of hostile forces getting the jump on an individual vehicle, or a larger convoy, especially while fighting through a congested cityscape. The Army is now considering adding a small unmanned aircraft capability to whatever armored vehicle design it chooses to replace the Bradley Fighting Vehicle . The existing purchases of Black Hornets for dismounted units could make it an attractive option for this requirement, as well. With the service now buying large amounts of them for widespread distribution among regular units, other branches of the U.S. military, as well as American allies and partners, may be quick to follow suit. Regardless, nano drones are now literally on the way to becoming a standard piece of infantry equipment across the Army, which will have a dramatic impact on the way it conducts even the most routine operations.

An aircraft that represents a missing technological link between Lockheed’s abortive “Tier III-” RQ-3 Darkstar unmanned penetrating and long-loitering spy aircraft and the company’s history making RQ-170 Sentinel is now coming to light. This previously unknown (to the public) flying-wing drone was built by Lockheed Skunk Works in 1999, shortly after the RQ-3 program vanished. This new program, which aimed to prove rapid manufacturing technologies and penetrating aerial reconnaissance capabilities, as well as the aerodynamic validity of a relatively small, tailless, swept-wing drone, was dubbed the X-44A and first took to the skies in 2001. The RQ-3 Darkstar program ended abruptly in 1999, but its mission requirement, to penetrate and persist over contested territory , lived on. , USAF The shadowy aircraft’s designation is outright confusing as the X-44 “Manta” is largely known as a program that aimed to test a tailless manned aircraft design that emanated from the same period of time. This notional aircraft would use thrust vectoring for primary flight control, with the objective being to realize new speed, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability capabilities with such a design, as well as to demonstrate simpler and cheaper forms of aircraft structures production. Concept imagery from the X-44 Manta program, which lost funding in 2000. , USAF/NASA This USAF and NASA led program was supposedly cancelled around the turn of the millennium with some conceptual art being all that is left to show for it, which mainly includes drawings of what appears to be a tailless F-22 with an expanded trapezoidal wing. This is the official entry for the X-44A as it appears in 2004 edition of the Department of Defense Directive 4120.15-L, Model Designation of Military Aerospace Vehicles, the Pentagon’s official public master list of aircraft and missile nomenclature. The “none” portion of the entry indicates that it has no official popular nickname. Clearly, this does not properly correspond with Lockheed’s X-44A drone. How or why this is the case remains unknown., DoD It is unclear at this time how Lockheed’s fat little flying-wing drone also ended up with the same X-44 designation, but there doesn’t seem to be any direct relation between the two programs. USPTO A patent dated 1996 and belonging to Lockheed has been identified as the real X-44A’s design, or at least very close to it. The X-44’s skin is supposedly made out of nano-carbon fiber and it’s powered by a Williams F112 turbojet engine. The F112 powerplant is used in cruise missiles, such as the stealthy AGM-129, but it has also been used in other unmanned technology demonstrators, like the McDonnell Douglas’s X-36 and Boeing’s X-50. Williams F112 jet engine., USAF/Public Domain Size wise, the X-44 has a wingspan of approximately 30 feet, making it roughly half the size of its RQ-170 successor. The airframe is modular in nature with a potato-like fuselage that could carry various sensors. It is also likely that the aircraft could have its wings detached for transport, similar to the RQ-170. The aircraft is guided by traditional control surfaces along its trailing edge and it features rakes, squared-off wingtips. USPTO Aside from doing independent research for Lockheed Martin, the X-44 was apparently also part of some sort of competition between Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed, the outcome of which remains unknown but it seems as if Lockheed lost. The goal of that competition is unknown, but it could have been an early semi-disposable stealthy drone program very similar to the Air Force Research Lab’s current Low-Cost Attritable Strike Demonstration (LCASD) initiative. USPTO The aircraft wears the insignia below, a mysterious crest that has become popular in aerospace-defense crowds after being presented initially in Trevor Peglen’s book I Could Tell You But Then You Would Have to be Destroyed by Me: Emblems from the Pentagon’s Black World. Worthpoint The crest features a black manta ray, which is interesting because “Black Manta” was the nickname for the aforementioned canceled X-44 program. It reads pottus est melius quam satis bene:  “Making something better than just good enough”—this could be in reference to the manufacturing techniques used in the X-44’s creation. Indigo, Delta, Kilo seems to be a reference to “I Don’t Know,” underlining the deep classification of the program. The number one and constellation of stars remain a mystery. Usually six stars signify Area 51 as a primary test location, but in this case there are 11. In recent years, the Skunk Works X-44 was refitted and used to evaluate visual cueing systems for the Navy’s upcoming Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS) tanker drone program. Lockheed, which hasn’t yet shown off its entrant into the CBARS tender, faces stiff competition from General Atomics and Boeing . Lockheed P175 Polecat was built following the X-44A, and although it was much larger, it sought to prove some of the same concepts as its predecessor albeit in a much more advanced form. We now have three aircraft that make up the RQ-170 Sentinel’s lineage: The RQ-3, the X-44, and the P175. , Lockheed Image What the X-44 provides us with is a new evolutionary stepping stone in a lineage of aircraft that collectively represent the Skunk Works’ quiet dive into the high-end unmanned space—a space that became increasingly promising in the early 2000s. The type likely served as one of the cruder forerunners to a family of stealth unmanned aircraft systems, some of which are undoubtedly still cloaked in secrecy. But one can clearly see how it helped spawn the P175 Polecat demonstrator, which had similar program goals and overall similar design, but on a much larger and more advanced scale. Other aircraft also likely existed during the early and mid 2000 that are part of this family of clandestine flying-wings courtesy of the Skunk Works. Following the attacks on 9/11, a penetrating and persistent reconnaissance capability would have been a top priority, and it is widely understood that a similar clandestine aircraft system belonging to Lockheed participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This was likely a semi-operational forerunner to the RQ-170 Sentinel , which first appeared publicly at Kandahar airfield in Afghanistan in 2007. A RQ-170 variant pictured at Andersen AFB on Guam., USAF via FOIA The RQ-170 Sentinel in particular, which helped in finding and finishing-off Osama Bin Laden, kept tabs on the Iran’s nuclear program, and famously fell into the hands of Iran in 2011 , not to mention also likely flying missions over other hostile territories such as North Korea, is a known operational benefactor of the X-44A’s existence, and there surely are others. You can learn all about the intriguing and mysterious saga of America’s stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) programs and why they disappeared in this past TWZ super feature. Hopefully the Skunk Works will post photos of this intriguing aircraft and more information on its backstory in the near future. That being said, the logic behind keeping it classified for so long is quite puzzling considering its simplicity and diminutive size compared to high-end unmanned systems we know of today. Above all else, the nearly two decade old X-44A serves a reminder that there is so much technology and history buried in the deeply classified “black” world that we have yet to learn about. We have reached out to Lockheed about the X-44 but have not heard back. We will keep you updated if we receive more information on this historic aircraft.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 14, 2018",This Video Of A CH-47 Extracting Soldiers Off A Ridge Reminds Us Why The Chinook Rules,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The H-47 Chinook is one incredible flying machine. As it closes in on the start of its seventh decade of service, the “Hooker” has never been more capable and the U.S. Army is slated to keep upgrading and operating the type for decades to come. But nowhere has the Chinook been more highly valued than on the harsh battlefield of Afghanistan. The Chinook’s ability to carry large numbers of troops and materiel into ‘hot and high’ locations, and despite is ungainly fame, its ability to access personnel in precarious places, have been a godsend to troops fighting in America’s longest war. Case in point, this awesome FLIR footage from an AH-64 Apache’s TADS targeting system showing a Chinook plopping its butt on a narrow ridge-line to extract a large group of soldiers. The maneuver is called a “pinnacle landing” and it has proved to be an invaluable tactic during the 17 years of war in Southwest Asia. The video was taken during an operation in 2012. In it the Apache crew gives some play-by-play, noting in far more colorful terms that the angle of the Chinook’s rear blades could be hazardous to the troops approaching the helicopter unless they duck. This is especially true considering the CH-47 is basically balancing on its rear gear and it could porpoise up or down at any given moment. Even the helicopter’s ramp looks like it is only partially opened due to the steep angle of the helicopter. It looked like nearly 30 troops and their gear would end up boarding the CH-47. The Apache crew also repeatedly says that they need to hurry, so it seems that this exfiltration occurred during a fairly hostile situation. Pinnacle landings aren’t all that rare in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan. Pictures of these maneuvers have gone viral on the net and there are videos of them occurring under various combat circumstances. https://youtube.com/watch?v=CAWLKXphPkI Special operations and counter-terror units also leverage the tactic to quickly load and unload onto building rooftops. One of the most iconic pictures from the war in Afghanistan is of a CH-47 making a pinnacle landing on a disheveled rooftop high up in the mountains to pick up some prisoners. Here is the pilot’s account of that image. , DoD The maneuver was also used 50 years ago in Vietnam, a war in which the Chinook originally received it reputation for a being fast, resilient, surprisingly maneuverable and incredibly useful. Chinook executing a pinnacle landing at an outpost in Vietnam., Public Domain A maritime variation of the maneuver called the “Delta Queen” is used to rapidly recover special operations teams in small boats. Youtube Gif For highly experienced CH-47 pilots, pinnacle landings aren’t that challenging under ideal circumstances, but the higher you get, and add in wind, the darkness of night, the threat of enemy action, and especially the angle of the surface in relation to the Chinook’s rear blades , things can get very dicey fast. So once again, here’s to the mighty and ultra versatile Chinook. Whether it be extracting troops off a ragged ridge-line, hauling away super-sized cargo , coughing-up Humvees from its cargo hold , whisking special operators in and out of hostile territory , Boeing’s legendary design continues to be more valuable than ever. The U.S. Army is currently putting its Hooker fleet through an elaborate and l ong roadmap of upgrades , and the latest version of the tandem-rotor icon, the CH-47F, is in competition to supply Germany and Israel with their next heavy-lift multi-mission helicopters. But still, Afghanistan will be remembered as the Chinook’s war, for both bitter and sweet reasons.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",USAF Pararescuemen Fawn Over The Army’s Chinook Helicopters In This Video From Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released a new slickly produced video that gives an inside look into a unique combat search and rescue super team it operates jointly with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. With the Air Force in the process of replacing its older HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters with new HH-60W models , it’s particularly interesting to hear the service’s personnel spend much of their time talking about the benefits of the Army’s CH-47F Chinook in the combat search and rescue (CSAR) role. In October 2017, the Air Force revealed that it would withdraw the 83rd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron’s HH-60Gs and their crews from Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan and replace them with Army CH-47Fs, a development that we at The War Zone were among the first to report . The squadron’s command element and pararescuemen, also referred to as P.J.s, would continue operations as before, but with those new aircraft. At the time, this was the only remaining U.S. military search and rescue unit in the country. In January 2018, the Air Force did re-deploy some Pave Hawks to Kandahar Airfield in the country’s southeast region. “At the tactical level, the P.J.s and the Army work seamlessly together,” U.S. Air Force Major Robert Wilson, the commander of the 83rd, says in the video. “It’s as we’ve been doing this for years.” He’s not wrong. The squadron had conducted multiple joint training and other operations with active Army and National Guard personnel in Afghanistan prior to the decision to reorganize the unit. The Army also operates its own casualty evacuation helicopter elements in the country that likely coordinate at various levels with other services and foreign partners on a routine basis. And given the increasing age of the HH-60G Pave Hawks and the growing strains on the Air Force’s combat rescue community in general , this more formalized partnership and division of labor made good sense for the tasks at hand in Afghanistan. But Wilson, as well as other members of the unit that the 1st Combat Camera Squadron interviewed for the production, also took the time to not only describe the Chinook as an adequate substitute, but praised it as a far more capable aircraft than their Pave Hawks. A US Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk., USAF “In this particular area of operations, in Bagram, … the Army Chinook is the best platform to conduct this mission,” Wilson says unequivocally. “We need that aircraft [the CH-47F] to get to places we couldn’t reach before.” This is all particularly interesting to hear, especially from an official Air Force public relations video, given that the service had picked a variant of Boeing’s Chinook, the HH-47 , as the replacement for its Pave Hawks back in 2006. Protests from Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky regarding the contracting process, combined with criticisms about the much greater operating costs of the larger aircraft combined to cancel that program. An artist’s conception of the proposed HH-47 combat search and rescue helicopter., Boeing There were also very real concerns about whether the Chinook could truly fulfill the mission, especially given its large footprint and the powerful downwash from its twin rotors. These features inherently limit where it can land and could pose a hazard to personnel in the landing zone, which is even more problematic for medics trying to provide immediate aid as the aircraft touches down. The CH-47 does make up for some of the difficulties it might have fitting into confined landing zones by being able to balance itself on its rear two wheels while hovering to unload personnel and equipment in places where it cannot fully land. This maneuver, known as a pinnacle landing , has been particularly useful in Afghanistan’s rugged terrain. In Afghanistan, the CH-47 is apparently now getting a chance to shine in the role in spite of any of those limitations. One of the biggest issues for units operating out of Bagram is that it sits north of Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, inside a valley surrounded by mountains thousands of feet of high. Any aircraft, fixed wing or helicopter, has to get through that obstacle even just to conduct relatively short range operations from the airfield. A US Army CH-47F Chinook attached to the 83rd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron flies over Afghanistan., USAF For helicopters, the problem is that high altitudes, as well as hot temperatures, can easily and dangerously degrade their performance . Depending on the weather, especially low cloud cover and fog, it can be equally risky to fly at lower levels through the mountains. Even beyond Bagram’s immediate vicinity, much of Afghanistan is equally mountainous and can experience high temperatures in the summer months. It can be a foreboding region for helicopter operations, even though the lack of roads and canals down below often make it the most rapid and effective method of traversing the country. Members of the 83rd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron load onto a US Army CH-47F on top of a snow-covered mountain in Afghanistan during a training exercise., USAF “If somebody’s up in the mountains and they need to be hoisted out of the mountains because there isn’t a suitable landing zone, their [the Army’s CH-47F] aircraft actually has the power to hold a stable hover,” one of the 83rd’s pararescuemen, who the Air Force did not name for operational security reasons, explains. “With the Chinook having as much power as it does, it allows us to reach very high altitudes without the degradation of the power margin that most other tail rotor aircraft experience as you go up in higher altitudes,” an unnamed Army CH-47F pilot attached to the squadron adds. Those features have long made CH-47s a workhorse for both conventional and special operations in Afghanistan. In 2017, Ed Darack, photographer and author of The Final Mission of Extortion 17 , shared his own experiences with the helicopters while he was embedded with American troops in Afghanistan with us at The War Zone, writing : “The Black Hawk’s passage above the airstrip highlighted, through contrast, the key distinguishing characteristic of the CH-47: its rotor configuration. The Black Hawk is a “tail rotor” helicopter, relying on a tail rotor to counteract the torque effect of the main rotor system –and through “anti-torque” foot pedal control inputs, yaw the aircraft clockwise and counterclockwise. By far the most common form of rotary-wing aircraft throughout the world, the tail-rotor helicopter suffers a fundamental disadvantage: that tail rotor draws upwards of 15 percent of available power that would otherwise be used for thrust simply to keep the helicopter from spinning wildly out of control. “The Chinook, on the other hand, uses a torque-canceling configuration of two counter-rotating rotor systems, one three-bladed assembly at the front of the helicopter’s fuselage, and one at the rear. With this design, virtually 100% of available horsepower its two turboshaft engines produce is applied to thrust – a small amount is lost due to internal friction of the gears in the combiner box and transmissions. “All of this thrust allows the Chinook to carry upwards of 50 troops and their gear in its spacious fuselage. The helicopter can also haul tens of thousands of pounds of cargo, loaded internally or slung beneath it. The ability for CH-47s to externally sling heavy military implements like howitzers quickly became so renowned that it inspired an enduring nickname for those in the Chinook world: ‘Hookers,’ for the hooks found on the underside of the aircraft’s fuselage to which the slings attach.” The CH-47’s carrying capacity and the large amount of physical space within its main cabin are also major benefits for the joint squadron, according to Wilson and the other interviewees. These features would translate more readily to combat search and rescue operations more generally, too. “Mass casualty operations is [sic] an inherent risk that takes place within Afghanistan,” Wilson says. “What’s nice about the -47 is I can pick most of those folks up all in one trip.” Pararescuemen from the 83rd Expedtionary Rescue Squadron treat a mock patient inside a US Army CH-47 during a training mission., USAF The ability to carry larger numbers of patients reduces the total number of aircraft necessary for rescue and casualty evacuation missions. It also potentially speeds up how fast the unit can get those individuals back to Bagram for more intensive care, which in turn improves the likelihood that medical professionals will be able to save their lives or otherwise prevent lasting injuries. In addition to potentially being able to rush wounded service members back to hospitals faster, the Chinook provides space for better in-flight treatment, as well. “The space that the -47 allows us gives the P.J. more room to operate around the patient to give care,” Wilson notes. A US Army soldier mans a machine gun on the tailgate of one of the CH-47Fs attached to the 83rd Rescue Squadron in Afghanistan., USAF Whether or not non-stealthy helicopters of any kind will be able to perform combat search and rescue missions at all in a future high-end conflict, where low-observable aircraft will be necessary to penetrate in areas full of integrated air defenses and advanced combat aircraft , is a growing question . There will still definitely be a need for these units in more permissive environments, though. “As long as anybody’s on the ground and aircraft are flying overhead, rescue is needed within Afghanistan,” Major Wilson says. “Period.” In 2014, the Air Force finally settled on the newer HH-60W variant from Sikorsky – now part of Lockheed Martin – as the Pave Hawk replacement. The first of those helicopters are supposed to begin flight testing later in 2018 and production aircraft will hopefully begin reaching units sometime in 2020 . An artist’s conception of the HH-60W., Lockheed Martin Those aircraft can’t come fast enough, as the HH-60Gs are steadily showing worrisome signs of their age. The oldest of those helicopters that remain in service first rolled off the production line in the 1980s and are now suffering structural failures . Though the exact cause of that incident remains under investigation, the Pave Hawk community did suffer a major loss in March 2018, with the crash of an HH-60G near the Syria-Iraq border that killed all seven individuals on board. The 1st Combat Camera Squadron dedicated the video on the 83rd to the crew of that aircraft, which was using the callsign Jolly 51 at the time. But even when the HH-60Ws come online, if the comments from the 83rd in Afghanistan are any indication, there may be some in the Air Force’s combat search and rescue community who are still pining for the power and capacity an HH-47 could have offered, whether it would be overkill for typical missions or not.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 26, 2019",Retired General Says F-22 Production Was Killed So That A New Bomber Could Live,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Retired Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz has stated in his new memoir that F-22 production was idiotically axed after building less than half the required number so that the flying force could get then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to approve building a new stealth bomber. Air Force Magazine was first to report on the revelations from the General’s new book “Journey: Memoirs of an Air Force Chief of Staff,” which also includes much more detail about how exactly the fight for the F-22 was lost, as well as how the battle to re-launch a Next Generation Bomber program was eventually won. Norton Schwartz became the first non-fighter pilot to lead the USAF since 1982 ., USAF Behind the scenes, Schwartz’s predecessor General Mike Moseley “never gave up in his principled attempts to get those 381 F-22s” the book states. That push ended up getting Moseley fired along with his civilian counterpart, Air Force Secretary Mike Wynn. After the culling, the brass thought that the new bomber was simply too important and that the chances of winning both the F-22 and bomber arguments with Gates, who was staunchly averse to building high-priced weapons that couldn’t be used in Iraq or Afghanistan, was next to zero. Schwartz, in an attempt to see if a reduced F-22 production number would be palatable to the Defense Secretary, executed an independent assessment that ended up stating 243 F-22s was the absolute minimum the force could get by with. But Gates balked at that number as well. Lockheed Martin After that final push, Schwartz and his colleagues gave up on the F-22 production fight as it had already “consumed enough oxygen.” The idea of going to the powers that be in Washington, DC behind Gates’s back to lobby for the jet was a non-starter for the General as he didn’t want to betray his boss, no matter how poor his decision making seemed to be regarding the Raptor issue. The need for the new bomber would now become a top procurement priority and having sacrificed something at the fiscal altar gave Schwartz and the USAF brass of the era some momentum for making a case for that bomber. But still, convincing the civilian leadership that a new stealth bomber was needed even during a time when a peer-state conflict was anything but the major military issue of the day was going to be a major undertaking. Gates had also terminated the prior bomber effort, known as Next Generation Bomber (NGB), for what Schwartz calls “rational reasons.” Air Force Magazine states: The NGB “had grown too big” and was carrying too many missions and requirements. It was to have an air-to-air missile capability for self-defense, Schwartz revealed, describing that requirement as “not completely nonsensical” but unaffordable. The attitude was that “cost was no object” on the NGB, Schwartz claimed, and that didn’t meet with Gates’ worldview, “So he canceled it.” In explaining the termination of the NGB to Congress and the press, Gates claimed that the B-2’s unit cost had swelled unreasonably and this is why it had been canceled in its day, but that was exactly backward. It was cutting the planned 132 B-2s to 20 that caused its unit cost to swell, because all of the research and development costs associated with it had to be amortized across a force less than a sixth as large as had been planned. This is only partly true. Unit cost does not take into account sunk research and development costs first of all, and the B-2 unit cost itself had ballooned as well . Regardless, Schwartz—a helicopter and transport pilot by trade— saw the bomber as an “unquestioned requirement” that would be needed by future presidents “both for warfighting and deterrence purposes.” So they went about convincing Gates that the bomber could be had for an acceptable price and without the massive developmental risk associated with Next Generation Bomber. This included keeping requirements fixed and costs down by using existing subsystems and other components, as well as other offboard jamming and sensor aircraft that could work together with the bomber as a ‘system of systems.’ Air Force Magazine concludes by restating the general’s remarks: Ultimately, Gates relented, apparently persuaded that “we as an Air Force could field such a system with discipline.” Schwartz said he and Donley are proud of having “succeeded in persuading Gates” the B-21 would be pursued with “discipline like he had not seen, and so it’s up to our successors to deliver on that promise. The Air Force has to, if it is going to bring this one home… Moreover, they promised the aircraft would rely heavily on offboard sensors, jammers, and other capabilities to keep the cost down, as part of a system of systems. All this is interesting for a number of reasons. First, it slams home my position that I have stated for years that Gates is largely to blame for the F-22 production debacle, along with a whole slew of near-sighted decisions and calls—in particular, poor handicapping of near-peer adversaries technological abilities and intent. Discounting the quick rise of China’s stealth fighter programs is among the worst calls Gates made. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , DoD Other developments in North Korea and Russia were also poorly foreseen and/or outright brushed aside during his term. He was very focused on Iraq and Afghanistan, which is understandable, but in doing so he seemed to totally set aside America’s greater defense needs in the process and seemed to believe that low-end adversaries would be the only threat to America for the decades to come. A highly controversial mindset at the time, and one which we are paying dearly for today. In other words, I would not want to be betting on Gates’s picks at a race track. Air Force Magazine backs up this train of thought as well, stating: Gates, in his own memoir, “Duty,” argued that the F-22 was useless in the Afghanistan and Iraq counterinsurgencies, was a Cold War relic, and that a Chinese stealth fighter wouldn’t be along until the 2020s, so nothing would be lost by killing it. In actual fact, the F-22 has been essential in the Syria campaign and China fielded its first operational stealth squadron in 2017. Every Air Combat Command chief since Gates tenure has warned that the F-22 force is far too small for the demands placed on it. Beyond the F-22 production saga, we get some rare insights and affirmations as to the USAF’s bomber programs of the era and the birth of the B-21 Raider . The Next Generation Bomber initiative was and remains highly classified, and with this new commentary, the idea that it was truly a “and the kitchen sink” program is reinforced. It also underlines how the USAF’s move to arm its next bomber with air-to-air weapons for self-defense was a major objective back then. We have discussed this capability at length here at The War Zone, and the B-21 may be able to attain this capability far easier than its NGB predecessor as it is thought to use off-the-shelf mission systems —possibly those associated closely with the F-35—that already support this capability. The Air Force is hard at work quietly developing very long-range air-to-air missiles that the B-21 could carry into battle and without even needing the ability to target them themselves, instead, it could rely on network connectivity and teaming with stealthy fighter aircraft to do so. Norton’s comments also underline something we have been trying to make clear for a long time—the B-21 is part of a larger clandestine ecosystem of new penetrating air capabilities being developed to take on peer-state opponents and work in concert with the new bomber, as well as independently. This likely includes a strategic reconnaissance aircraft that has existed for some time, unofficially referred to as the RQ-180 , which can penetrate enemy airspace and persist there at high altitudes to collect targeting data and electronic intelligence that the B-21 can use in real time for targeting and route planning. B-21 Raider, Northrop Grumman/The Drive Tactical unmanned combat air vehicles that can be used as sensor and electronic attack platforms, and even as kinetic attack aircraft, are also likely part of this family of systems. These can augment and assist the B-21 on its mission to strike deep in the heart of enemy territory. A new stealthy cruise missile that will almost certainly have a conventional warhead option is also being developed under the LRSO program . So at this point think of the B-21 as the star performer on a dark stage, with many supporting agents working in the darkness so that it can execute a stellar performance. These elements seem to have been alluded to by Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter on more than one occasion, as well. Even the B-21’s eventual arrival at Edwards AFB in the not so distant future has been described to us as being part of a larger family of systems that will be tested there under a unified ‘program of programs’ umbrella. These associated systems are very likely to have been operating for some time in the darkness but could become more visible as the B-21 pushes its way toward initial operating capability in the mid 2020s. Norton Schwatz at flying a C-130., USAF Also, by building a family of systems that can enable the B-21, the bomber’s unit cost, which is an incredibly volatile topic that is further exacerbated by the B-2’s dismal fiscal history, can be kept relatively low. With its cadre of lower-density enablers being developed using black budget funds that won’t be officially related to the B-21 itself—at least budgetarily—a ‘cheaper’ B-21 can be built. Basically, it’s very possible that the USAF is not only decentralizing some of the bomber’s critical capabilities, they are also decentralizing its budget, and thus making it more survivable on the battlefield and on Capitol Hill. We are looking forward to reading General Schwartz’s entire memoir and finding out what other interesting tidbits of information are laced throughout its pages. We will report back with a full review when we do.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 10, 2019",This Elite B-2 Stealth Bomber Test Unit’s Challenge Coin May Be The Coolest Ever,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We talk a lot about unit patches here on The War Zone, but challenge coins, aka ’round metal objects,’ or RMOs, are as equally interesting and are a major part of military aviation culture and tradition. There are seemingly a limitless number of features that can be included on a challenge coin outside of their basic traits, which usually include the unit’s designation, colors, mascot, nickname, mottos and slogans, symbology, and references to its history and lore. But of all the RMOs I have seen, the 72nd Test and Evaluation Squadron Detachment Two, which deals with testing the fearsome and sinister B-2 Spirit , has the coolest. For those not yet in the know, it is worth reviewing the history of the challenge coin and how they are used in practice. F-22 pilot Rob Burgon, author of “Piano Burning and Other Fighter Pilot Traditions” has a website that has a good primer on this awesome topic that you can and should read here . Officially speaking, the 72nd Test and Evaluation Squadron is part of the 53rd Wing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, but it spends most its time far west of that location. This includes primarily operating out of the B-2’s home base at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, plowing the range complexes and working out of Nellis AFB in southern Nevada , and visiting Edwards AFB and the nearby Plant 42 in California as well. Tyler Rogoway The squadron has deeper roots than the vast majority of USAF units, with its establishment dating back exactly 100 years. The 72nd even deployed to France during World War I. Since then it has taken on various roles, including being a bomber squadron during World War II and a reconnaissance squadron and once again a bomber squadron during the Cold War. The unit stood-up in its current form as the B-2’s test and evaluation unit, dealing with virtually all forms of the prized bomber’s evolution and sustainment, in 1998. A patch from World War II while the unit was flying B-24 Liberators over the Pacific. From the website description: “These patches probably date to late 1942 or early 1943 when the 5th Bomb Group was attached to the 13th Air Force… A banner beneath the death’s-head reads KIAI O KA LEWA (“Guardians of the upper regions”: Hawaiian).”, Flyingtigerantiques.com Their absolutely wicked emblem harkens back to at least 1924 and is one of the most striking crests in the entire U.S. military.

Approved on 14 Feb 1924.” USAF The testers of the 72nd Test and Evaluation Squadron Detachment Two have incorporated this emblem and a whole load of other symbology—and even functionality—into their challenge coin. Here are the features of the coin as far as our sources describe them and as we understand them: The iconic skyline of Las Vegas is seen as well as a stylized aeronautical chart. The unit’s official name and the 72nd TES lightning bolt logo are also prominently displayed, as well as the aircraft they test—the B-2 Spirit—in both quartering and planform perspectives. ‘DET 2’ refers to ‘Detachment Two,’ a sub-unit that deals with the evaluation and reporting aspects of B-2 testing, especially in regards to the aircraft’s stealthy capabilities. ‘Coyotes’ is the unit’s nickname . ‘Deny, Deceive, Destroy’ and the post office motto ‘neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds’ is aptly showcased in Latin. Contributer ‘Survivability’ refers to the various elements of the stealthy B-2 that allow it to penetrate enemy air defenses and come out intact to fly another day. These include a whole cocktail of capabilities ranging onboard sensors, to electronic warfare, to mission planning systems. Yet the aircraft’s exotic shape and radar absorbing coatings are its primary low-observable features, so it’s not a surprise to see the sigma symbol after ‘survivability’ as it represents the measurement of an aircraft’s radar cross-section. The alien is a common tongue and cheek reference to secretive programs at Area 51 where the Dynamic Coherent Measurement System (DYCOMS) and its managerie of antenna arrays are located. This system is similar to a static radar-cross section test range but it can collect data on real aircraft as they whiz by above at different angles. The B-2 is known to use this installation relatively regularly. The 509th Bomb Wing, which flies the B-2 operationally, also has a connection with the whole alien thing as they were the unit based at Roswell New Mexico during the time of the infamous ‘flying saucer crash’ that now has a life of its own within American popular culture., Ebay The claws with talons and red glowing eyes make up the logo of the B-2 Combined Test Force. The five stars plus the triangle in the center most likely refers to Area 51 as six stars are established cryptic symbology that represents the base. In this case, one star is replaced with the triangular shape which matches the large rotating tower array located at the DYCOMS facility on the secretive installation. The meaning of the other five stars isn’t clear at this time. Finally, we have the coolest part of this killer design—the negative space below the B-2’s sawtooth trailing edge isn’t just there for great aesthetics. This RMO is also a very usable bottle opener! This feature is not unheard of on challenge coins, but the B-2’s trailing edge makes it ideal for such a function without looking like, well, a bottle opener. Making it even cooler, certain features of the coin, like the alien, glow in the dark as well. So there you have it, a highly specialized subset of an elite but seldom talked about Air Force unit happens to have one hell of a challenge coin. Well done guys, we didn’t even see it comin’—but I guess you are kind of used to that! What awesome challenge coins have you seen? Share them and let’s discuss in the comments section below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 2, 2017",Excalibur Was A Vulcan Gatling Gun Wielding Air Defense Vehicle Straight Out of G.I. Joe,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Late in the Cold War, the Standard Manufacturing Company pitched a new type of short-range air defense vehicle, called Excalibur, to the U.S. Army. Looking like something out of a G.I. Joe playset or a 1980s action movie , this Vulcan cannon-armed vehicle was just one of many designs the company suggested could revolutionize the service’s mechanized units. It’s not clear exactly when Standard Manufacturing, situated in Dallas, Texas – and apparently unrelated to the Connecticut-based gunmaker of the same name – built the first prototype design, but one was available for tests by 1985. The firm had applied for a patent for the vehicle’s unique 8×8 trailing-arm suspension in 1984, which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted two years later . According to Fred Crismon’s Modern U.S. Military Vehicles , Excalibur, also known as the Vulcan Wheeled Carrier, combined this suspension with a 135-horsepower Detroit Diesel V8 engine, which reportedly gave it a top speed on improved roads of 45 miles per hour. On top of the chassis, there was a lightweight, open-framed crew-cab in front and a turret in the rear with a radar-assisted 20mm M168 six-barrel cannon, a variant of the M61A1 Vulcan cannon found on fighter jets and other aircraft . The entire vehicle weighed approximately 16,000 pounds. More importantly, Standard Manufacturing claimed that the suspension system, in which every one of the eight wheels could articulate up and down independently, would give it the same mobility on uneven ground as a tracked vehicle. At the same time, Excalibur would have significantly higher speeds on rough terrain and improved roads, but with fewer maintenance requirements, reducing the operating costs compared to traditional tracked designs. The Excalibur Vulcan Wheeled Carrier vehicle during a US Army exercise in 1985., US Army At the time, the Army’s had tracked and towed Vulcan Air Defense Systems , or VADS, in service using the same manned turret. Excalibur would have been lighter than the M113 armored personnel carrier that served as the basis for the tracked system. The tracked VADS, also known as the M163, was significantly heavier than the standard M113, as well, necessitating a reinforced suspension and additional floatation gear to maintain its amphibious capabilities. On roads, that vehicle could hit a top speed of 40 miles per hour, but at the cost of increased wear and tear on its tracks and the road surface. The M167 towed version was limited in its mobility by whatever vehicle was pulling it along. In 1985, the system’s prime mover was the first iteration of the new ubiquitous Humvee , which had better mobility off-road than its predecessors, but still could not match the capabilities of a tracked vehicle, especially when pulling a heavy trailer. Even so, it’s not clear what the exact impetus was for the Texas-based company to develop this vehicle, since the Army had two versions of the VADS in service already, primarily to provide short-range defense for ground units against low-flying aircraft and helicopters. But it did come at a time when the Army had become increasingly concerned that its ground units and their vehicles might be too heavy and bulky to rapidly deploy in response to far-reaching conflicts. The rapid collapse of the Shah’s regime in Iran and the speed at which the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan , both of which occurred in 1979, pushed the service to craft what it first dubbed a High Technology Test Bed and then renamed as the High Technology Light Division. Excalibur would have been well at home in this organization, which for a time had an entire battalion of militarized dune buggies . Chenowth Fast Attack Vehicles from 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry during a training exercise in South Korea in the 1980s., US Army The same organization subsequently experimented with various light tank and assault gun concepts, Humvees carrying Hellfire missiles , and other state-of-the-art, but highly mobile systems. Likely with this type of organization in mind, Standard Manufacturing’s patent outlines an entire family of vehicles based on its 8×8 suspension, including cargo trucks, armored personnel carriers, scout vehicles, mobile artillery rocket launchers, and platforms for communications nodes and electronic warfare systems. The drawing of the last vehicle actually looks very much like a truck carrying the Franco-German-designed Roland surface-to-air missile , which the Army had planned to acquire in the 1980s. We don’t know exactly what happened to Standard Manufacturing’s concept. None of the vehicles based on its proprietary chassis, which also included a variety of civilian trucks and construction equipment, ever entered series production. Drawings depicting various vehicles that could use the Standard Manufacturing suspension system as shown in its patent. Figure 35 looks very similar to US Army’s truck-mounted Roland launcher., USPTO The complexity of the independent suspension system may have made the vehicles too costly or unreliable for military use, especially during rapid deployment operations where there might not be the immediate benefit of established repair facilities or robust logistics chains. It would also undoubtedly have needed additional armor protection for the crew cab and other military equipment. This, in turn, might have increased its overall weight and reduced the potential mobility and speed benefits. Especially after the Cold War ended in 1991, and the U.S. defense budget began to contract, Excalibur may just have been too expensive when compared to the existing mix of traditional tracked and wheeled vehicles. By the end of the 1980s, the Army had already shelved the entire High Technology Light Division concept and returned most of the test units to more conventional force structures. A Standard Manufacturing Company cargo truck using its 8×8 independent suspension system during a US Army exercise in 1985., US Army The basic underlying concepts didn’t go away, though. In the 1980s, the U.S. Marine Corps had purchased a fleet of 8×8 wheeled armored vehicles based on the Swiss-designed MOWAG Piranha , known as the LAV-25 family , for a variety of roles. This fleet included a small number of LAV-Air Defense variants, or LAV-ADs, which featured a turret with a Vulcan cannon and eight Stinger short-range surface-to-air missiles. Early prototypes iterations also included a 70mm rocket pod for attack ground targets, a concept that carried over to a similar, proposed Canadian design known as the Multi-Mission Effects Vehicle (MMEV). In the early 2000s, the Army finally followed suit with the Stryker series , derived from the MOWAG Piranha III . By that point, however, the service had largely dismissed the need for short-range air defense in the future and did not buy an air defense type. This decision that has since proven to be immensely short-sighted, which you can read more about in detail in this past War Zone feature . Some foreign VADS operators have put the turrets on various other wheeled vehicles, as well. The Saudi Arabian National Guard acquired a version of the Cadillac Gage V-150 4×4 armored vehicle straight from the manufacturer with the Vulcan weapon system . More recently, Jordan’s state-owned King Abdullah II Design and Development Bureau (KADDB) defense company modified a number of the country’s 6×6 Cougar Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to carry the VADS turret.  This combination is more about providing massive firepower against ground targets, though, which was always a secondary role for the tracked and towed Vulcan systems. KADDB-modified Cougar MRAPs of the Jordanian Army with the Vulcan turret near the Al Roqban refugee camp in 2017., Jordan Pix/Getty Images The turrets themselves appear to be relatively durable and the basic components of the gun system remain in production. Variants of the Vulcan cannon remain in service as air-to-air weapons and as part of the Phalanx close-in defense system on ships. The Army even adopted a trailer-mounted version of the Phalanx as a means of protecting forward outposts against small rockets and mortar bombs. Just in November 2017, reports emerged that South Korea was upgrading its towed variants with new thermal optics as an interim defense against North Korean threats such as low- and slow-flying An-2 biplanes and small unmanned aircraft . Especially when it comes to the increasing proliferation of small drones among state among state and non-state actors , the VADS system, or weapons like it , are increasingly relevant again. Combined with a short-range surface-to-air missile system, such as Stinger , the old turrets might be a good interim short-range air defense option in many cases, regardless of what platform carrying them. As it stands now, the Army is looking to field a Stryker-based air-defense vehicle in the near term to address its aforementioned and increasingly glaring short-range air defense gap, both with regards to the threat of low-flying manned aircraft and small drones. Though the service appears to be focusing largely on missile-based systems, OrbitalATK has demonstrated a vehicle carrying both an electronic warfare jammer to target small drones and an XM914 single-barrel 30mm cannon. OrbitalATK’s prototype Stryker with its Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Defense System, or AUDS, and an XM914 30mm cannon., OrbitalATK The Army wants prototypes of the air defense Stryker ready for testing by 2019 , but has yet to settle on a particular design. If everything proceeds on schedule, the first batch of vehicles could join units in Europe the following year. At that time, more than three decades after Standard Manufacturing designed its Excalibur prototype, the Army may finally have an 8×8 air defense system.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 2, 2021",Check Out The Changes To Supercarrier USS Abraham Lincoln’s Island Structure After Refit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ​​​​ USS Abraham Lincoln , one of America’s Nimitz class supercarriers commissioned in 1989, recently completed a multi-year mid-life Refueling and Complex Overhaul that began in 2013. In May of 2017, she was redelivered to the fleet and is slated to make its first operational deployment since its refitting. During her downtime, the nuclear-powered carrier received many upgrades, some of which are very visible when viewing the ship externally. Chris Cavas ( @cavasships ) noted that there were changes to Lincoln’s island superstructure on Twitter, which prompted us to take a closer look. Below is a comparison shot of the USS Abraham Lincoln’s island from before the overhaul (right) and after (left). The changes are quite dramatic. An entirely new mast has been fitted as well as a new radar tower design located just behind the island superstructure. After overhaul (left) and before overhaul (right)., USN Also, what’s clear is how the carrier’s satellite communications suite has been totally reconfigured and expanded. Satcom domes cover not just the island but also the radar tower. One of the ship’s AN/SLQ-32 SEWIP electronic warfare systems has been relocated from the upper section on the island, down to just below the deck-line. Finally, what’s also immediately clear is that the number of radar target illuminators used to guide RIM-7 Sea Sparrow and RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSMs) have been reduced by two and the remaining two have been repositioned. The three previously mounted atop the island have been reduced to just one, which is now positioned at the forward right corner on the island. The one that was on the radar tower still remains, but it has been moved up a bit on the new tower. January 30th, 2019 photo of CVN-72., USN The reduction in illuminators could be because of the fact that the new Block II variant of the ESSM is active homing capable and networked. As a result, it doesn’t have to rely on illuminators to home in on its target. You can read all about this system in this past article of ours. Once again, these are just the obvious changes to the area around the ship’s island, but it serves as a good example of just how extensive these complex overhauls are. January 30th, 2019 photo of CVN-72., USN CVN-72 is now ready to get back in the fight after the better part of a decade spent getting overhauled and training. After this complex refit, she is set to serve for the back half of her 50 year, and potentially even longer , lifespan. As the ability for the Navy’s newest carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) , to meet her introduction into operational service is increasingly in doubt , the Lincoln’s ability to return to hot spots around the globe will be greatly appreciated.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 30, 2020",The Navy Is Ripping Out Underperforming Anti-Torpedo Torpedoes From Its Supercarriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy halted development of an anti-torpedo defense system for its ships last year due to poor performance, including unreliable sensors and interceptor torpedoes, and will remove the prototype systems from five carriers over the next four years. This comes at a time when the service routinely sounds the alarm about growing submarine threats , especially to high-value ships, from potential “great power competitors,” such as Russia and China . The latest annual report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, revealed the Navy’s decision to suspend work on what it officially calls the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System (ATTDS) in September 2018. DOT&E issues these reports to provide a public summary of significant testing developments regarding major U.S. military programs in the preceding fiscal year. At present, three of the Navy’s Nimitz -class aircraft carriers – USS George H.W. Bush , USS Harry S. Truman , and USS Nimitz – have prototype engineering and development models of the ATTDS installed. Bush was the first to receive the ATTDS in 2013. Two more Nimitz class carriers, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and USS Theodore Roosevelt , initially had earlier interim roll-on/roll-off versions of the system, but the Navy eventually added full prototypes to those ships. The basic components of the ATTDS on all five carriers are the same. It consists of the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) and the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT). A graphic showing how the ATTDS is supposed to work., USN The TWS includes a towed acoustic sensor that trails behind the ship to detect potential threats, classify them, and provide targeting information for the CAT. The CAT is a torpedo-like “hard-kill” interceptor that homes in on the torpedo and destroys it either by physically smashing into it or with its own explosive warhead. You can read more about the system and how the Navy expected it to work here . The problem, according to DOT&E, is that after more than five years in development, the ATTDS’s demonstrated capabilities were improving, but not fast enough. The system’s performance in testing and other evaluations, including during operational deployments on Bush , Eisenhower , and Nimitz in the 2017 Fiscal Year, was limited. An overview of the CAT., USN A cutaway showing the various components of the CAT interceptor., USN “TWS demonstrated some capability to detect incoming torpedoes,” DOT&E’s report for the 2018 Fiscal Year explained. “The significance and effect of false target alerts on TWS capability are unknown.” “CAT demonstrated some capability to defeat an incoming torpedo,” the annual review continued. “CAT has uncertain reliability. The lethality of CAT is untested.” In short, the two major components of the torpedo defense system have shown, in principle, that they might be able to destroy an incoming threat, but they’re not reliable enough to accurately evaluate those capabilities. The latest DOT&E report is otherwise light on specific details. However, DOT&E reviews from previous years do shine some additional light on significant ongoing issues. For one, the system reportedly suffers a high rate of false alarms when large numbers of other ships are present. This could suggest the TWS might have difficulty spotting an actual threat amidst other friendly ships, neutral vessels a hostile submarine might use to hide its approach, or anything else creating acoustic signatures during an actual combat scenario. A contractor examines part of the line holding the TWS’ towed sensor array to USS George H.W. Bush in 2013. , USN The active acoustic sensor component of the system, which might’ve helped mitigate that with its ability to actively search for targets, was still in testing at the time the Navy halted work in 2018. In every instance that a carrier had deployed with the ATTDS installed, the TWS was capable of passive detection only. DOT&E’s report for the 2017 Fiscal Year said that crews onboard Bush , Eisenhower , and Nimitz had rarely bothered to roll out the TWS array during their cruises and therefore collected little information on how it might work under real-world conditions. DOT&E also criticized the Navy’s use of highly scripted tests to evaluate the CAT’s performance, as well as how relevant the surrogate torpedo targets actually were. The service’s existing training targets are modified American designs and are not meant to reflect any foreign torpedo’s specific capabilities . As such, while the testing met the Navy’s requirements, DOT&E said it was impossible to gauge whether the data was representative of how the anti-torpedo interceptor would perform against a real threat. The ATTDS was supposed to be part of the larger Surface Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD) system, which also includes the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie and the Mk 2 Acoustic Device Countermeasure (ADC), both of which are in widespread Navy service already. The Nixie is a towed decoy meant to lure enemy homing torpedoes. The ADC is a standoff system that gets launched from Navy ships and then settles at a predetermined depth pumping out acoustic noise to attract homing torpedoes. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IVlVWXEQauA The complete arrangement was supposed to provide important close-in protection against underwater threats for Navy carriers and other high-value ships, such as amphibious assault ships. The added protection ATTDS is supposed to offer reflects the very real and growing threat of advanced submarines, including steadily harder to detect diesel-electric types with air-independent propulsions (AIP) systems. China and Russia are both looking to expand the size and capabilities of their submarine fleets and many of their new, non-nuclear submarine designs are available for export , increasing the chance that these potential threats will proliferate. This is to say nothing of increasingly capable Chinese and Russian torpedoes, many of which are also available on the export market. The latest variants and derivatives of Russia’s Type 53 family have ranges in excess of 12 miles, have features to defeat acoustic countermeasures, and zig-zag in the terminal phase of their attack to make them particularly hard to evade or intercept. A deactivated Soviet-era Type 53-65K, one of the first Type 53 variants to have wake homing capability, on display. , BrokenSphere via Wikimedia Though its general configuration is reverse engineered from the U.S. Mk 48 torpedo, China’s Yu-6 reportedly has some similar capabilities to the Type 53. In 2012, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) introduced the Yu-9 , which is a quieter, electrically-powered version of the Yu-6 that is more difficult to detect. However, the most recent report from DOT&E does not offer any recommendations for how the Navy might proceed, strongly implying that the ATTDS program might end up heavily restructured or canceled entirely. In 2017, the Navy pushed back the planned date for reaching initial operational capability with the system from 2018 to 2022. As of 2016, the service had hoped all of its carriers and other high-value ships would have the new anti-torpedo defenses by the end of 2035. Now it will remove all of the ATTDS components from the five carriers with the system by the end of 2023. Still, it seems hard to believe that the Navy wouldn’t at least try to squeeze some capability out of the system. The service has received more than $760 million in funding for the continued development of the entire SSTD, including almost $85 million in the ATTDS in the 2017 and 2018 Fiscal Year defense budgets alone. As already noted, there is certainly a continuing need for improved anti-torpedo defenses that only looks set to grow in urgency the coming years, as well. Whether ATTDS, or a revamped version of the system, ultimately provides the capability or not, the Navy’s expensive carriers and other major surface ships are still in desperate need of a more robust array of defenses against enemy submarines.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 4, 2020",A Navy P-8 Poseidon Jet Has Been Flying Mysterious Circles Over Los Angeles For Hours (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft launched out of Long Beach Airport this evening and set up shop in some of the busiest airspace in the United States—20,000 feet over Downtown Los Angeles. The P-8 has flown continuous circles roughly 15 miles in diameter for three hours now over the Southern California metropolis. Our friend and master airplane tracker @aircraftspots first posted about the peculiar flight. The militarized 737 derivative, callsign TIGER14, took off from Long Beach Airport just before 6pm local time and is still tracing the same precise orbit around downtown Los Angeles. The P-8 is primarily known for its anti-submarine, anti-surface warfare, and sea control roles, but the reality is that it’s cutting edge mission systems are capable of quite a bit more than that. The aircraft is equipped with electronic surveillance systems capable of classifying and geolocating enemy emissions, such as those from air defense systems and enemy communications nodes. It can also intercept communications and work as a communications relay. In addition, the P-8 is equipped with a very powerful Wescam MX-20HD electro-optical turret that is capable of capturing high definition moving video of surface targets far below its flightpath and it can stream that video to users around the globe if need be. This is all in addition to its traditional maritime patrol systems as the P-8 was built to replace the venerable turboprop-powered P-3 Orion . You can read all about what it’s like to fly the P-8 on real-world missions in this past feature of ours. P-8A and P-3C over NAS Pax River. , USN Other capabilities can be fitted to the P-8 for special missions, including the incredibly capable Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS), also known as the Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS), that is bolted on to the lower forward fuselage of the aircraft. You can read all about this system here . Other modular surveillance payloads remain undisclosed, but an advanced communications intelligence system has been spotted bolted below the aircraft’s chin. But thanks to a local aviation photographer who captured the P-8 departing Long Beach on its mission, we know none of these systems are installed on the aircraft in question. Making things even odder, the weather in the area is somewhat dismal right now, so it’s not like conditions are ideal for certain types of surveillance missions. Even the airport the P-8 launched out of is odd. Why would it use Long Beach instead of Naval Air Station Point Mugu to the north or Naval Air Station North Island to the south? So the big question is, what is this aircraft, which is most at home operating over water, doing making precise circles at 20,000 feet over Los Angeles? We have seen other, far more shadowy military aircraft execute similar missions, but not the P-8. The truth is that there is no way to say for sure at this time, but it is likely training to support operations in dense urban areas. This is where the Pentagon sees wars being fought in the future and special operations forces, in particular, have to train in real cities to get critical experience on the challenges they will face when fighting in such a complex environment. This often results in everything from high interest and to panic from the uninformed inhabitants of the area. You can read all about this training, and the stir among the public it usually causes, in this past article of ours. There has been a large special operations exercise ongoing throughout Southern California with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , more widely known as the Night Stalkers, descending on the area with their tricked-out helicopters . This P-8 could be providing overwatch, communications relay, and electronic surveillance duties for training occurring in the metropolis below. It’s also possible that the P-8 is executing a training or test flight on its own, but that does seem far less plausible as we really haven’t seen this type of aircraft execute similar missions in the past. We will reach out to the Navy tomorrow to see if they have any comment, but for now, the reason behind this odd flight remains a mystery. UPDATE: 10:30pm PST— Just as we thought, this mission was in direct support of an ongoing special operations exercise in Southern California dubbed Emerald Warrior/Emerald Trident. Below is the official release, that was released either moments before or shortly after the helicopter raiding exercises in the downtown area began. This is all too regular a custom when 160th SOAR is in town for urban warfare training. Official Statement. Video of the helicopters in action is already hitting the web. Here we see a standard quartet of MH-6 Little Birds that is followed by a lone MH-60 . These aircraft will be landing on ledges of high rises throughout the city and dropping off and picking up special operators.

He is a household name for breaking mankind into the realm of supersonic flight, but his career is so dense with accomplishment and adventure it’s hard to imagine it can actually be true. His biography Yeager reads something like a mix between The Right Stuff and Forest Gump. It’s one of the best military books you will ever read, but this exceptionally high-quality interview, shot in 1991, is a nearly essential companion to it. In it, Yeager conveys some of his most harrowing cockpit experiences in a way only he can, as well as everything from his thoughts on the future of air combat to the space program. It may have a one hour and 35 minute runtime, but you will be left wanting more. One of its best parts is when Yeager recounts his crazy ejection from an NF-104A on December 10th, 1963 , one he barely survived. This is a major part of Yeager’s memoir, but hearing him describe it in person and in detail is even more chilling than reading it. That section begins just after the 28 minute mark: https://youtube.com/watch?v=L7-N_5JcvdE Beyond his recollections about his amazing career, the video is chock-full with wonderful commentary that still holds up nearly 30 years later, in many cases. This includes discussion on stealth technology, unmanned combat, advanced flight control systems, cockpit automation, smart weapons and even some commentary on the Advanced Tactical Fighter program that was all the rage at the time and eventually gave birth to the F-22A we know today. But maybe the best part is at the one hour and 33 minute mark, when General Yeager gives a little insight about life and doing what you love. I think the wisdom he conveys is especially important in this day and age. As for General Yeager today, he is still going strong at 95! He just made an appearance at an airshow in West Virginia to celebrate the 71st anniversary of conquering the sound barrier, which obviously blew people’s minds: If you haven’t, make sure to order Yeager’s biography , it is a must-have for any history, aerospace, or military aficionado.

The story does not say what MLD stands for and does not mention the Myasishchev M-55 Geophysica research plane, also known by the NATO reporting name Mystic-B, by name, though the infographic clearly depicts it as the mothership. The International Scientific Optical Network (ISON), which the Russian Academy of Sciences manages through the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics, is reportedly leading the development of the MLD, on behalf of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos . RIA Novosti did not say what the specific mission or missions for the spacecraft might be or why ISON, which is responsible at present for around 30 terrestrial telescopes at 20 observatories in 10 countries, was in charge of the project. The MLD concept art shows a rocket-like central fuselage with a delta wing configuration. There are two vertical stabilizers pointing up from the edge of each wingtip. The spacecraft is supposed to be reusable, according to RIA Novosti , but there is no obvious internal payload bay for releasing objects into orbit. A cutaway artist’s conception of the MLD reusable spacecraft., ISON The spacecraft will use old Russian-made components, including the same 14D30 rocket booster found in the upper stage of a Briz-M space launch vehicle as its primary means of propulsion, Yuri Bakhvalov, ISON’s director, told RIA Novosti . Based on the dimensions of the Briz-M , the MLD is a diminutive craft that is significantly smaller than the U.S. Air Force’s secretive X-37B unmanned space shuttle and is downright tiny compared to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) in-development XS-1 reusable spacecraft . The infographic shows that the mothership will be based on the M-55 and carry the spacecraft on top of its fuselage. This aircraft would carry it to an appropriate altitude, possibly between 80,000 and 100,000 feet based on other known two-stage-to-orbit concepts . The Geophysica’s normal service ceiling is 70,500 feet. Once there, the MLD’s rocket motor would fire and it could either travel at hypersonic speeds of around Mach 7 in the upper atmosphere at altitudes of more than 500,000 feet or actually fly into space and enter a shallow, rapidly degrading orbit, according to RIA Novosti . At the conclusion of its flight, the MLD would re-enter the atmosphere if it had gone into space or otherwise begin gliding closer to the ground. At a certain altitude, it would deploy parachutes and drift the rest of the way down to the ground where personnel could recover the unmanned spacecraft. ISON claims the design would be reusable for up to 50 flights. An infographic showing the proposed flight profile for the two-stage-to-orbit system consisting of a modified M-55 mothership and the MLD spacecraft., ISON There is no information on what modifications this 1980s aircraft might need to perform this mission. A mothership configuration with smaller craft mounted on top of the fuselage is notoriously complex and potentially dangerous , with a significant risk that the vehicle on top will crash into the launching aircraft, destroying them both. The small size of the MLD could help mitigate any potential hazards. It’s also not clear whether the plan might call for restarting production of the Geophysica or another similar aircraft. Myasishchev only ever built five of these slender-wing, twin-boom aircraft, including a two-seat M-55UTS trainer version. Since the end of the Cold War, the Russian Air Force has used these planes officially for high-altitude research purposes, including flights over the Arctic and Antarctic regions . The M-55 is roughly analogous in its basic mission to NASA’s ER-2 and WB-57F aircraft, which are derived from the U-2 and RB-57F high-altitude spy planes, respectively. A Myasishchev M-55 Geophysica., Leonid Faerberg via Wikimedia Though we don’t know what ISON’s or Roscomos’ plans are for the MLD, the two-stage-to-orbit concept, in general, has a number of broad benefits . This includes providing a more flexible launch option compared to traditional space launch rockets and without the associated costs to maintain launch sites and related infrastructure. The modified M-55 could have the range to rapidly reposition to new locations or simply launch the spacecraft well away from where it took off, offering even more flexibility. But the size of the MLD suggests it will have a very limited payload capacity and may not be capable of reaching high enough altitudes to place even small satellites in a stable orbit. This could still be valuable for scientific research and perhaps offer a way to readily flight test materials and other systems related to the development of or hypersonic vehicles. American space-launch firm Generation Orbit is offering a similar service to the U.S. government and other customers using its GO-1 air-launched hypersonic vehicle . The MLD may also be capable of short-notice, short-duration orbital or suborbital intelligence gathering missions either with a releasable payload or with sensors fixed in place on the spacecraft. The ability to launch the MLD in an unpredictable manner over denied areas could make this attractive for the Russians, who still lack a robust spy satellite capability. But it seems unlikely that the MLD would be able to provide anywhere near the same kind of space-access capability as the larger X-37B or the even bigger future XS-1. For the U.S. government, these sorts of rapid, flexible space launch concepts are increasingly attractive given ever-emerging threats to its critical space-based assets. Russia , as well as China, are developing and fielding increasingly capable anti-satellite weapons, including terrestrial and air-launched interceptors and potential dual-use “ killer satellites ,” which you can read about more here . Russia’s MLD may even be capable of acting as another anti-satellite system, physically smashing into an opponent’s objects in space or otherwise carrying payloads to blind, jam, or destroy those targets. It could also simply serve a stepping stone to larger and more capable reusable spacecraft that could actually perform a wider array of missions or expand Russia’s already significant presence in the international commercial space launch market . This is also not the first time a Russian firm has proposed using the M-55 as a space launch platform, either. In the late 2000s, Myasishchev pitched an updated M-55, known as the M-55X, paired with a much more ambitious manned, reusable spacecraft, known as the Cosmopolis XXI , or C-21. As with the MLD, the M-55X would carry the C-21 up into the stratosphere, at which point it would rocket into space. The C-21 was officially described as a space tourism vehicle, similar in general concept to Scaled Composites’ SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo and bearing something of a general outward resemblance to Soviet spaceplane concepts, such as the BOR-4 and MiG-105 . NASA also tested similarly shaped “ lifting bodies ” and the Sierra Nevada Corporation is now in the process of developing their own spacecraft, known as Dreamchaser , which has a broadly similar planform. Virginia-based Space Adventures subsequently took over the development of the C-21, eventually renaming the vehicle Explorer, in cooperation with Myasishchev and Roscosmos. This same company is known for offering trips to the International Space Station (ISS). There is no indication that a real prototype of the C-21/Explorer spacecraft ever got built and the only related pictures show what are clearly full-scale models, not air- or space-worthy craft. In 2010, Space Adventures abandoned its plans for Explorer completely, citing growing costs . A Russian firm called BestRussianTour.com is still promoting the M-55X/Explorer as a space tourism option that “is almost ready.” Still, the MLD and its M-55 mothership could leverage some of this past experience with the C-21/Explorer. A low-quality image of a mockup of the C-21/Explorer spacecraft being hoisted on top of an M-55 sometime prior to 2010., Space Adventures An artist’s conception of an M-55 carrying the C-21/Explorer., via BestRussianTour.com ISON has reportedly received 25 million Rubles – around $381,250 at the time of writing – in funding from the Proekt-Technika corporation for the MLD’s development, as well as another 35 million Rubles – some $533,750 – from the Skolkovo Foundation . Founded in 2010, the Skolkovo Foundation is a Russian government-funded non-profit and technology incubator with its main site being the Skolkovo Innovation Center in Moscow. Proekt-Technika is a major Russian manufacturing concern and supplier to Russia’s Ministry of Defense. It is particularly notable in this case because individuals who had worked on the Buran Soviet space shuttle program founded the company in 1990. ISON says it needs at least another 280 million Rubles, or $4.27 million, to complete the second stage of development work, and expects that money to come from a combination of outside investors and Skolkovo grants. It’s not clear if this includes funds required for the adaptation of the M-55-based mothership. ISON has five MLD flight tests planned for 2023, according to RIA Novosti . It will certainly be interesting to see if this new system comes to fruition and how the Russians ultimately decide to employ it.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 22, 2018","F-15X Will Come In Two Variants, And No, It Won’t Cost $100M Per Copy","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Since breaking the F-15X story last July, pretty much everything our original exposé discussed has come true. After many discounted that original report, last December Bloomberg reported that the F-15X would indeed appear as a procurement program of record for the Pentagon’s 2020 budget proposal, which is due to be released at any time. Comments by heads of the USAF and industry have since confirmed this eventuality. Still, that report was thin on details, leading to quite a bit of confusion about what would be included in the USAF’s initial investment into the F-15X and what was exactly planned for the program overall. With that in mind, we have new details that answer some of these questions and paint a finer picture of what the F-15X will look like when it rolls off the production line, in one of two distinct forms, as well as what the new Eagle variant will mean for the United States Air Force. Editor’s note: Please read our original feature on the F-15X to understand its genesis, capabilities, and purpose, as well as this update to get up to speed on the concept if you have not already. First off, we still haven’t seen the final draft of the Pentagon’s proposed 2020 budget. Things can change, but many of the details we are about to unveil aren’t dependent on the exact dollar figure the Air Force sets aside for F-15X. Also, I can’t stress enough that, just as I originally discussed in detail, the F-15X is not a Boeing ploy to disrupt the F-35A program. The USAF’s top uniformed officer and the CEO of Lockheed have both confirmed this as fact, echoing exactly what I wrote last summer. Many media outlets will continue to blindly pit the two programs against one another as if it is a competition, but it’s not. The USAF’s target inventory goals for the F-35 will be unaffected by the limited scope of the F-15X initiative. Once again, don’t take my word for this, take it from Lockheed’s own CEO, Marillyn Hewson, who said the following during an earnings call last week: “If they choose to have an order of the F-15, it won’t be at the expense of F-35 quantities… I’m hearing that directly from leadership in the Pentagon, and I think that’s an important point for me to make. It’s not just our suspicion, but I’ve been told that directly.” The Air Force’s Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein, offered more detail and further underscored this reality in statements made to Defense News’s Jeff Martin: …Goldfein said Saturday that the decision to possibly refresh the F-15 fleet comes down to the need for more fighters in service, regardless of generation. “They complement each other,” he said. “They each make each other better.” When asked if that meant compromising for quantity over quality, he said that would not be the case. “We’ve got to refresh the F-15C fleet because I can’t afford to not have that capacity to do the job and the missions.” Goldfein explained. “That’s what this is all about. If we’re refreshing the F-15C fleet, as we’re building up the F-35 fleet, this is not about any kind of a trade.” He added that Air Force needs to buy 72 fighters a year to get to the amount they need in the future — and to drive average aircraft age down from 28 years to 15 years. And while Goldfein might want all 72 to be fifth generation F-35s, budgetary concerns likely won’t let that happen. “If we had the money, those would be 72 F-35s. But we’ve gotta look at this from a cost/business case.” he explained. “An F-15 will never be an F-35. Never. But I need capacity.” So, buying a few F-15Xs now to begin recapping the F-15C/D fleet , the youngest of which is now well over three decades old, will have no impact on the future F-35A force structure. The idea that advanced Eagles complement F-35s, and vice versa, isn’t just held by some in the top rungs of the USAF, either. Capt. Andrew “Dojo” Olson, F-35 Heritage Flight Team pilot and commander poses for a photo with Gen. David Goldfein, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and Marillyn Hewson, chief executive officer of Lockheed Martin July 13, 2018 during the annual Royal International Air Tattoo at Royal Air Force Fairford, England. RIAT 2018. Both leaders have made statements that should dispell the impression that the F-15X will compete for funds with the F-35A. , DoD With that out of the way, let’s talk about numbers. The December report from Bloomberg said there would be $1.2B set aside in the 2020 defense budget proposal to procure a dozen F-15X aircraft. This led many to believe the price of each F-15X would be $100M. This is more than the unit cost of an F-35A, which is slated to hit $80M apiece in the not so distant future. According to sources close to the discussions, this is flat out incorrect. The money being set aside in 2020, possibly around $1.1B, will include an initial order for F-15Xs—likely eight aircraft—with the rest of the money being spent on non-recurring costs, including setting up and managing the program and to pay for a relatively tiny amount of development work needed to bring the aircraft’s systems and software in line with the USAF’s exact specifications. Keep in mind that this relatively minuscule developmental cost is only possible because other countries have spent roughly $5B over the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15 into what it is today . So basically, the USAF is getting this for free. In contrast, bringing an all-new fighter into existence costs tens of billions of dollars in development work that spans decades. The big question then is how much will these jets cost? Our sources familiar with the discussions say they will cost “less than an F-35 is ever forecast to cost, best case,” let alone what it is priced at now. This indicates that Boeing is going to cut the USAF one hell of a deal on these jets, which will help keep the F-15 production line open and Boeing’s historic St. Louis plant building fighters well into the latter half of the next decade. This assessment is based on the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation’s (CAPE) numbers, not just some blue sky pitch from Boeing. These numbers are not projected from hypothetical notions or the dreams of consistently large buys materializing down the line, they take into account hard data from aircraft already being rolled off the production line and flying around the globe. This is the same for the F-15X’s projected cost per flight hour that will be spread across the airframe’s whopping 20,000-hour design life. For reference, most tactical fighters have a design life of around 8,000 hours . F-15 Advanced, pictured here, has close ties to the F-15X concept being offered to the USAF, Boeing In addition, the F-15X was offered by Boeing to the USAF under a firm, fixed-price contract terms. In other words, if the USAF executes the offer, and the aircraft cost more than what is estimated, Boeing eats that cost directly, just as it has with the KC-46 tanker . There is nearly zero financial risk to the USAF. What it agrees to spend on procuring the capability is exactly what the bill will look like in the end, unless the two parties decide otherwise. Boeing has been especially aggressive with its bidding on aircraft programs using similar constructs as of late, snapping up the UH-1N replacement contract, MQ-25 carrier-based tanker drone tender, and the opportunity to build the USAF’s next jet trainer. Maybe what’s more important, is that the F-15X is being designed specifically to slot directly into the USAF’s deeply established F-15 infrastructure, even down to seamless pilot conversion. Our sources say it will only take one or two flights per F-15C pilot to convert to the F-15X for the air superiority mission, saving millions on retraining aircrews, not to mention ground crews, that are already intimately familiar with the Eagle. But there are other factors as well. Some information about the proposed F-15 Advanced. The F-15X will have near identical features but will be offered in single and two seat configurations. , Boeing Converting a fighter unit to any new airframe costs a lot of money. The unit cost is just the ‘cover charge’ compared to what it costs to bed-down and sustain the type over its service life at multiple locales around the globe. New infrastructure has to be built or old infrastructure adapted, and this is especially costly when introducing stealthy 5th generation fighters. Support systems, tools, and parts needed to keep the jet in the air also have to be purchased, which quickly adds up. And above all else, the unit has to be relegated to a reduced or unavailable readiness status during much of the long conversion process, which can last years. All this results in something of a logistical nightmare, especially when you take into account the fact that the USAF’s tactical jet inventory is a shadow of what it was just a decade ago, all the while demand for its capabilities have jumped dramatically. Also, the majority of the F-15C/D units that would get F-15X have to provide multiple aircraft and crews at all times to the critical homeland defense alert mission . But none of these capacity issues will happen if F-15C/D units convert over to the F-15X. As the new airframes are added, a unit’s readiness should actually go up substantially along with overall their warfighting capability. Even if the USAF could buy 100s of F-35s a year, they simply couldn’t convert squadrons fast enough while maintaining any sort of a minimum combat capacity. In other words, production levels are only one part of the story, the ability for squadrons to absorb those aircraft is another. By buying a lot of F-35s each year and some F-15Xs, this issue is mitigated to some degree as the USAF can get new fighters into the fight without having to tank its overall readiness, which isn’t in a good place as it is. In fact, in many ways, the F-15X actually takes a lot of pressure off the F-35 as it continues to teethe its way into a position as America’s predominate front-line fighter capability. All this is largely validated by General Goldfein’s comments about capacity and the realities he is facing with his current fighter inventory force structure and the demands being placed on it, both operationally and fiscally. This all comes at a time when the USAF is also chasing its new and highly ambitious 386 squadron goal. Air Force Magazine recently inquired to Air Force Undersecretary Matt Donovan about the F-15X. Although he wouldn’t address the initiative directly, he did paint a picture of the logic behind it: “History being what it is, and because we never quite got to the procurement ramp we needed to” on the F-35, “we’re in a bit of a pickle,” Donovan said. “We don’t have the capacity we need” in the fighter force. Donovan’s speech to the AFA audience focused heavily on the need to increase the size of the Air Force to 386 combat squadrons in order to fulfill the National Defense Strategy of engaging China and Russia in Great Power Competition. He noted that, under original plans, USAF expected to have 736 F-35s by now, but “we have 174, … so … we need to increase our fighter procurement, replacement rate.” Every F-15C/D left in the USAF’s inventory is at least 33 years old, yet even these jets have availability rates that are markedly higher than what’s found in the F-35 community. , USAF As for how many jets would be procured under an F-15X initiative, our sources close to the discussions say between 150 to 250 aircraft depending on what the USAF wants to do with its overall force structure. The most likely number is roughly 230 airframes to replace the F-15C/D force one a one-for-one basis. Procurement would likely start with eight aircraft, which could be delivered very soon, with roughly 18 to 24 procured each year after that. Oh, and there are two variants of the F-15X that are being offered by Boeing and will likely be procured. One is dubbed the F-15CX and the other is known as the F-15EX. The F-15CX will be a single-seat configuration, while the F-15EX will be a two-seater with a fully missionized rear cockpit complete with a wide-area flat panel display , helmet-mounted display , and full flight controls. The F-15EX will cost a couple million dollars more than its single seat stablemate, but they will roll of the St. Louis production line right alongside one another. Boeing The F-15EX can be used for training or for actual missions where having two crew would be beneficial. As discussed in great detail in my original F-15X feature , an F-15X could serve as a unique platform for various missions in the future beyond the currently established mission set serviced by the F-15C/D community. These include acting as a flying weapons truck and carrying outsized weapons, including hypersonic cruise missiles and very-long-range air-to-air missiles , to controlling flocks of stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles , to acting as a network relay between 5th generation and 4th generation fighters, as well as other assets in the battlespace. With this in mind, having a second crew station that can accommodate many operational contingencies in the future is likely to be highly attractive. Still, this doesn’t mean that F-15X users will hop into complex air-to-ground and other mission sets when the aircraft are delivered. The jets will be used primarily as an air-to-air weapon system just like the aircraft it replaces, the F-15C/D. But, according to our sources, adding GPS guided air-to-ground munitions, just like what was done in the similarly air-to-air focused F-22 Raptor community, would give the F-15X added versatility at virtually no cost and without detracting heavily from training for the counter-air mission. The weapons configuration options for the F-15 Advanced, a concept with close commonality with the proposed F-15X. Amber launch racks could further increase air-to-air missile carriage capabilities. , Boeing Even using the F-15X to fire advanced High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles to quickly knock down enemy emitters that threaten it and the aircraft it protects could also be done without significantly dulling-down the F-15C/D community’s air superiority focused role. The bottom line is that the jet will be delivered capable of virtually every fighter role imaginable, but training and fighting doctrine will dictate its actual use. The F-15X will have a gross weight of 81,000lbs and will be powered by either General Electric F110-GE-129 or Pratt and Whitney F100-PW-229 turbofan engines, both of which are in the 29,000lb thrust class. Some configuration and range information with for the F-15 Advanced, a concept that shares close commonality with the proposed F-15X., Boeing One of the biggest issues some seem to have with F-15X is that the USAF’s decision to procure it was not based on some type of open fighter competition. But as our sources close to the discussions note, the USAF isn’t buying some new fighter to fulfill a new role. It is replacing tired F-15C/Ds that will require tens of millions of dollars in enhancements to stay flyable and tactically viable in the decades to come with new-build F-15s that are just about as off the shelf as one can imagine. It’s akin to the USAF directly replacing F-16A/Bs with F-16C/Ds. Still, the flying service’s seemingly bold decision to face the damning fleet issues it is facing and look outside the F-35 procurement box for tactical jet solutions is bound to be met with controversy. Also, keep in mind that the USAF’s F-15X wishes have to make it through the beltway intact to become a reality, and that’s if they do emerge as expected in the fiscal year 2020 defense budget. As always, there is also another side to the story, one that is worth discussing in greater detail. Now that we have more information about the F-15X in hand, we will look deeper into alternatives to it and address the question of if procuring it is really a good route for the USAF to take at this time. Keep an eye out, we should have this follow-up piece published soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 15, 2019",Navy’s Sea Hunter Drone Ship Has Sailed Autonomously To Hawaii And Back Amid Talk Of New Roles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Sea Hunter unmanned surface vessel has become the first ship of any description to ever sail from San Diego, California to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and back without the need of a crew for navigation and steering. It’s a significant milestone for this particular vessel and its future cousins, which the service has primarily been developing as anti-submarine warfare platforms , but could also provide electronic warfare support and acting as decoys to help shield friendly forces. Defense contractor Leidos, which is leading the Sea Hunter project for the Navy, announced the achievement in a press release on Jan. 31, 2019 . The notice did not say when the trimaran craft, formally known as the Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV), had left from or returned to San Diego, a round trip of more than 5,200 miles. Previous reports noted that the vessel had first arrived at Pearl Harbor on Oct. 31, 2018. “The Sea Hunter program is leading the world in unmanned, fully autonomous naval ship design and production,” Gerry Fasano, Leidos Defense Group President, said in the press release . “The recent long-range mission is the first of its kind and demonstrates to the U.S. Navy that autonomy technology is ready to move from the developmental and experimental stages to advanced mission testing.” The MDUSV did have a manned escort throughout the voyages. Personnel did board Sea Hunter at times to check the ship’s electronics and propulsion system, but Leidos did not say whether or not any repairs were necessary during any of the transits. Sea Hunter in Hawaii in October 2018., USN In 2016 , Oregon Iron Works, now called Vigor Works , built Sea Hunter for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which initially called it the Anti-submarine warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV). In January 2018 , DARPA turned the vessel over to the Office of Naval Research. Leidos originally built the navigation system for the vessel, but has now taken over responsibility for the entire program. The Virginia-headquartered firm is now on contract to build a second MDUSV, known tentatively as Sea Hunter II. The Navy is still developing its plans for how might employ these unmanned vessels in the future. In an interview with Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the annual Surface Navy Association’s main annual conference in January 2019, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Neagley, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Unmanned & Small Combatants, offered some new details about the roles and missions for the future MDUSVs. “Part of the value of having unmanned surface vehicles is you can get capacity at a lower cost,” he explained to Breaking Defense . As it stands now, the Navy is primarily looking to use the Sea Hunters, or similarly sized unmanned vessels, as scouts and decoys, packed with sensors and electronic warfare systems as part of a concept the service is calling “Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare.” Sea Hunter prior to its formal transfer from DARPA to the Navy., DARPA A group of MDUSVs, networked together with each other and manned ship, and operating autonomously, could cover a much broader area looking for all sorts of potential threats, including enemy surface ships and submarines , mines , or shore-based defenses . The unmanned vessels could use electronic warfare systems to blind enemy radars and other sensors or employ electronic support measures to geolocate and classify those targets, helping commanders get a better sense of an opponent’s “electronic order of battle.” This, in turn, would provide important situational awareness and give manned ships additional options to avoid threats or launch strikes from the most optimum direction. A screen of Sea Hunters could make it more difficult for hostile submarines or other pop-up threats to get the drop on high-value vessels, such as aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships . MDUSVs would also be to act as decoys, generating electronic signals similar to larger ships and giving the appearance of a large, distributed attack, confusing an enemy or otherwise forcing them to spread their forces thin across a wide area. All of this could be particularly valuable in the open expanses of the Pacific region . All of these concepts of operation benefit from Sea Hunter’s range and endurance capabilities, as well as plans for it to be able to operate completely autonomously. That the ship was able to navigate from California, out into the Eastern Pacific, and safely make it to Hawaii, as well as perform the return trip, all point to the increasing maturity of the vessel and its critical systems. Those same attributes mean that Sea Hunter, or follow-on designs, will remain capable of wide-area, persistent missions more independent of manned ships, as well. DARPA has originally explored using the unmanned ships for anti-submarine and mine-sweeping missions. In the anti-submarine role, Sea Hunter and its future cousins would offer cost-effective options for monitoring submarine activity across a wide area and be able to persistently track those threats. With that information, commanders would have better situational awareness and could then direct manned aircraft or surface vessels to engage those targets or look to avoid them altogether during a crisis. The unmanned vessels would provide a valuable, lower-risk alternative for mine-hunting and clearing operations. The smaller MDUSVs would have the ability to more readily maneuver, especially in narrow waterways , to find and neutralize underwater hazards and do so without putting sailors at risk. Sea Hunters, or similar unmanned ships in this size class, might eventually take on other roles, too. You can read more in detail about how the MDUSVs might operate in the future, here . The Navy is also developing requirements for even larger unmanned surface vessels, which will leverage the lessons learned from Sea Hunter, but will be able to take on another new set of missions. So far, the service is primarily envisioning these Large Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessels (LDUSV) as “arsenal ships,” linked together with various manned and unmanned platforms through the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) network concept. Other ships, including the Navy’s future guided missile frigate, or FFG(X) , as well as manned and unmanned aircraft , could provide targeting information for those crewless arsenal ships. As such, they may not even need to carry their own sensors, allowing for more space to be devoted to stand-off weapons. When it comes to Sea Hunter, more specifically, it “is a ship that you just sit down over the horizon and it might be able to do an awful lot of things that you don’t want a manned platform to do, especially in an area where there’s a lot of anti-access, area-denial threats,” then-Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work said in 2016 at the vessel’s christening ceremony. “The U.S. military has talked about the strategic importance of replacing ‘king’ and ‘queen’ pieces on the maritime chessboard with lots of ‘pawns,’ and [this] is a first step toward doing exactly that.” Medium, as well as large unmanned surface vessels,  are also becoming increasingly important to the Navy’s future plans to increase the total number of hulls available for combat missions. Sea Hunters and other future designs could potentially provide a cost-effective way for the service to finally reach its long-held goal of a surface force with 355 ships . But whatever roles unmanned surface vessels, takes on in the end, Sea Hunter’s recent long-distance trips are significant achievements and are major steps for the Navy toward adding larger and more capable unmanned vessels into routine operations.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Women’s History Month may be March, but January 2019 proved to be particularly significant for U.S. military female aviators. This week, the U.S. Air Force announced that Captain Zoe “SiS” Kotnik had become the service’s first-ever single-ship aerial demonstration pilot. Just days earlier, retired U.S. Navy Captain Rosemary Mariner, who had numerous ground-breaking achievements in her 24-year career, sadly passed on after a battle with ovarian cancer. Now, a group of female naval aviators is preparing to fly a “ missing woman ” formation for her memorial service tomorrow. U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, the service’s main warfighting command, certified Captain Kotnik as the commander of the F-16 Viper Demonstration Team , or VPT, on Jan. 29, 2019. In that position, She will also be the team’s lone F-16 display pilot for 2019, flying at various air shows across the United States and Canada. Leading the small VPT, which includes eight other personnel to support the performances, is a major honor and accomplishment for any pilot. Kotnik now holds the additional distinction of being the first woman to ever lead any of the Air Force’s demonstration teams . US Air Force Captain Zoe “SiS” Kotnik gives a “ shaka ” to two other members of the F-16 Viper Demonstration Team during a practice mission., USAF “What I’m looking forward to most is the potential to have an influence on younger generations,” Kotnik, who graduated from the Air Force Academy in 2011, said in an official statement . “I know firsthand how impactful airshows can be and what a difference it makes to young people to see just one example of what they too can do and who they can become. I hope to be a source of inspiration and motivation they can draw from to apply in their own lives.” Kotnik had to go through four certifications in total before receiving the final approval from General Holmes to lead the team. This process included a variety of specialized training flights, including sorties in the backseat while another pilot demonstrated the various aerobatic maneuvers, as well as 30 practice performances. The VPT’s routine is very different from the kind of flying Kotnik has been doing for the past eight years, most recently with the 55th Fighter Squadron at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina, but she already has some experience with aerial performances, having participated in the flyover of the nation’s capital for President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2017. She also has deep ties to air shows and aerobatics. Her uncle is noted air show performer Charlie Hillard , the first American to ever win a world aerobatics title. Kotnik says that it was her experiences with him, as well as with her mother who was a private pilot, and at airshows that pushed her to join the Air Force, according to an interview with LiveAirShowTV , which you can watch in full below. “There’s a larger community of female fighter pilots nowadays and it’s awesome. It’s a community within itself basically ,” then-U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Kotnik said in an earlier interview in 2017. “It’s awesome because you have someone who set the precedent and someone that I can follow in their footsteps and ask questions and learn from them. So, I feel very fortunate that there have been several [female fighter pilots] before me.” In that case, Kotnik was speaking about trailblazing women in the Air Force, and the preceding U.S. Army Air Forces, specifically. This includes Jacqueline Cochran and Nancy Love , who were foundational members of the World War II-era Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC) and Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), as well as the Air Force’s first female fighter pilot, Brigadier General Jeannie Leavitt, who is presently the head of the Air Force Recruiting Service. On Feb. 1, 2019, the AFRS, under Leavitt’s command, gathered 80 female pilots together for a day at Edwards Air Force Base in California, one of the Air Force’s premier research and development facilities, to share their stories about serving. It seems likely we’ll be hearing more about their experiences specifically as we get closer to Women’s History Month. View this post on Instagram A post shared by U.S. Air Force Recruiting (@usaf_recruiting) But January 2019 offered another, more somber opportunity to reflect on the trailblazing careers of female aviators across U.S. military, in general. Retired U.S. Navy Captain Rosemary Mariner, who passed away on Jan. 24, 2019, had been one the first eight female pilots in her service to fly jets, beginning with the A-4C Skyhawk in 1974 and then moving on to the A-7E Corsair II , according to her obituary . She was eventually sent to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Five (VX-5), the Vampires, at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake . In 1982, the Navy assigned Mariner to the aircraft carrier USS Lexington as a surface warfare officer. “In modern warfare, the emphasis is not on physical strength, but on brain power operating sophisticated weapons systems,” she said in an interview with Glamour magazine that year. “A machine gun is a great equalizer.” Then, in 1990, she became the first woman in the U.S. military to command a military aviation squadron when she became the commander of he Flashbacks of Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron Three Four ( VAQ-34 ). This unit, based at the Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, California, first flew a mix of ERA-3B and EA-7L aircraft, before transitioning to the F/A-18A Hornet . Its primary mission was to simulate various electronic warfare and missile threats against Navy warships during fleet exercises. Then-US Navy Commander Rosemary Mariner in the cockpit of one of VAQ-34’s EA-7Ls., USN Mariner went on to serve on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and her final assignment was at the Chairman of the Joint Chief’s Chair in Military Strategy at the National War College in Washington, D.C. She retired in 1997, after which she continued her academic career and remained an advocate for the further integration of women into the U.S. military, working as a policy advisor on those issues for the Navy, as well as news outlets such as ABC News and PBS . Mariner is set to be laid to rest at New Loyston Cemetery in Maynardville, Tennessee on Feb. 2, 2019. Nine female aviators have since volunteered to fly a “ missing woman ” formation with one F/A-18E and four F/A-18F Super Hornets from Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, some 400 miles away. “We’re fortunate to be chosen,” U.S. Navy Commander Leslie “Meat” Mintz, the executive officer of Strike Fighter Squadron Two One Three ( VFA-213 ), said in an interview with Military.com . “It’s certainly the first time I’ve done this for a female aviator. Everyone is truly humbled to be a part of it.” The other naval aviators taking part in the flight are Commander Stacy Uttecht, head of VFA-32 , Lieutenant Commander Paige Blok, also from VFA-32, Lieutenant Commander Danielle Thiriot of VFA-106 , Lieutenant Commander, presently assigned to NAS Oceana, Lieutenant. Christy Talisse of VFA-211 , Lieutenant Amanda Lee of VFA-81 , Lieutenant Kelly Harris, VFA-213, and Lieutenant Emily Rixey of the Strike Fighter Weapons School Atlantic . The nine women who will fly the “missing woman” formation as retired US Navy Captain Rosemary Mariner is laid to rest on Feb. 2, 2019., USN “It’s truly an honor to do this … for Capt. Mariner,” Mintz told Military.com. “I’ve been in this business for 19 years. I really haven’t thought about male versus female gender issues because it’s strictly merit-based. ‘Can you fly? Can you  perform?’ [but] really I owe that to her.” We here at The War Zone wish Captain Kotnik the best of luck as head of the VPT and say fair skies and tailwinds to Captain Mariner.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Dutch aviation photographer Roelof-Jan Gort recently posted photos on social media from his visit to RAF Fairford where he got a close-up look at B-1Bs operating from there in support of exercise Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 2018. Some of the photos show the crew inside a B-1B cockpit as they prepare for a mission. What’s unique about the photos is the standard gray cladding that usually encases the interior of the B-1’s cockpit aren’t there. In their place are red ones the likes of which I have never seen before. The motif definitely gives the ‘Bone’s’ cabin a sci-feel, looking more like a personal transport for a Star Wars villain than something you would find on a monochromatic USAF flight line. This B-1B clearly received the latest avionics upgrade that gives its crew a partial ‘glass’ cockpit, better connectivity, and a slew of other enhancements. Could this be some sort of a new standard feature? But why? Doing it one off seemed somewhat unlikely concerning the strict rules surrounding colored modifications to aircraft in the USAF and just how clean it looks in the photos. Roelof-Jan Gort/DutchAviationPhoto.com In an attempt to solve the mystery, I reached out to a source with many years of experience in the B-1B community. The source conveyed to me that it appears as if the crew chief of this B-1B went all out ‘decorating’ their jet and that minor interior modifications are allowed as long as they don’t distract from the mission or functionality of the aircraft. Some unique paint, stickers, slogans, and creative grip tape arrangements can be found on various airframes. Still, this is one heck of an extensive and detailed job and looks as if it came from the factory in the photographs, which is a testament to the those who spent the time creating and installing it. Roelof-Jan Gort/DutchAviationPhoto.com The 34th Bomb Squadron from Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota—also known by their nickname, the Thunderbirds—is who this jet belongs to. The unit has one of the richest histories of any squadron in the USAF. Its founding dates back to 1917 and it was directly involved in the Doolittle Raid on Japan in retaliation to the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor . The unit’s crest and tail-band are predominately deep red in color, so bringing those tones into the cockpit would definitely be a cool manifestation of the squadron’s esprit de corps. The red definitely makes more sense when you look at the historic squadron’s colors. , www.aviatorgear.com (patches)/USAF (Tail) So there you have it, folks.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 13, 2019",USAF’s New Excuses For Delaying Light Attack Aircraft Program Sound Like A Death Sentence,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s top officer says the service had to put its most recent light attack aircraft program on hold to gather yet more data on how it might use such these planes and how they might operate together with attack helicopters, armed drones, and other platforms. He also implied that there had been a lack of interest from potential foreign partners . Beyond simply ignoring the service’s own glaringly obvious need for this capability , these arguments for putting the program on ice are dubious at best and appear to be a pretext for outright canceling the effort, if it isn’t effectively dead already. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein offered his latest take on what has most recently been known as the Light Attack Aircraft (LAA) program in an interview with Defense News on Jan. 26, 2019. The Air Force had announced it was shelving the LAA effort indefinitely earlier in January . It had planned to issue a formal request for proposals in December 2018. In August 2018 , the Air Force had alerted potential vendors of the upcoming competition. At the same time, however, the service bluntly stated that it had determined that the A-29 Super Tucano and AT-6C Wolverine , both single-engine turboprop aircraft, were likely to be the only aircraft that would meet its requirements. Brazil’s Embraer, in cooperation with Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), had supplied an A-29 for two rounds of experiments between 2017 and 2018, while Textron had provided one of its AT-6Cs. Textron’s Scorpion light jet and the AT-802L Longsword armed crop duster from Air Tractor and L3 had participated in the first phase of evaluations, as well. Goldfein told Defense News that the Air Force had decided against issuing the request for proposals in the end because of uncertainty about the upcoming budget proposal for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which is now due out in a matter of days. He said the service had not yet finished crafting its over-arching strategy for employing light attack aircraft, either. We don’t know what the Air Force’s final plans for the LAA program might have looked like, but a report that the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, released on Jan. 31, 2019, said the service could have bought a fleet of 359 aircraft, enough for eight operational squadrons and three training units. Purchases would have begun after a contract award sometime in 2019. It is not clear whether this reflected a maximum purchase order, since, by December 2018, senior Air Force officials were already talking about a potential fleet of less than 100 aircraft . In August 2018, now-retired U.S. Air Force General Ellen Pawlikowski, then head of Air Force Materiel Command, had talked about the service purchasing as few as 20 of the planes. It is also important to remember that DOT&E report covers activities during the 2018 Fiscal Year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2018, meaning the information therein is at least four months old. The Air Force has already confirmed that the details are no longer accurate . “What is the right mix of fixed wing, rotary wing, manned and unmanned that can do the business of light attack?” Goldfein said in his interview with Defense News about how the service is now looking to move forward with the program. “What is the right mix and how do we bring allies and partners in right now with us – not just periodically parachute in – but how do we expand this experiment to bring them into the tent with us?” Chief of Staff of the Air Force General David Goldfein, in the green flight suit, shakes hands with Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson while standing next to an AT-6C aircraft in 2017., USAF Goldfein’s comments are in line with statements that Under Secretary of the Air Force Matt Donovan, the service’s number two civilian, had made to reporters when he announced the indefinite suspension of the LAA program after an Air Force Association event on Jan. 18, 2019 . “We’re going to broaden the scope a little bit,” he said, without offering any details. The Air Force’s top officer certainly offered more context, but one can only reasonably describe these arguments as nonsensical. The most immediately maddening claim is that the Air Force has been unable to properly craft a light attack strategy, whatever types of aircraft it might include, based on the information it already has or can readily obtain from its sister services. The seemingly perpetual need to collect more data has been a routine talking point since the Air Force’s most recent light attack experiment, known variously as the Capability Assessment of Non-Developmental Light Attack Platforms or Combat Dragon III, began in 2017. As we at The War Zone have pointed out repeatedly , the idea that this is the case strains credulity. At the risk of sounding repetitive , it remains important to remember that various branches of the U.S. military have now conducted evaluations involving either the A-29 or the AT-6C, or both aircraft, in the light attack role, on no less than six separate occasions since 2007. In 2008, the staff at the headquarters of Air Combat Command’s, the Air Force’s main warfighting command, also drafted a specific “ enabling concept ” regarding the employment of a light attack aircraft, then referred to notionally as OA-X, which could also perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Members of the Air National Guard look at an AT-6C on display during another evaluation of this type in 2010., USAF Then, between 2008 and 2012, the Air Force managed two separate light attack aircraft efforts, one for itself and one primarily on behalf of foreign partners, known as Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) and Light Air Support (LAS) respectively. The LAAR program, its own saga you can read about in more detail here , imploded in ways that mirror what has happened to the latest LAA effort and ultimately got cut from the budget, ostensibly due to shrinking overall defense spending due to sequestration . However, the Air Force did pick the A-29 as the winner of the LAS program and subsequently helped deliver those planes to Afghanistan . In 2014, Air Education and Training Command’s (AETC) then reactivated the 81st Fighter Squadron to fly these exact same aircraft to train Afghan pilots. The 81st has been flying A-29s ever since, developing their own knowledge base about the light attack mission and incorporating lessons learned from their Afghan partners’ actual combat experience with the type. Lebanese Air Force pilots are now in the mix , too, after receiving their own Super Tucanos via the U.S. military . “The squadron is the only combat mission ready fighter squadron in AETC,” according to the unit’s official webpage . An A-29 Super Tucano assigned to the 81st Fighter Squadron., USAF Outside of the Air Force, the U.S. military, primarily through U.S. Special Operations Command, has also conducted another serious and thorough evaluation of the Super Tucano, as part of a program known as Imminent Fury , and has pursued other light attack aircraft efforts . This includes the deployment of two OV-10G+ Bronco aircraft to Iraq in 2015 as part of a field test in actual combat known as Combat Dragon II. Now, Goldfein’s appears to be implying that the Air Force has to take additional time to develop a light attack strategy that better takes into account the possible contributions of larger combat jets, attack helicopters, and armed unmanned aircraft. If this is true, the only sensible question should be, why is this only happening now? Beyond its obvious fleets of combat jets, the Air Force, as well as other U.S. military services , has been actively operating armed drones for nearly two decades. The idea and practice of pairing fixed-wing attack aircraft with armed helicopters dates back to before the Vietnam War . A US Air Force A-1E Skyraider attack aircraft escorts a CH-3C helicopter during a combat search and rescue mission in South Vietnam in 1966., USAF More importantly, the Air Force program to acquire a fixed-wing light attack aircraft was always supposed to be an additive capability , not a complete replacement for any one of these other platforms. The primary benefit of acquiring light attack planes has always been to provide an alternative to higher-end combat jets and bombers in low-risk environments, and a very cost-effective one at that in order to ease any concerns about breaking the budget . This would free up those other aircraft up for missions that actually require their particular attributes. Light attack aircraft also require far less infrastructure to support and can operate with a smaller overall footprint , offering added operational flexibility. Being able to rapidly redeploy to sites closer to the target area would also allow the planes to maintain a more persistent presence over particular portions of the battlefield, flying armed overwatch or ISR missions in addition to close air support sorties. They can do all of this at a fraction of the average cost per flight hour to operate even the Air Force’s most cost-conscious combat jet, the A-10 . But none of this obviates the requirement for higher-end aircraft entirely, even in limited conflicts . It certainly doesn’t fully eliminate the separate utility of armed helicopters or unmanned aircraft in those settings. It’s all about force management. Relying heavily on combat jets such as the F-16C/D Viper and F-15E Strike Eagle , and even the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, to perform these low-risk missions created an unsustainable demand for those aircraft. The result has been a visibly negative impact on the readiness of those fleets. Without light attack aircraft as alternatives, these issues will only become pronounced as the Air Force expands its reliance on the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter, which is even more costly to operate. US Army AH-64 Apache gunships at a forward operating location during operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria., US Army So it’s even more glaring that, in his interview with Defense News, Goldfein sought to shift blame onto potential foreign partners for the apparent lack of interest in light attack aircraft and a demand for a broader mix of capabilities. The desire for international participation has also long been another major talking point for the Air Force regarding its most recent light attack effort, even though not one single country has ever confirmed an active interest in joining the program. “Some countries, it actually would be better to have an unmanned option. Some countries, [it] would be better to have a rotary-wing option,” Goldfein said. “Some countries would do fixed wing, but [only with a] turbojet [engine].” The reality that certain platforms work better in certain environments is a meaningless truism. It also ignores the fact that many of America’s partners and allies, including other first world countries , that would be interested in a fixed-wing turboprop light attack aircraft, such as the A-29 or AT-6C, already operate aircraft in those roles or are pursuing their own efforts . US Air Force pilots stand next to a Colombian A-29 light attack aircraft., USAF Just with regards to the A-29, the U.S. military itself has facilitated the delivery of Super Tucanos to Afghanistan , Lebanon , and Nigeria since 2012. It calls into question why the Air Force feels the need to create a new multi-national program when it effectively has one right now. On top of that, numerous other countries have purchased these aircraft directly from Embraer for training and light attack missions, further reducing the pool of countries who might be interested in buying another set of light attack planes, too. Iraq also received a number of AC-208 Combat Caravan aircraft in the 2000s via the United States and the Pentagon is now helping Afghanistan buy the latest version of this plane, now known as the Eliminator. IOMAX AT-802i armed crop dusters went to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and then Jordan with the help of the U.S. government. Domestic politics in Kenya have held up another American-sponsored deal for the similar AT-802L Longsword. There have been additional direct sales of American-made types, including IOMAX’s latest offering, the Archangel , to foreign countries. It would take too long to list all of the countries that have used existing U.S. government foreign military assistance constructs to acquire combat jets and attack helicopters of various types . An AT-802L Longsword., L3 When it comes to foreign sales of armed unmanned aircraft such as the now-retired MQ-1 Predator , or other larger designs such as the MQ-9 Reaper , the U.S. government is, right or wrong, hamstrung by its adherence to international arms control regimes . This is an entirely separate issue that no expanded Air Force program would ever be able to get around on its own. All of this notwithstanding, there is simply no reason why the Air Force’s light attack efforts should ever be beholden to foreign demand for this type of aircraft. “LAA will provide an affordable, non-developmental aircraft intended to operate globally in the types of Irregular Warfare environments that have characterized combat operations over the past 25 years,” the service said in its own contracting notice in August 2018. Foreign involvement, or lack thereof, doesn’t change the Air Force’s own need for this capability or the benefits that light attack planes would offer as part of the existing mix of manned and unmanned aircraft and helicopters the U.S. military already has. Exports to allies won’t solve the service’s own glaring problem of flying the wings off its tactical jet fleets for missions that a far simpler aircraft could perform more effectively at a fraction of the cost. If going down this road alone is somehow actually a show-stopper, it could easily look to partner up with the Marine Corps, which also has a standing requirement for a light attack aircraft for the same reasons. But cooperation at home or abroad doesn’t seem to be the real issue at play, anyway. By talking about the ability of other platforms to fill the Air Force’s gap in light attack aircraft capability, Goldfein is implicitly setting up the argument that these systems are adequate substitutes. This is a rhetorical ploy the Air Force has also used, unsuccessfully, in the past to push for the retirement of the A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft. The service does have separate requirements for an actual A-10 replacement, too, but has kept them hidden away in bureaucratic limbo more than two years now, a story we at The War Zone were first to report . The truth of the matter is that, despite many public pronouncements to the contrary, by every real indication, the Air Force has never been serious about this latest light attack program. Goldfein’s latest statements don’t show that anything has changed in that regard and also indicates that the service is beginning to lay out official reasoning, no matter how obviously contrived, for finally canceling the LAA program officially in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 15, 2018",USMC’s Older F-35Bs May Only Be Able To Fly Around A Quarter Of Their Expected Service Life (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new Pentagon report is warning that the U.S. Marine Corps’ oldest F-35B Joint Strike Fighters may remain airworthy for just over a quarter of the aircraft’s expected lifespan due to serious structural problems . This could force the service to begin grounding jets, or retiring them permanently, as early as 2026. It also remains unclear whether subsequent improvements to the aircraft’s design on later models have significantly increased the durability of later production aircraft. Bloomberg first reported the new details about the life expectancy of early block F-35Bs, which may be as low as 2,100 flight hours, after acquiring the most recent annual review of the program from the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, more commonly known as DOT&E . This office publicly releases reports every year on how various significant military programs are proceeding in testing, often compiling data together with information from previous years. The yearly reports on the F-35 also cover the entire Joint Strike Fighter program, including developments with the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A and the U.S. Navy’s F-35C , as well as components common to all three variants. Beyond the F-35B lifespan problems, the review also said concerns about cybersecurity vulnerabilities , as well as issues with the overall performance of the cloud-based Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) computer network that supports all the F-35s, remained unresolved, according to Bloomberg . We have yet to see the full report for ourselves and get more details about these particular problems, and any others it might highlight. But these particular points are hurdles that the Joint Strike Fighter program has been struggling to overcome for years and you can read about more about them in depth here and here . The latest DOT&E review also raised questions about the accuracy of the internal GAU-22/A 25mm gun in the Air Force’s A model against ground targets, another well-established issue that the Air Force has, at least implicitly , appeared to ignore over the years. The appalling low durability of early F-35Bs is also something that DOT&E reports have highlighted in the past , but this is the first time there has been any concrete information on how bad the problem actually is. All three F-35 models are supposed to have a life expectancy of 8,000 flight hours. The Joint Strike Fighter program office had demanded that a non-flyable airframe representative of each one of the three F-35 models go through the equivalent of three full life cycles, or 24,000 flight hours, of simulated routine wear and tear. Contractors hired to do the fatigue testing could make general repairs and conduct normal preventive maintenance at appropriate points in the experiments. An F-35B test article undergoes structural testing., Lockheed Martin So far, only the F-35A test article has completed all of these tests. In 2017, the Joint Strike Fighter program suspended plans for the third round of testing on F-35B test article, also known as BH-1, because it was “no longer representative” of any actual production aircraft, according to DOT&E’s reports. BH-1 had received significant structural redesigns over the course of testing, including a new carry-through-structure joining the wings to the fuselage, the latest DOT&E review explained, according to a separate report from Aviation Week . Testing had also exposed that certain components proved to be more prone to cracking than expected. This can only reignite concerns about the F-35B’s basic design going back more than a decade now. In 2004, Lockheed Martin tasked a group of engineers, known as STOVL (Short Take Off/Vertical Landing) Weight Attack Team, or SWAT , with shaving pounds off the B model. This variant is still heavier than the F-35A due to the added weight of the lift fan, articulating exhaust, and other features necessary for its short- and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. Those same features also reduce the size of its internal weapons bays compared to its cousins and give it a lower G rating compared to the A model. Lockheed Martin’s SWAT cut 2,700 pounds off the F-35B. The changes they made also resulted in 1,300 pounds of weight savings on both the F-35A and C models as part of the herculean effort that effectively saved the Joint Strike Fighter program. Since then, critics had questioned exactly what had to get sacrificed to meet those goals as reports of cracking and other component failures have emerged with the B variant in particular. The Marine Corps’ oldest F-35Bs are underperforming, in general, due in large part to their now thoroughly obsolete Block 2B software package and shortages of spare parts. In March 2018, U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Steven Rudder, the service’s Deputy Commandant for Aviation, informed Congress that these aircraft were mission capable, on average, less than 40 percent of the time. A general overview of the different software packages developed for the U.S. military’s F-35 fleets, as of 2018., GAO The limited capabilities of the Block 2B software already means that the Marines have relegated these aircraft to training roles and other non-combat roles, an arrangement that poses potential risks for the service’s ability to meet the demand for generating more F-35 pilots. The Corps has regularly downplayed these issues with its Joint Strike Fighter fleet. The service declared initial operational capability with the type in 2015 and used the aircraft in actual combat for the first time over Afghanistan in September 2018 . The Marines also suffered the first crash of an F-35 of any kind in 2018. This was one of the F-35Bs assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron Five Zero One (VMFAT-501), the service’s premier Joint Strike Fighter training unit, but there is no evidence as yet that structural problems played a role in that accident. The reason that there are so many different sub-configurations of the three main F-35 variants spread across the U.S. military at all is the result of a concept known as “ concurrency .” The Pentagon had billed this idea, which involved stepping up production of the jets and buying dozens of low-rate production examples while simultaneously planning to implement any necessary upgrades across the fleet as time went on, as a cost-saving measure. F-35As under construction at Lockheed Martin’s plant in Fort Worth, Texas., Lockheed Martin This has not turned out to be the case and there are now questions about whether it will ultimately turn out to be practical to upgrade any F-35s still running the older software, regardless of specific variant. If this comes to pass, the U.S. military will have sunk billions into jets that will never be combat capable and may be increasingly irrelevant even for training purposes as newer Joint Strike Fighters become increasingly distinct from the earlier examples. The problems look set to become increasingly pronounced for the F-35B fleet if early models won’t be airworthy without significant structural upgrades by the end the next decade. Beyond that, there’s no guarantee that later model Bs will meet the 8,000 flight hour life expectancy goal, “even with extensive modifications to strengthen the aircraft,” either, according to previous DOT&E reports on the F-35 program. In the end, concurrency may leave the Marines with a fleet of aircraft that will only ever fly for a fraction of their expected service life before needing replacing entirely. The Joint Strike Fighter program office has received funds for a new test article that is representative of the current B model configuration that it could use to gather more realistic data from the third round of fatigue testing, but it has yet to actually acquire that airframe, according to the latest review . The F-35C still need to complete its third cycle of testing, as well, though previous DOT&E reports have not highlighted severe structural issues with that model. The F-35A has completed its full battery of tests without any apparent major issues. An F-35B prepares to take off from the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Essex for an operational mission in 2018., USMC The new and worrisome details about the F-35B’s life span also come amid growing concerns about the readiness of the U.S. military’s F-35 fleets overall. In 2018, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis ordered the Air force, Navy, and Marine Corps to take the steps necessary to boost the availability of the Joint Strike Fighter fleet across the services, as well as that of F-16 , F/A-18 , and F-22 fighter jets , to an average of 80 percent by the end of the 2019 Fiscal Year. “I am biased towards giving the taxpayer their money’s worth,” Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan more recently told reporters on Jan. 29, 2019 , in response to questions about whether the former Boeing executive had pushed the Air Force to purchase new F-15s from his former employer over F-35s. “And the F-35, unequivocally, I can say has a lot of opportunity for more performance.” It is worth noting that the Air Force and Lockheed Martin have said that the Air Force’s plans to acquire F-15Xs will have no impact on the F-35 program, something that we at The War Zone underscored when we broke the story initially . Shanahan’s statements do seem to highlight growing frustration within the Pentagon over persistent issues with the Joint Strike Fighter program, even as the jets continue to hit certain milestones and drop in price . “If they choose to have an order of the F-15, it won’t be at the expense of F-35 quantities,” Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin’s CEO, said during a routine earnings call on Jan. 30, 2019 . “I’m hearing that directly from leadership in the Pentagon, and I think that’s an important point for me to make. It’s not just our suspicion, but I’ve been told that directly.” We’re eager to get our hands on DOT&E’s latest review to see if there is any more specific information about the F-35B’s life expectancy or other issues still plaguing all three Joint Strike Fighter variants. From what we know now, though, there are already serious questions about the future of the Marine Corps fleet in the near term and about whether the U.S. military’s F-35 fleet as a whole can come anywhere close to meeting the performance targets the Pentagon has laid out for this year. Update: 2/1/2019— After we published this story, Lockheed Martin, who manufactures the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, sent us with the following statement regarding the F-35B’s life expectancy: The F-35s  operating today are delivering exceptional capability, lethality and connectivity around the globe. While we await the full details of the ongoing Operational Test phase, we are actively enhancing all aspects of the F-35 to ensure it exceeds warfighter demands and outpaces evolving threats. Items identified in the Annual  DOT&E report are well understood and have been resolved in partnership with the F-35 Joint Program Office or have an agreed path forward to resolution. F-35B Service Life: The F-35B has completed full scale durability testing to 16,000 hours. Planned modifications and fleet management of the early contract F-35B aircraft will ensure that they meet the 8,000 hour service life requirement, and aircraft delivering today incorporate these design changes in the build process to ensure they’ll meet 8,000 hours or more. However, as DOT&E’s report noted, the F-35B still needs at least another round of durability testing to meet the U.S. military’s requirements and confirm that the existing structural improvements will allow the aircraft to meet the 8,000 flight hour requirement. It also remains unclear how realistic the data from the second round of tests actually is, given that the BH-1 airframe had changed so significantly throughout the course of that testing that it was no longer representative of any production configuration in the end. The U.S. military’s F-35 program office did accept the results of that second round of testing. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air F-35 Fighters Stealth"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has quickly made its way around Russian social media showing a Russian Su-27 Flanker flying between a USAF F-15C Eagle and another aircraft during an intercept mission, with the Su-27 turning then directly into the F-15 at very close range in an attempt to ‘push it away’ from the aircraft it was escorting. It isn’t clear exactly what the circumstances are that led to the intercept or where it occurred, although the F-15C appears to be from the 493rd ‘Grim Reapers’ Fighter Squadron based at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom. The unit has a heavy presence throughout Europe and regularly provides aircraft for NATO’s air policing duties in the Baltic region . We can’t say for sure if the video was shot during one of those alert scramble missions, but Russian aircraft are very active in the tense Baltic Sea region and have been known to inject themselves between NATO aircraft who have intercepted Russian VVIP aircraft, surveillance planes, and transports in a similar, but not quite as aggressive manner. They have even photo bombed large NATO formation flights over the Baltic Sea during major exercises. All this is in addition to making aggressive moves near lumbering U.S. and allied surveillance aircraft operating in various hotspots around the globe. One Russian fighter even barrel rolled ove r a KC-10 tanker while flying over Syria, so these types of antics aren’t just relegated to intercepts in international airspace. Here is a video of Grim Reaper F-15s in action during an air policing detachment to the Baltics in 2018: Clearly, such abrupt maneuvers could end in disaster and spark an international crisis , but regardless of the normal diplomatic protests that occur after these types of events, Russia has shown to have little interest in modifying their pilot’s behavior.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Statistics from a new Pentagon report show that the troublesome electromagnetic catapults and new arresting gear on the U.S. Navy’s newest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford , performed terribly during at-sea trials over the past two years. The news comes just weeks after the Pentagon approved plans for a block buy of two more of Ford -class flattops in an attempt to help cut ballooning costs . The first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford , also known as CVN-78, was billions of dollars over budget at the time of delivery in 2017 and continues to require significant and costly work . Bloomberg was first to report the new details about the Ford ‘s dismal performance in 2018 after obtaining a copy of the latest annual review from the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, more commonly known as DOT&E . Every Spring, this office releases public reports on how well, or not, various high-profile military systems performed in testing in the previous fiscal year, which ends in September. These reviews often include data compiled over multiple years, as well. We have yet to see the full report for ourselves, but DOT&E’s latest examination of Ford shows that Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) suffered 10 “critical failures” across 747 aircraft launches in at-sea trials since delivery in 2017, according to Bloomberg . The Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) had 10 “operational mission failures” over the course of 763 landing attempts in that same time frame. There are no additional details on what qualifies as a “critical failure” for the EMALS or an “operational mission failure” for the AAG. It is reasonable to assume these categories are instances where the catapults did not successfully launch the aircraft and that the arresting gear did not safely stop returning planes, for one reason or another. Ford with her deck devoid of aircraft during initial sea trials., USN EMALS and AAG are essential for Ford ‘s ability to conduct aviation operations and both of these systems, which are all-new to this class of ships, are also supposed to improve its capabilities compared to past flattops. These electronically operated and controlled launch and recovery systems allow the crew to fine tune how they get aircraft up in the air and get them safely back on the deck, at least in principle. When they’re working correctly, the two systems are supposed to help increase the number of sorties the carrier can generate and reduce the physical strain on aircraft, lowering maintenance and logistical demands. Suffice to say, so far this hasn’t been the case and the persistent problems with the EMALS and AAG directly impact the carrier’s ability to conduct actual meaningful operations. For testing purposes, in the past, the Navy has defined a typical day of operations as launching and recovering 84 aircraft in a 24 hour period. The required number of sorties could easily be far greater during combat, especially during the initial phases of a major conflict or even a smaller crisis. At present, Ford “will probably not achieve” the required number of sorties per day due to “unrealistic assumptions” that “ignore the effects of weather, aircraft emergencies, ship maneuvers and current air-wing composition on flight operations,” Robert Behler, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, wrote in his latest report, according to Bloomberg . But this latest review raises continued questions about whether the carrier can even meet those requirements under optimal circumstances. “None of the interruptions experienced during CVN-78 flight operations caused injury to personnel, or damage to the aircraft or ship,” Michael Land, a U.S. Navy spokesperson, told Bloomberg . The tests provide “an insufficient number of events from which to draw conclusions with respect to reliability,” he added. General Atomics, which makes both the EMALS and the AAG, declined to comment to Bloomberg on any specifics about the performance of the two systems. But based on the data in the previous DOT&E report , the Ford ‘s performance still sounds absolutely dreadful. As of 2017, the EMALS was suffering a critical failure once every 455 launches. This was already nine times more frequent than the Navy’s desired rate. If the information from the new report is accurate, during at-sea testing, the catapults broke down once every 75 launches or so, a significantly greater rate than the previously stated average. Land, the Navy spokesperson, said that in the case of two of the critical failures, the ship only “briefly” suspended flight operations before the problem got resolved. Again, however, previous DOT&E reports say that it takes a minimum of an hour and a half to just begin troubleshooting an issue since there is no way to shut down specific components of the EMALS in order to inspect them. We do not know if this has changed since 2017 or what the Navy defines as a “brief” pause in regular operations. Unlike the EMALS, the AAG’s demonstrated better reliability at-sea compared to its overall failure rate as of 2017. The arresting gear only experienced a major failure once every 76 recovery attempts, based on the information from Bloomberg . The AAG was failing once every 20 landing attempts on average across all testing as of 2017, according to DOT&E’s previous review. The Navy isn’t likely to be impressed by this “improvement,” though, given that the service expects Ford ‘s arresting system to properly stop aircraft in 16,500 consecutive landings on average before experiencing a major fault. We’ll have to wait to see the full report to be sure, but its likely that it contains additional criticisms of Ford ‘s performance, or lack thereof. Starting in November 2018, there have been a series of reports detailing persistent difficulties with the ship’s electromagnetically-operated Advanced Weapon Elevators, which that move ordnance to and from the main flight deck. Sailors stand inside the newly delivered weapon elevator onboard the USS Ford in January 2019., USN The Navy only formally accepted delivery of the first of these elevators on Ford in December 2018, more than a year after taking delivery of the ship itself. The carrier is still waiting on 10 more of them, meaning that it lacks another major set of components critical to regular operations. The question is increasingly becoming whether or not all of these issues will have gotten resolved by the time the next Ford -class carrier, the future USS John F. Kennedy , is set to get commissioned in 2024. The cost of that ship has already risen to around $15 billion . This two billion more than Ford and four-and-a-half billion more than the Navy insisted the ships would cost initially , in spite of higher cost estimates from government watchdogs and the shipbuilder, Newport News Shipbuilding. A third example, the future USS Enterprise , is also already under construction. The Navy has not yet received any actual funding for the two additional ships it wants to purchase in the block buy . Unfortunately, the Navy already has a “ carrier gap ” that has made it difficult to meet existing demands for naval airpower, let alone the added strain of a sudden crisis. Given what we know of Ford’s capabilities at present, it’s anyone’s guess when that carrier might be ready to contribute to actual operations in anything but an emergency capacity.

The first installment of a two-part series from Russian media outlet RT that takes viewers into the shadowy world of the submarine component of Russia’s Northern Fleet has been posted and it doesn’t disappoint. The program explores Russia’s vaunted ‘Beast Division’ made up of Akula class nuclear fast attack submarines (SSNs) and includes downright fascinating video of what action aboard these hunter-killer boats looks like, as well as of the infrastructure that supports them. At every turn there are interesting things to see and somewhat strange, but fascinating dialogue to be heard. The Russian Navy’s 24th Submarine Division is made up of a handful of Akula I and Akula II class SSNs, all named after ferocious animals. This makes some sense as they are the tip of the spear when it comes to hunting and killing enemy submarines and ships in the open ocean. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7L8pKSfJc88 There are so many interesting elements to unpack, from what appears to be remarkably dated looking technology filling up much of the interior of these vessels, to how their crews see American threats, to an incredibly detailed look at one of the Akula IIs, Vepr (Wild Boar) K-157, stripped and undergoing an overhaul. It’s important to note that while only four Akulas are active, a larger number of them are undergoing deep upgrades that will supposedly see them outfitted with new technologies, allowing them to better compete with their western counterparts. With these new enhancements, they will serve for decades to come alongside their aging Sierra and Victor class and brand new Yasen class counterparts.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s official! On January 28th, 2019 a North American Twin Mustang lifted into the air once again on a planned flight, its twin Packard-built Merlin engines roaring like only they can. The event was truly music to aviation history’s ears. You can read all about master warbird restorer Tom Reilly’s years of work to bring the XP-82—a prototype variant of the P/F-82—back to life, and the Twin Mustang’s place in the annals of military aviation, in this past piece of ours . Originally, it was hoped that the Twin Mustang was would be flying in time to make a triumphant appearance at EAA’s Airventure air show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin last Summer, but that goal increasingly looked in doubt as the July show date approached. Better late than never and now that the XP-82 has flown it will begin a flight test program from its home field in Douglas, Georgia that will hopefully lead to it being cleared to roar around the country to various air shows and warbird gatherings in the not so distant future. Check out some video of the flight below (make sure your sound is on!): This was technically the second flight of the reborn XP-82, but its first planned flight. A December 31st high-speed ground test ended up turning into an unplanned, albeit short flight. A posting on the XP-82 project’s Facebook page described the surprise inaugural flight and just how powerful the aircraft is: “On 31 December 2018, our XP-82 Twin Mustang flew for the first time since 14 December 1949. Although it wasn’t supposed to fly yesterday, all that was planned to do was the last FAA required runway high-speed taxi test, lift off for a second or two and then back down, deploy full flaps and brake to a stop. It accelerated so fast after the planned lift off that Ray, our test pilot, realized that getting it back down and stopping it in the remaining runway would be marginal. So he pushed the power back up and flew for about five minutes. The unexpected and dramatic acceleration of our XP-82 at 55 inches of manifold pressure occurred because it was approaching three times the horsepower of a single engine Mustang and one and a half times the weight. The XP-82 has 1860 hp each side for total of 3720 hp, compared to 1500 hp for the P-51. Our XP-82 weighs approximately only 1 1/2 times more than a P-51 – 14,700 lbs. compared to 9500 lbs. for the P-51. The very short gear-down flight showed zero airframe squawks, hands-off no trim required, with all engine temps and pressures normal. This wonderful test flight came after a 10.5 year restoration encompassing 207,000 labor hours. Many thanks to Ray Fowler, our test pilot and all of the men and women that made this restoration possible. Thank you, Tom Reilly.” A huge congrats to Tom and his team.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps is following the U.S. Army’s lead and is now looking for a contractor to develop and install a turret with a 30mm cannon in a portion of its forthcoming Amphibious Combat Vehicle fleet. The move is part of a larger trend in both services to up-gun existing and future armored vehicles in light of parallel developments among potential conventional opponents, especially Russia . Marine Corps Systems Command announced plans for the 30mm-armed variant of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, or ACV-30, in a contracting notice on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps, on Jan. 28, 2019 . The Marines also want command and armored recovery versions, known as ACV-C and ACV-R respectively, as part of what the service is now calling the ACV family of vehicles. In June 2018 , the Marines revealed they had picked the SuperAV 8×8 wheeled armored vehicle as the winner of what it had called the ACV 1.1 competition. BAE Systems and Italy’s Iveco had partnered together on the proposal. Afterward, the Corps said it would look to begin a follow-on “ lethality upgrade ” for the vehicles, then known as ACV 1.2. A US Marine Corps ACV during testing. This variant only has a remote weapon station able to hold a .50 caliber machine gun or a 40mm automatic grenade launcher., USMC “The program office tested the vehicle to all of the ACV 1.2 transition requirements, and even subjected the vehicle to 9-foot waves without issues,” U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Kirk Mullins, the program manager for Advanced Amphibious Assault at the Marine Corps Systems Command’s Program Executive Office for Land Systems, said according to an official news story on Jan. 29, 2019. “Because of this, the Marine Corps now was [sic; has] the opportunity to combine the program into a singular ACV family of vehicles program.” The contracting notice does not specify a particular 30mm cannon or turret for the ACV-30, but there are a number of weapon systems that could work with the SuperAV platform. Italian defense contractor Leonardo already offers its HitFist Overhead Weapons Station (OWS) for the 8×8 vehicle, which consists of an unmanned turret that can accept various 20mm or 30mm cannons. Iveco markets the SuperAV/HitFist combination as the VBA . https://youtube.com/watch?v=GDNV0OF6V-0 It also features a co-axial 7.62mm machine gun and can accommodate a two-tube anti-tank guided missile launcher on the side. It can mount various electro-optical and infrared sensors for both target engagement and general reconnaissance, as well as self-defense smoke grenade launchers. The Cockerill 3030 turret from Belgium’s CMI Defense is another option. The Marines might be able to leverage the work CMI Defense did for the Army to integrate the turret onto a Stryker vehicle . An experimental US Army Stryker equipped with the CMI Defense Cockerill 3030 turret., Joseph Trevithick Unlike HitFist, the Cockerill 3030 is a significantly larger, manned turret. But this it is also modular and able to accept a wide array of weapons, which could give the Marines more armament options in the future. The experimental Army version had an XM813 30mm cannon , but the turret can accept weapons as big as a 105mm gun. The CMI Defense turret also has space for various sighting and sensor packages, as well as secondary machine guns and smoke grenade launchers. This turret could be particularly attractive if the Marines want to add a larger automatic cannon, such as a 50mm type , to the ACV in the future. This is a general category of armored vehicle weapons that is becoming increasingly popular both in the West and elsewhere, including Russia. The Russians have been demonstrating a new 57mm turret on a number of different vehicles already, including the BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle , the T-15 heavy infantry fighting vehicle, and the Derivatsiya-PVO , which is a fully-tracked vehicle focused on short-range air defense. https://youtube.com/watch?v=-d_7XNA8IKc Another turret that’s ready to go that the Marines could take advantage of is the one the Army already has in service on the Stryker Dragoon variant. The primary armament, in this case, is also the XM813 30mm cannon. In 2018, General Dynamics Land Systems unveiled a further refined version of that design, as well. A Stryker vehicle with a refined 30mm cannon-armed turret design from General Dynamics Land Systems., Joseph Trevithick Whatever they choose, the Marines will have to pick a turret that does not upset the balance of the vehicle on land and on the water. It will be important to select a design that doesn’t add undue weight to the vehicle overall and reduce its mobility, which the Marines say is a major benefit of the ACV over the service’s existing fully tracked Assault Amphibious Vehicles. This could push the service to adopt a lower profile, unmanned turret, such as the HitFist OWS. But any of these options would be a big improvement over the ACV’s basic armament of a single .50 caliber machine gun or 40mm grenade launcher in a remote weapon station turret. This initial configuration actually represents something of a loss of firepower compared to the Marine Corps’ older AAVs. These larger vehicles have a manned turret with a single .50 caliber machine gun and a 40mm automatic grenade launcher. The turret on the Marine Corps’ present AAVs with the .50 caliber machine gun at left and the 40mm automatic grenade launcher at right., USMC It is also important to note that the Marines have no plans to up-gun all of their ACVs with the new weapon. The contracting announcement says the service is interested in buying 150 ACV-30s, as well as 39 ACV-R and 29 ACV-C vehicles. It is not clear whether the purchase of any of these variants will be part of the Marines’ initial ACV contract with BAE and Iveco, which contains options that the service could exercise to buy more than 200 vehicles in total. The first unit to get the ACVs, the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, is supposed to reach initial operational capability with the vehicles in 2020. Recent reports say the Marines are interested in eventually buying more than 700 ACVs of all types to replace the bulk of its more than 900 AAVs. The Marine Corps’ budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which is due out at the end of this month or the beginning of February 2019, is likely to have more details about the exact numbers of each variant the service is looking to buy and over what timeframe. What is clear is that the Marine’s amphibious battalions are set to get a significant boost in firepower in the coming years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 7, 2019","The Navy’s Future Frigates Are Shaping Up To Be More Lethal And Capable, As Well As Cheaper","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy expects to complete a design review of five proposed frigate designs by the end of this spring. This will help the service finalize its requirements and pave the way for a full, open competition to hire one company to build 20 frigates, each of which will cost more than $800 million. These ships will be a significant component of a growing surface warfare renaissance within the service. Navy officials offered the latest details on the state of the program at the Surface Navy Association’s (SNA) main annual conference on Jan. 15, 2019. The service first announced its was in the market to procure new guided missile frigates, presently referred to as FFG(X), in 2017 . Subsequently, General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, Fincantieri Marine, Huntington Ingalls, Austal USA, and Lockheed Martin each received $15 million contracts in 2018 to craft proposed designs and to help the Navy figure out exactly what it wanted out of the ships. Firmer requirements “Our requirements are mature,” Dr. Regan Campbell, the FFG(X) program manager at Naval Sea Systems Command, said during remarks at the SNA conference on Jan. 17, 2019 . “We’ve engaged with industry, gotten a lot of wonderful feedback and significant savings from that engagement. And we are on track to finish those conceptual design contracts, and through that process I think we are going to have a robust competition going into detailed design and construction.” Campbell said that the Navy received more than 300 specific suggestions from the five contractors regarding the requirements for the frigates, as well as ways to save money. The service implemented around 200 of those pointers. A slide from Dr. Regan Campbell’s briefing at the SNA conference showing the ships that four of the five participants in the first phase of the FFG(X) program are using as the basis for their designs. Huntington Ingalls’ Patrol Frigate concept is not shown., USN There were no details on exactly what these changes to the Navy’s requirements included, but the service is now increasingly confident that the average unit cost for the ships will be closer to $800 million each. The initial threshold unit price was $950 million apiece . “We started closer to the $950; we are trending to very close to the $800 now. We have taken some very significant costs out of the average follow units,” Campbell explained. “Lead ship? I won’t give you a number, but it is reflected in the president’s budget, which you will see shortly.” This surety about the cost of the frigates almost certainly reflects the increasingly final nature of the Navy’s demands for the FFG(X) program. In January 2018, the service released a detailed breakdown of the systems and overall performance specifications that it wanted the new ships to have, which you can read about in more detail here . Campbell showed the chart below at SNA, which shows some significant updates. An overview of the Navy’s required capabilities for FFG(X), as well as some plans for systems it might integrate in the future. , USN More weapons Perhaps most notably, each FFG(X) will have 32 Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) cells. The original threshold requirement was only 16 , though it seemed likely at the time that this would grow. This arrangement forms the core of the ship’s air defense capabilities, with the Navy still saying that the primary weapon for these cells will be quad-packed Block II variants of the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM). This would give the frigates a full load of 128 of these missiles. These cells could also potentially accommodate other missiles in the future, including the increasingly capable and multipurpose Standard Missile 6 (SM-6). It is not clear whether the Navy has any requirement to install longer “strike length” Mk 41 cells on the FFG(X), which would also allow it to fire Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles. The ship’s primary air defense sensor is still set to be a three-face fixed array Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR), which you can read about more here . Variants of this radar will also go onto the future America -class amphibious assault ship USS Bougainville and some of the Ford -class aircraft carriers , beginning with the future USS John F. Kennedy . In addition, Campbell’s presentation did indicate that there was already a future requirement to integrate the RUM-139 Vertical Launched Anti-Submarine Rocket, or VLA, in order to give the ship an all-weather, stand-off anti-submarine weapon. The VLA can carry its payload of a lightweight homing torpedo to target areas up to more than 13 miles, at which point it releases that weapon in order to engage the hostile submarine. There is also now an objective requirement for ship-mounted torpedo tubes to further increase the FFG(X)’s anti-submarine capabilities. The Navy already wants the FFG(X) to have two types of towed sonar, along with a fixed sonar array, to spot underwater threats. This makes good sense given increasing concerns about expanding scope and capabilities of Russian and Chinese submarine fleets. Another significant new detail about the frigate’s requirements is that the Navy wants, if possible, two eight-round launchers for the ship’s over-the-horizon anti-ship missile. The threshold requirement is for the ships to have a pair of four-round launchers. It seems almost certain that the weapon in this case with the Naval Strike Missile , which you can read about more here. American defense contractor Raytheon and Norwegian firm Kongsberg have already begun supplying these missiles to the Navy to arm certain Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The rest of the Navy’s desired armament package for the ships remains the same. In addition to their various missiles and anti-submarine weapons, the frigates will have a 57mm main gun capable of firing the Advanced Low-Cost Munitions Ordnance (ALaMO) guided shell, the SeaRAM close-in defense system, and various automatic cannon and machine guns. The Navy has also now said that it wants the FFG(X) to have adequate space and power generation capacity to accommodate a 150 kilowatt solid-state laser directed energy weapon in the future. The original requirements simply called for space and power “reservation for future Directed Energy.” A 150-kilowatt system would be a significant addition to the frigates and a major upgrade over the Navy’s existing directed energy plans more broadly. Starting in 2020, the service hopes to begin integrating the 60-kilowatt Surface Navy Laser Weapon System ( SNLWS ) onto much larger Arleigh Burke -class destroyers. At present, the service has a prototype 30-kilowatt system in place on the USS Portland , a San Antonio -class landing platform dock. Whatever the power of the laser system, its primary job remains close-in protection against small unmanned aircraft , as well as small manned and unmanned surface vessels. In this latter role, it could be a helpful addition for countering swarms of small boats . Depending on the range and power of the 150-kilowatt system, it may also be able to provide an added layer of defense against incoming anti-ship missiles, as well. An artist’s conception of an Arleigh Burke -class destroyer using a laser weapon to shoot down an incoming threat., Lockheed Martin Added sensors and electronic warfare systems Beyond the main radar, the Navy still has plans for the frigates to have a robust suite of sensors and electronic warfare capabilities, as well, combined with stand-off systems on the MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter and MQ-8C Fire Scout drone that each ship will carry. For instance, each FFG(X) will have the SLQ-32(V)6 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block II. The SLQ-32(V)6 can jam enemy radars, as well as geolocate, identify, and classify those emitters. These latter functions give the system a significant electronic intelligence capability that gives the frigate better situational awareness of the potential threats around and allows the ship to help contribute information for analysts to use in building a larger electronic order of battle of an enemy’s force posture across a wide area. In the presentation at the SNA conference, Dr. Campbell also indicated that the plan is now to build the frigates with the specific intent of installing a lightweight version of the future Block III system, also known as the SLQ-32C(V)7 or SEWIP Block III Lite. The standard Block III system features new active electronically scanned array (AESA) emitters of its own, which offer significantly improved capabilities improves over the earlier versions of the system. It may be possible for this system to even fire bursts of high powered microwave energy and physically destroy the radar seekers or other electronics on incoming threats such as anti-ship missiles. You can read about more about the SLQ-32 series and the improvements coming with the Block III version here . Components of the full-size SLQ-32(V)7 SEWIP Block III installed on a test fixture., Northrop Grumman Cooperative Engagement Capability Each one of the FFG(X)s will have an array of communications systems and data links to readily exchange information with other naval assets, aircraft up above, and forces ashore. As with all of the Navy’s assets, the frigates are set to be linked together using the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) network, which is part of the service’s over-arching Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air ( NIFC-CA ) concept. This again provides additional situational awareness, as well as the ability to rapidly exchanging targeting information so that the frigates could potentially engage hostile forces outside of the range of their own organic sensors. These ships could provide the same sort of target data to other ships or aircraft overhead, too. In the latter case, this could potentially allow fighter jets to fire long-range air-to-air missiles at an enemy even while flying in a “radar silent” mode to conceal their own position, for example. This will also help alleviate issues of limited “magazine depth” on certain aircraft, especially stealthy platforms such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , which cannot carry additional stores externally without sacrificing their stealth capabilities. CEC will be essential for linking manned ships with unmanned surface vessels in the future, too. The Navy has a long-standing roadmap to develop a wide array of small, medium, and large unmanned ships and other craft in the coming years. Small- and medium-sized craft are already increasingly mature and capable of serving as persistent sensor nodes and distributed light attack platforms. The Navy now also has plans for larger unmanned vessels , generally described as being longer than 164 feet, that may provide even more capability. One of the potential missions outlined for these unmanned ships is to serve as floating arsenals loaded with stand-off missiles to increase the overall firepower of a surface task force. Linked together with ships such as the FFG(X), as well as other friendly assets, via the CEC, these unmanned arsenal ships might not even need to carry their own sensors, providing additional space for more weapons. The Navy’s Sea Hunter , also known as the Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessel, is one of the service’s most capable unmanned craft to date. The Navy is looking to acquire more vessels of this general size, but is also now aiming to incorporate larger unmanned ships into its fleets in the future., USN System commonality But for all of these new developments, the Navy remains adamant that it does not want the frigates to contain any systems that are unique to this particular ship. All of the weapons, sensors, and other equipment will be common, at least in part, with systems on other Navy ships, or that the service is developing for multiple types of ships in the future. “Any system we put on this ship, because it has a common radar and weapons systems that we already own and know – every time we have something that we already use and know how it works, we don’t have to pay an additional integration cost,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Ron Boxall, director of the Navy’s top surface warfare office under the Chief of Naval Operations, told Defense News in an interview earlier in January 2019. “And as we upgrade these systems more and more by software, they become seamless between other systems that also use that [combat system]. One of the things we looked at was making sure we got that commonality right up front.” Commonality will help with maintenance and sustainment, since the Navy will have to add fewer unique components to the logistics chain and train personnel how to repair them. The hope is that this will also streamline training, since it is easier to reassign operators who know how to use a particular system from one ship to another with the same weapon, sensor, or other particular piece of common equipment. The Navy’s goal is to develop an increasingly common combat systems architecture to make it even easier to reassign sailors from one type of ship to another in the future, as necessary. All of this will help the service save money and potentially help speed up the training of new personnel, which it desperately needs . The contenders As for the five individual frigate designs under development already, from what is publicly known, there has been no dramatic shifts in the general hullforms. Austal USA was the only firm to show off a model at SNA of its present proposed design, which is derived from its Independence -class LCS. To meet the Navy’s requirements, their new frigate is nearly 40 feet longer and a foot wider. The bulk of this additional space is toward the stern of the ship and is there primarily to provide room for the 32-cell Mk 41 VLS array. The two four-round over-the-horizon missile launchers are also on the fantail. #Austal USA was only #FFGX #frigate contender to show a full concept at #SNA last wk. Enlarged fm a year ago, mostly extended aft for more missiles. Length 456', beam 105', 21' draft. All diesels (4) for 26 knots. 32-cell VLS, 8 NSM fwd. Note redesigned bow, props vice waterjets. pic.twitter.com/RPIHYykcl5 — Chris Cavas (@CavasShips) January 21, 2019 More importantly, Austal had to dispense with the waterjet propulsion system on the Independence -class in favor of traditional drive shafts and propellers. This has been a standing Navy requirement from the beginning and the service also required that certain engine and drive chain components be sufficiently spaced apart to reduce the chances that a single hit from an opponent could leave an FFG(X) dead in the water. These requirements have also impacted Lockheed Martin’s offering, which is derived from their Freedom -class LCS design. As a result, the company’s frigate design is also longer overall than the Freedoms . A model of Lockheed Martin’s Freedom -class-derived FFG(X) proposal that the company unveiled in 2018. Lockheed Martin has not yet released imagery or presented a model of a revised design that meets the Navy’s evolved requirements, including the need for a 32-cell VLS array., Joseph Trevithick “It does require the ship to be longer, given those separation requirements and how you plan to stagger your port and starboard configuration of the combining gear/reduction gear, running into a single shaft into a screw on either side,” Joe DePietro, Lockheed Martin’s Vice President of Small Combatants and Ship Systems, told Defense News in October 2018 . “You have to have a certain amount of separation and they have to be fully independent.” Other competitors are also putting forward well-established, purpose-built frigate designs, as well. Italy’s Fincantieri Marine has put forward a derivative of its Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM) design, which it designed in cooperation with France’s Naval Group . Ships based on this design are now in service in Italy, France, Morocco, and Egypt. A model of an anti-submarine warfare focused FREMM frigate design. Fincantieri Marine has based their FFG(X) proposal on this hullform., Joseph Trevithick General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, in cooperation with Spain’s Navantia, is pitching a version of the latter firm’s F100 frigate . Beyond Spain, Norway operates derivatives of this ship design and Australia is purchasing its own variant . The last company involved in the FFG(X) program at present is Huntington Ingalls, which has proposed a ship based on its Patrol Frigate concept that itself derived from the Coast Guard’s Legend -class National Security Cutter . An artist’s conception of Huntington Ingalls Patrol Frigate., Huntington Ingalls Already a heated competition It’s hard to say which of these companies may be the top favorite to win the final FFG(X) deal. Austal USA and Lockheed Martin are clearly hoping to make attractive offers by leveraging existing experience and industrial capacity from their respective LCS designs, but as noted the other contenders are also proposing ships derived from in production designs. That LCS pedigree may not ultimately be a selling point given their record of underperformance and having difficulty adapting to more complex mission sets . An initial attempt to up-gun the two LCS classes and add more capability, known as the Small Surface Combatant , resulted in designs that still lacked any real air defense capability and would be dangerously vulnerable in even moderate risk environments. Austal USA and Lockheed Martin also built their LCS designs to meet requirements the Navy had laid out for ships conducting littoral operations closer to shore and it’s unclear how adaptable they may truly be to the broader FFG(X) operating concept. The need to make significant changes, including revising the entire propulsion system, also raises the question of how similar the final designs will actually be with their predecessors. On top of that, on Jan. 24, 2019 , U.S. federal agents, including members of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), descended on Austal USA’s shipyard in Mobile, Alabama. Authorities would not explain the reason for the raid. The company’s Australian parent is reportedly under investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for how it handled losses related to the Independence -class. Independence-class Littoral Combat Ships under construction at Austal’s shipyard in Alabama., Austal USA “Austal USA is working with the U.S. Navy on an open investigation,” the company said in a subsequent statement to USNI News . “We are unable to provide additional details due to the nature of the investigation. We are continuing business as usual, executing our existing and recently awarded contracts.” Navantia’s F100 design may also be facing increased scrutiny after the Royal Norwegian Navy’s Fridtjof Nansen -class frigate Helge Ingstad all but sank after colliding with a tanker in November 2018. The Fridtjof Nansens are based on the F100 and share many of their basic design features. The Norweigan frigate Helge Ingstad sits almost completely underwater after suffering a major collision. , Forsvaret On Nov. 29, 2018 , Norwegian authorities released their first official report on the accident, which raised questions about whether potential design flaws in the ship contributed to the severity of the damage. Navantia has since said the analysis of potential faults was hasty and has disputed the findings. The Norwegian report was certainly based on limited information as the Norwegians have yet to refloat the ship and get it into dry dock for a full inspection. Whether these developments, or any future issues, play a role in the final frigate competition remain to be seen. The Navy hopes to release its final request for proposals by the end of September 2019. The goal is for the contract award to come within a year of that. The present acquisition timeline for the FFG(X) program., USN The Navy would then buy one ship in both the 2020 and 2021 Fiscal Years. The service would proceed to buy the remaining 18 ships at a rate of two a year every year through the 2030 Fiscal Year. Billions of dollars on the line for what may be one of the more significant Navy shipbuilding programs in the coming years, combined with the potential to win more contracts in the future to sustain and upgrade these vessels. There is also the possibility that the Navy might decide to purchase additional examples or derivatives in the future and a major U.S. military order could attract lucrative foreign sales , as well. All told, FFG(X) promises to be a heated competition, no matter what happens. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Procurement"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 10, 2019",USAF Chief Just Said Next Air Refueling Tanker May Fly In Space… Huh?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have long highlighted the glaring need for a low-observable (stealthy) tanker to support the thousands of relatively short-ranged stealth fighters the USAF will continue to purchase in through coming decades—aircraft that are expected to take on peer states with high-end anti-access capabilities, like China. You can read the entire case for such a platform in this past feature of mine . Many laughed off the idea when that piece was published, but it has since become a very real concept within the flying force . Now the USAF’s Chief Of Staff, General David Goldfein, has poured a bit of cold water on the idea, while at the same time positing a far more exotic if not outright puzzling one—a tanker that flies in low earth orbit. What? Aviation Week recently inquired about the status of the survivable tanker initiative, with Goldfein replying: “The days of buying individual platforms that we then described as game changers—those days are behind us… There actually are no silver bullets on the horizon.” As the USAF’s top uniformed officer, Goldfein’s primary vision for the flying force has included putting far heavier emphasis on networking together an ever more diverse constellation of weapons and sensor systems distributed over a wide area as opposed to packing a ton of capability into singular platforms. This distributed concept of operations relies very heavily on secure communications and especially beyond-line-of-site data-links whose abilities are largely made possible by space-based satellites. Some see this reality as the glaring Achilles heel of Goldfein’s vision. It’s hard to imagine why such a strategy totally eliminates the advantages that some so called ‘silver bullet’ capabilities could provide. The two ideas don’t seem mutually exclusive. Goldfein continues: “I actually don’t know if the next version of tanker operates in the air or operates at low earth orbit.. I don’t know if it’s manned or unmanned, and I actually don’t care that much as long as it brings the attributes we need to win… It might sound a little bit odd that the commander of Air Mobility Command is talking to Air Force Space Command about development of the next tanker, but it makes perfect sense to me.” When it comes to refueling air breathing jet aircraft like fighters, airlifters, and bombers, no, this statement makes zero sense at all. In fact, it is outright preposterous. Maybe what the General means is that a tanker may be needed to refuel satellites in orbit, some of which could be weaponized to the point of carrying kinetic munitions in the coming decades. It is not hard to imagine a space plane of sorts being designed to refuel and service objects in low earth orbit. In fact, the Pentagon is openly funding a system that could be capable of just that now and certainly others have been rumored to exist in the past. With more fuel, satellites could be designed to maneuver more freely and aggressively, adding to their flexibility, unpredictability, and survivability. Pentagon satellites are facing growing anti-satellite threats from Russia and China and even rogue states . Being able to better protect them is becoming a very urgent defense priority. Goldfein has stuck to a consistent, highly networked vision for the USAF’s future since taking on the role as the highest ranking uniformed officer in the service., USAF Adding modular plug-and-play capabilities that can be updated while on orbit, or even rearming space-based weapons platforms as needed would also bring big advantages in a future where space is a highly active battlefield . It’s clear that the USAF has plenty of non-disclosed capabilities and plans related to space. Maybe he sees a future where some jet attack and transport aircraft give way, at least partially, to suborbital or orbital systems. But this is a huge, expensive, long-term proposition. Meanwhile, we know the Pentagon is buying thousands of stealthy fighter jets in the coming decades and has plans for next generation systems as well. These aircraft will serve well into the second half of this century. So regardless of if the USAF wants to flood low earth orbit with weaponry, its very expensive fighter fleet will have to maintain relevancy for many, many decades to come, all the while America’s potential enemies continue to push out their anti-access capabilities farther from their own shores, creating massive swathes of contested airspace where traditional tankers will become increasingly vulnerable. The introduction of a large fleet of unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) would go a long way to making the USAF less dependent on large tanker aircraft and doing so clearly fills Goldfein’s distributed, network-based air combat vision—you can read all about UCAVs and why the USAF acts as if they don’t even exist in this past special feature of mine —but they have nothing to do with suborbital or orbital flight. With all this in mind, it seems like an absurd leap to go from talking about a survivable tanker to support existing combat aircraft and those still to come, to some sort of an orbital tanker concept, which really isn’t new. One doesn’t displace the need for the other. He also inserted Air Mobility Command (AMC) into his remarks. AMC doesn’t deal with space logistics, at least not yet. The first KC-46 was just delivered to McConnell AFB and will serve the USAF for many decades. But the type will struggle to safely provide fuel close enough to enemy territory for F-35s and F-22s to reach their target areas when fighting against peer states with anti-access capabilities. Situational awareness and electronic warfare upgrades, and even active defenses , could help when it comes to survivability, but a low-observable tanker would provide a far more survivable aerial refueling capability that can penetrate some distance into contested territory. , USAF This isn’t the first time an Air Force leader has made eyebrow raising and/or outright embarrassing claims about the service’s vision for space. These statements are largely the result of the Air Force’s struggling with all its might to keep its grasp on space as the White House pushes for an independent Space Force . Virtually anywhere space could be injected into the USAF talking points it has been, sometimes with disastrous results. But it’s odd to hear this kind of thing from Goldfein, who is usually an eloquent and thoughtful speaker about his vision for the force and its fighting doctrine. In the end, the Air Force would be well advised to ensure the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fighters it is planning to buy for the coming decades have the support assets they need to be mission relevant before they start making down payments on a fleet of space tankers.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Long known as the Nevada Test Site and now called the Nevada National Security Site, the sprawling land mass deep in the southern Nevada desert is home to some of America’s most sensitive installations and pockmarked with craters from past nuclear explosions. It’s here that a peculiar and deadly incident occurred on January 28th, 2019. At 5:18pm local time, a man drove through the security checkpoint at Mercury, which is located roughly 70 miles north of Las Vegas. The austere enclave off U.S. Route 95 has long acted the basecamp for the Test Site’s operations. A car chase ensued, with the notoriously territorial private contractors that guard the massive installation and Nye County Sheriff deputies pursuing the rogue vehicle. The chase went on for roughly eight miles before the car pulled over. A man got out of his car with some type of metallic cylindrical object in his hand and confronted his pursuers. He would not respond to verbal commands and was shot dead by both security personnel and law enforcement officers as a result. An official statement from the Department of Energy, whose National Nuclear Security Administration runs the site, says that they have contacted the FBI to help investigate the strange incident. Official Statement from NNSS/DOE The facility, which encompasses nearly 1,400 square miles and is surrounded by the Air Force’s Nevada Test and Training Range , includes a nuclear weapons assembly plant, experimental flight test facility, and large explosive testing areas, among many other sensitive sites, and is notorious for its extreme security.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the weekend, Venezuela’s increasingly isolated President Nicolás Maduro took a trip to review various units of the country’s armed forces, including the Venezuelan Army’s 41st Armored Brigade and elements of the Venezuelan Marine Corps. The heavily staged visits included a photo op of Maduro and his wife riding in the turret of Chinese-made VN18 armored amphibious vehicle while it did donuts in the water at a naval base. The events were obvious propaganda to show his opponents at home and abroad that he continues to enjoy the loyalty of the bulk of the country’s armed forces, a typical move for a dictator facing a popular challenge to their authority. Pictures and videos of the trips to review the military units in the field appeared on Maduro’s official Twitter account and elsewhere on social media on Jan. 27, 2019. The Venezuelan leader has been fighting to retain control of the country since Jan. 23, 2019 , when opposition figure and President of the country’s National Assembly Juan Guaido announced he had taken the title of Interim President. Maduro had been set to begin a new term following a disputed election in 2018 that observers said was neither free nor fair. Guaido now enjoys the support of the United States, Canada, and the majority of the countries in Central and South America, as well as other nations around the world, but he has not yet been able to get Maduro to relinquish power. During his visit to the Agustín Navarro Naval Base, Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores, who is also a Venezuelan politician and lawyer, donned Russian-style armored vehicle crew helmets and went for a literal spin in the water in a VN18 amphibious armored vehicle. During the event, Maduro and Flores stood in the vehicle’s turret, while Venezuelan military personnel rode on the back. In the videos and photographs that the Venezuelan leader released himself, you can see the entire escapade if hardly as impressive a display of martial strength as Maduro’s fist-waving and talk of his country’s “warrior spirit” clearly seeks to imply. Small boats keeping close by in case of an accident as the VN18 drives around in a circle, never straying far from shore. In 2015, Venezuela’s Marine Corps reportedly took delivery of 25 VN18s, as well as 25 VN16s, from China, according to data the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has collected . The VN16 and VN18 are export variants of the ZTD-05 and ZBD-05 amphibious armored vehicles, respectively. Venezuela is the only operator of these fully-tracked armored vehicles outside of China. The two vehicles differ primarily in their armament, with the turret on the ZTD-05 featuring a 105mm gun, while the ZBD-05’s main armament is a 30mm automatic cannon. Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores ride in the VN18 at Agustín Navarro Naval Base., Office of the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela The ZTD-05 primary role is to act as an assault gun and support marines against light armored vehicles and fortified positions. The ZBD-05 is an infantry fighting vehicle configured carry up to 8 fully armed troops. For Venezuela, the vehicles provide an important maritime capability both in the Caribbean Sea and along the country’s many large rivers. The same deal with China also included rocket artillery systems, self-propelled mortars, and light armored personnel carriers, the latter of which went to the country’s National Guard. During his visit with the 41st Armored Brigade, which is part of the Venezuelan Army’s 4th Armored Division, the country’s only armored division, Maduro got to see that unit’s arsenal of Russian-made armored vehicles, including T-72B1V tanks, BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles, and BTR-82A wheeled armored vehicles. Unfortunately, there are no photos or video of Maduro riding in any of these vehicles. A Venezuelan T-72B1 tank., via dambiev Venezuelan BMP-3s., via dambiev Venezuelan BMP-3s on the move., via dambiev A Venezuelan BTR-82A., via dambiev Beyond just armored vehicles, Venezuela has purchased substantial amounts of Russian military equipment in recent years, including Su-30MKV Flanker fighter jets, Mi-17 Hip armed transport helicopters, and more. Before the country’s latest political upheaval, Maduro’s government had reportedly been in talks with the Kremlin about allowing Russia to establish an air base in Venezuela. The 4th Armored Division itself also has Russian-made 2S19 Msta-S self-propelled 152mm howitzers and various other armored support vehicles, some of which appeared to be heading toward the border with Colombia on Jan. 27, 2019. Maduro routinely accuses the United States, as well as its ally Colombia, itself a major critic of his government, of plotting to forcefully depose him in favor of Guaido, but has provided no evidence so far that this the case. Colombian officials have publicly said that they would not support any armed intervention, according to state media in Russia , one of Maduro’s principal allies. Previous reports had indicated that Colombia’s government had also made its opposition to a military operation clear in meetings with U.S. President Trump and members of his administration. However, NBC contributor Ned Price, a former Obama Administration official, said he and his colleagues had noticed an apparent note reading “5,000 troops to Colombia” on a notepad that Trump’s National Security Advisor John Bolton had brought to a White House press briefing on the situation in Venezuela and Trump has publicly floated the idea of more than one occasion . At present, there has been no announcement of a major US troop to deployment to Colombia and it is possible that Bolton’s shorthand referred to the Venezuelan deployment toward the Colombian border. At the press conference, the U.S. only announced it was sanctioning Venezuela’s state-run oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. , or PDVSA. Regardless, Maduro’s trip to visit various military units was clearly meant as a very visible signal to his opponents that he is prepared to oppose any attempt to unseat him by force and to show off his heavy armored forces, which could present significant risks and challenges to any such intervention. It also came after Jose Luis Silva Silva, the attaché from the Venezuelan military, officially known as the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela, or by the Spanish acronym FANB, at the country’s embassy in Washington, D.C., publicly announced he was siding with Guaido on Jan. 26, 2019. In a video recording from his office, Silva Silva urged his comrades in the military to join him, to respect the constitution, and to refrain from attacking civilian protesters who continue to demonstrate against Maduro. The FANB’s official Twitter account branded Silva Silva a traitor in a subsequent social media post. You can watch Silva Silva’s address below and can turn on English subtitles in the settings if they do not automatically appear. So far, the bulk of the FANB, including what appears to be the core of its heavy armored forces, remains loyal to Maduro and has been a key factor in keeping his regime afloat. There have also been reports that Russia may have sent shadowy mercenaries to help bolster the President’s position. Continued support from the country’s military will likely be one of, if not the key deciding factor in whether Maduro can retain his grip on power.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We reported about the crash of a Russian Tu-22M3 on January 22nd, 2019. The incident occurred while the jet was returning to Olenya Air Base in Russia’s frigid Murmansk Oblast around 1:30pm Moscow time, with reports of poor weather possibly contributing to the incident that supposedly killed three crewmen. A horrific video has surfaced of the crash landing that supports this account. The Tu-22M3 is seen approaching the runway at a high sink rate in very bad visibility conditions. The aircraft hit the landing area hard and fast on its main gear, stressing the airframe enough to snap the elongated structure connecting the cockpit and nose area to the fuselage. A fire is sparked at the point of the fissure and the nose, nose cone, and fuselage go flying down the runway separately. The cockpit section slides down the runway, nearly coming to a rest, just before the fuselage comes crashing down nearby, engulfing the wreckage in a huge fireball. The video is a reminder of the perils of operating in the bad weather conditions that permeate the Arctic region, an area that has become increasingly strategic in recent years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 25, 2019",Russian Mercenaries Reportedly Descend On Venezuela To Help Protect Maduro’s Regime,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has reportedly sent a contingent of shadowy private military contractors to Venezuela to help President Nicolás Maduro fend off a challenge to his authority from the President of the country’s National Assembly, Juan Guaido. It’s unclear what their exact orders might be, but whether they’re in the country to protect Maduro himself, assist government security forces, stymy a U.S. military intervention, or something else, these mercenaries only add an additional layer of complexity to the still-evolving crisis . On Jan. 25, 2019, Reuters reported that individuals linked to the now infamous Russian private military company Wagner were in Venezuela. The story cited Yevgeny Shabayev, the head of the Khovrino Cossack organization, who has his own background as a soldier of fortune and routinely speaks to the international press about Russian mercenary activities, as well as anonymous sources. Cossack organizations in Russia are quasi-official, semi-autonomous bodies of Slavic peoples that have historically contributed armed personnel to serve in wars and as internal security forces at the direction of the government in Moscow. Many of these groups continue this tradition today to varying degrees, sending individuals to fight on behalf of pro-Russian interests in conflicts in Chechnya , Georgia , and Ukraine . “Our people are there directly for his protection,” Shabayev told Reuters , adding that the mercenaries were there specifically to prevent rogue members of Venezuela’s security forces from detaining Maduro. He also claimed that Wagner had around 400 individuals in the country. A screen grab from an interview Yevgeny Shabayev gave Radio Svoboda, a Russian language news service that is part of the U.S.-government operated Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, in 2018. , Radio Svoboda capture After being in the grips of a devastating economic crisis for years, Venezuela plunged into an all-new period of upheaval on Jan. 23, 2019, when President of the National Assembly Guaido declared himself Interim President of the entire country and quickly received recognition from the United States, Canada, and a number of countries in Latin America. Maduro, who has long accused the U.S. government of plotting his overthrow without providing any hard evidence, has refused to step aside and still commands the loyalty of the vast majority of the country’s military and national police . In addition, Maduro has called for U.S. diplomats and their staff to leave by tomorrow, Jan. 26, 2019. The United States has ordered nonessential diplomatic personnel to leave the country, but has refused to shut down its Embassy and other facilities entirely, arguing that Guaido is the country’s legitimate leader and has asked the U.S. government to stay. An emergency United National Security Council meeting on the issue is scheduled for tomorrow. A caravan of US government vehicles leaves Simon Bolivar International Airport in Caracas after dropping off nonessential US diplomatic staff, who took a commercial flight back to the United States without incident on Jan. 25, 2019., AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd The Wagner mercenaries had already begun arriving earlier in the week before this standoff emerged, according to Shabayev. Other sources who spoke to Reuters said that the total number of contractors was far smaller than Shabayev’s estimate and that they had arrived in multiple groups, including one that only touched down “recently.” These individuals also did not confirm that these personnel were guarding Maduro. Maduro’s regime is a major regional ally of Russia’s and publicly available information shows a relatively steady stream of Russian government and Russian-registered aircraft flying to and from the country since the beginning of December 2018. Reuters reported that two Russian Air Force aircraft, an Antonov An-124 and an Il-76 , had been in Venezuela between Dec. 10 and Dec. 14 and that another Il-76 had been in the country between Dec. 12 and 21, but these are almost certainly unrelated to the deployment of any Russian mercenaries. Russia sent a pair of Tu-160 Blackjack heavy bombers to Venezuela between Dec. 10 and Dec. 14 with supporting personnel and equipment on board an An-124 and an Il-62 airliner. The report of an Il-76 during this timeframe may be a mistaken reference to the Il-62. The other reported Il-76 in the country around the same time could have been supporting that mission or otherwise delivering Russian-made weapons and other military equipment to the Venezuelan government as part of existing contracts . More to the point, it would be unusual for the Russia military to so visibly deployment of members of Wanger. This group, and others like it, exist specifically to give the Kremlin a plausibly deniable means of intervening in sensitive conflicts. Russia exploited these murky links and very promptly disavowed a group of Wagner mercenaries after the U.S. military killed hundreds of them in a skirmish in northeastern Syrian in February 2018. A chart showing various Russian private military companies, including Wagner, as well as the Cossack organizations, all of which have ties to the Russian government and have been involved in numerous proxy conflicts., InformNapalm.org Reuters ’ own sources said that the contractors used chartered aircraft to take them from unspecified locations where they had been conducting operations to the Cuban capital Havana. There they boarded commercial flights bound for Caracas. That’s not to say that the Kremlin isn’t directly involved in their deployment or that they haven’t been potentially overseeing their activities closely. On Jan. 23, 2019, a Russian government Il-96-300 belonging to the country’s Special Flight Detachment also appeared in Havana after taking a somewhat circuitous route from Dakar, Senegal via Asunción, Paraguay. Russia’s Special Flight Detachment also operates the specially configured Il-96-300PUs that fly President Vladimir Putin around and a similar in form and function to the U.S. Air Force’s VC-25A Air Force One presidential aircraft. The reason for the plane’s trip to Cuba or stops before arriving in Havana are unclear. Paraguay has recognized Guaido and Senegal has not publicly announced its support for either Venezuelan leader. It could potentially have something to do with the movement of Wagner personnel from Africa to Venezuela. In March 2018, there were images and reports that the group was training personnel or otherwise conducting operations in Central Africa Republic (CAR). Two months later, images appeared showing what appeared to be the same personnel near that country’s border with Sudan . Then, in December 2018, purported Wagner mercenaries appeared on the streets of the Sudanese capital Khartoum , reportedly to help put down massive protests against the government there. Both CAR and Sudan are essentially on the other side of the continent from Senegal, but that country could still have served as an intermediate stop for any individuals heading toward Venezuela. So far, no photos or video of any Russian mercenaries in Venezuela have appeared online that might help confirm their presence in the country and the scope of their deployment. But it would make good sense and be in line with the Kremlin’s increasing use of groups such as Wagner as a low-cost, readily deniable force for supporting its partners overseas without serious risk of becoming embroiled directly in any particular conflict. These proxies have become a cornerstone of Russia’s so-called “ hybrid warfare ” tactics. Mercenaries linked to the Russian government have bolstered pro-Russian separatist groups in Georgia and Ukraine , helped prop up Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad when his regime was at its most fragile, and more recently helped Sudanese strongman Omar Al Bashir in trying to quell major nationwide protests. Venezuela’s Maduro is one of Russia’s few major allies in Latin America and it is certainly in the Kremlin’s interests to keep him in power. Even just giving Maduro a more reliable security detail, as Shabayev said was the case when talking to Reuters , could be important. He was the target of an assassination attempt using explosive-carrying drones in August 2018. There were reports that some Venezuelan security forces had sided with anti-government protesters or otherwise abandoned their posts in the days leading up to Guaido’s announcement that he was assuming the role of Interim President. There remains no clear indication that the U.S. military is planning to intervene in the crisis, or even deploy forces to provide additional security at the American embassy in Caracas or other diplomatic sites. Still, it seems hard to believe that there has been no crisis response planning or movement of forces into position to better respond to various contingencies already. A U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport, using the callsign Reach 543, was visible using online flight tracking software making a highly unusual trip from Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia area into the Carribean on Jan. 24, 2019. It disappeared from radar before reaching its final destination, but was seen heading back to the continental United States just hours later. Norfolk is home to one of the U.S. Marine Corps’ Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams , a crisis response unit also known as a FAST Company. There are two more FAST Companies at the nearby Naval Weapons Station Yorktown in Yorktown, Virginia. Marine FAST elements regularly deploy overseas to bolster security at American embassies and other diplomatic facilities, as necessary. There is a major U.S. Navy SEAL presence at Dam Neck in Virginia, which is also close by. A FAST Company Marine stands guard during a training exercise., USMC Regardless, the presence of Russian contractors could change the risk calculus for any such operation. They could also present a deterrent to any potential U.S. government plan to try to more forcefully eject Maduro from power. Maduro’s Russian benefactors could have sent the mercenaries to guard the Venezuelan leader for fear that he may be increasingly at risk of ending up like the late former Panamanian President Manuel Noriega . In 1989, the United States launched Operation Just Cause into Panama to oust Noriega after a protracted crisis that has many similarities to the present situation Venezuela, including a disputed election. The murder of an off-duty U.S. Marine by Panamanian forces at a roadblock and the decision by Panamanian authorities to detain and abuse a U.S. Navy lieutenant and his wife, incidents that both occurred on Dec. 16, 1989, helped provide additional justification for the invasion two days later. There is a risk of similarly dangerous alternations in Venezuela now if Maduro orders government security forces to remove the remaining Americans from the Embassy in Caracas or any other diplomatic facilities. In the ensuing operation in Panama more than 30 years ago, American special operations forces rushed to detain Noriega. Noriega initially evaded capture by fleeing to the Vatican embassy in Panama City, where he endured 10 days of American psychological warfare tactics before finally surrendering on Jan. 3, 1990. Russia could also use the mercenaries as a way of testing the waters for their own larger, overt military deployment on behalf of Maduro, similar to its use of “ Little Green Men ” ahead of taking over Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. As noted, Russia has a vested interest in keeping its ally in power in Venezuela. After the deployment of Tu-160 bombers to the country in December 2018 there was a report that Venezuelan authorities had offered the Kremlin a more permanent basing deal . This would give the Russian an unprecedented ability to challenge the United States in its own hemisphere, the implications of which you can read more about here . Having a formal base in the country could only provide Russia a more permanent foothold to help support Maduro’s regime in the future. Sending the bombers to the country in the first place was a very visible signal of continued Russian support for the government in Caracas. Still, if Reuters ’ report is accurate, Russia’s active involvement in the crisis seems relatively limited in size and scope for the moment. But, at the same time, we’re only three days into the confrontation between Maduro and Guaido and their respective domestic and international supporters and neither side appears to be inclined to back down. Whether any Kremlin-linked mercenaries that are actually in Venezuela turn out to be key to ensuring Maduro remains in power or are a prelude to a larger Russian intervention remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Soldiers In Texas Are Putting The Army’s Newest Marksman Rifle Through Its Paces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army personnel at Fort Bliss in Texas are conducting a limited user trial of the service’s new 7.62x51mm Squad Designated Marksman Rifle, or SDM-R. This is the latest in a series of efforts to give individual infantry squads, as well as scout and combat engineering units, the ability to more precisely engage targets at longer distances. The service revealed the ongoing evaluations on Dec. 27, 2018, in a year-end wrap-up of developments associated with its new Futures Command, which includes a team dedicated to improving the lethality of individual soldiers. The first batch of nearly 120 rifles had gone to the 82nd Airborne Division and other select units in September 2018. “The Army’s current rifle technology is most effective below the 300-meter [nearly 330 yards] range,” U.S. Army Captain Weston Goodrich, the Assistant Program Manager for Soldier Weapons at the Program Executive Office Soldier, said in an official interview in June 2018 . Trained snipers, however, are not typically expected to engage targets less than 650 yards away. The SDM-R is supposed to help bridge that gap. The rifle is a variant of the Hecker and Koch HK417 , which is itself a derivative of the AR-15/M16 series that fire the 5.56x45mm round. The German-headquartered firm also makes a rifle, the increasingly popular HK416 , in the smaller caliber. The Army’s new 7.62mm SDM-R., Heckler and Koch The German-designed weapons dispense with the direct impingement operating mechanism of the earlier rifles, wherein every shot sends propellant gas carrying unburnt gunpowder and other particulate matter into the action, in favor of a physical gas piston. This largely eliminates concerns about the buildup of debris inside the main workings of the rifle that could cause it to jam. The SDM-Rs have an adjustable length buttstock and come standard with a Sig Sauer Tango6 scope, which adjustable from 1x “magnification,” or more accurately no magnification, up to 6x. The entire rifle weighs in at just shy of 10 pounds empty. This is around two and a half pounds heavier than the Army’s standard issue 5.56mm M4 carbine with a loaded magazine, but without any other accessories. Pictures of the SDM-R show it with two different kinds of handguards, one featuring the Magpul M-Lok accessory attachment system and another with the competing VLTOR Weapon Systems KeyMod system. Soldiers could use either type to quickly add flashlights , visible and infrared aim lasers, night vision or thermal optics, and other devices to their rifles. The rifles will also come with suppressors and the same images show two different possible types, the OSS Suppressors Helix-series HX-QD 762 and the earlier HX 762 from the same company. OSS has discounted the latter type, suggesting that the HX-QD 762 could be the primary suppressor for the SDM-R now. However, it’s likely that the user evaluation at Fort Bliss, as well as feedback from other units that previously received the weapons, will inform the final, standard issue configuration. The U.S. Marine Corps went through similar comparative testing of accessories in developing its new 5.56mm M38 designated marksman rifle . The Marines actually looked at the 5.56mm version of the OSS HX suppressor and determined that it had superior performance to the existing Knight’s Armament Company (KAC) QDSS-NT4 , but was difficult to install and remove, as well as maintain in the field. That feedback may have contributed to OSS’ decision to develop of the new, quick-detach model. A US Marine fires an M38 designated marksman rifle with a now-discontinued OSS Suppressors HX 556 sound suppressor during a test., USMC The choices the Army makes with regards to the accessories on the SDM-R could influence the final configuration of the service’s Compact Semi-Automatic Sniper System (CSASS), as well. This will also be an HK417-based rifle, but will be set up for use by actual sniper teams at longer ranges. Also known as the M110A1, the CSASS is set to begin its own limited user trials in 2019. “The Army is working to equip each squad with a predetermined amount of marksman rifles,” Captain Goodrich said in his June 2018 interview, but did not say what that number would be. Adding one or two of the weapons to each 9-person infantry squad would improve the ability of even these small formations to respond to certain threats directly without necessarily having to call in outside support . Heckler and Koch’s M110A1 CSASS rifle, also equipped in this case with an OSS Suppressors HX 762, which is no longer in production., Joseph Trevithick Studies have consistently shown that Army infantry squads and other small dismounted units are often out-ranged by opponents with their own rifles and machine guns in the NATO standard 7.62x51mm and Russian 7.62x54mm calibers. A weapon such as the SDM-R would offer an additional option for engaging opponents behind cover or other barriers, such as a window or the door of a light vehicle, which might defeat smaller 5.56mm rounds, especially at extended ranges. The 7.62mm SDM-R will also give small units added armor piercing capabilities over their existing 5.56mm weapons, something the Army has said it is becoming increasingly concerned about. The service canceled plans to equip some squads entirely with some form of 7.62mm rifle to address this threat earlier in 2018. Instead, the new marksman rifles will be able to use the equally new XM1158 armor-piercing round . The Army had tried to field SDM-Rs in the past using modified M16A2 and A4 rifles equipped with new optics, as well as specially configured M4 carbines, in the mid-2000s. These weapons suffered from the limited performance of even purpose-built “long-range” 5.56mm ammunition in the designated marksman role. US Army soldiers with M16-based 5.56mm SDM-Rs in Iraq in 2005., US Army The service ultimately began issuing rebuilt, modified Cold War-era 7.62mm M14 rifles . Unfortunately, those weapons proved difficult to maintain given the age of the base weapons and the lack of commonality with any other fielded small arms. The SDM-R may not be a long-term solution to demands for increased range and armor penetration capabilities within the Army’s small units, though. The weapons are relatively lightweight for their type – about the same as that of a standard infantry M14, which had no scope or other accessories – but 7.62mm ammunition weights significantly more than 5.56mm and is physically bulkier. A US Army soldier with a rebuilt M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle., US Army The Army is already investigating polymer- or partially polymer-cased ammunition to help reduce weight, but there’s no way around the size of the rounds. These factors impact how many extra rounds an individual can carry, as well as the weight and dimensional requirements for shipping larger amounts of ammunition to units in the field. The service is separately working on a program to develop an entirely new family of small arms that all use a so-called “intermediate cartridge” in 6.8mm. The goal is to hopefully provide ballistic performance closer to 7.62mm with logistical requirements more in line with 5.56mm. But this project, known as the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) program, isn’t set to get fully funded until at least 2020 . In the meantime, the Army expects weapons like the new SDM-Rs to help give small units an added punch against better-protected opponents at longer ranges.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 24, 2019",Detailed New Photos Of Russia’s ‘Hunter’ Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle Emerge: Our Analysis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, we reported on what appeared to be the first image of Russia’s much-touted, but never yet to be seen Okhotnik, or Hunter, unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) that had been in development for years and was supposed to start flight testing soon. Now, just a day later, new images have surfaced that offer up a much better look at the aircraft, as well as new insights into the drone’s potential capabilities and design limitations. Make sure to read our past piece of Hunter to get up to speed, but suffice it to say that these images show an impressively large UCAV. As you can see, it dwarfs the relatively large snow plow tractor that is pulling it, leaving the impression that it is similar overall in size to a medium weight fighter, although shorter in length and significantly longer in wingspan. Its dimensions appear to be loosely analogous to Northrop Grumman’s X-47B , if not larger in terms of wingspan as it doesn’t appear to feature the X-47B’s ‘cranked kite’ planform. The X-47B was roughly 38 feet long with a 62 foot wingspan. Russian Social Media Far more valuable than the forward hemisphere photos is this one from the rear. The aircraft is powered by a full-sized fighter jet engine that could potentially include afterburning capability based on the nozzle installation. This would be helpful for taking off at high gross weights, but beyond that, it would have questionable utility. The engine being used is unknown, but the Saturn AL-31F series used by the Flanker family of aircraft would be a logical choice. It is possible that a derivative of the more powerful AL-41F that is still somewhat in development could be used in the future, which may eliminate the need for an afterburner. Russian Social Media The engine type is not as important as the configuration of the rear of the aircraft. What we see here is downright crude by western low-observable UCAV standards . The engine exhaust section appears to be sunk into a trough that features classical ‘radar trap’ angles. Composite structures could help with reducing such a design’s radar signature from the rear aspect, but still, the design would be far from ideal. The nozzle itself is about as bad as it gets when it comes to reducing the infrared and radar signatures of the aircraft. Even if a lower-observable serrated round nozzle were added, such as one similar in concept to what is found on the F-35, this would still be a major issue when it comes to providing broadband low-observability, instead of being mainly able to elude and/or reduce the effectiveness of enemy fire control radars. Russian Social Media When it comes to thermal signature, there really is no difference between this aircraft and a 4th generation fighter, especially in terms of line-of-sight directly at the exhaust from the entire rear hemisphere of the aircraft. We have to also remember that this is a prototype. Maybe the final version will feature a redesign of this critical area. But we never saw that happen on Russia’s 5th generation fighter, the Su-57. As it sits now, some of the biggest potential advantages of a modern UCAV, broadband low observability and highly reduced infrared signature, have been forfeited in this particular configuration. It’s also worth noting that for larger stealthy flying wing aircraft, designing an exhaust to successfully reduce radar and infrared signature while also retaining efficiency and keeping the aircraft in control throughout its flight and thrust envelope is very challenging. The B-2 went through years of teething to get its planar exhausts to work without major material issues and the design is still considered sensitive technology. The X-47B never flew with its production representative exhaust. Instead, it used a less stealthy exhaust shroud during its testing career, which could have been refined on production aircraft. Still, this is nothing in comparison to the deficiencies seen on Sukhoi’s exhaust design. Smaller stealthy flying wings that use lower thrust engines seem to have less of an issue in this department. Still, there is no attempt seen in Hunter’s current design that even points to a low observable change down the road. X-47B during testing over Edwards AFB. Note the shroud extending from the exhaust. , DoD/Northrop Grumman Forward hemisphere low observability is by far the most important for traditional low-observable tactical jets. The idea is that you can kill the target before it gets a chance to look at your rear, or you can exit a vulnerable area fast enough to ensure survivability. Careful route planning supported by high-quality electronic intelligence, as well as electronic warfare support, can go a long way in overcoming this issue as well. But this really isn’t the case for a UCAV. The ability of these aircraft to persist for long periods of time over enemy territory while operating in kinetic and surveillance and support roles is one of their greatest selling points. The Hunter’s rear configuration will severely limit its ability in this regard. The air inlet’s position in relation to the engine’s fan face is also worth questioning when it comes to low observability. In the pictures, they appear as if they are fairly in line with one another, which would not be good for maintaining a stealthy signature from threat radars peering from the critical head-on aspect. We will have to wait and see if there is a serpentine duct or some sort of baffle and screen setup to help mitigate this issue. But a baffle is still not the same as serpentine duct when it comes to low-observable treatments. Considering what the rear looks like, it’s possible Sukhoi just went with a baffle system. Once again, this would be similar to what happened with the Su-57’s design. As we mentioned in our previous piece, the aerials and lumps on the aircraft will likely disappear after testing. But what’s worth mentioning is the odd configuration of the trailing edge flight controls and flaps considering it is being pulled by a tug. Also, the APU is running on the aircraft and the engine exhaust appears to be in an under power configuration. It’s possible that some sort of glitch or failure required the aircraft to be returned to a servicing area without being shut down, or it is being brought out while running for ground handling tests. The aircraft’s landing gear looks similar to the one used on the Su-57, which would make sense as Hunter and the Su-57 are likely to share multiple systems and are envisioned to work alongside one another. Russia’s Su-57 took a balanced approach to stealth while also incorporating some novel features that could help in its effectiveness and survivability. This was likely out of necessity, not choice and the Hunter UCAV adds more evidence to this conclusion. The Su-57s rear is far from ideal when it comes to low-observability, but this is less important for a tactical fighter than a deep penetrating and persisting UCAV. , AP Finally, I want to address some questions I have been asked after our first piece regarding how Russia was able to make such an aircraft in the first place. Knowing what we now know from these pictures, I don’t see how this is far outside Russia’s aerospace capabilities. Nearly every major power is involved with some sort of UCAV program at this time. China has a list of them ongoing and these are just the ones we are allowed to know about. So, it’s only logical that Russia, still one of the world’s most prolific military aircraft manufacturers, wade into this capability area as well. Flying the aircraft and turning it into a working and effective weapon is another story entirely. Just developing the command and control software and data-link architecture will be a significant and expensive challenge for Russia. But, it is important to remember that Russia was able to examine the RQ-170 Sentinel that fell into Iranian hands. In fact, they likely led the effort to exploit every bit of technology and know-how they could from the Skunk Works-built stealthy flying wing. Do not underestimate how much of an impact this had on their ability to at least know where they needed to invest development dollars to make a similar system of their own a reality one day. With all that said, it’s exciting that we are already getting multiple decent quality views of Sukhoi’s long-awaited unmanned creation. For now, we will leave the analysis there, but we will update this post throughout the day with new information as it comes available, as well as key takeaways from it.

VK The photos are reminiscent of the ones that came out of China showing it’s J-20 stealth fighter for the first time in 2011. It is quite possible that the image was a deliberately “leaked” as the Ministry of Defense has touted the upcoming flight testing for the UCAV since the Summer of 2018. The craft itself looks fairly impressive and substantial in size with a hardy landing gear that looks similar to those used on modern Russian tactical jet designs. The configuration appears to be loosely similar to something between Northrop Grumman’s X-47B and Boeing’s X-45C Phantom Ray , as well as other international UCAV designs. The blisters protruding from its fuselage are likely necessary systems for testing and not representative of a final production configuration. “Next year, the Okhotnik will enter trials. The work on this project is a priority and it is proceeding at a good level. In the spring, we are expecting the first flight of this drone,” Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko told the Ministry of Defense’s official television channel TV Zvezda in December 2018. “This is a serious task for us.” In November 2018 , An unnamed Russian ministry source had also told state-run news outlet TASS that the Okhotnik prototype had completed its first ground tests, including taxying and a takeoff run, at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association ‘s plant, which support’s Sukhoi’s research and development programs and actual aircraft production. Though it reportedly reached a speed of more than 120 miles per hour, the UCAV did not actually take off. The anonymous individual also said that the unmanned aircraft had accelerated down the runway and then slowed to a stop in a “fully automated mode.” The general weather conditions in the picture would match with the reports from Novosibirsk in November 2018, suggesting that this picture could be from those ground tests. The current weather there is also frigid and snowy, though, so it could easily have some time between now and then or even before, too. A previous picture purportedly of the Okhotnik had emerged in 2017 as part of an official Russian Ministry of Defense briefing slide. The much lower quality image did show a flying wing design roughly similar to the unmanned aircraft in the new pictures. The caption to the 2017 image had described the aircraft as “Okhotnik-B,” suggesting there may be or have been multiple subvariants or configurations over the course of its development. It’s most likely the earlier photo is of a subscale demonstrator. In addition, in recent days, one of Russia’s handful of Su-57s has emerged wearing unique markings showing the shape of a UCAV flying alongside the shape of Su-57 with a lightning bolt between the two. The bolt is universally used to show electronic connectivity and data sharing. A number of aerials are also new to the Su-57 in question, which would be used for data-linking between it and the Okhotnik. The manned aircraft could potentially forward that information to testers on the ground. Making the mission of this particular Su-57 even clearer, a shot of the aircraft from the bottom shows its digital paint scheme resembles the shape of a stealthy UCAV. The jet could be acting as a surrogate testbed for certain technologies that will go into the Okhotnik, as well. Russia’s move to developing a UCAV that is capable of manned-unmanned teaming involving UCAVs acting as “ loyal wingmen ” to Su-57s and eventually other aircraft makes a lot of sense. The U.S. Air Force, in particular, has been actively exploring the concept which you can read about in more detail here . But for Russia, Okhotnik could help overcome known deficiencies in the Su-57 design, which you can read about in detail here, and create a team that is truly more than the sum of its parts. This is in addition to using the UCAV as an independent asset or networked with other UCAVs for strike, surveillance, and electronic warfare missions. Separately, the MiG company has also been working on their own stealthy UCAV, known as Skat, or Manta Ray, the present status of which is unclear . There are also unconfirmed reports that this project may have helped inform the development of Okhotnik. Sukhoi and MiG are both under the umbrella of Russia’s state-owned United Aircraft Corporation. Whether or not this new image is of Okhotnik, or some other design, if it is indeed real it is the latest evidence that Russia remains committed to the development of a stealth UCAV. China continues to charge in the same direction , as does India , and countries in Europe are following suit , as well. Meanwhile, the United States continues to act as if this game-changing technology doesn’t even exist, at least publically , even though they proved it was incredibly promising a decade and a half ago. You can read all about this history and the odd paradox it that exist because of it in this past special feature of ours. If Sukhoi intends to keep to its previously reported schedule and have Okhotnik make its first flight later this spring, we might not have to wait too much longer to see how far the Russians have moved toward making their stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle dreams a reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 1, 2019","If The U.S. Has To Pull Its Diplomats Out Of Venezuela, Here’s How They Would Do It","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Venezuela is in the midst of major civil unrest following the decision by the President of the country’s National Assembly, Juan Guaido, to declare himself the new Interim President of Venezuela. The United States, among others, has recognized Guaido, creating a standoff of sorts with the regime of the country’s embattled President Nicolás Maduro . While the chances for a major military intervention still seem low, the U.S. military could find itself deploying forces to the country soon in order to help U.S. diplomats and other American nationals evacuate or to provide additional security at diplomatic and other U.S. government facilities. On Jan. 23, 2019, Guaido made his announcement in front of throngs of supporters in Caracas who had turned out to protest Maduro’s government, which is widely seen as responsible for a protracted and widespread economic crisis that has led to shortages of food and other basic necessities in recent years. Maduro began his second term earlier this month after winning an election in 2018 that many observers said was neither free nor fair . U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration, which have been vocal critics of the increasingly dictatorial Venezuelan leader, were quick to announce their support for the new interim president. Canada and nearly a dozen Central and South American countries have followed suit in recognizing Guaido, so far. “In its role as the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people, the National Assembly invoked the country’s constitution to declare Nicolas Maduro illegitimate, and the office of the presidency therefore vacant,” Trump said in a statement on Jan. 23, 2019 . “The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law.” Bolivia , Cuba , and Mexico have expressed continued support for Maduro, as have lawmakers in his major foreign ally, Russia. Turkey, whose own President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan routinely faces international criticism for undemocratic policies, has also reportedly sided with the embattled Venezuelan leader. Maduro, unsurprisingly, has denounced Guaido’s decision and his foreign supporters, especially the United States, and has ordered all U.S. diplomats and staff out of the country within 72 hours. The Venezuelan president has long accused the United States of actively conspiring to overthrow his government without providing any hard evidence to support those claims. In August 2018, he survived an assassination attempt involving explosive-laden drones, which he promptly blamed on the United States, as well as its major regional ally Colombia, which has also been a vocal critic of his regime. Venezuelan security forces work to disperse protestors in Caracas on Jan. 23, 2019., Rayner Pena/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images However, Guaido says that any orders or directives coming from Maduro are no longer legitimate and has said American government officials are welcome to stay. With government security forces loyal to Maduro trying to violently disperse protestors and other reports of domestic upheaval , the U.S. government could easily decide to draw down its diplomatic staff or otherwise help American nationals evacuate to safety. At the same time, it could deploy additional troops to bolster security at facilities where any U.S. personnel remain in place. We have reached out to State already for more information about the steps it is taking, but have not received a response at the time of writing. CNN has reported that the Department has no plans to evacuate its personnel from the country at present since the U.S.-recognized president has not asked them to leave. A satellite image of the US Embassy compound in Caracas., Google Earth This will automatically put those individuals in a riskier situation given that a significant portion of Venezuela’s security forces remain loyal to Maduro at this point and could end up under orders to more forcefully eject American diplomats, or decide to take matters into their own hands if the situation worsens. Venezuelan troops and police might also look to harass their families or other U.S. citizens in the country, concerns that the U.S. also used to justify its military intervention into Panama in 1989. But absent any direct order from Trump to the Pentagon to intervene militarily in the crisis, something he has floated publicly in the past, the U.S. State Department will remain the lead agency for any such security decisions in the country. As such, State would be the one to first request any support for an evacuation or additional security from the Department of Defense. If the security situation were to devolve to a particularly precarious point, the State Department could look to employ its own fleet of light aircraft or chartered commercial airplanes to get U.S. government employees and American citizens out of the country first. It could similarly deploy additional Diplomatic Security Service personnel to guard the Embassy in Caracas and any other diplomatic facilities in Venezuela. A member of the Diplomatic Security Service runs around a corner during a training exercise in 2017., State Department State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, better known as INL , has a significant presence in neighboring Colombia, too, to support counter-narcotics activities. As such, the Department might already have assets, including light aircraft, well-positioned to help. Long-standing relations between the U.S. and Colombia, including major defense and security ties, as well as the latter country’s opposition to Maduro, would make it a likely staging ground for any contingency response. Unfortunately, State is one of a number of U.S. government departments that are currently operating in a limited capacity due to a partial government shutdown . This could potentially limit the response forces it can deploy itself and how readily it might be able to hire contractors to provide additional support. A map showing INL’s operating locations and forward deployed aircraft in Colombia as of 2013. The number and location of these sites may have changed since then, but INL still has a major presence in the country., State Department Whether not State has already requested any support from the Pentagon, the U.S. military is certainly standing by to provide support, if necessary, as well. In the aftermath of the infamous attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, the U.S. military instituted an over-arching contingency response plan known as Operation New Normal . U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) would have to have its own additional regional plans in place to carry out crisis response missions in Central and South America. At the time of writing, SOUTHCOM had not yet responded to our queries about how the command might be responding or preparing to respond to the new developments in Venezuela. One of the most common U.S. military responses to situations such as the one still developing in Venezuela is to deploy members of one of the Marine Corps’ Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams , or FAST Companies. These units already have a long-standing relationship with the State Department and offer a readily scalable and rapidly deployable additional security force for Embassies and other diplomatic sites. FAST Company Marines in Europe demonstrate their riot control capabilities., USMC There are presently three FAST Companies based in the United States that could easily mobilize for duty in Venezuela. Depending on the exact mission requirements, these units could deploy with various small arms, including .50 caliber machine guns and Mk 19 40mm automatic grenade launchers, as well as a variety of less-than-lethal crowd control weapons and other related equipment, some of which is seen in the video below. Another option would be to mobilize special operations forces, either in the United States or forward deployed for other missions closer to Venezuela. U.S. Special Operations Command already has a so-called Special Operations Command (Forward) headquarters element in Colombia to oversee special operations activities in that country and elsewhere in the region. There is also the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force-Southern Command (SPMAGTF-SC), which is forward deployed at Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras specifically to respond to regional contingencies in Central and South America. First established in 2015 , this task force is made up of rotating units, which have at times included detachments of KC-130 Hercules aircraft, CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters, and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors. The KC-130s can act as transports or aerial tankers for the CH-53Es and MV-22s, allowing the entire force to self-deploy across extended distances. There are also U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawks and CH-47 Chinooks at Soto Cano, but these do not have aerial refueling capability. It is still more than 1,400 miles from Soto Cano to Caracas, though, so any force deploying from there would almost certainly make stops along the way in other friendly countries that have recognized Venezuela’s Guaido, such as Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. SPMAGTF-SC CH-53Es at Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras in June 2018. , USMC The U.S. military could also decide to mobilize forces within the United States and deploy them through avenues that might put them closer to the target area, such as staging them in Puerto Rico, which sits around 500 miles north of Caracas. The United States also has access to an established forward operating location on the Dutch island of Curaçao , which is less than 200 miles to the northwest. The U.S. Air Force regularly deploys aircraft there, primarily for counter-narcotics operations , including E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) radar planes, KC-135R tankers , and C-130 Hercules transports. Any C-130s that might be there could easily find themselves tasked with a short-notice rescue mission if it comes to that. In 2016, a Hercules crew in Djibouti in East Africa similarly woke up to find themselves headed to evacuate American diplomatic staff from South Sudan , the very first mission initiated under Operation New Normal. Back to front, a pair of E-3 Sentrys, an RC-135V/W Rivet Joint, and two KC-135R tankers sit on the ramp at the forward operating location on Curaçao., USAF Regardless, that forward site could easily serve as an important staging base or lilypad for any contingency operations into Venezuela. The United States likely has similar agreements to make use of airports and air bases in friendly countries in the region during a contingency. Using U.S. Navy ships already in the Caribbean Sea as improvised sea bases could be another option if larger amphibious assault ships are not available. That service also did just demonstrate its ability to deploy a small amphibious unit, called Littoral Combat Group One (LCG-1), which consisting of an Arleigh Burke -class destroyer , a San Antonio -class landing platform dock, and an embarked Marine task force. The group returned to the United States in December 2018 after making stops across South America, but could serve as a model for a new deployment to respond to the new situation in Venezuela. The San Antonio -class landing platform dock USS Somerset sails off the coast of Chile in December 2018 during her deployment with Litorral Combat Group One. , USN Whatever course of action the U.S. military might take could encounter significant dangers. One of the most apparent is that the Venezuelan military has significant stockpiles of Russian-made man-portable shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as MANPADS . These weapons could be a major threat, especially to low- and slow-flying transport aircraft and helicopters. If the security situation in Venezuela deteriorates significantly, those weapons may proliferate to local militias and other less professional groups, increasing the potential risks. At time goes on, there may be less and less reliable intelligence about the disposition and intent of any possible hostile forces, which will only make things more complex and potentially dangerous. There is also the distinct possibility that any significant deployment of American military personnel could prompt a violent response from government security forces loyal to Maduro or among portions of the Venezuelan population who continue to support him. While there is no clear evidence that the United States has been actively planning a military intervention against the Venezuelan president, it is clear that the U.S. government supports Guaido over the current regime. On top of that, there have been numerous reports that President Trump has repeatedly asked about the potential of using military force to resolve the crisis in Venezuela and apparently met directly with actual coup plotters on more than one occasion. Other U.S. government officials and politicians have explicitly and implicitly called for a coup to unseat Maduro, which can only increase skepticism about America’s true intentions in the oil-rich country. Maduro himself might seek to call in outside support, including from Russia. Russian Tu-160 bombers visited the country in December 2018 and there had been reports that Venezuelan authorities had offered to let the Kremlin establish an air base on an island off the country’s coast. Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to support Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad in order to preserve Russia’s foothold in the Middle East. He may be inclined to do the same here, which could bring American and Russian forces dangerously close together in a chaotic situation. Russia could also simply help Maduro flee into self-imposed exile if his position becomes too precarious. It’s still far too early on in this new crisis in Venezuela to know for sure what will happen. We will be keeping a close eye on the situation as it continues to develop.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 26, 2019","Russia Shows Off Parts Of Its Controversial Cruise Missile System, But Not The Missile Itself","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time ever, Russia has publicly displayed the launch canisters for the 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile and its associated transporter erector launcher, or TEL, and offered new details about the complete system. The United States says the missile violates the terms of an important arms control agreement and has called on the Kremlin to completely and verifiably eliminate the entire system from its inventory. Russia’s Ministry of Defense presented two 9M729 launch canisters and a single TEL to foreign military attaches and the press at its Patriot Park theme park outside of Moscow on Jan. 23, 2019 . The U.S. also refers to this missile as the SSC-8. The Russians only publicly acknowledged its existence in November 2018 , though it has reportedly been in development since the mid-2000s . The 9M729/SSC-8 has an improved guidance system and a larger warhead compared to the older 9M728, also known as the Iskander-K or SSC-7, Chief of the Russian Missile and Artillery Force Lieutenant-General Mikhail Matveyevsky told attendees at Patriot Park. The general officer said that this resulted in a missile that is longer, heavier, and actually has less range than its predecessor. The new TEL can also carry four missiles, while the older vehicle associated with the 9M728/SSC-7 could only fire two before needing to reload. These claims are key to the Russian position that the 9M729/SSC-8 doesn’t violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , to which it and the United States are both parties. This agreement prohibits signatories from having any conventional or nuclear-armed ground-launched missiles of any type with maximum ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles. The launch canisters for the 9M729 missile and their associated TEL., Sergei Bobylev/TASS Russia says that the 9M729/SSC-8 has a range of just less than 300 miles, while the older 9M728/SSC-7 butted right up against the INF range limit. The Kremlin has also described the new missile as simply a modification of the older type. The United States is unconvinced and says that, according to its intelligence, the Russians have demonstrated the weapon at prohibited ranges by using a provision in the treaty that allows for land-based testing of missiles intended for air- and sea-launched applications. Russia denies that this is the case. The TEL for the older 9M728/SSC-7 ground-launched cruise missile, with a launch canister in the firing position., Vadim Grishankin In his briefing on Jan. 23, 2019, Lieutenant-General Matveyevsky further claimed that, during the period that the Americans said the 9M729/SSC-8 tests occurred at the Kapustin Yar test facility, the only missiles the Russians fired from there at INF-prohibited ranges were intercontinental ballistic missiles . These weapons are covered under a different U.S.-Russia arms control agreement . It remains unclear why Russia would choose to develop a new variant of the 9M728/SSC-7 that is longer and requires a larger TEL and not at least match the range of the older missile. The Kremlin also insists that there is no way to readily modify the missiles to fly further. A rear view of the new TEL for the 9M729 missile., Sergei Bobylev/TASS Since the display at Patriot Park only showed the launch canisters and not the missiles themselves, it is difficult to judge the validity of any of the Russian claims against its visible size, configuration, and features. Even if the Kremlin’s position on this particular missile is accurate, it presents a verification nightmare. Russia says that the launch canister has a diameter of just over 20 inches and a total length of around 312 inches. The RK-55 , a ground-launched cruise missile the Soviet Union canceled development of after signing the INF, since it would’ve violated that deal, was only six inches longer than the 9M729/SSC-8’s launch canister and had essentially the same diameter. So, it is not hard to see how the Russians could develop a missile that fits within the same launch canister and that prioritizes range over an enlarged warhead. There would be no ready way to verify the contents of the tube visually, especially from satellite or other long-distance imagery. This may be entirely by design on the Russian’s part, too. As noted, until November 2018, the Kremlin did not even acknowledge the 9M729/SSC-8 existed. By announcing it and now revealing it publicly, Russia has had the leeway to apply that nomenclature to whatever missile it chooses. It remains entirely possible that the missile the United States identified as the 9M729/SSC-8 is simply not the one the Russians are putting up for display now. The TELs would also simply give the Kremlin a way to readily deploy INF-violating missiles if it not already doing so. This is almost certainly why the U.S. government had called for the elimination of the launch vehicles along with the missiles themselves, since it would hard, if not impossible to verify those vehicles were only carrying INF compliant weapons. A 9M729 marking on one of the launch canisters, which is about the only outward indication that they contain the missile the Russians say they do., Sergei Bobylev/TASS Unless the United States can declassify some of its own intelligence on the matter, the Russians may be putting it in an increasingly impossible situation and giving themselves additional room to blame the U.S. government entirely for what seems to be the increasingly inevitable collapse of the INF. In addition to professing its innocence, the Kremlin also continues to argue that the U.S. military is itself in violation of the INF through the construction of Aegis Ashore missile defense sites in Europe. These fixed facilities employ a version of the Mk 41 vertical launch system, versions of which U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers use to fire the BGM-109 Tomahawk land attack cruise missile. The United States insists the land-based variant of the launcher does not have this capability . “We expect that the objective technical data provided by us and the arguments that have been cited will lead to the intensification of the thought process in the U.S., which will help give another chance to a dialogue aimed at preserving the INF Treaty,” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said at the event at Patriot Park on Jan. 23, 2019 . “For our part, we continue to be ready for such work. It should be done with the mandatory mutual consideration of both parties’ interests and concerns and without any counterproductive ultimatums.” But it’s not clear where the two countries would be able to find common ground if one of Russia’s core interests is maintaining a weapon system that violates the treaty, or at least the capability to readily deploy one that does. That is completely incompatible with both the U.S. position and the treaty itself.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 2, 2019",Sig Sauer’s Tiny Copperhead Submachine Gun Looks Made For the U.S. Army’s Requirements,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reporters and members of the public are getting a chance to get their hands on Sig Sauer’s new ultra-compact MPX Copperhead at the annual SHOT Show firearms trade show in Las Vegas. The company is pitching the gun hard toward the U.S. civilian market as a 9mm “pistol,” but its select-fire version should attract interest from military and law enforcement units. It looks particularly well suited as an option for the U.S. Army’s requirements for a new, super small submachine gun . The American subsidiary of Sig Sauer, which has its main headquarters in Germany, first announced the Copperhead on Jan. 7, 2019 , but the gun had been in development for months before that . It draws inspiration and includes numerous features from the Rattler , the sub-compact member of the increasingly popular MCX rifle family . U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is evaluating that weapon already, which you can read about in more depth here . “The MPX Copperhead considerably reduces the length, width, and size of the MPX platform making it the most compact addition to the MPX family of firearms,” Tom Taylor, Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice President of Commercial Sales at SIG SAUER, Inc, told Shooting Illustrated in an interview earlier in January 2019. “The Copperhead is the perfect combination of the features and performance our consumers expect from a SIG MPX in a compact package.” Sig Sauer first introduced the MPX 9mm submachine gun in 2015 and now offers those guns with a variety of barrel lengths and the option for an integral sound suppressor. Additional, semi-automatic-only variants that are legal on the U.S. civilian market soon followed. The guns are externally reminiscent of the AR-15/M16 family of rifles and they also incorporate design features from the MCX series, which are derived, in part, from those earlier guns. But the MPX is an entirely separate weapon. The standard submachine gun type has an eight-inch barrel and overall length of fewer than 17 inches with its stock collapsed. An existing compact variant, the MPX K, cut that down further with only a four-and-a-half-inch barrel. A Sig Sauer MPX variant with a four-inch barrel and a side-folding stock on display the annual Association of the US Army conference in 2018., Joseph Trevithick Copperhead has a three-and-a-half-inch barrel and an overall length of just 14.5-inches. It’s also narrower than the standard MPX and has a shortened pistol grip, making it easier to conceal in a bag or under a coat. It weighs a mere four-and-half pounds, two pounds lighter than the full-size submachine gun version. The gun is so short it has a monolithic upper receiver and no separate handguard. The civilian pistol version keeps size further to a minimum by having a barrel with a flash hider machined right into the end. The military and law enforcement focused version has a more traditional threaded muzzle that allows the user to install different kinds of devices, including quick-detach systems for a sound suppressor. The civilian “pistol” version of copperhead with its distinctive muzzle., Sig Sauer An accessory rail on the top means the gun can accept various optics. With a gun this tiny, a non-magnifying, compact red dot or holographic sight for rapid aiming would probably make the most sense. The submachine gun version comes with an extremely low-profile personal defense weapon (PDW) style collapsible stock, while the civilian version has a collapsing arm brace, instead, to meet the U.S. legal definition of a pistol. Both types had a small accessory rail on the back to accept any of the side-folding stocks that Sig Sauer offers for the MPX and MCX families. As already noted, the MCX is seeing increasing sales, including to military and law enforcement elements. The MPX has secured a number of sales, as well. So the addition of the ultra-compact type could easily help increase that market share, especially to units focused on VIP protection and other close-quarters operations, where a small, portable, and highly concealable weapon with a higher rate of fire and far more accuracy than a handgun could be highly advantageous. These are notably among the core demands the U.S. Army has laid out for its Sub Compact Weapon (SCW) program. The service is looking to acquire as many as 1,000 guns for personal security details guarding senior officers and other “high risk personnel” in dangerous areas. The Army wants a gun that is 15 inches long or less with the stock in the collapsed position, has a barrel no longer than five-and-a-half inches, and weighs under seven pounds. The Copperhead meets all of these requirements with a lot of room to spare, as well as the service’s demands for certain features, including a collapsible stock rather than a folding one. You can find the full details about the SCW program’s publicly known requirements here . The MPX had already seemed like a leading contender given the gun’s existing features and the U.S. military’s growing interest in the weapon, as well as the MCX rifle series. In July 2018 , the Army hired Sig Sauer to provide a variety of weapons, including MPX and MCX types, as part of a large order for American special operators , other unnamed U.S. government agencies, and unspecified foreign allies . Copperhead, or a further version thereof, was almost certainly Sig Sauer’s final submission the SCW program, which should already in the process of evaluating the various entrants. That’s not to say it won’t still face competition from some of the other entrants. The Czech EVO 3 Micro is heavier and has a longer barrel and overall lengths, but still meets the Army’s requirements. A “pistol” version of the EVO 3 Micro., CZ-USA The SCW-9, a late entry from North Carolina-based Angstadt Arms, is almost as short as the Copperhead and actually weighs less. Perhaps more importantly, it uses the same magazines as Glock 17/19 pistols , which have developed a major following within the U.S. military, especially within the special operations community. The Angstadt Arms SCW-9., Angstadt Arms Of course, the SCWs are destined for regular Army units, so this might not matter as much. The service recently adopted Sig Sauer’s M17 and M18 as its standard service pistols. The Army’s timeline for the program envisioned at least down-selecting from the multiple submissions soon and that the final guns could be in the hands of personal security details as early as this year. So it may not be long before we know whether troops guarding VIPs will be carrying Copperheads or not. Regardless, we’ll be keeping an eye out for where else these tiny sub guns end up.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 27, 2019",Russian Tu-22M3 Bomber Crashes Near The Arctic Days After Two Su-34s Collide Further East,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Tu-22M3 Backfire bombers and Su-34 Fullback combat jets are grounded following a spate of accidents in recent days. This comes after Russian Minister of Defense Sergei touted plans for an uptick in major drills and exercises this year, in part to improve overall readiness. The most recent accident occurred on Jan. 22, 2019, when a Tu-22M3 crashed while trying to land at Olenya Air Base near Olenegorsk in Russia’s Murmansk Oblast, killing three of the four crew on board. On Jan. 18, 2019, a pair of Su-34s crashed into the Sea of Japan after reportedly colliding with each other. Search and rescue teams safely recovered the pilot of one of the planes, as well as the bodies of the two crew from the other jet. The fourth individual involved in the accident remains missing. The exact circumstances of these mishaps are unclear, but they are both under investigation. An unnamed source told state-run media outlet TASS that weather conditions at Olenya were poor and may have contributed to the Tu-22M3 crash, but this is unconfirmed. In both cases, the aircraft were on routine missions in regions that have garnered increased attention as of late. Russia and Japan remained locked in a dispute over the final status of the Kuril Islands chain in the Sea of Okhotsk, further to the northeast of the Sea of Japan.

Tensions over the issue have recently spiked and Russian combat aircraft, such as the Su-34s, routinely fly patrol and training missions in the Far East near Japan, often prompting the Japan Self-Defense Forces to scramble jets to intercept them . Similarly, the Tu-22M3 returning to Olenya could have been completing a training or other flight over the Arctic region, which has become increasingly strategic in recent years. On Jan. 1, 2019, the Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement specifically noting its plans to increase sorties in the far north and project heavy airpower more widely in the area, a significant decision that you can read about more here . A Russian Tu-22M3 bomber. , Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia In December 2018, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu also promised that the Russian military would step up its training plans overall in the coming year, with more than 4,000 major drills and some 8,500 smaller events across all service branches. These would take place both at home and abroad, as well. “Next year is going to be extremely busy. … The main focus will be placed on applying expertise in the use of troops in today’s armed conflicts and training commanders to effectively address non-standard tasks,” Shoigu said during a public conference call with various regional commanders and other officers. Snap drills, in particular, “makes it possible to pinpoint problems that are not very visible in everyday life,” he added. The Russian military has suffered a number of high profile aviation accidents in recent years. Most recently, in October 2018, an Aero L-39 Albatros training jet crashed in the country’s North Caucasus region, killing both pilots . In 2018, Russia’s forces in Syria also lost a Su-30SM Flanker fighter jet and an An-26 Curl cargo plane in apparent accidents, with the latter mishap leaving all 32 people on board the transport dead. In December 2017, another Tu-22M3 ended up damaged beyond repair after overshooting the runway at Shaykovka Air Base near the city of Kirov in central Russia. But with limited information from the Russian military, it’s hard to say whether these mishaps form a broader trend, such as the one the U.S. military aviation communities are experiencing at present after years of sustained combat operations with limited time and funds for routine training and maintenance. If the Kremlin is trying to increase the tempo of military aviation activities, it could similarly increase the strain on units to keep their aircraft flying. At the same time, of course, there is always some amount of risk of pilot error, sudden shifts in environmental conditions, or bird strikes , among other things , all of which can lead to serious accidents. We will certainly be keeping an eye out to see if the Russian military’s “extremely busy” 2019 correlates in any way with an uptick in aviation mishaps.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 16, 2018",The Army Wants Israel’s Iron Dome Missile System To Swat Down Cruise Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army wants to buy two batteries worth of Israel’s Iron Dome defense system. Though its primary targets are rockets and other artillery rounds, in American service one of its main jobs will be to provide localized defense against incoming cruise missiles , a threat given new attention in the Pentagon’s recent Missile Defense Review . Inside Defense was first to report on the acquisition plan on Jan. 9, 2019, after obtaining a memorandum that the Army’s top procurement official Bruce Jette had sent to members of Congress outlining the details. In total, the service is looking to purchase a dozen launchers, two associated radars, a pair of battle management systems, and 240 individual Tamir interceptors, at a total cost of more than $370 million. The Army wants legislators to agree to shift more than $290 million within its existing budget to buying the acquisition process and the service will ask for the remaining amount, almost $84 million, in its budget request for the 2020 fiscal year. “We want to have some things in place that provide us some immediate protection,” Jette said in a later statement according to The Times of Israel . “So what that’s going to do is we’re going to look at things that are readily available.” The latest U.S. National Defense Strategy , which that the Pentagon released in January 2018, specifically highlighted the threat of cruise missiles, especially from potential near-peer adversaries, such as Russia and China . In the annual defense policy bill for the 2019 Fiscal Year, Congress made it a legal requirement for the Army to have two batteries of a system capable of providing an interim cruise missile defense capability operational by 2020. An Iron Dome launcher., Joseph Trevithick The new Missile Defense Review , which the Pentagon released on Jan. 17, 2019, further reinforced this requirement for cruise missile defense and added an entirely new emphasis on countering this particular threat as part of the over-arching U.S. missile defense strategy. The previous review, which President Barack Obama’s Administration released in 2010, did not mention cruise missiles at all. The Army had first announced it was considering Iron Dome for this interim cruise missile defense requirement in August 2018 . Jette’s report to Congress said that the Tamir interceptor had a demonstrated capability against cruise missiles, but offered no details about its exact performance in testing either in Israel or the United States. Tamir is extremely fast and nimble, which would make it well suited to the cruise missile defense role. The service also evaluated the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System ( NASAMS ), a cooperative development between U.S. defense contractor Raytheon and Norway’s Kongsberg. The last option was an improved version of the Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) already in the works as part of the Army’s own Indirect Fire Protection Capability, Increment 2 – Intercept, or IFPC Inc 2-I , effort. A NASAMS launcher., Dutch Ministry of Defense Iron Dome was the only system that could meet the Army’s requirements, including availability and cost, according to Jette . The defense system is already in service in Israel, where it has seen extensive real-world use against incoming rockets, artillery rounds, and missiles and boasts an impressive success rate , though some critics contend the official reports may be exaggerated . Regardless, the system remains in very active use and just on Jan. 20, 2019, Iron Dome batteries shot down an incoming rocket heading toward Israel from Syria. Israel blamed the launch on Iranian and Iranian backed forces in that country and launched a flurry of retaliatory strikes , destroying weapons stockpiles and air defense sites. Iron Dome’s Tamir interceptor also has a reported unit price of between $100,000 and $150,000 . In contrast, the latest missiles for the Army’s Patriot surface-to-air missile system , the service’s primary air defense weapon at present, cost around $2 million each – almost as much a single $4 million Iron Dome launcher . A Patriot missile blasts out of its launcher., Raytheon The NASAMS missile, a ground-launched version of the AIM-120 air-to-air missile, has a price tag of around $800,000 . The U.S. military also has this system in service to protect the airspace around Washington, D.C . The Army has become increasingly aware of the glaring gap in lower cost and shorter-range air defense options and has been working to rectify that with Multi-Mission Launcher. So far, the truck-mounted launcher has demonstrated its ability to fire the AIM-9X Sidewinder heat-seeking missile, the AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire millimeter-wave radar-guided missile, a small interceptor from Lockheed Martin known as Miniature Hit-to-Kill (MHTK), and Tamir. It remains in development, though. Despite being a foreign-designed system, the Iron Dome program has received significant U.S. funding and is now readily available in the U.S. market thanks to a partnership between Israeli manufacturer Rafael and Raytheon. The American company now produces 70 percent of the Tamir interceptor in the United States and has the rights to market the entire system to the U.S. government. “Things that are readily available may meet some of our requirements but not all of our requirements,” Jette, the Army’s top procurement official, noted . “But we may be able to deal with those things that are, I don’t want to call them necessarily shortcomings, they’re [not], because something’s not a shortcoming if you never planned to do it.” Congress has stipulated that the Army deploy two additional batteries of cruise missile defense systems by 2023, but there does not appear to be a requirement that these be the same weapons necessarily. The service plans to spend $1.6 billion through the 2024 Fiscal Year integrating Iron Dome with its existing sensors, including its AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel air defense radar, and command and control networks, which could result in a hybrid system mixing Tamir interceptors and their launchers with more American-made components. An AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel radar., Canadian Forces Providing American Iron Dome systems with improved sensors, and linking the batteries together in such a way that they can leverage additional offboard sensors to help spot targets and engage them, could be especially important. Cruise missiles typically fly nap-of-the-earth flight profiles and use irregular routes to help mask their approach, which has historically made them difficult to spot and shoot down. On top of that, advanced cruise missile designs increasingly have stealthy features , can change course in flight , sometimes autonomously or semi-autonomously, and fly at ever increasing speeds . All of this allows them to better dodge enemy defenses and otherwise reduce their vulnerability to interceptors. Iron Dome may also have demonstrated a capability against cruise missiles in testing, but its main opponent since it became operational in Israel in 2010 has been relatively slow-moving, unguided artillery rockets and mortar rounds. Whether its existing success rate is truly reflective of its ability to engage faster and more advanced threats remains to be seen. The video below shows a Russian Iskander-K ground-launched land-attack cruise missile system in action during a drill. https://youtube.com/watch?v=WwZqOIA6Yug Regardless, the Army’s decision to buy Iron Dome in an “interim” capacity could give the system a leg up in the future. As noted, the service’s MML, which it hopes will become a core component of a new set of short-range air defense systems, already works with Tamir. Buying Iron Dome means the Army will gain the benefits of a premier system for countering rockets, artillery, and mortars, also known as C-RAM, too. As such, any Iron Dome battery positioned to defend friendly forces against cruise missiles will also offer protection against these additional threats and more, including increasingly threatening small drones . The standard Iron Dome launcher has 20 interceptors ready to go, giving it significant magazine depth against massed targets, as well. Each MML has 15 cells, which could accommodate Tamir, or a mix of Tamir and other missiles, as well. All of this makes Iron Dome and its interceptors a more flexible addition to the Army’s overall plans for a new, layered integrated air defense arrangement . The Army is also working with the Marine Corps on the IFPC Inc 2-I program and that service could be very interested in adopting Iron Dome or otherwise integrating the Tamir interceptor with a future launcher. As with the Army, the Marines have found themselves lacking adequate short-range air defenses as threats from traditional aircraft and helicopters, small drones, missiles, and long-range artillery systems have continued to re-emerge. In the meantime, Congress’ immediate requirement is clear and the Army is pushing ahead to have its first two Iron Dome batteries operational and protecting troops next year.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 19, 2019",USS Kearsarge Transits The Suez Canal With Anti-Drone Buggies Keeping Watch On Deck,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The threat of small commercially available drones looms large over the U.S. military . After years of dragging its feet , the Battle of Mosul finally awoke the Pentagon as to just how complex and vexing the threat from these systems is. Now, ever more elaborate anti-drone defense concepts are hitting the field under rushed procurement concepts. One of those is the Light Marine Air Defense Integrated System (LMADIS), a highly mobile anti-drone solution that rides on a pair of Polaris MRZR buggies , and now the Corps is getting creative about how they put this capability to use. A great example of this is the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge’s recent transit through the Suez Canal, in which LMADIS sat strapped to its deck, providing a much-needed albeit asymmetric defense for the multi-billion dollar technology packed warship. Yes, it’s somewhat bewildering to think that a vessel like Kearsarge , which has four layers of air defense all by itself, ranging out hundreds of miles with its AIM-120 equipped AV-8B+ Harriers, to dozens of miles with its Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles , to up-close in personal with its Rolling Airframe Missiles and Phalanx close-in weapons system needs a little buggy chained to its deck to detect, classify, and fend-off weaponized drones that can be bought at retail electronics shops. But this is the nature and pace of the threat and there are few places where a large capital ship is as vulnerable to attack than in the tight confines of the Suez Canal, which sits alongside a known hotbed for militants activities. USMC With this in mind, putting the LMADIS to use during such a transit makes great sense and it’s likely an indication of what’s to come in the future as similar systems become integrated directly on U.S. Navy ships or are deployed in a modular concept better adapted for the maritime mission. LMADIS consists of the RADA RPS-42 hemispheric air surveillance AESA radar system mounted atop a MRZR buggy . The short-range S-band radar is highly sensitive and can spot multiple types of targets, including traditional helicopters and aircraft, as well as ones with small radar signatures like ultralight aircraft and small drones. https://youtube.com/watch?v=K_qIxeOUodI Sitting atop the radar system is gyro-stabilized CM202 multi-sensor optical ball. This is used to positively identify aerial targets day or night so that a far better-informed decision can be made as to whether or not a suspicious target is indeed a threat. An up-front control tablet is installed in front of the passenger seat of the MRZR. This provides sensor data and control of the system, including the CM202. Another MRZR is used as a command and control vehicle and it may or may not feature the same sensor systems, although the addition of a second RPS-42 set seems standard. This allows one unit to keep a big-picture view while the other uses the optical system to ID targets. Both are equipped with a small generator for stationary operations and the communications systems needed to support the system. USMC If the target is deemed unfriendly, a Modi jammer can be turned on to target and break the data-link between the drone and its controller on the ground. There is nothing that limits the LMADIS to ‘soft kills’ using electronic warfare alone. The sensor data could be used to cue kinetic weaponry and especially lasers in the future. USMC It’s not exactly clear how much information LMADIS can share with the ship’s own air defense system and vice versa. If the data can be more seamlessly integrated, the ship’s Phalanx and Rolling Airframe Missiles could leverage the tracking information from LMADIS, or in the future, a similar set of sensors placed around the ship, to kinetically engage hostile drone targets. But for now, the Modi jammer and upgraded FIM-92 Stinger shoulder-fired missiles are what the Marines are working with for small drone defenses during these types of operations. As the threat continues to evolve and becomes far more complex and voluminous , this will all change. USMC Beyond adding solid-state laser capability, which is already being pursued on multiple fronts , LMADIS is set to become a piece in a larger counter-UAS and low-flying air defense capability in the form of the Marine Corps’ Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) program . This will integrate LMADIS systems onto the Oshkosh MATV Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) as well as Coyote anti-drone drones , and a M230LF 30mm cannon, into one package. This concept takes LMADIS to the next level, giving it multiple hard-kill options and a platform that is more adaptable to different situations and combat environments. Considering that LMADIS is envisioned to be used with highly mobile Marines operating on land, adding an armored and more capable variation of the concept will be a welcome addition. These systems are just part of an expanded ecosystem of weapons that aim to revitalize the U.S. military’s waning short-range air defense (SHORAD) capability that has languished for decades. You can read all about this reality in this past feature of ours . Strapping down vehicles to a ship’s deck in order to provide point air defense capabilities isn’t exactly new even in this day and age of highly integrated weapon systems. Recently, Egypt took a relatively novel albeit austere approach to arming their French-built Mistral -class amphibious assault ships against low-flying airborne threats. They tied down U.S.-built Avenger air defense systems to their decks. The USMC has also used their machine gun toting ‘Growler’ MV-22 Osprey-transportable buggies for force protection on older amphibious vessels during transits in tight waterways. The Corps is also working with the concept of strapping LAV-25s , which pack the M242 Bushmaster 25 mm chain gun, and standalone BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile systems, to the decks of amphibious assault ships to provide enhanced defenses against swarms of small boats. Self-contained weapon systems like this are easy to repurpose and are traditionally less expensive than ones that need deep integration into a ship and its combat system. For now, these types of modular capabilities have mainly focused on countering lower-end threats, but this approach could become more attractive for countering more advanced threats and adding unique capabilities to ships and sea bases in the future. USMC In the meantime, the USMC’s new anti-drone MRZR buggies are being put to good and creative use where they are really needed most and are acting as a stepping stone of sorts to more advanced anti-drone capabilities and other modular weapons capabilities that can be inserted onto U.S. Navy vessels in the years to come.

From F-15s landing nose first at each other on the same runway, to the infuriating attack in Manbij , to finally getting to see what the new Missile Defense Review contained , to confirmation that China is indeed working on a regional bomber , the week wasn’t short on surprises or new information. We also broke the story on a much-expanded U.S. military footprint in Jordan and asked the question of who was the masked special operator who rushed into the danger zone during the terrorist attack in Kenya, a story that subsequently went viral. There were also some crazier reports, like Ghana’s not-so-super soldiers , Iran’s crazy claims on the Space Shuttle , and a mothballed Nike Missile command post that is being turned into a microbrewery . And no, we couldn’t escape the political warfare in Washington, D.C. as the national security apparatus was turned into a club that the heads of both parties took turns beating each other with . Still, there were many stories we didn’t get to. But it’s not too late. Welcome to Bunker Talk! This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t get to.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 6, 2019",These Are A Renowned Combat Journalist’s Favorite Images From A Decade Of Deployments,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Combat journalist and author of The Final Mission Of Extortion 17 , Ed Darack, has a new book out that captures in vivid imagery some of his most memorable moments with the U.S. military over the last decade. This has included everything from tagging along on combat patrols in the Hindu Kush, to embedding alongside armor in Iraq, to flying with aircrews on live-fire training missions over the American Southwest. Ed has been kind enough to supply us with some of his favorite images and abbreviated recollections found in his new book War Moments: Images & Stories of Combat in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Beyond . ​ ​​​ Ed told us a bit about his new creation, how it’s different than his past narrative works, and why he thinks people of many backgrounds will enjoy it: “War Moments is a collection of my 118 best war images, beautifully printed in full color, I created while embedded in Iraq, Afghanistan, and during training over the course of more than ten years. Each image has an associated “story behind the photograph” that gives each image so much more depth than just a simple caption. I’m really excited about this book because I was able to showcase modern war and the modern war fighter with both breadth of subject matter and depth of each individual image through narrative. Here are 17 select images I chose for an excerpt for The War Zone, each with a short caption and a note of where the image is located in the book. For the full story of each image, and over one hundred more images like it—and to get technical photographic details of how I got each shot (camera, lens, etc.)—get the book! I think both veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as non-veterans will really love War Moments . The veterans I’ve shown it to love it because it brings back memories, and non-veterans I’ve shown it to love it as it uniquely brings modern war and the modern warfighter to life—as it’s a fusion of both text and images, so they can see the moment in time, and read about it as they scan each image. Thank you!” So, without further ado, here are Ed’s images and the recollections that go along with them in his own words: “Ospreys at Night” – Page 64. I made this image while embedded with VMM-261, Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 261. This was during the very first MV-22 deployment to Afghanistan. I was super fortunate to be able to fly in the cockpit (on the jump seat, just behind the two pilots) for a number of missions, as well as in the hold of the amazing craft. Here’s one of my favorite images from the embed, shot at night as the Osprey’s spin up for nighttime operations. Ed Darack “Mountain Sniper Training” – Page 21. I shot this photograph at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center – one of my all time favorite places to visit. The image is of Joe Roy, a sniper I met during my first embed (in Afghanistan). We both happened to be at the MWTC at the same time, and I tagged along to get some images of him training, high in the Sierra Nevada of California during winter. Ed Darack “In the Highback” – Page 70. Tough Marines! This was during my first embed. I joined Marines based out of Firebase Blessing, in eastern Afghanistan’s Kunar Province, near the border with Pakistan. I shot this at the end of a weapons cache raid as we were returning to base, as an Apache gunship provided cover. The ride was painfully bumpy! So getting this image was not easy! Ed Darack “Out of the Dust Storm” – Page 68. I was at the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range photographing a large training exercise (at one point there were 42 aircraft in the air in the region) when this scene emerged. It’s an MV-22 Osprey, launching in the desert. The Osprey is an amazing machine, and incredible to ride in and to photograph from a distance. Here, one emerges from a brownout it created as it lifted off the ground. Ed Darack “Combat Engineers” – Page 50. Most people outside of the military have never heard of “combat engineers.” They’re an incredibly important and select group. Not only do they build all sorts of structures, but they also find hidden munitions, including improvised explosive devices, (using metal detectors and other implements). Here are two combat engineers I photographed at the end of a large combat operation outside of the city of Marjah, in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province. Ed Darack “Yodaville at Night” – Page 33. Yodaville is an incredible place. It’s a “city” in the desert, but nobody lives there. It’s not a ghost town, as nobody has ever lived at Yodaville. It was built for urban CAS (close air support) training, and meant to be shot at with bullets, rockets, missiles, and bombed. Here’s Yodaville at night, being attacked by helicopter gunships. Ed Darack “Mike, Oscar Mike” – Page 125. This is my friend Mike Scholl. It’s one of my favorite images I’ve ever shot. It’s during a combat operation in eastern Afghanistan’s Hindu Kush, specifically, the Pech River Valley region. I shot this image right at dawn, as Mike’s platoon had just ascended the side of a steep mountain during an operation to root out Taliban and Al Qaeda. Ed Darack “Hornet Versus MiG” – Page 47. I was very fortunate to be able to embed with a Marine F/A-18D Hornet squadron during a training exercise they participated in where they practiced air-to-air combat with the Royal Malaysian Air Force, who at the time flew MiG-29s (they now fly SU-30s). I detail how I got this shot in the book—it was a very exciting photo shoot, nearly two miles above the South China Sea! Ed Darack “Into the Pech” – Page 48. The Pech River Valley in eastern Afghanistan’s Kunar Province is incredibly beautiful. It is also incredibly steeped in recent military history—and when I shot this image, incredibly dangerous. I saw this image emerging at the tail end of a large combat operation and I raced into place to grab this silhouette of a Marine descending into the Pech. Ed Darack “Abrams at Rest” – Page 41. I shot this image at the end of a large combat operation north of the town of Haditha, Iraq. I was in a perfect spot to capture two Abrams perched atop a small rise, with the waters of Lake Qadisiyah in the distance, at sunset. Ed Darack “F-15E Strike Eagle” – Page 51. Look at all those hard points! What an amazing aircraft. I photographed this Strike Eagle at Bagram Airfield at dusk, just as the pilot emerged after returning from a close air support mission. Ed Darack “Canal Jump” – Page 88. I was embedded with a squad of Marines tasked with tracking down a local Taliban commander, and we did a lot of jumping canals. Yikes! This image brings back memories. Details, and one of my favorite captions, in the book! Ed Darack “Harriers Over Al Anbar” – Page 74. Wow, this was an exciting photo shoot. Here are two Marine Corps AV-8B II Harriers miles over the Al Anbar Province of Iraq. I shot this during a close air support mission – more details in the book! Ed Darack “Scanning the Distance” – Page 40. I shot this image during a large combat operation in southern Afghanistan. No, it wasn’t posed, but yes, I did see all of the elements of the image coming together and I quickly “pre-visualized” – and it was a very exciting moment, indeed! Ed Darack “Hornets at Dusk” – Page 84. I shot this image of these Hornets during a close air support mission in Iraq’s Al Anbar Province. I was where I was at just the perfect time to capture this moment—the Hornets silhouetted and breaking away. Ed Darack “Yankee Launch” – Page 123. I was embedded in Afghanistan during the first combat deployment of the UH-1Y “Venom,” the latest iteration of the venerable UH-1 helicopter. I was fortunate to be able to grab this shot during a combat operation this “Yankee” (phonetic for ‘Y’). Loved this moment! Ed Darack “Up Close with the Osprey” – Page 37. I shot this image during my time embedded with VMM-261, Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 261, during the very first deployment of the MV-22 Osprey to Afghanistan. These guys are incredible pilots, and I was able to witness some amazing moments, like this one. More details and many more images in the book itself! Thank you!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Singapore’s Ministry of Defense has announced that it is formally considering replacing its fleet of F-16C/D Viper fighter jets with F-35 stealth fighters . The vertical takeoff and landing-capable F-35B , in particular, could be especially valuable for the small Southeast Asian nation given its ability to operate independently of runways or potentially from the flight deck of larger amphibious ships the country also plans to acquire in the future. All of this comes amid rising tensions in the South China Sea as China makes increasingly forceful moves to assert its claims in the region. A technical evaluation from the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the Defense Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) concluded the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) was the “most suitable” replacement for the F-16C/Ds, according to the statement the Ministry of Defense released on Jan. 18, 2019. Singapore has approximately 60 Vipers, which it says it will need to begin replacing around 2030. “However, the technical evaluation also concluded that the RSAF should first purchase a small number of F-35 JSFs for a full evaluation of their capabilities and suitability before deciding on a full fleet,” the statement continued. “In the next phase, MINDEF [Ministry of Defense] will discuss details with relevant parties in the US before confirming its decision to acquire the F-35 JSFs for Singapore’s defense capabilities.” The brief release did not specify a particular model or models that Singapore might be interested in buying. The United States has not yet publicly approved a sale of F-35s to Singapore, either, which might help shine a light on the possible size and composition of that fleet. A US Air Force F-35A races down the runway at Hill Air Force Base in Utah., USAF That’s not to say that the U.S. government would be opposed to doing so. Singapore has been a so-called Security Cooperative Participant to the F-35 program since 2003. In addition, the two countries enjoy a long-standing defense relationship and Singapore has purchased a wide array of other U.S. made-combat aircraft, helicopters, and other military equipment over the years. U.S.-Singapore-ties have only grown in the face of China’s claim that virtually the entire South China Sea is its national territory and Beijing’s moves to bolster that position , including the construction of a constellation of man-made island military outposts in the region. Of course, Singapore does not make any claim itself to any portion of the body of water and routinely calls for a resolution through regional and international organizations . A map showing Chinese man-made island outposts in the South China Sea., DOD But it’s hard not to see the South China Sea, and China more broadly, behind Singapore’s renewed interest in the F-35. Singapore is heavily reliant on the maritime trade that crisscrosses through that body of water. Other littoral areas closer to home, especially the Malacca Strait, could easily become choke points in any wider regional crisis, too. “Even non-claimant states are dependent on peace and stability, freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea,” Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said at a press conference in August 2018 . “Even if you don’t have a conflict, even if there’s no conflict but there is increased tensions, immediately your shipping costs, insurance premiums will go up, it has a very real economic impact on us, on everyone.” China is only expanding its anti-access and area-denial capabilities in the South China Sea, especially when it comes to its made-made islets. Many of these have, or could readily accommodate, long-range surface-to-air missiles and shore-based anti-ship defenses that would present a significant challenge to any potential opponent in a crisis. The Chinese have also demonstrated their ability to fly H-6 medium bombers and smaller combat jets from those islands, giving them additional options to project power. This is to say nothing of the steadily expanding and improving surface ships and submarines of the People’s Liberation Army Navy . A stealthy fighter may simply soon become a requisite for any country in the region who is looking to present a credible challenge to those developments. The obvious threat the F-35 specifically poses has led Chinese media to downplay it and derisively dub Joint Strike Fighter operators in the Pacific region, which includes Australia , South Korea , and Japan , so far, as the “ U.S. F-35 friends circle .” As such, evaluating the jet is a logical course of action for Singapore given its relationship with the United States and the simple fact that the aircraft is in production now. At the same time, the country’s “fly-before-you-buy” approach shows that they’re willing to take the time to fully explore their options. Singapore’s F-16C/D Block 52/52+ aircraft are quite advanced and have already received significant upgrades over the years. The country is now in the process of upgrading those jets to the even more advanced F-16V configuration , which could help keep them relevant beyond 2030 if necessary. One of Singapore’s F-16D’s used for training new pilots in the United States. , RAF-YYC/wikicommons The RSAF is only looking, at most, to replace its F-16s with F-35s, as well, with no plans to retire the larger F-15SG Eagles in the near term. These aircraft are a derivative of the U.S. Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagle . A mixture of F-35s and F-15SGs, or F-35s and more advanced F-15s, would certainly help save on the operating and maintenance costs associated with an all stealth fleet. At the same time, this mix would have very real operational benefits given the distinct capabilities both of these aircraft offer. An RSAF F-15SG Eagle., USAF The F-15 simply has a larger payload and greater range than any F-35 variant. In a conflict, this could mean the stealth jets would work to clear a path through hostile air defenses and enemy fighters so the non-stealthy aircraft could conduct follow-on missions. The JSFs could potentially use their robust sensor suite and data links to feed targeting information back to the Eagles for strikes using stand-off weapons, as well. Israel has been a particular proponent of this type of tactical fighter mix with its own F-35s and F-15s and the U.S. Air Force now appears to be considering a similar arrangement with plans to purchase at least a small number of advanced F-15X aircraft . You can read more about this general concept of operations in this past feature from our own Tyler Rogoway. Beyond that, F-35Bs, or a mix of F-35 variants that includes at least a small number of B models, could offer important advantages for Singapore specifically. The country has a total area of less than 280 square miles, four times smaller than Rhode Island, meaning there’s not a lot of room to disperse conventional aircraft to make them less vulnerable to enemy strikes during a conflict. With its vertical takeoff and landing capability, the F-35Bs could fly from suitably reinforced roadways or other small concrete pads . Being able to operate independently of a major runway could also help the jets resume operations relatively quickly from established bases after an attack. In July 2018, Singapore’s Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen also announced that the country would replace its four Endurance -class landing platform docks with a new Joint Multi-Mission Ship (JMMS) sometime after 2020. Ng had first revealed plans for the JMMS back in 2014. The most likely candidate for the JMMS is a design based around the Endurance-160 and 170 designs from Singapore’s own ST Marine. These ship designs are almost 540 feet long with an estimated displacement of around 14,500 tons. Most importantly, unlike the existing Endurance -class ships, they feature a full-length flight deck. So far, concept art and models have only shown the new design with parking spots on the deck for five medium helicopters, but these vessels could potentially support limited F-35B operations. An artist’s rendering of the Endurance 160 design., ST Marine ST Marine could also craft a larger derivative more suited to the stealthy fighters. South Korea is similarly considering flying F-35Bs from its Dokdo -class amphibious assault ships, which are around 100 feet longer and displace some 4,000 more tons when fully loaded than the Endurance-160/170 design. Determining the exact optimal mix of F-35 variants, and how many aircraft it would make sense to buy in total, will surely be part of Singapore’s planned initial evaluation of Joint Strike Fighter. But with China only taking a more assertive stance in the South China Sea and the risks of serious skirmishes increasing, it’s not hard to imagine the stealthy jets flying with RSAF markings sometime in the decade to come.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 10, 2019",Political Flight Fight: Trump Yanks Pelosi’s Plane In Tit For Tat Move As Melania Jets To Florida (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With the U.S. government in the throes of the longest shutdown of any kind in American history, politics in Washington have become even more acrimonious than usual. In the latest drama, Republican President Donald Trump informed Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Representative from California who is presently Speaker of the House, at almost the very last moment that a U.S. military aircraft will no longer be available to take her on a planned trip to Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia. Trump alerted Pelosi to the decision in a brief letter on Jan. 17, 2019, delivered on the same day she and her delegation were scheduled to leave to meet with NATO officials in Belgium and U.S. military forces in Egypt and Afghanistan . In fact, members of her delegation were on a bus heading to an air force base right outside of Washington, D.C. when they found out. Though the President does not refer to it specifically in his message, the missive is clearly a direct response to a letter from the Speaker the day before, in which she had effectively disinvited him from the Capitol to give a State of the Union address at the end of the month. Both of these letters cite the shutdown as the primary reason behind their respective cancelations. The full text of Trump’s letter is as follows: Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan, has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown. Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would be your prerogative. I look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous Southern Border finally receive the attention, funding, and security it so desperately deserves! As this drama was playing out, plane spotters online watched as a C-32A bearing a callsign associated with First Lady Melania Trump took off from Andrews Air Force Base right outside of Washington, D.C. and began flying an otherwise typical route to Southern Florida. Throughout his presidency, Trump and his family have made regular trips to his resort at Mar-a-Lago, costing taxpayers millions and stretching security resources thin . The shutdown has been going on since Dec. 22, 2018, after Trump informed the leadership of his own party in Congress that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include additional money for a new border wall . Republicans and Democrats had looked set to pass a bipartisan deal that did not include the wall funding. In January 2019, the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and have since reiterated their intent to reject any new measure that gives extra funds for the wall and border security enhancements beyond the $1.6 billion they had previously agreed to. Though it seemed to be a political decision in part, in her letter regarding the State of the Union address, Pelosi had rightly cited how demanding such an event is on the Secret Service and other federal security services, some of which are now working without pay due to the shutdown. A State of the Union address involves putting the President, the Vice President, both chambers of Congress, and a host of other officials, dignitaries, and private citizens all under the same roof, which presents massive security concerns, especially for a government that is not running at full capacity. Trump’s citing of the shutdown in his own retaliatory decision is spurious, since the U.S. military is presently fully funded. U.S. military aircraft have performed dozens of so-called Special Air Missions shuttling high-level government officials around since the shutdown began, including Melania’s latest trip to Florida. A spokesperson for Pelosi specifically highlighted that that the President had flown to Iraq during the shutdown, as did a delegation led by Representative Lee Zeldin, a Republican from New York. On Jan. 17, 2019, Trump did cancel plans for a delegation to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland later this month, which would have used military airlift to get there. The exact chain of events leading up to the cancelation of Pelosi’s trip are somewhat muddy. It appears, on the most basic level, that Trump simply ordered the U.S. military to withhold the airlift support in his capacity as Command in Chief. The Office of the Secretary of Defense had originally tasked the Air Force’s 89th Airlift Wing , the U.S. military’s premier VIP air transport unit, which is situated right outside of Washington, D.C., to fly Pelosi to her destinations, according to Military Times . “The tasking has been turned off,” an unnamed defense official told that outlet, confirming that there were aircraft otherwise available for the trip. Despite Trump’s letter, that individual did not specify whether the order had come from the White House originally. Another anonymous senior administration official later confirmed this was the case, but insisted that the decision was part of a broader decision to ban congressional delegations from using military aircraft going forward until the end of the shutdown, according to ABC News . The timing seems particularly suspect for this to have been a more general decision. Especially considering that members of Pelosi’s delegation were on a bus bound to Andrews when they found out the trip had gotten canceled. Of course, Trump has no legal authority to restrict Pelosi’s personal movement or to prevent her from traveling to fulfill her Congressional duties. As he notes in his own letter, she is more than welcome to fly commercially to any of the destinations in question. But this might not be an option for the Speaker for security reasons. It’s not clear what type of plane Pelosi was scheduled to use for this particular trip, but it would likely have been one of the 89th’s four C-32As , commonly known as Air Force Two, or a C-40 , which are Boeing 757s and 737s in U.S. military specific configurations respectively. The Wing is also responsible for flying the two heavily modified VC-25A used as Air Force One , which are specifically set aside for the presidential airlift mission, as well as various smaller business jets . All of these planes have varying degrees of secure communications capabilities and many have directional infrared countermeasures systems to help protect the plane against heat-seeking missiles. One of the 89th Airlift Wing’s C-32As, at center, flanked by a pair of smaller C-20 aircraft., USAF These features may not have been necessary for traveling to Belgium, but flying commercial would simply not offer the security guarantees, either in terms of the plane’s specific defensive capabilities or airport security on the ground at any one stop, for such a high ranking American official flying to Egypt or Afghanistan. Just on Dec. 28, 2018 , a roadside bomb killed three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian tour guide who were visiting the pyramids at Giza, outside the Egyptian capital Cairo. Egyptian authorities blamed the attack on ISIS-affiliated terrorists based in the Sinai peninsula. That same group claimed responsibility for blowing up Metrojet Flight 9268 after it left Sharm El Sheikh International Airport on October 2015. Egyptian authorities move the wreckage of a tour bus after it hit a roadside bomb outside of Cairo in December 2018., Ahmed Abdelfattah/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images Afghanistan poses even greater dangers and much of the country is an active war zone. When then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis arrived in that country for a visit in September 2017, he did so, as most senior U.S. officials do, in a secretive, unannounced fashion. It was good that he did, too, because the Taliban quickly rallied their forces in and around the country’s capital Kabul to launch a brazen attack on Hamid Karzai International Airport just hours after he touched down. The city is so dangerous that regular U.S. government workers in the city use a special helicopter service to make the five minute trip from the airport to the U.S. Embassy every day. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his staff exit a contractor-operated helicopter at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan after making the brief trip from Hamid Karzai International Airport during a visit in July 2018., DoS So, while Trump cannot specifically prevent congressional delegations from traveling abroad, or anywhere for that matter, halting access to military aircraft can only make those trips difficult, if not impossible to plan. Beyond the basic security concerns, a lack of military airlift support could make these trips a virtual non-starter for the Speaker of the House specifically, too. Under U.S. law , if the President dies or is otherwise incapacitated, and the Vice President is unable to assume their duties, the Speaker is the next in line to take over the role of the country’s chief executive. What this means is that Pelosi, like Trump himself , is at the mercy of security assessments when making decisions to travel due to her position as the third individual in line to ensure a so-called “ continuity of government ” in a crisis. Until the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Speakers of the House had flown commercially just like any other member of Congress. Since then, however, it has been the standing practice to provide them with military aircraft to both ensure their safety and make sure they remain in constant, secure contact in case of any contingency. Today, it is the House Sergeant at Arms , who Representatives elect at the start of each new Congress, who determines the risk associated with particular trips and recommends the Speaker use military aircraft based on those assessments. They are also the one who then makes the request to the U.S. military to provide those aircraft as necessary. There is no apparent formal requirement that the Speaker must follow this advice, though. For domestic trips, past Speakers, including Pelosi, have regularly flown on commercial airlines domestically. But for longer trips outside the United States, where connectivity and security becomes a major issue, it’s unlikely that a commercial option would be well advised, if feasible at all. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi exists a U.S. military Cessna UC-35 aircraft during a visit to U.S. Africa Command in Germany in 2010., AFRICOM Pelosi is no stranger to these issues, either. After she first became Speaker of the House for the first time in 2007, her critics accused her of abusing the use of military planes to fly to and from her home in California, among other locations, and for using the more expensive C-32s rather than smaller aircraft. Reports and official records subsequently confirmed that as of the end of 2008, she only used a C-32 once , when smaller planes were not available. In 2009, additional documents showed that she actually used military aircraft for travel less than her predecessor , Illinois Republican Dennis Hastert and often times flew commercial domestically. In at least one particular instance, there was a particularly contentious debate within the Air Force itself about whether or not to meet a request from the Speaker’s office to have the plane reposition from San Franciso International Airport to Travis Air Force Base, which was closer to her home in the Napa Valley, but outside of the Congressional District she represented. An Air Force official made clear that this was not possible and that the White House and the Secretary of Defense only approved operations to and from Washington, D.C. and the airport in San Francisco, adding that even repositioning the plane nearby would cost thousands of dollars. Eventually, this conflict was solved by allowing the jet to fly direct to Travis, making only one stop and obviating the need for any repositioning. It’s hard to believe that Trump, or at least members of his staff, aren’t aware of the complexities of having the third person in line for the Presidency travel overseas and to a war zone. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders essentially admitted to ABC News later in the day that trying to limit Pelosi’s movement was the plan all along . “We want to keep her in Washington,” Sanders said. “If she leaves she guarantees that the second round of paychecks to workers won’t go out,” she added, an implicit threat from Trump to block some number of future funding bills if Pelosi does seek alternative transportation for her trip. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi speaks at a press conference on Jan. 17, 2019, after Trump effectively canceled her planned overseas trip., AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster All this is a very worrisome development for Trump and Pelosi, and any of their political opponents. To be playing tit-for-tat politics with the U.S. national security apparatus sets a dangerous precedent going forward and it’s not even the first time the Trump Administration, in particular, has reportedly used this kind of leverage to block political opponents from visiting sensitive locations overseas. At the same time, multiple administration officials have been placed under investigation for using federally owned or paid fo r aircraft for non-essential business . Beyond simply eroding basic norms, Trump’s last-minute decision also disrupts all the other associated planning that would have gone into the trip, including sorting out various security and logistics issues, among others. U.S. officials in Belgium, Egypt, and Afghanistan had no doubt made extensive preparations to receive Pelosi and her entourage. There’s no way to get the massive amount of wasted man-hours back and the money spent on various items and services may now be sunk costs, as well. All this also draws attention to Pelosi’s decision to leave Washington, D.C. during the longest government shutdown in history. Although her stops in Europe and the Middle East are clearly important, the situation at home is becoming increasingly dire. As such, jetting off overseas why federal workers can’t pay their rent and face financial ruin probably isn’t what most would consider “good optics.” With no end to the shutdown in sight, it, unfortunately, seems very possible that we will see more of these tit-for-tat political maneuvers, none of which do anything to resolve the current impasse, get the U.S. government back up and running, and ensure hundreds of thousands of federal employees get their paychecks on time. Update: 1/18/19— Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s spokesperson has released a statement saying that the Speaker initially hoped to continue with the trip by alternate means, but that an updated threat assessment from the Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service had indicated “that the President announcing this sensitive travel had significantly increased the danger to the delegation and to the troops, security, and other officials supporting the trip.” The statement also accused the Trump administration of deliberately leaking information regarding the alternative commercial flight arrangements.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Iranian government has an incredible appetite for putting forward hyperbolic technological claims and has little shame about backing them up those with outright laughable proof. It’s one thing to claim that a ‘new’ indigenously produced fighter aircraft that is at best a clone of a 50-year-old design is equivalent to America’s front-line fighters or even making the erroneous proclamation that Iranian industry has reproduced an equivalent of the RQ-170 unmanned flying wing stealth drone that fell into their hands in 2011, but making it seem like Iranian scientists developed the freakin’ Space Shuttle is a whole other level of bozo behavior.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 26, 2019",Here’s All You Need To Know About The New Missile Defense Review That Was Just Released,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than a year of delays, the U.S. military has finally released its long-awaited Missile Defense Review. The report outlines plans to improve and expand the United States’ existing missile defense shield, as well as add additional layers with space-based sensors and interceptors, technology to track and defeat hypersonic weapons, unmanned aircraft with lasers to shoot down threats, and missile-hunting F-35 stealth fighters, among others. The Pentagon officially released the unclassified version of the review at a rollout event led by President Donald Trump, who has become a major advocate for missile defense, a well as Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser John Bolton, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, and other senior officials, on Jan. 17, 2019. The U.S. military had originally expected this report to be ready before the end of 2017. “Missile defenses are a key element of our strategy given this proliferation of offensive ballistic and cruise missiles and emerging hypersonic weapons technologies that markedly raise threats to regional balances and to our major allies and partners,” Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan wrote in a preface to the review. “Our missile defense systems constitute a cornerstone of our efforts to deter a missile attack by a rogue state on the U.S. and make a clear contribution to our alliances.” Given how long it’s taken for the Pentagon to release the final review, the bulk of the content has already emerged in budget documents and other public forums. Still, the report further cements the U.S. governments intention to pursue these policies and technologies and we’ve broken down the key points below: Policy priorities U.S. Missile Defense Shield remains focused primarily on countering threats from smaller potential opponents, such as North Korea and Iran . Traditional nuclear deterrence remains the primary means of responding to existing and future strategic threats from larger potential adversaries such as Russia and China . The U.S. government has no plans to limit developments of missile defense technologies to focus purely on smaller actors. The Missile Defense Shield is a component of an over-arching deterrent posture in that it helps ensure the ability of the United States to respond to a massive attack on the homeland. There is also a call for continued and expanded regional focuses, as well, including greater cooperation and coordination with allies and partners, especially in the face of the growing proliferation of ballistic missiles. The MDR has requirements for various components of the U.S. military to complete a number of studies within the next six months to better formalize and streamline command and control and identify services or other agencies within the Department of Defense to lead efforts to respond to particular threats. The new MDR adds an entirely new emphasis on potential non-ballistic threats posed to the homeland and to U.S. forces deployed abroad, with particular attention on cruise missiles. The 2010 MDR focused almost exclusively on ballistic threats. An infographic from the MDR showing existing and future missile defense threats around the world., DOD Near-term technical developments Expanding the SM-3 Block II interceptor’s capabilities to allow it to engage intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, as well as intermediate- and medium-range ballistic missiles, or IRBMs and MRBMs. At present, the SM-3 Block IIA is primarily focused on engaging IRBM and MRBM type threats, though the Missile Defense Agency has long indicated its hope that it would also be able to conduct mid-course intercepts against higher and faster-flying targets. Add 20 more Ground-Based Interceptors (GBI) to the overall Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) portion of the U.S. Missile Defense Shield, which is situated in Alaska, for a total of 64. The purchase of these interceptors has been planned for some time and were first included in a request emergency missile defense funding that the Trump Administration sent to Congress in 2017. Continue development of the Redesigned Kill Vehicle, or RKV, to replace the existing Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle, or EKV, on top of the GBI. Previous reports have indicated that the U.S. military will begin deploying RKV-equipped interceptors in 2020. The RKV, like the EKV, is a kinetic weapon designed to destroy an incoming ballistic missile by smashing into it. The EKV has struggled in testing since the late 1990s and only intercepted a target representative of an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time in May 2017. Installation of Lockheed Martin’s advanced Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) in Alaska to support the GMD system. This radar is set to be operational by 2021. Improving existing land-based radars and adding additional sites in Hawaii and elsewhere in the Pacific by 2023. These new radars will have improved capability to spot and track ballistic missiles during the mid-course portion of their flight trajectory when they have “gone cold” in the vacuum of space and are harder to monitor. New space-based sensors to track ballistic missiles during mid-course flight, as well as additional satellites, positioned closer to the United States, or its territories or other interests abroad, to monitor those weapons in the latter stages of their trajectory. Both systems, the first of which could be ready by 2023, will be able to cue surface-based interceptors or other weapons to engage those threats. The latter satellites will also provide a critical “kill assessment capability” to determine whether an intercept is successful and whether personnel on the ground need to re-engage. The deployment of additional and improved Patriot , Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ), Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) ships, and Aegis Ashore land-based missile defense sites around the world to respond to more localized ballistic and cruise missile threats, such as those from Iran and North Korea. To support this the U.S. Army will submit a report within six months outlining the total number of THAAD units required to satisfy those requirements and the resources necessary to meet that goal. The U.S. Navy will similarly provide a review of the timeline and required resources to make all of its Arleigh Burke -class destroyers Aegis BMD capable. The Navy will also prepare a plan for how to activate the Aegis Ashore test facility in Hawaii as an operational site in an emergency situation . Further fielding of more mobile and readily relocatable missile defense systems and the further integration of those capabilities with conventional maneuver forces to protect them ballistic and cruise missile threats during both offensive and defensive operations. Improving interoperability of U.S. missile defense systems with those of allies and partners. The United States has already spent considerable resources to assist in the development of ballistic missile defenses in South Korea and Japan to counter threats from North Korea and across the Middle East to challenge Iran’s growing missile arsenal. A very general overview of the existing U.S. Missile Defense Shield as it exists today., DOD Novel missile defenses In line with the annual National Defense Authorization Act for the 2019 Fiscal Year, the MDR calls for exploration of space-based anti-missile weapons , potentially including physical interceptors or directed energy weapons, a concept you can read about in more detail here . Congress has already demanded that the U.S. military place such a system into operation “at the earliest practicable date,” though this does not guarantee any such system will ever be feasible. “We’re going to study it and we’ll see whether or not it’s feasible,” an unnamed U.S. defense official told reporters at pre-briefing on the MDR on Jan. 16, 2019. That study will be due within six months, according to the MDR. A laser-armed unmanned aerial vehicle that would be able to engage ballistic missiles during their initial boost-phase right after launch, a concept you can read about more here and here . During this phase of flight, ballistic missiles are particularly vulnerable since they are moving relatively slowly and are generating a large thermal signature making them easier to track and engage. Further exploration of potentially using the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as a boost-phase ballistic missile defense platform. The MDR asks the Air Force to produce a report within six months detailing how it would go about integrating a missile defense capability into the F-35. This is a concept that has been around for some time, but gained renewed traction at the height of tensions with North Korea in 2017. Though likely feasible at its most basic level, we at The War Zone have previously explained in detail why this concept will be extremely expensive and applicable only in a very narrow set of circumstances, calling into question whether it would ever be a worthwhile expenditure of resources. The development of systems to track and potentially defeat hypersonic weapons, which are only becoming an increasing threat. The MDR requires the Missile Defense Agency to outline the resources required for a program to meet those goals within six months. This plan would leverage existing work the Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have already done and would likely act as a follow-on or otherwise related effort to DARPA’s present Glide Breaker program. The MDR calls on U.S. Strategic Command to produce a sperate study within nine months assessing the present state and future requirements for early warning and engagement regarding hypersonics, as well as more traditional ballistic and cruise missile threats. A timeline in the MDR says the goal is to be able to demonstrate advanced space-based systems, laser-armed unmanned aircraft, and hypersonic defense options by 2030. A very general timeline of certain planned U.S. Missile Shield developments through to 2030., DOD All told, this review has been in the works for so long that little inside is outright new. The biggest single takeaway is the expanding definition of missile defense to more cohesively include non-ballistic threats, including cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons. Concerns about the threat of cruise missiles, especially to the homeland, have waxed and waned over the years , but advanced developments among America’s near-peer competitors have surely contributed to the resurgence of interest in countering those weapons. There renewed emphasis on new space-based systems , especially potential space-based weapons , is also significant. If the U.S. military goes ahead with plans to put weapons of any kind into orbit, it seems almost certain to prompt controversy and pushback. At the same time, without any existing arms control agreements regarding the deployment of conventional weapons in space, and with potential opponents, such as Russia and China , developing more robust anti-satellite capabilities, it’s easy to see how it could provoke an arms race. Expanding and improving the U.S. missile defense shield will require significant time and resources, as well. At present, it’s unclear whether or not the next defense budget will be smaller or larger than the last . When the budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year comes out later this month, we will likely get an even better picture of how fast the U.S. military expects to move in implementing the plans the MDR has outlined for the next decade or so.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 18, 2018",Russia Says Its Own New Weapons Are Exempt After Accusing U.S. Of Violating Nuclear Arms Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In an unusual move, late last year, Russian authorities sent a letter directly to American lawmakers complaining that the United States needs to prove that it is not in violation of a key arms control treaty . The same document includes “clarifications” and other rejections of the U.S. government’s own concerns about Russian developments. But those latter statements strongly suggest that the Kremlin may have initiated development of a number of new nuclear weapons specifically to skirt the agreement’s requirements or perhaps give the country additional leverage in future negotiations. The Wall Street Journal was the first to obtain a copy of a translation of the unsigned letter regarding the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START , which is dated December 2018. The Russian accusations center primarily around modifications to a number of U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress heavy bombers and U.S. Navy Ohio -class nuclear ballistic missile submarines, or SSBNs. The Kremlin also raises questions about whether silos the Air Force uses to train personnel to work with and launch intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, are truly incapable of live missiles. “Recent years were marked by the rise of the problems that undermine its [New START’s] viability,” the letter’s introduction explains after lauding the agreement. “In the worst case scenario these problems might potentially disrupt prospects for its extension after 2021.” The United States and Russia signed New START in 2010 and it entered force in 2011. It is set to expire in 2021 unless the two countries agree to extend it through 2026. Any further agreements on strategic nuclear weapons after that point would require a new deal. Then-U.S. President Barack Obama and then-Russian President Dmitri Medvedev sign the New START treaty in 2010., AP Photo/Alex Brandon At its most basic, New START puts hard limits on the total number of deployed strategic missiles and bombers, total warheads, and deployed and non-deployed launchers. Strategic missiles include ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, or SLBMs. Each reentry vehicle inside a single missile and each nuclear-capable heavy bomber count as a single warhead. A single launcher is either a missile silo, individual launch tube on a submarine, or a single bomber. To meet the treaty’s requirements, the Air Force modified 41 B-52H bombers to make them incapable of delivering nuclear weapons. The Navy similarly sealed off four of the Trident II SLBM launch tubes on each one of its 14 Ohio SSBNs. That service had already converted another four Ohios to entirely conventional guided missile submarines, or SSGNs, armed with Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles. “Three years ago the U.S. side declared its intention to convert B-52H heavy bombers by rendering them incapable of employing nuclear armaments by removing the nuclear code enabling switch and interconnection box, mounting a code enabling switch inhibitor plate, removing applicable cable connectors, [and] capping applicable wire bundles,” the letter explains. By the end of 2015, the United States had given Russian inspectors a chance to look over the first conventional-only B-52H with these modifications. An underwing pylon loaded with AGM-86 air-launched cruise missiles, which can carry nuclear or conventional warheads, sits in front of a B-52H bomber., USAF Russia contends these measures are insufficient to meet the treaty’s requirements for rendering a “launcher” non-nuclear capable and that it is hard, if not impossible to verify that the remaining 40 bombers have even received these modifications. The concern is that the United States could rapidly reinstall the aforementioned equipment and quickly return the bombers to their nuclear-capable functionality. The Kremlin cites similar problems with the conversion of the four tubes on the Ohio SSBNs, which involves the removal of certain components and the physical sealing of the launch tube. Russia says it was allowed to inspect those changes on the USS West Virginia . Tugs help guide the Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS West Virginia into port., USN Lastly, the Russians say that they cannot verify that the four silos the Air Force maintains to train IBCM launch crews and other related personnel are actually incapable of launching real missiles. There is no evidence that these facilities are actually fully-functional or are even connected to a launch complex. All told, the Russians want the United States to include these silos, launch tubes, bombers in its totals of declared weapons and weapon systems under the treaty. These are actually not new complaints and Russia had specifically brought them up in February 2018 , when it announced that it had met its treaty requirements on time and accused the U.S. government of cheating to meet the deadline. The United States has already countered these accusations by noting that New START does not specifically say that the requisite modifications to render a system non-functional have to be irreversible. In addition, it says that the deal’s provisions for regular inspections give the Kremlin ample opportunity to verify that the modifications remain in place. There is some debate , though, if the U.S. government’s position meets the agreement’s separate criteria for ensuring that any such modifications are not “ambiguous.” It is important to note that the Russian letter makes it clear that they are interested in finding a way forward and it describes existing offers from the United States to provide more confidence in the conversions as “a step in the right direction.” Unmodified launch tubes on the USS Ohio . , USN These proposals include a cabinet-level written declaration stating the United States does not intend to return the conventional-only B-52Hs to their previous configuration and an offer to allow Russian officials to more closely inspect the steel plate that seals the launch tubes on the Ohios . The Kremlin has said these offers are insufficient by themselves and has asked the United States to provide options for “additional measures” to verify the conversions. But perhaps more importantly, these ongoing deliberations about how to resolve these disputes is that the letter from the Russians uses them to soften the impact of their own potential violations of the agreement. The United States has expressed three relatively minor concerns to the Russians, according to the letter. The U.S. government wants assurances that launchers Russia uses to test prototype ICBMs may be capable of supporting operation missiles and to inspect a version of the road-mobile RS-24 Yars ICBM that is capable of launch from a fixed silo. The Kremlin contends that the prototype launchers are within the parameters of the treaty and that the silo variant of the RS-24 is not materially different from that of the road-mobile version. There is no mention of long-standing U.S. accusations that Yars is simply an existing missile, the RT-2PM2 Topol-M , modified in a way that violates other New START provisions, to begin with. There is also the matter of whether the upgraded Tu-22M3M Backfire bomber might qualify as a strategic bomber under the terms of the treaty. Russia says it has no plans to add an inflight refueling capability or integrate new air-launched weapons with extended range that would give a strategic capability as outlined in the agreement. By far the bigger issue is that Russia is arguing that it should be able to categorically exempt many of its new strategic systems from the terms of the treaty entirely. “The issue of new kinds of Russian armaments that cause concerns of the U.S. to a far lesser extent relates to the treaty than the issue of accountability of ‘converted’ B-52H heavy bombers and Trident II SLBM launchers,” the letter declares. The Kremlin’s letter explicitly makes it clear that the country does not see the treaty as applicable to the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, or the Poseidon nuclear-powered unmanned undersea vehicle, seen in the video below. This position is based on the fact that the treaty only covers ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers. This argument would seem to be technically accurate, at least in the case of the Burevestnik and Poseidon. The intention to exempt Avangard appears to be based entirely around its non-ballistic flight trajectory, which means it is not specifically a “ballistic” missile, even though it uses repurposed IBCM rocket boosters and gets launched from a silo. But while Russia appears to have a solid case for why these weapons do not meet the specific definitions of any of the weapon systems New START covers, it does raise the question of whether it developed them in order to skirt the agreement’s requirements. Regardless, having these systems outside of the treaty could give the Kremlin additional leverage, or just things to bargain away, during any future negotiations over extending New START or with regards to a new deal altogether. The Russians could conceivably offer to limit or cut any one of these weapons in exchange for additional concessions from the United States. There are already questions about whether some of these new developments, especially the Burevestnik cruise missile , seen in the video below, could ever be practical, leaving open the possibility that they exist only to get negotiated away at a later date. In the past, the U.S. government itself had suggested it might pursue similar tactics to try and goad the Kremlin back into compliance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, which covers an entirely different set of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. The United States has now announced its intention to abandon that deal, though the U.S. and Russian governments continue to engage with each other over that agreement with a possible eye toward saving or renegotiating it. You can read more about that ongoing debate in detail here . Of course, there’s also no guarantee that New START will survive past 2021, which would render all of these issues moot. Russia’s letter to American legislators makes it clear that the Kremlin is interested in continuing to abide by the agreement, but only insofar as the United States is willing to meet its demands. Russia has an established history of deflecting from its own violations of international treaties and norms while criticizing its opponents for similar malfeasance, as has been the case with the INF . At the same time, President Donald Trump’s administration and some American legislators are themselves openly questioning a wide array of international agreements , including New START . The more deals that collapse for one reason or another, the more it erodes confidence in the ones that remain. 2021 is not very far away at all and the U.S. and Russia will have to begin resolving these compliance issues and other disputes in short order if they truly intend to agree on an extension or reach a new deal before New START expires.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Intel Report Confirms China Developing Stealthy Tactical Bomber In Addition To Strategic Bomber,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An arm of the U.S. Intelligence Community has publicly confirmed the existence of not one, but two Chinese stealth bomber development programs for the first time in a new report. In addition to the much-reported H-20 stealth heavy bomber program, China is also working on a smaller, regionally-focused stealthy bomber, commonly referred to as JH-XX. This new information was contained in the Defense Intelligence Agency’s (DIA) latest China Military Power report, which the Agency released on Jan. 15, 2019 . DIA restarted issuing its “Military Power” unclassified public reviews, which trace their origins to the Cold War-era Soviet Military Power reports, in 2017. This new examination of China’s capabilities says the information it contains is up to date as of November 2018. “The PLAAF [People’s Liberation Army Air Force] is developing new medium- and long-range stealth bombers to strike regional and global targets,” an annex of the report explains. “Stealth technology continues to play a key role in the development of these new bombers, which probably will reach initial operational capability no sooner than 2025.” The report offers few specific details on the designs of these aircraft and does not assign a nomenclature to either one of them. “These new bombers will have additional capabilities, with full-spectrum upgrades compared with current operational bomber fleets, and will employ many fifth-generation fighter technologies in their design,” the review says broadly. Though the report never mentions it by name in the text, a footnote confirms that the “long-range stealth bomber” in question is the Xian H-20 . This aircraft is widely believed to be a flying wing design very loosely analogous to the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit. This aircraft will reportedly have a roughly 4,000 to 5,000 mile combat radius, be able to carry heavy weapons loads internally, and, according to DIA, have an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar to better spot targets, threats, and other hazards. The Agency’s report also says it will be able to carry vague “precision-guided munitions.” This will likely include a wide range of weapons, from direct attack smart bombs to standoff weaponry such as land attack and anti-ship cruise missiles. There is no official pictures or concept art of the H-20, but Xian’s parent company, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or AVIC, released this shot as part of a promotional film in May 2018. The framing here apes a Northrop Grumman television ad that aired during Superbowl XLIX in 2015, which teased an eventual reveal of the B-21 bomber. , AVIC capture via China Defense Online With a load of CJ-10K or CJ-20 land-attack cruise missiles, both of which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, the H-20 would give China a completely new strategic capability and a new way to hold targets across the Pacific and Asia at risk. “The bomber’s deployment would provide China with its first credible nuclear triad of delivery systems dispersed across land , sea , and air – a posture considered since the Cold War to improve survivability and strategic deterrence,” DIA’s report notes. With anti-ship missiles, the stealthy, long-range bombers could present a new and significant threat to hostile warships, especially American carrier battle groups . This would give the Chinese an additional means of denying access to certain portions of the Pacific during a crisis or at least force its opponents to reassess their risk calculus , which might prompt them to change or slow their advances. Even acting as a long-range sensor platform and targeting node alone, the H-20 could provide targeting information to other weapons located hundreds or even thousands of miles away . You can read more about the possibilities the H-20 could open up for the PLAAF here and here . DIA’s report does not point directly to any existing public reporting when discussing the “medium bomber,” which it also describes as a “tactical bomber” and a “fighter-bomber.” However, this is almost certainly a reference to a design from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation that has come to be known as the JH-XX. A table showing Chinese fixed-wing aviation developments, including both the H-20 “Strategic Bomber” and the JH-XX “Tactical Bomber.”, DIA Some have suggested that the JH-XX was Shenyang’s bid for the strategic bomber program, which then lost out to the H-20. DIA’s report indicates that these are, in fact, two distinct projects. Images of a model of the smaller aircraft first emerged online in 2013 and the design likely predates that considerably. The H-20 has reportedly been in development since the early 2000s and the J-20 stealth fighter project dates back to the late 1990s. The model, which has since served as a basis for various unofficial fan art, has a fighter-like swept wing, twin-taileron, lifting body planform with two engines each fed by separate air intakes on top of the fuselage behind the cockpit. As with the H-20, DIA’s report says the aircraft will feature an AESA radar. The cover of the May 2018 edition of Chinese magazine Aviation Knowledge featuring some of the most recent unofficial concept art of the JH-XX. Aviation Knowledge is the country’s oldest aviation-specific publication, publishing its first issue in 1958., Chinese Internet Previous reports had described the JH-XX model as having a main ventral weapons bay, as well as separate side-mounted bays for what appeared to be air-to-air missiles. DIA’s report makes specific reference to the aircraft’s ability to employ “long-range” air-to-air missiles, which China is actively testing , as well as “precision-guided munitions.” Those same reports have suggested the aircraft could have a maximum takeoff weight of anywhere from 60 to 100 tons , but the lower end seems more plausible given the plane’s estimated length of around 100 feet. It would also have a far shorter combat radius than the H-20, with estimates ranging from approximately 1,000 to 2,000 miles, to match its focus on more localized, regional targets sets and mission. With this range, the JH-XX would still have the ability to challenge strategic type targets, such as U.S. military facilities in Japan and possibly even on Guam, as well as bases in India , the South China Sea and beyond. The design could prioritize speed, as well as stealth, too. This could give the smaller fighter-bomber added advantages when it comes to sortie rates and for successfully penetrating through an enemy’s integrated air defense network. Above all else, it allows for multi-role operations, including supporting long-range air-to-air missions, without a heavy reliance on vulnerable tankers or even the use of coastal airfields, which would be the most vulnerable to attack during an all-out conflict. A map from DIA’s 2019 China Military Power report showing the locations of major PLAAF units, including existing bomber divisions, across the country., DIA The confirmed existence of larger and smaller Chinese stealth bomber aircraft programs is a welcome revelation in that it clears up much confusion as far as what has been talked about in the press over the years. The details of these two disparate programs have been chronically conflated in the media, leading to very strange and conflicting capability claims. This clears much of that up and will allow for a much clearer understanding of information in the future, as well as higher-quality analysis. All told, this Chinese regional bomber concept appears to be analogous to the U.S. penetrating ‘regional fighter-bomber’ concepts of the mid-2000s. Lockheed Martin’s proposed FB-22 concept and Northrop Grumman’s FB-23 concept were put forward for a tender that never came to be. The FB-22 was to have been an enlarged (stretched) derivative of the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter that would have also been able to carry a mix of air-to-ground munitions and air-to-air missiles. The larger design would have provided space for additional fuel, another crew member, far more weapons housed in an elongated and deeper weapons bay and in stealthy enclosures under its wings, and even additional communications and sensor packages. There were reportedly up to six different design concepts under the FB-22 initiative , though most concept art shows an enlarged, delta-winged aircraft based directly on a stretched F-22 with or without the original aircraft’s twin tail. This proposed FB-22’s combat radius would have been similar to those of the JH-XX and the plane would have been able to carry 15,000 pounds of munitions while maintaining a high degree of low-observability. External racks would have boosted that payload to 30,000 pounds for missions where maximum stealth was not a requisite. Focusing on speed, as well as stealth, the aircraft would have retained supercruise capability from its fighter brethren. The Raptor’s 2D thrust vectoring nozzles would have been omitted for a lighter, less complex but also low observable fixed design. An artist’s conception of an FB-22 with the twin tail. Other design concepts show it without., Lockheed Martin While the JH-XX may have a similar mission set to the FB-22, Northrop Grumman’s FB-23 concept is far more similar to the scant amount of imagery we have that possibly depicts the Chinese design. In fact, the design of Shenyang’s model, and the fan art that built on that, looks largely lifted from the proposed follow-on to the defunct YF-23 program . You can read a bit about this concept in this past piece of ours. In fact, the tail and rear-fuselage design looks to be an exact copy. Although it would have lacked commonality with a then in-production design, the FB-23 would have been ideally suited for the regional fighter-bomber role, as it would have built on the unique traits of the YF-23 . Some of these features actually hurt its chances in the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition against the YF-22, but would have been ideal for a very-low-observable, high-performance, long-range strike-fighter platform. An artist’s conception of the FB-23., Northrop Grumman The general similarities between the supposed requirements for the JH-XX and these past American combat aircraft concepts strongly suggest that the Chinese were at least watching the U.S. very closely before the U.S. Air Force canceled its regional bomber sometime around 2006. It is also very possible that China acquired actual data through espionage about one or more of the designs and used that information to support its own developments. There would be some precedent for this. Chinese intelligence operatives and hackers have stolen massive sums of sensitive information relating to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and a model of a similarly shaped aircraft, now commonly known as the J-31 or FC-31 , appeared a few years later. The J-20 stealth fighter also has some sensitive features in common with the F-35, as well as the F-22, further showing that American designs at least influence their Chinese counterparts. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. It is known that China’s pilfering of American stealth and aerospace technology goes so deep that they were actually regularly listening in on virtual design meetings for these and other programs. It’s possible the JH-XX could end up looking entirely different as well, but its mission sit seems clear, which informs the design either way. So whatever the exact origins of the JH-XX concept, its existence underscores what we have been saying for many years, that a regional fighter-bomber, one that isn’t addicted to vulnerable tanker gas, is the aircraft the USAF has needed all along. Instead, the powers that be blindly pursued a fleet of fifth-generation fighters that have their combat radius measured in hundreds of miles. The origin of this art isn’t clear, but it is clearly an extrapolation of official model design and what has been rumored about China’s regional fighter-bomber initiative that has now been confirmed by the DIA., Chinese Internet Fast forward to today and those aircraft do not have the range needed to pierce a peer state’s anti-access buffer zone around their territorial interests. The USAF is finally examining procuring a stealthy tanker to help overcome some of the operational issues with its very expensive but short-ranged stealth fighter fleet that will measure in the thousands of aircraft in the coming decades. But a stealthy tanker is an expensive treatment for a fully foreseeable and preventable illness, not an outright cure. If the B-21 Raider stealth bomber ends up being built in large numbers , as in well over 100 units, this deficiency could be addressed to some extent as well. But those bombers alone still won’t provide the flexibility or sortie rates that smaller regional fighter-bomber aircraft would. In fact, the two together would make the ultimate anti-access strategy defeating team. Beyond America’s chronic case of missed air combat capability opportunities, this is yet another example of China picking up where the United States left off to continue pursuing promising advanced military technology and weapons concepts. The Chinese are similarly moving ahead with naval electromagnetic railguns and stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles as American interest in those developments has stagnated , at least publicly . This is to say nothing of People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) other major military developments in recent years, including the construction of multiple aircraft carriers , a growing fleet of increasingly capable nuclear-powered and advanced diesel-electric submarines , work on hypersonic weapons , fielding of long-range anti-ship ballistic missiles , and much more . “China shifted funds and efforts to acquiring technology by any means available . … The result of this multifaceted approach to technology acquisition is a PLA on the verge of fielding some of the most modern weapon systems in the world,” the DIA report notes in its executive summary. “In some areas, it already leads the world.” Now, China may be getting close to fielding both a long-range stealthy flying wing and a stealthy deep-penetrating regional strike platform as soon as 2025 with the initial rollout of the H-20 possibly occurring as soon as the end of this year. All this underscores what we have highlighted for so long, that the DoD has long underestimated China’s determination, espionage capabilities, and technological resourcefulness. And we are now paying for that nearsightedness in the form of an ever eroding edge in technological supremacy.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 28, 2018","Suicide Bombing Kills U.S. Troops In Syria, Mysterious S-92 Helicopter Seen Evacuating Casualties (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still spotty, but a suicide bomber has killed U.S. military personnel and others in a terrorist attack inside the northern Syrian city of Manbij . A mysterious gray Sikorsky S-92 helicopter linked to U.S. special operations forces in the region swooped in afterward to evacuate casualties. All of this comes as the United States moves ahead with plans to withdraw from the country entirely. The attack occurred around 12:40 PM local time on Jan. 16, 2019 on a busy street in Manbij near a market. Unconfirmed reports from the U.S.-backed Manbij Military Council and the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say that there may be more than two dozen dead and wounded, including up to four American troops. This appears to be the first major terrorist attack in the city proper since American-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) liberated it from ISIS in 2016. In March 2018 , a roadside bomb near Manbij did kill a U.S. special operations forces member, as well as a British counterpart, but the perpetrators of that attack remain unclear. Another American special operator died during a mission died in Raqqa in 2016 . There were also been two non-combat related fatalities among U.S. personnel in Syria in 2017. There have been other coalition casualties in Syria, as well, including French special operations forces member near Raqqa in September 2017. CAUTION, the video below may be disturbing to some viewers: ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Manbij bombing through one of its official websites, Amaq, and said the specific target was “foreign” personnel. There is no independent confirmation of the group’s direct involvement, but if true, this would be a clear indicator that the terrorists remain a significant threat despite having lost control of nearly all of the physical territory the “Islamic State” once held. The Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, the top U.S.-led force fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, “is aware of open source reports regarding an explosion in Syria,” according to an initial statement from the official Twitter account for the Task Force’s top spokesperson, U.S. Army Colonel Sean Ryan. “Coalition forces conducted a routine patrol in Syria today. We are still gathering information and will share additional details at a later time.” “U.S. service members were killed during an explosion while conducting a routine patrol in Syria today,” a subsequent Tweet read, though it did not say how many fatalities there were in total. “We are still gathering information and will share additional details at a later time.” U.S. troops do conduct regular patrols within Manbij together with members of the Manbij Military Council and work closely with the SDF in and around the city. Both of these organizations are predominantly Kurdish. After the attack, witnesses on the ground also spotted a gray S-92 helicopter arriving to evacuate casualties. This chopper is similar if not identical to one that has previously appeared in areas where U.S. forces and their local partners operate in Syria and was traced back to a U.S. based contractor. You can read more about this unique aircraft and its shadowy origins here . It still remains unclear exactly who exactly that contractor is flying this helicopter on behalf of, but this latest appearance would further suggest that a branch of the U.S. military, or U.S. Special Operations Command, is the customer. The United States relies heavily on contractor-operated fixed and rotary-wing aircraft for casualty evacuation , personnel recovery , and other airlift missions to support other “light footprint” missions around the world. Regardless of the exact nature of the attack and its immediate aftermath, the incident underscores the complex and fluid situation in northeastern Syria and could have an impact on President Donald Trump’s Administration’s plans to withdraw all American forces from the country. After he first announced the pullout plan in December 2018, Trump had initially declared that the U.S.-led coalition had defeated ISIS . In the weeks that have followed, he has walked back those comments and other U.S. government officials have issued a string of often conflicting statements about the timeline and scope of the pullout. The current and future status of Manbij, which U.S.-backed SDF forces liberated in 2016, remains a contentious issue, in particular. The city itself is a strategic hub that links the eastern and western portions of Syria and is situated around 20 miles from the Turkish border. Unfortunately, Turkey sees the Kurdish fighters that make up the bulk of the SDF as terrorists, has criticized the United States for supporting them, and has repeatedly vowed to crush the group by any means necessary. American special operations forces very visibly deployed to the area in 2017 to create a buffer between Turkish and SDF forces apart. After Trump’s withdrawal announcement, Turkish forces moved closer to the city itself, as did groups aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and his Russian and Iranian benefactors. This has created an increasingly tense situation that you can read about in more detail here . A map of Syria showing Manbij in the north and the relative dispositions of the various parties in the country, as of Dec. 17, 2018. Since then, Turkish and Syrian government forces have only moved closer to the city., Congressional Research Service More recently, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has promised to wait for U.S. forces to withdraw before launching any new offensive, though he has threatened to proceed with his operation against Kurdish groups if that pullout ends up unreasonably delayed . The increasingly authoritarian leader has also agreed, in principle, to establish some sort of buffer between Turkish and Turkish-backed forces and the Syrian Kurds, though it’s not clear if that only applies to civilians. It remains to be seen how this might change the Trump Administration’s position on continuing operations in Syria and how quickly, or not, it wants to pull American forces out of the country. Update: 3:30pm EST— U.S. Central Command has now issued a formal statement confirming the deaths of four Americans – two U.S. troops, a Department of Defense civilian, and a civilian contractor – in Manbij. The statement does not confirm that the incident was a suicide bombing, simply stating “an explosion caused the casualties, and the incident is under investigation.” A separate statement from Vice President Mike Pence, however, did describe the incident as a terrorist attack. “As we begin to bring our troops home, the American people can be assured, for the sake of our soldiers, their families, and our nation, we will never allow the remnants of ISIS to reestablish their evil and murderous caliphate – not now, not ever,” the statement added.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 11, 2018",Two Kadena F-15s Made Emergency Arrested Landings In Opposite Directions On The Same Runway,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ​ In what has to be one of the craziest military aviation incidents of the young new year, two USAF F-15C/D Eagles made emergency landings at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa , Japan on January 15th, 2019. What made the incident so unique is that both jets landed on the same runway in the opposite direction of one another , catching the arresting cables at each end of the runway and coming to a rest face to face with a big expanse of runway between them. There are parallel runways at Kadena, but the north runway was closed for repairs and its arresting cables were inoperative when the separate in-flight emergencies occurred on the morning of the 15th. You can see just how violent an emergency barrier engagement can be for an F-15 in this prior piece of ours. The strange occurrence was first reported on by the Okinawa Times . Clearly, there is a very real risk to such an operation. If the aircraft’s hook skips the cable and the plane cannot go around for another try—which is unlikely if the jet was stricken by a malfunction serious enough that it would require an arrested landing—the aircraft could careen into the other jet stopped farther down the runway. The BAK-12 arresting gear at Kadena is located roughly 1,500 feet beyond the threshold of each end of the runway. Kadena Air Base. , Google Earth It sounds like the second troubled F-15 had no other divert fields with a cable that it could reach. The only other option would be an ejection, which is far from risk-free for the pilot and would result in the total loss of the aircraft. So with no better alternative, it seems that clearing the runway of personnel and preparing the pilot to eject if they did not catch the cable was the best of a handful of bad options. What remains unknown is why the second F-15 couldn’t have used nearby MCAS Futenma which has an arresting gear system as well, but also has just one runway to work with. The Okinawa Times piece notes that a flight of four F-15s had to divert to the MCAS Futenma after the double arrested landing at Kadena, so maybe sending those functioning aircraft to Okinawa’s Naha Airport, which is home to Japanese F-15Js, or another base in the region wasn’t possible. There’s no arresting gear at Naha Airport, so if one of the four Eagles required it during landing they would be out of luck. The dual runway closure at Kadena Air Base lasted about an hour, ending at around 11:20am local time once both aircraft were cleared off the runway and the arresting gear was rest. It’s worth mentioning that it is possible that the F-15s landed pointing away from each other instead of at each other, with the second jet flying over the first before touchdown. Depending on the aircraft’s emergency, this may have been an option, but apparently, eyewitnesses said it happened the opposite way as previously described. Either way, the incident is totally out of the ordinary. Kadena Eagles over Okinawa. , USAF Kadena’s north runway started a six-month closure on January 8th, 2019. This means the air base will have to get by with a single runway for an extended period of time—a challenging reality for one of America’s busiest overseas air bases. As we noted in a previous piece about Kadena’s capabilities and its unique place in a turbulent neighborhood, F-15s reign supreme at the base and are literally the ‘tip of the spear’ of American combat power in the region: “There are two F-15C/D squadrons, the 44th FS and 67th FS, based at Kadena and both are part of the 18th Wing. Most F-15C/D squadrons have 18 primary aircraft and three backup aircraft in inventory. Only one other F-15C/D “active” USAF squadron exists, the 493rd FS based in RAF Lakenheath, the UK, the rest are all Air National Guard units.” The base is also home to a huge variety of other aircraft, including HH-60Gs, KC-135Rs, E-3s, and pretty much every strategic surveillance platform in the USAF’s inventory as well as other fighters that deploy to the installation on a rotational basis. Resident 18th Wing aircraft executing an ‘elephant walk’ readiness drill at Kadena. , USAF On June 10th, 2018 an F-15C from Kadena crashed into the Pacific ocean . Thankfully, the pilot was able to eject and was rescued alive. But even though the F-15C/D community boasts better mission-capable rates than their 5th generation fighter brethren, the youngest airframes in the fleet are now 32 years old. The USAF will have to decide to spend money on significant upgrades to these aircraft in the coming decade or to outright replace them with another airframe. This replacement aircraft could be upgraded F-16s , F-35As, or F-15Xs . We will be revisiting this issue in the near future, so stay tuned for that special feature. The Eagle’s size always wows. A Kadena F-15C rolls out of its shelter on its way to the active runway. , USAF Regardless of what’s to come, those must have been some ridiculously tense moments on the airfield as controllers cleared a crippled aircraft to land on a fouled runway. It’s definitely a first of hearing of such an incident for this writer! Thankfully it worked and everyone made it out alive with a crazy story to tell.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 30, 2019",Iran’s Satellite Launch Fails Amid News That Trump Admin Wanted Options To Strike Iran Last Year,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has made the rare acknowledgment that an attempt to put a satellite into orbit using a domestically produced space launch vehicle has failed. The launch was already controversial, drawing criticism from the United States, Israel, and others who accuse the Iranians of using their nascent space program as a cover for the development of advanced ballistic missiles . It also comes amid revelations that the White House asked for options for a military response to Iranian-backed militia attacks on American diplomatic facilities in Iraq last year. The Iranian Simorgh space launch vehicle lifted off from the country’s Imam Khomeini Space Center , also known as the Semnan Space Center, on the night of Jan. 14-15, 2019. The rocket was carrying the Payam-e Amirkabir satellite, which Iran officially described as carrying four cameras for scientific earth observation purposes from low earth orbit. The exact nature of the failure is unclear. Iranian Minister of Communications and Information Technology Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi seemed to indicate that the satellite never even reached escape velocity, according to a report from the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency , or IRNA . https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSaLQOU9jT0 Other interviews with the minister seemed to suggest that Payam had reached outer space, but did not successfully enter a stable orbit. Azari Jahromi did say that whatever the fault was, it occurred with the third stage carrying the satellite. It also remains to be seen when Iran might proceed with the launch of a second non-military satellite, Doosti, the mission of which is not immediately apparent. Azari Jahromi said the satellite “waiting to be launched,” according to IRNA . So far, the Simorgh launch vehicle has yet to successfully put a satellite into orbit. Iran publicly unveiled the rocket in 2010 and conducted a successful sub-orbital test flight in 2016. In 2017 , to mark the official rebranding of Semnan as the Imam Khomeini Space Center and the expansion of the facility, Iran launched another Simorgh, possibly carrying Tooloo, an experimental intelligence satellite. That launch failed, as well, reportedly due to a problem with the second stage. At that time, Iran said it had plans to put two communications satellites into orbit by March 2018 , the end of the Iranian calendar year. That did not come to pass and may have been related to ongoing issues with the Simorgh design. Iran has successfully launched domestically produced satellites in the past, but using the smaller Safir space launch vehicle . https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZPTN_e73RM Whatever the exact state of the Simorgh program and Iran’s space program as a whole are, the official admission that the latest launch failed is notable for a country that routinely exaggerates its technical achievements . Iranian authorities did not publicly announce the failure of the 2017 launch themselves, though it was widely reported in the international press . Open discussion of space launch activities could be a sign of the Iranian government’s growing confidence in its space capabilities, despite the failures. Historically, it is hardly uncommon for national space programs to suffer major setbacks. Any failure still provides useful information for future developments, too. The public announcement of the space launch plans and the outcome of the launch also point to a desire to legitimize the program in the face of criticism from many of Iran’s chief international opponents, including the United States and Israel. The U.S. government, in particular, had lambasted the Iranian government about its launch plans and warned them not to go through with it at all. “The United States will not stand by and watch the Iranian regime’s destructive policies place international stability and security at risk,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Jan. 3, 2019 . “We advise the regime to reconsider these provocative launches and cease all activities related to ballistic missiles in order to avoid deeper economic and diplomatic isolation.” Iran’s Khorramshahr medium-range ballistic missile. The United States contends that the Iranian space program is simply a way to support development of weapons such as this or even longer-range designs. , AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi The crux of the U.S. government’s argument is that launch vehicles, such as Simorgh, are analogous to long-range ballistic missiles and that the Iranian space program is simply a cover for their development. In turn, these space launches are then in violation of various U.N. Security Council Resolutions that demand Iran cease development of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Other American allies, particularly Israel, share this opinion. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany, all condemned the 2017 launch , but have not been as vocal about this latest Simorgh flight. The United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany, along with China and Russia, had been parties to the controversial deal over Iran’s nuclear program, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ), which they all signed in 2015. President Donald Trump pulled out of that arrangement in May 2018. Not surprisingly, Iran rejected Pompeo’s warning and the country does not believe that either its space program or its ballistic missile developments violate any U.N. Security Council Resolutions, which specifically talk about work on systems that could potentially carry nuclear weapons. The Iranian government says that since it is not actively working on nuclear weapons, none of its missiles can be understood to be potentially nuclear capable. A Simorgh space launch vehicle blasts off from Semnan in 2017. The building the background is adorned with pictures of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Iran’s present Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, IRNA Information the Israeli government recently obtained on Iran’s nuclear program has offered greater detail about activities prior to 2003, but has offered no evidence that Iran has had an active program working to build an actual nuclear weapon since then. However, the country did continue enriching uranium, ostensibly for civilian purposes, afterward, which Iran scaled back after agreeing to the JCPOA.  Iranian officials have threatened to resume enriching uranium to higher levels of purity, which could point to a rebooted weapons program, in response to recent American sanctions. Regardless, the Simorgh launch is likely to further inflame tensions between the United States and Iran, have been steadily growing since the U.S. government left the JCPOA. In November 2018, the Trump Administration reimposed all of the sanctions that it had previously relaxed under the Iran deal. Since then, the United States has been pressuring its allies and partners to further isolate the regime in Tehran, which continues to support terrorists and militants around the world and commit human rights abuses at home, among other things. The results have been decidedly mixed and the remaining parties to the JCPOA have been working to try and keep that deal alive despite opposition from the U.S. government. In addition, countering Iranian influence steadily became a core part of the U.S. military’s mission in Syria and has been at the center of America’s continued support for the controversial Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen . On the Iranian side, in 2018, officials in Tehran made numerous threats to close off the strategic Strait of Hormuz leading into the Persian Gulf and enabled Yemen’s Houthi rebels to launch attacks on commercial shipping and warships in the Mandeb Strait separating the Red Sea from the Gulf of Aden. An infographic the U.S. military released in 2018 showing coordinates found on the navigation computer on the captured Houthi explosive-laden drone boat , indicating that it likely came, at least in part, from Iran. , DOD More seriously, a recent report from the Wall Street Journal also said that the White House had asked the Pentagon to provide options for a military response following rocket and mortar attacks on the U.S. consulted in the Iraqi city of Basra and the American Embassy in the capital Baghdad during widespread protests in September 2018. After those incidents, the United States temporarily relocated diplomatic staff elsewhere. Secretary of State Pompeo publicly blamed Iranian-backed militias and Iran’s Quds Force for the attacks. It remains unclear how directly Iran might have been involved. The Quds Force, part of the powerful quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), is responsible for training and advising militant groups overseas and publicly supported the development of Shia militias in Iraq, ostensibly to fight ISIS terrorists. It has also been active in Syria, Lebanon, and elsewhere in the region, notably supporting groups fighting Israel. In addition, beyond Pompeo’s remarks, National Security Advisor John Bolton has also long been an advocate for taking military action against Iran to curtail any potential nuclear capabilities. There is a growing concern that the hawkish stance of the Trump Administration is increasing the likelihood that Iranian provocations might lead to an actual skirmish of some kind. “As we have been warning for some time, Iran’s missile testing and missile proliferation is growing,” Pompeo wrote in another statement condemning an actual Iranian ballistic missile test on Dec. 1, 2018 . “We are accumulating risk of escalation in the region if we fail to restore deterrence. We condemn these activities, and call upon Iran to cease immediately all activities related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” Iraqi Popular Mobilization Force militiamen in Basara in September 2018. Many of these groups are linked to Iran and received support via the Quds Force., AP Photo/Nabil al-Jurani On top of this, the future of the Syria mission is now in question after President Trump announced plans to withdraw all American forces from that country in December 2018. He then upset members of the present coalition government in Iraq by not meeting with the country’s Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi during a surprise visit to the country later that month. Abdul-Mahdi’s political bloc has sought to improve the country’s relationship with Iran and some members of parliament are now calling for a complete pullout of U.S. forces from the country. These developments could further contribute to the United States seeking new ways to challenge Iran’s position in the region and Iranian responses in kind. “It is important to know also that we will not ease our campaign to stop Iran’s malevolent influence and actions against this region and the world,” Pompeo said during a speech in Cairo on Jan. 11, 2019 , which came at the start of a regional tour to visit America’s Middle East allies. “The nations of the Middle East will never enjoy security, achieve economic stability, or advance the dreams of their people if Iran’s revolutionary regime persists on its current course.” So far, the U.S. government does not appear to have issued a direct response to the latest space launch. How the United States and Iran choose to respond, or not, especially given the failure of the satellite to reach orbit, could further escalate tensions and increase the potential for actual alterations between the two countries, or their proxies.

Nearly a foot of snow was dumped onto Washington D.C. and the surrounding area over the 36 hours, leaving a gorgeous winter wonderland in its aftermath. No matter what political turmoil is afoot on Capitol Hill, the White House always looks absolutely breathtaking when blanketed with snow. And few objects can stir up action in the white and wet stuff like the blades of a low flying helicopter, and in this particular case, a very special chopper at that— Marine One . A Sikorsky VH-3D belonging to HMX-1 plucked President Trump from a very white South Lawn earlier today, whisking him off to Andrews Air Force Base for a trip to New Orleans aboard Air Force One .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what really was a sad display, the 38th annual Technology Exhibition in the Ghanian capital of Accra included marching super soldiers wearing exoskeletons backed up by a huge armored personnel carrier…thing. The display was meant to showcase local high-tech achievements, but it was really a costume party more than anything else orchestrated largely but a single company known for highly dubious military “inventions.” The spray-painted motorcycle helmet wearing soldiers had laughably clunky assault rifle turret contraptions attached to their backs, cannons on their arms, and ‘armor’ panels with tubes running to their exoskeleton suits that supposedly lied beneath. Well, that clearly wasn’t the case even at first glance. As the soldiers waddled slowly forward, it became clear that one of the fake hydraulic tubes had broken loose from the leg of one of the costumes, making the whole affair not even meet a low-tier Borg cosplay outfit at a small market Trek convention. The ‘APC’ was bad too. It’s ungainly, has a civilian-like hobbled-together interior, and is equipped with a few cameras, some sort of weapons turret, a ‘laser range finder,’ and there are a bunch of smoke grenade launchers tacked onto it. The platform that the APC shell is built on looks like some sort of hodge-podge of commercial parts. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9YXAJBh0TgE Listen, the whole thing is really embarrassing and at the same time, in some ways outright amazing. The idea that it is 2019, yet a spectacle this bad could be accepted as credible, is mesmerizing. It certainly says something about the man behind these creations, The Apostle Dr. Kwadwo Safo Kantanka, founder of both the Kantanka Group of Companies and his Pentecostal Church, the Kristo Asafo Mission of Ghana. A 2016 Jalopnik profile on Katanka and his automotive interests, which is worth reading in full, makes it clear that its unclear why and when he dubbed himself an apostle or started referring to himself as a “doctor.” Jalopnik ’s particular interest in the Kantanka Automobile Company, which Kwadwo Safo Jr. is CEO of, was centered on its claims to sell cars that were both designed for and made in Ghana. Neither of these things turned out to be true. The cars come from a Chinese manufacturer in knock-down kits that Kantanka simply assembles in the country. Kantanka Automobile’s website incredulously claims to be “Africa’s No. 1 Choice Automaker.” In addition to the automotive arm, Kantanka Group has a long history of producing similar military “innovations,” including a wooden “ attack helicopter ” and something that defies description and has features that appear ripped from an airplane and a trailer-mounted anti-aircraft gun. Even the vehicles that look more realistic in their basic design have obviously fake weapons and other “advanced” features. What is clear is that Kantanka, as well as his well-to-do family, have a significant base of support, which is bolstered by an organic media outlet, Kantanka Newsroom . After the debacle at Technology Exhibition in Accra, Nana Safo, likely another one of Katanka’s sons, went so far as to write a scathing hit piece on a local blogger for even asking questions about the systems’ viability titled “Ghanaians Shame Blogger JB Klutse over His 5 Stupid Questions About Kantanka’s Exoskeleton.” So yeah, the whole thing is an oddly fascinating disaster.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 24, 2019","Docs Show US To Massively Expand Footprint At Jordanian Air Base Amid Spats With Turkey, Iraq","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military is moving ahead with plans to dramatically expand its presence at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan to better accommodate a broad mix of fighter jets , ground attack aircraft , armed drones , cargo planes , and more. The multi-million-dollar construction project comes as President Donald Trump’s administration moves to withdraw American forces from neighboring Syria . But while the new facilities at the Jordanian base could help support continuing Syrian operations indirectly, they will serve a far more important purpose in providing an alternative to other major operational locations in the region, especially in Turkey , where political disputes could hamper U.S. access in the middle of a crisis. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing the work at Muwaffaq Salti , released specifications and drawings related to the new aircraft aprons, taxiways, and other associated facilities on FedBizOpps , the U.S. government’s main contracting website, on Jan. 11, 2019. The documents themselves date to the fall of 2018. The defense budget for the 2018 Fiscal Year included more than $140 million for the upgrades to the Royal Jordanian Air Force base, which the United States has been actively using for regional operations since at least 2013 . The contracting documents do not mention Muwaffaq Salti by name, which the U.S. military generally describes as an “ undisclosed location ,” but include annotated satellite images that clearly show that it is the base in question. Previous contracting announcements have indicated that the U.S. Air Force’s 407th Air Expeditionary Group presently oversees day-to-day operations at the base. The U.S. military’s new additions appear focused on growing the Air Force’s presence at the base specifically and the bulk of the improvements will be along the southern runway at the base. These include an airlift apron, a personnel recovery and special operations forces apron, and a close air support (CAS) and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) apron. A satellite image of Muwaffaq Salti Air Base as of May 2017., Google Earth An annotated satellite image of Muwaffaq Salti Air Base, showing the locations of the various planned upgrades., USACE The nearly 300,000 square foot airlift apron, which will have an attached 40,000 square foot cargo marshaling yard, will be big enough to accommodate up to two C-17 Globemaster III and one C-5 Galaxy cargo aircraft at once. This will enable to movement of large amounts of personnel, ammunition, fuel, and other materiel in and out of the base, all of which would be vital for sustained air operations. Muwaffaq Salti could also act as a trans-shipment point, with crews loading cargo onto smaller aircraft, such as C-130 Hercules for movement to other forward operating locations elsewhere in the region. The C-17s also have the ability to operate from unimproved airstrips , too. The U.S. construction plan at Muwaffaq Salt includes a nearly 280,000 square foot “hot” cargo pad on the north side of the base for rapid unloading and loading of materiel from transient aircraft, as well. C-17s at an undisclosed location supporting US operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in 2018., USAF Back at the southern portion of the base, the United States also plans to add in a 450,000 square foot personnel recovery and special operations forces apron. This will have parking spaces sized for the extended-length C-130J-30 airlifter, but would most likely be home to detachments of special operations MC-130s . There will also be space for four CV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors. The Air Force’s MC-130s can act as tankers for the CV-22s, helping extend their range and giving special operations forces the ability to rapidly move small units and cargo to and from dispersed sites in the region or to support air assaults on particular targets. In addition, the Ospreys have a speed advantage over traditional helicopters, as well as various electronic countermeasures and other self-defense systems and nap-of-the-earth flight capabilities, all of which helps the aircraft get to the objective area quickly and reduce its vulnerability to hostile defenses . As such, CV-22s in Jordan could be on call to insert reinforcements , extract wounded individuals or forces under fire, perform combat search and rescue (CSAR) missions, and other personnel recovery functions , as well. CASR is an especially important consideration for sustained air operations and one where the United States has historically limited options in the region. For instance, at present, the U.S. military has detachments in Kuwait , Iraq , and Turkey to provide that kind of capability in Iraq and Syria. A more detailed breakdown of the personnel recovery/special operations forces apron, showing the C-130J-30- and CV-22-sized parking spaces., USACE The so-called “CAS/ISR” apron will be, by far, the biggest single addition, covering almost 1,350,000 square feet. This will allow the United States to build three dozen parking spots with protective revetments and sunshades, all sized for F-15 or F-16 fighter jets , as well as A-10 ground attack aircraft . There will be another apron with four spots for MQ-9 Reapers , as well as multiple enclosed shelters each able to accommodate two of the drones, attached to this area, as well. Though described as CAS/ISR focused for construction planning purposes, this would give the United States the ability to use Muwaffaq Salti for expanded air combat operations more broadly. The aircraft this apron can accommodate could perform combat air patrols, interdiction, and various other missions. A closer look at the CAS/ISR apron with the MQ-9 shelters at the top and additional parking spaces for those drones to the right., USACE The sizing of the parking spaces could allow for the deployment of other combat jets, including from services other than the U.S. Air Force, as necessary, too. In September 2018, the Air Force conducted a temporary deployment of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates to Muwaffaq Salti, along with supporting personnel in a KC-10 Extender tanker aircraft. This is something that could become more common, and require less outside support, with the infrastructure upgrades. The U.S. Marine Corps also operates a land-based crisis response force with F/A-18C/D Hornets , among other aircraft, which could make use of the expanded facilities. The video below shows the F-22s from the Air Force’s 380th Air Expeditionary Wing deploying to an “undisclosed location” September 2018. https://youtube.com/watch?v=hl6_8UsLW8U In addition to the various aprons, the U.S. military will build new taxiways, access roads, life support areas, and other associated infrastructure to support the larger American presence at Muwaffaq Salti. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates the work will cost between $25 and $100 million, leaving significant funds left over for other additions, as well. The due date for contractors to submit their bids on this deal is Feb. 19, 2019, but there is no estimated schedule for when the work might get finished. The plan does make it clear that the United States is looking to grow its presence at the site and turn it into a more permanent, strategic base. This could be important given the Trump Administration’s efforts to extricate American forces from Syria . The exact timeline for that withdrawal remains unclear . It also remains to be seen how U.S. policy with regards to the ongoing fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, as well as with respect to the broader conflict in Syria, will evolve. There have been reports that U.S. forces are likely to move into facilities in other neighboring countries. From there, they could remain close by to support American-backed local forces and other U.S. partners still fighting in Syria as necessary . A US Air Force F-16C Viper taxies at Muwaffaq Salti during the multi-national Falcon Air Meet in 2011., USAF Though Iraq has been cited as the most likely country to accept the units withdrawing from Syria, Jordan could easily be another option and already hosts a significant American military presence . On top of that, some members of Iraq’s parliament were incensed that Donald Trump did not meet personally with the country’s Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi during his surprise visit to the country in December 2018. Members of the current coalition government in Iraq, which is also looking to improve relations with Iran , have since called for a complete withdrawal of American forces from the country. Whatever the outcome of this particular spat, it could limit the U.S. military’s ability to use bases in that country in the future. The expansion of Muwaffaq Salti could reduce the need for other regional operating locations that have become increasingly politically untenable recent years, in general. When the general plan first became public in 2017, it came at a time when there were also significant concerns about the continued viability of Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which is the largest American air base in the Middle East and has been a central hub for operations in the region and beyond for decades now. You can read more about how vital that base is for the U.S. military here . Unfortunately, Qatar remains embroiled in a major political spat with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, among others, who have cut off diplomatic relations and blockaded the country economically. However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatari officials to begin plans to significantly expand Al Udeid, as well, during a visit to the country on Jan. 13, 2019. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at center in suit, arrives in Qatar on Jan. 13, 2019., US Department of State “We’re all more powerful when we’re working together,” Pompeo said at a press conference, where he also said the nearly 20 month-long dispute between Qatar and other countries in the region had “dragged on too long.” America’s top diplomat is now in Saudi Arabia and will, among other things, likely continue to advocate for a resolution to the situation. Beyond that, Muwaffaq Salti is some 1,000 miles away from Al Udeid, making it poorly situated to be a substitute for that base. It seems more likely that the primary driving force behind the expansion in Jordan is long-simmering tensions between the United States and Turkey. Despite both being members of NATO, both countries have drifted apart over a host of disputes, including Turkey’s decision to purchase S-400 surface-to-air missiles from Russia, Ankara’s increasing ties with Moscow broadly, and the United States support for Kurdish groups in Syria that Turkish authorities view as terrorists. A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft arrive at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to support operations against ISIS in 2015., USAF Turkey and the United States are also embroiled in a dispute over Fethullah Gülen, a former political ally of the increasingly dictatorial Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who now lives in self-imposed exile in the United States. Turkish authorities accuse Gülen of masterminding a 2016 attempted coup against Erdoğan, but the United States has so far refused, citing insufficient evidence. The question of American support for the Kurds specifically was a major factor in Trump’s initial decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria and the safety of Kurdish civilians in any areas where Turkish or Turkish-backed forces might take control of has since become an equally serious question. U.S. authorities have since demanded assurances from Turkey that it will not seek to attack the Kurds and Trump himself has threatened to “devastate Turkey economically” if Ankara doesn’t agree to those terms. The president also insisted he did not want the Kurds to “provoke” Turkey, either. It is not entirely clear if “Kurds” in this case refer to Kurdish civilians, the predominantly Kurdish U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces group that is fighting ISIS, or both. Turkey has repeatedly declared its intention to crush Kurdish fighters , even if they’re aligned with the SDF, across northern Syria. It is also worth noting that the United States provides intelligence and other support for Turkish military operations against other Kurdish militant groups that are active within Turkey. So, how the Turkish government might interpret any demands from their American counterparts and how willing the United States might actually be to respond to any apparent violations of those stipulations remains to be seen. All of this presents a standing risk that access to Incirlik Air Base , a major regional hub for the U.S. military that serves as a base for combat jets operating in the region, a tactical nuclear weapons storage site , and as an important trans-shipment point, could end at a critical moment . Muwaffaq Salti, less than 400 miles to the south, is well positioned to supplant Incirlik, as well as other operating locations in Turkey , for conventional operations if the Turkish government was to force a halt to American operations from those bases. All told, the upgrades to Muwaffaq Salti will boost America’s ability to operate in that part of the Middle East outside of any presently ongoing operations, in Syria or elsewhere, for years to come and will only further cement U.S.-Jordanian relations. With that in mind, we may begin to see work at other sites in Jordan in addition to Muwaffaq Salti in the coming years. If the Army Corps of Engineers’ estimates are accurate, there will be tens of millions of dollars left for construction projects in the country.

In the first full week of the New Year we brought to you three in-depth features on a topic we get asked about very often—stealthy special operations transports. With part one and part two of The Mysterious Saga Of America’s Hunt For A Stealth Special Operations Transport published by mid week, we turned to one of the most talked about mysteries in military aviation, the origins of the Stealth Hawks that were used in the Bin Laden raid. We also talked a bit about the Navy’s late to the table initiative to have a more significant presence in the Arctic and their new hyper-velocity deck-gun ammo , Russia’s importation of WWII-era tanks, and the troubling state of two critical Pentagon aircraft programs . The U-2 Dragon Lady even made an appearance ! Still, because of those big features, there was so much that we didn’t get to, but it’s not too late! Let’s shoot the breeze. Welcome to Bunker Talk! This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t get to. In other words, literally an off-topic thread. We can talk about the news that the owners of the tanker that collided with the USS John S. McCain will be pulling out their wallets for some of the repairs. Then there is this cheesy, but light hearted swipe from Nellis AFB against the nerds attending CES this week. We can also chat about the fact that it seems pretty clear that the Navy wants more than 32 VLS cells on their new frigate: What about the border wall standoff and the shutdown? This is a heated topic, but we can handle it and it really does have a national security angle that is worth discussing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 8, 2019","USMC’s Huge New CH-53K King Stallion Helicopter Has Not So Tiny Problems, Faces More Delays","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it’s not sure when the U.S. Marine Corps will be able to declare initial operational capability with their new Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopters due to technical issues. The CH-53K program already has a long history of delays and these new developments threaten to again push back the Marines’ plans to replace their increasingly old and troublesome CH-53E Super Stallion fleet. Vertical Magazine got the latest status update on the CH-53K program as of January 2019. Bloomberg was the first to report that new problems had emerged in the helicopter’s development in December 2018 . The Marine Corps had taken delivery of its first King Stallion in May 2018 . “Discovery of technical issues later than expected and [the] inadequate rate of their closure resulted in a flight test efficiency rate that was less than projected,” Greg Kuntz, a spokesperson for Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), which oversees the CH-53K program for the Marine Corps, said in a statement to Vertical . “We are evaluating requirements to the program but have not yet made a formal determination on IOC [initial operational capability] or IOT&E [initial operational test and evaluation] dates.” As of 2014, the Marine Corps had expected to reach initial operational capability with the CH-53K in 2019 and the service still plans to eventually buy a fleet of around 200 King Stallions to replace the older Super Stallions. Though visually similar to the CH-53E, the CH-53K is an all-new helicopter that is larger and significantly more powerful – not to mention more expensive – than its predecessor. A CH-53K King Stallion., USMC But the Marines’ official 2018 Aviation Plan only described the initial operational capability date as being “on the five year horizon.” At the same time, the annual report said that Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron Three Six Six (HMH-366) is slated to become the first operational squadron flying the type sometime in the 2020 fiscal year, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020. In the meantime, a detachment within Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron One (VMX-1) is operating the first two CH-53Ks that Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, has delivered so far. This unit is scheduled to receive additional pre-production King Stallions between 2019 and 2020 to support its test and evaluation mission. A chart outlining the Marine Corps’ timeline for transitioning units from the CH-53E to the CH-53K, as of 2018., USMC At present, one of VMX-1’s helicopters is at Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina, while the other is at the Navy’s China Lake test center in California. At New River, “maintainers are meticulously taking the aircraft apart and putting it back together” as part of a “logistics demonstration,” Bill Falk, the CH-53K program manager at Sikorsky, told Vertical . The second helicopter is at China Lake is there for “ballistic testing” to evaluate its survivability against enemy fire and other hazards. Neither of these helicopters are reportedly undergoing any flight testing at present and that may be linked to the design’s ongoing technical troubles. The known issues have to do with a defect that results in exhaust gasses getting sucked back into the engine, problems with the main drive shaft and tail rotor assemblies, and main rotor gearboxes that are failing well before they’re supposed to, according to Bloomberg . In development since 2006, the Marines originally expected to reach initial operational capability with the King Stallion in 2015, but this steadily got pushed back over time . Gearbox trouble was among the issues that pushed that timeline back to 2019 in the first place. To add insult to injury, NAVAIR and Sikorsky had both indicated these long-standing issues had gotten resolved in 2016 . Ahead of the delivery of the first helicopter in 2018, the Marine Corps had also publicly dismissed another Bloomberg report that said the service was aware of over 1,000 remaining deficiencies that still needed to get fixed. “You saw the CH-53K fly,” U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Hank Vanderborght, the service’s CH-53K program manager, said to reporters after a demonstration at the Berlin Airshow in April 2018. “Did it look like a helicopter that has a thousand problems with it?” Beyond the King Stallion’s specific design issues themselves, the Navy has experienced additional delays in getting redesigned components for additional testing, according to Bloomberg . Part of this may be due to the fact that the sole subcontractor responsible for the gearbox casings on the CH-53K filed for bankruptcy in 2016. The Pentagon did not name this firm in a September 2018 report to President Donald Trump discussing risks to the U.S. defense industrial supply chain, which was the first public acknowledgment of this specific issue. The company was also the only domestic supplier of gearbox casings for the Boeing AH-64E Apache gunship helicopter and Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey family. The Navy said would approach other potential manufacturers to find an alternate source for these parts to meet its particular requirements by the end of 2018 , but it is unclear if they have found a replacement firm or firms. A CH-53K during flight testing., Lockheed Martin Sikorsky remains upbeat that it will be able to resolve the remaining issues with the CH-53K and deliver sufficient helicopters to meet the Marine Corps’ demands to conduct its first operational missions with the type sometime between 2023 and 2024. Falk, the company’s King Stallion program manager, also said that engine exhaust ingestion issue should be resolved this year, according to Vertical . Its still unclear whether this means that the flight test plan will continue as planned or might end up getting accelerated, in order to try and have sufficient helicopters ready by the end of the year so that the Marines can declare initial operational capability. Testing the helicopter’s propulsion system, flight controls, and avionics are still on the agenda, Falk told Vertical . The goal is also to evaluate the CH-53K ability to fly in various environmental conditions and operating envelopes, as well as its capabilities when operating from Navy amphibious ships before the end of the year. The Marines also remain heavily invested in the CH-53K as the need for a replacement for the aging CH-53Es becomes increasingly urgent . The Corps’ aging Super Stallions have suffered a number of high-profile crashes in recent years and the helicopters have only become increasingly hard to maintain as time has gone on. Hopefully, the remaining issues with the CH-53K will prove to be relatively easy to rectify and any additional delays will be minor. After more than a decade of difficulties already, the Marines can ill afford to wait much longer for the new helicopters.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 10, 2021",Canadian Troops Pose With Chinook As It Sticks A Pinnacle Landing While On Deployment In Mali,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the most impressive capabilities of the CH-47 Chinook series is the helicopter’s ability to balance its two rear wheels on the edge of a cliff or some other piece of rugged terrain while still hovering, a maneuver known as a pinnacle landing . This allows chopper to more readily get in and out places where it wouldn’t necessarily be able to land otherwise to pick up or drop off personnel and cargo. A Canadian Chinook crew supporting peacekeeping missions in the northwest African country of Mali recently pulled off the move and managed to hold it long enough for two dozen troops to get a picture in front of the hovering helicopter. The photo op occurred at a small arms training range Canadian forces use situated outside of the northeastern Malian city of Gao on Jan. 2, 2019. Canada’s Task Force Mali deployed to the country in July 2018 and consists of three CH-147F Chinooks, five CH-146 Griffon helicopters, and approximately 250 personnel in total. The unit is there as part of Operation Presence, the country’s mission to support United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, which is better known by its French acronym MINUSMA . The CH-147Fs have provided an important boost to MINUSMA’s operations since they arrived. In addition to the pinnacle landings, the Chinook family is well known for its ability to operate in high altitude and hot temperature conditions, both of which are present in Mali. The helicopters are also surprisingly fast for their size and payload capacity. Canada’s Chinooks also have significant additional features over Boeing’s standard CH-47F configuration. Most importantly for operations in Mali, the Canadian examples have extended range fuel tanks similar to the ones on the MH-47 types that the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment flies. A Canadian CH-147F Chinook, in front, flies with a pair of CH-146 Griffon helicopters in Mali., Canadian Forces The CH-147F also has a sensor turret under the nose with electro-optical and infrared cameras, giving its crew better situational awareness at night and in other low-visibility conditions. The choppers in Mali have 7.62mm C6 machine guns mounted on either side of the forward fuselage and on the rear cargo ramp for self-defense. Task Force Mali’s CH-146s, armed with Miniguns and .50 caliber machine guns, act as armed escorts during missions. In addition, the helicopters in Mali are also sporting Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24 Nemesis directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system. This self-protection arrangement consists of two turreted lasers on the Chinook’s sponsons on either side of the rear fuselage and multiple warning sensors to cue them. When the system spots an incoming heat-seeking missile, the lasers try to blind and confuse its seeker, throwing it off course. A Canadian CH-147F takes off for a mission in Mali. One of the two turrets associated with the AN/AAQ-24 Directional Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM) system is visible on a mount toward the rear of the sponson on the side of the helicopter’s fuselage., Canadian Forces Canada hired Northrop Grumman in 2015 to install these defensive systems on its CH-147Fs, which already had traditional decoy flare launchers. DIRCM systems are becoming increasingly common on helicopters and fixed wing aircraft . Since at least 2017, the U.S. Army has been working to add a DIRCM capability to its own CH-47Fs, but suffered some initial setbacks in getting the systems to meet its requirements. However, in 2018, pictures emerged showing that the service’s Chinooks were increasingly carrying what appeared to be the AN/AAQ-24 or a variant thereof. A US Army CH-47F with the AN/AAQ-24 system installed., US Army For MINUSMA, helicopters have been an especially vital asset since the peacekeeping operations in Mali began in 2013 due to the country’s austere environment and limited infrastructure, especially in the country’s northern desert regions. On top of that, the mission has become known as the world’s deadliest . More than 170 peacekeepers have died over the course of the mission and more than half of those fatalities have been the result of hostile fire and roadside bombs. This is a high body count for a mission that does not actually involve direct action against militants, terrorists, or criminal organizations in the country. The distributed nature of the fighting and the distance between remote outposts and more robust medical care only increases the risk that any casualty will turn into a fatality – something even large militaries have had to contend with during operations in this part of Africa . Helicopters are useful tools for casualty evacuation, in general, but the demand for this capability has been even more pronounced in Mali. Tiny MD500E light attack and scout helicopters from El Salvador , one the longest-running contributions to MINUSMA, have been pressed into the casualty evacuation role at times for lack of alternatives. But it has been hard for the United Nations to secure consistent and suitable helicopter contributions from its member states. The U.N. force in the country has often had to rely on private contractors to provide any form of support, but those civilian crews generally have more restrictions on where and when they can operate. The Canadians arrived in 2018 specifically to take over operations from a German-Belgian contingent that was leaving. It’s not surprising that one of the primary missions for the CH-147Fs quickly became casualty evacuation. “You will get ‘First World’ care in the back of the Chinook, as if you just walked into a Canadian emergency room,” Canadian Forces Colonel Chris McKenna, the commander-in-charge of Task Force Mali, told the country’s Globe News in September 2018. “The level of health care that’s occurring in this helicopter is about the same as you’d get in Vancouver, Quebec City, or Ottawa.” Members of Canada’s Task Force Mali riding in a CH-147F treat a simulated casualty, a Dutch soldier in this case, during a training exercise in Mali., Canadian Forces The Chinook’s spacious main cabin gives medical personnel ample space to work in , making it easier to provide immediate aid as the helicopter speeds toward an actual hospital. The extra room the chopper offers means that the crew can lift a significant number of casualties at once, reducing the total number of sorties, and the total time, it takes to get all of the wounded personnel at the site of an attack to the next level of care. All of this only improves the chances of medics will be able to save an individual’s life. Other Chinook operators have seized on the helicopter’s capabilities in this role, but it is reportedly a relatively new mission for Canada’s CH-147F crews. “To watch the medicine that’s occurring in the back of this aircraft, in 40-degree heat, being pitched around the sky and still conducting that level of medicine is nothing short of incredible,” Colonel McKenna explained to Globe News . “This is brand new to Canada and it’s going extremely well.” Unfortunately, the Canada has insisted that its contribution is temporary and will end after a year, as planned, in July 2019. The mission had been controversial in Canada from the start , with critics accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government of deploying too small a force to be useful and that the deployment was politically motivated. Since he took office in 2015, Trudeau’s political opponents have lambasted him for a variety of defense-related decisions, among other things , especially with regards to the country’s circuitous attempts to bolster or replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging fleet of CF-18 Hornet fighter jets. Canada is heading for another federal election in October 2019 , in which the outcome of the Mali deployment and Hornet saga could be factors. So far, it remains unclear who might replace the Canadians in Mali. There’s no guarantee that whoever might step in to take their place will bring their own Chinooks and be able to provide anywhere near the capability the CH-147Fs have offered peacekeepers for the past six months.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 7, 2018",China Wants U.S. To Know Its Ships In S. China Sea Can Be Targeted By Long Range Ballistic Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China appears to have threatened to use anti-ship ballistic missiles against American warships after a U.S. Navy destroyer sailed past disputed islands in the South China Sea . This is the latest in a string of increasingly aggressive actions and rhetoric from the Chinese government and is another signal that the country is looking to more actively assert its claims to the contested region of the Pacific Ocean. On Jan. 8, 2019, state-run China Central Television ( CCTV ) reported that unspecified units of the People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force ( PLARF ) armed with DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM) had mobilized in the country’s far western Gobi Desert and Tibetan Plateau regions. This was in direct response to the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS McCampbell conducting a so-called Freedom of Navigation Patrol (FONOP) near the Paracel Islands, which the Chinese government claims as its sovereign national territory, according to the CCTV broadcast. The DF-26 is a road-mobile IRBM and officially entered service in 2018 . There are conflicting reports as to whether these missiles have a conventional or nuclear warhead , or if it has the capability to one or the other depending on the target set. By 2017, the Chinese had also reportedly fielded a variant with maneuverable re-entry vehicle (MARV) warhead, giving it an anti-ship capability. Most public reports give the DF-26 a range of between 1,864 miles and 2,485 miles, with an extreme maximum range of almost 3,000 miles. It is unclear whether or not this latter range figure applies to missiles with the anti-ship warhead. The video below from CCTV shows the mobilization of DF-26 units in Western China in January 2019. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pdm2i-jVAWk The lower end of the DF-26’s reported range would still allow the missiles to engage targets in the Paracels from China’s western regions. With the road-mobile transporter-erector-launchers, crews could conceivably reposition them further east relatively easily, if necessary, as well. Launching the missiles from deep inside China’s interior would make them less vulnerable to any attempts to destroy them either before launch or during their vulnerable boost phase when they are moving slow and generating a large infrared signature. It could also make it harder for ground-based sensors associated with enemy ballistic missile defense systems to spot, track, and provide accurate fire control data for an intercept during the missile’s mid-course flight phase. In addition to allowing it to hit slow-moving targets, the MARV’s ability to alter its course during the terminal flight phase also makes it less predictable and harder to intercept, as well. At the same time, from the publicly available information, China has tested other anti-ship ballistic missiles against static, aircraft carrier-shaped targets in the Gobi Desert , but there is no indication that it has demonstrated any such capability against a representative moving target at sea. It’s also not clear if China has a robust enough sensor infrastructure to reliably target ships in the South China Sea or the networks to then communicate that information to DF-26 units thousands of miles away. A map showing the ranges of various Chinese Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM) and Intercontinal Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). The range given for the DF-26 here is 4,000 kilometers, or 2,485 miles, and from the range ring’s center point in central China, this would give the DF-26 more than enough range to strike any target in the South China Sea., DOD Beyond that, firing the DF-26s from so far away would simply increase the time it takes for the missile to reach the target area after launch. This could give an opponent added opportunities to try to change direction or otherwise mitigate the threat. This doesn’t mean that the missiles don’t still pose a threat to American interests in and around the South China Sea. The DF-26’s range has led some to dub it the “Guam Killer,” as it can hold America’s highly strategic military facilities on that island at risk. An aircraft carrier-sized target with multiple large craters from missile impacts on a test range in the Gobi Desert., Google Earth via the Federation of American Scientists “China continues to have the most active and diverse ballistic missile development program in the world,” the U.S. Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center wrote in an unclassified review of ballistic and cruise missile threats in 2017. “Missiles such as the … DF-26 are key components of the Chinese military modernization program, specifically designed to prevent adversary military forces’ access to regional conflicts.” On top of that, China has a variety of other, shorter-range shore-based anti-ship missiles deployed in and around the South China Sea on a constellation of increasingly militarized man-made island outposts . The country is in the process of developing faster, less vulnerable types and ground-launched anti-ship missiles , too, all of which would present a challenge to American naval forces in the region during a crisis. In a talk regarding U.S.-China relations in December 2018, People’s Liberation Army general officer Lou Yuan said that China’s anti-access posture in the region was designed around the goal of being able to sink multiple American aircraft carriers , at least in part. Lou is the Deputy Head of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences and has a long history of making controversial comments. “What the United States fears the most is taking casualties,” he said, suggesting the fear of the possible loss of approximately 10,000 personnel could effectively keep the U.S. military out of a fight in the South China Sea. “Attack wherever the enemy is afraid of being hit.” Whatever the exact capabilities of the DF-26 are and how exactly it fits in with China’s overall anti-access concept of operations, publicly announcing the mobilization of those missiles in response to an American FONOP is a major development in of itself. The Chinese government routinely protests these patrols as violations of its sovereign territory, despite a broad international consensus that Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea are overly broad and do not conform to international law and norms. But a threat to respond militarily in a way where the goal would be to sink the American ship, rather than chase it off, seems unprecedented. This reaction to McCampbell ’s patrol comes less than four months after the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) Type 052C Luyang II -class destroyer Lanzhou nearly collided with the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Decatur during a FONOP near Gaven Reefs. A video still showing the Chinese destroyer Lanzhou , at right, cutting in front of the USS Decatur on Sept. 30, 2018. At one point the two ships were dangerously close, coming within 45 yards of each other., USN via gCaptain Gaven Reefs, which is home to one of China’s man man-made island military bases, is in the Spratly Islands chain, which is situated further south in the South China Sea from the Paracels. This appeared to be the first time a Chinese warship had ever sought to physically drive off an American naval vessel in the South China Sea. “Both countries warships definitely have to come into close proximity and it’s easy for there to be a misunderstanding or an error of judgment, even a collision,” Zhang Junshe, a researcher at the PLA’s Naval Military Studies Research Institute, said of the 2018 incident in a discussion with reporters on Jan. 9, 2019. “If there is a collision, the root cause is the United States.” An annotated satellite image showing China’s man-made outpost in Gaven Reefs., DOD The increasingly assertive attitude among Chinese authorities and official media outlets extends beyond the South China Sea to other hotspots, such as Taiwan and the East China Sea , too. In the last 18 months, the United States has also accused China of harassing its military aircraft in the South China Sea , as well as off the coast of the country of Djibouti in East Africa, where the PLA recently established a major overseas base . “All military units must correctly understand major national security and development trends, and strengthen their sense of unexpected hardship, crisis and battle,” China’s President Xi Jinping said in at a meeting with the country’s top Central Military Commission on Jan. 5, 2019 . “Preparation for war and combat must be deepened to ensure an efficient response in times of emergency.” This had followed a New Years address from Xi to commemorate the 40th anniversary of China’s 1979 Message to Compatriots in Taiwan . The new speech included, among other things, an assertion that the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland was inevitable . Xi also reiterated his past position that the Chinese government could use force, if necessary, to speed that process along. Chinese President Xi Jinping makes his address on Taiwan on Jan. 2, 2019., AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein When it comes to U.S.-Chinese relations specifically, the DF-26 threat also comes as President Donald Trump’s administration and Xi’s regime remain locked in strained negotiations over how to end an ongoing trade war. In the past 18 months or so, the two countries have also sparred over American support to Taiwan , Chinese intellectual property theft and industrial espionage , and host of other issues . The incident with Decatur near Gaven Reefs in 2018 already indicated that China might be increasingly willing to take riskier and more forceful action against the United States, as well as any other potential opponents, to assert its territorial claims and otherwise advance its national interests. This new threat, no matter how veiled, to attack those ships with ballistic missiles certainly suggests that the Chinese government isn’t rushing to deescalate the situation.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 3, 2019","USAF Finally Accepts Its First KC-46A Tanker, But The Design Still Needs Years Worth Of Fixes","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has accepted the first Boeing KC-46A Pegasus tanker, an important milestone for the troubled program . However, the initial batch of aircraft will still have serious problems with their remote vision and refueling boom systems, meaning that the planes remain years away from reaching their full operational potential. Foreign Policy was the first to report on the agreement between the Air Force and Boeing to proceed with the deliveries of the aircraft, citing anonymous sources, on Jan. 10, 2019. Defense News then reported that the Chicago-headquartered planemaker had agreed to fix the remaining deficiencies and that the Air Force’s top leadership reserved the right to withhold full payment for the planes – up to $1.5 billion in total if the service docks the company for each of the 52 aircraft in the first batch of planes – until it sees real progress. “The KC-46A is a proven, safe, multi-mission aircraft that will transform aerial refueling and mobility operations for decades to come,” Leanne Caret, President and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, said in a subsequent press release . “We look forward to working with the Air Force, and the Navy, during their initial operational test and evaluation of the KC-46, as we further demonstrate the operational capabilities of this next-generation aircraft across refueling, mobility and combat weapons systems missions.” Boeing says that now that the Air Force has accepted the KC-46A in its present state, the company will begin delivery of four of the tankers to the premier 22nd Air Refueling Wing at McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas as early as February 2019. After those planes arrive, another four will go to the 97th Air Mobility Wing at Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma. US Air Force Major Nick Cenci, Chief of Flight Operations, Defense Contract Management Agency (Seattle), at left, and Major Anthony Mariapain, KC-46 Chief Pilot Defense Contract Management Agency (Seattle), stand in front of the first KC-46A that the Air Force has accepted from Boeing. These individuals led the acceptance flight testing., Boeing The acceptance and up-coming deliveries are a big deal for the KC-46A program, which has been mired in delays and controversy since Boeing won the Air Force’s KC-X competition in 2011. That decision itself followed nearly a decade of earlier, scandal-ridden Air Force attempts to procure a new tanker aircraft. Notably, in 2004, Darleen Druyun , a Boeing executive who had previously been the Air Force’s top procurement official, went to federal prison after receiving a conviction on corruption charges relating to an earlier tanker program. The Air Force was supposed to have received a fleet of 18 KC-46As, the first tranche in the total initial buy of 52 aircraft, by the end of 2017 and reach an initial operational capability with the type shortly thereafter . Between 2011 and 2017, continuing technical difficulties, which you can read about in more detail here , repeatedly pushed this schedule back. This continued into 2018, leading to an unusually public spat between the two parties over the program’s progress. Boeing’s contract is firm, fixed-price, and that company has already had to pay more than $3 billion of its own money to cover cost overruns. Boeing had expected the Air Force to finally accept the first KC-46 in December 2018, but this was reportedly delayed by former Secretary of Defense James Mattis’ resignation . Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan is a former Boeing executive and has had to recuse himself any dealings related to the company, further lengthening the process for the Pentagon to formally approve the Air Force’s plans. But Boeing and the KC-46A are hardly out of the woods. As noted, the company was supposed to have delivered 18 aircraft in total back in 2017 and it is unclear whether it will completely fulfill that part of its contract by the end of this year. Beyond that, the aircraft the Air Force is getting now still have serious problems that neither the service nor Boeing expects to be completely resolved for at least another three to four years. The first of these is related to the refueling boom at the rear of the aircraft. Aircraft that use this aerial refueling method must work with the tanker to force the probe at the end of the boom into a receptacle on their own plane. If the receiving aircraft can’t generate enough thrust, it might not be able to successfully establish the link and there is a risk that the connection might fail inadvertently in the middle of refueling. The KC-46A’s boom has a so-called “thrust resistance” of 1,400 pounds, according to Defense News . This is higher than the maximum threshold of certain U.S. military aircraft, including the A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft. The nose of an A-10 Warthog with a very visible dent in its nose from a tanker’s boom., USAF Apparently, the Air Force did not specify the lower thrust resistance in the original contract and has now asked Boeing for a design change to meet this requirement. As such, since this is officially a new stipulation, the service has agreed to give the planemaker additional funds on top of the fixed deal to pay for the work. This is an important concession on the part of the Air Force, which required Boeing to pay out of pocket for a separate boom-related software fix to prevent the probe from damaging the receiving aircraft . The two parties are still negotiating the exact cost for the revised boom design, but they expect the work to take around two years to complete. A bigger issue remains with the Pegasus’ long-problematic Remote Vision System , or RVS. In the Air Force’s existing KC-135 and KC-10 tankers, an operator at the rear of the aircraft helps guide the boom into the receiving aircraft. On the KC-46A, this individual performs their task remotely from the main cabin via an advanced stereoscopic video feed that presents a blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional imagery from an array of electro-optical and thermal cameras at the back of the plane. “There is a slight difference between the motion viewed in the RVS versus what is actually occurring in the physical world,” an Air Force official explained to Defense News . All of those things can create a depth compression and curvature effect.” A view from a receiving aircraft of the remotely-operated boom on the KC-46A., Boeing What this means is, depending on shadows, glare , and other factors, the boom operator might not have an accurate understanding of what’s going on behind the tanker, leading them to over-compensate and move the boom erratically, putting potentially dangerous strain on the boom itself and risking hitting and damaging the receiving aircraft. Additional studies have warned that certain individuals may simply be predisposed to eye strain, headaches, vertigo, and other vision issues when using the system for a protracted period of time, limiting the pool of people who could take on the boom operator job on KC-46s at all in the future. As part of the acceptance plan, Boeing has agreed to completely overhaul the RVS, which could entail both hardware and software changes to the aircraft, and do so at its own cost. The Air Force expects it to take between three and fours years to simply to develop the replacement system. There is no timeline for how long it might then take to modify any aircraft the service has taken delivery of up to that point. There have been other deficiencies that Boeing has been working to resolve , as well, and it is unclear how close these are to getting fixed. This includes the boom striking the receiving aircraft, which is especially problematic for stealth aircraft, such as the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . Damaging the special radar absorbent skin on these aircraft could have a direct impact on their ability to hide from hostile radars. There is a growing, separate discussion about how well a non-stealthy tanker such as the KC-46 will be able to support stealthy manned and unmanned aircraft during any future high-end conflict, in general. A KC-46A with its boom fully extended., Boeing With these major issues remaining, it’s unclear how useful the aircraft will be to the Air Force in their present state. They will definitely serve a purpose in priming the training pipeline for Pegasus crews and getting personnel accustomed to the new tanker. How valuable this training can be, especially for boom operators, if there are major changes still to come, is certainly debatable, though. The Pegasus is supposed to undergo initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) this year , leading to the Air Force declaring an initial operational capability with the type sometime afterward. It’s not clear how well it will be able to meet the ITO&E criteria if the thrust resistance and RVS issues remain unresolved. This could limit the KC-46’s operational utility, regardless of whether the Air Force decides to declare it has reached an initial operational capability in the next few years until these problems are conclusively fixed. On top of the issues with the Pegasus itself, there is the matter of second-order impacts on the Air Force’s plans to retire older tankers , which could lead to additional, parallel spending on upgrading existing aircraft or contract aerial refueling services . The service still hopes to eventually have a fleet of nearly 180 KC-46s, as part of a broader push to expand its total combat force structure . All told, the acceptance of the first KC-46 is a significant step forward for the program, but it is clear that the Air Force and Boeing still have a long way to go before the new tankers are truly ready for action.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Russia Just Imported More World War II Era T-34 Tanks Than They Will Buy New T-14s This Year,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a three-way deal also involving Vietnam, Russia has taken delivery of around 30 World War II-era T-34/85 tanks from Laos. These tanks will take part in public parades, be installed as museum pieces, and maybe even end up in state-sponsored movies and other media. Though the exchange certainly taps into national pride, it may be hard to ignore that the Kremlin looks set to receive more examples of these historically significant, but hardly combat worthy vehicles this year than it will of its new T-14 Armatas . TV Zvezda , the official television channel of the Russian Ministry of Defense, reported that the T-34s , still bearing their distinctive Lao national insignia, had arrived in Russia’s far eastern port of Vladivostok on Jan. 9, 2019. From there, they will go to the city of Naro-Fominsk, near Moscow, which is home to the Russian Army’s 4th Guards Tank Division . https://youtube.com/watch?v=r8jeVPh674s Pictures had already emerged on social media showing workers loading the T-34s onto a ship in Vietnam on Dec. 29, 2018. Earlier that month, Russia had unloaded an initial batch of T-72B1 White Eagle tanks, bound for Laos, in Vietnam. Russia introduced the White Eagle upgrade in 2010 and sold the first examples to Nicaragua . These tanks feature various improvements over older T-72Bs, including the addition of the Kontakt-1 explosive reactive armor, a new thermal sight with a built-in laser rangefinder, a remotely operated weapon station on top of the turret, and updated communications equipment. The Russians reportedly tried to sell Laos the more advanced T-72B3 , which feature many more substantial improvements to bring them to a standard close to the more modern T-90 , in 2017. That year, Laotian troops had a chance to drive these vehicles during Russia’s annual Tank Biathlon , a sort of hybrid military exercise and sporting event that brings together military personnel from various countries around the world. https://youtube.com/watch?v=d9V59Zkqkxs Small, cash-strapped Laos balked at the T-72B3’s reported unit price of $3 million , opting for the cheaper T-72B1 White Eagle, instead. The exchange of the T-34/85s was also part of the 2017 deal, according to Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. The cost of new armored vehicles has also increasingly been an issue for the Russians, which is only set to begin the final round of pre-production trials of the new T-14 Armata tank later this year in advance of initial production deliveries in 2020. Though Russian officials have downplayed the delays and other issues in getting these new tanks into service, the Kremlin did announce in August 2018 that it would be focusing on purchasing upgraded T-72B3, T-80BVM, and T-90SM tanks in the near-term. On the other end, Laos appears to have become the last active operator of the T-34/85 anywhere in the world. It’s an impressive run for the last major variant of the iconic T-34, which entered service in the latter half of World War II. As its designation indicates, this version featured an 85mm main gun, which significantly boosted its firepower, especially against late-war Nazi medium and heavy tanks. The tank was already well known for its speed, mobility, armor protection, and reliability, and is generally considered one of, if not the best all-around medium tank of the war. Between 1940 and 1946, the Soviet Union made more than 58,000 T-34s of all types and after the war, they delivered thousands of these iconic vehicles to allies and partners, where they continued to see active combat. The Laotian examples, which the Russian Ministry of Defense says are 1944 production examples, took a curiously circuitous route to get to that country, though. Though it has become the final military operator of the type, Laos reportedly only received its T-34/85s as part of an earlier three-way deal involving the Soviet Union and Vietnam in 1987 . What was then North Vietnam had taken delivery of approximately 300 of these tanks between 1955 and 1960, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI . Still, the Lao People’s Liberation Armed Forces put these World War II-era vehicles into service alongside its only slightly newer T-54/T-55 tanks , which it had obtained in the 1970s. With their 1944 production dates, it is very possible that these tanks saw combat on the Eastern Front during World War II. After delivery to Vietnam, they could have seen further action against South Vietnam and its U.S. allies, or against the Americans and their partners in neighboring Laos. That they’re now back in Russia means they’ve come full circle. A posed picture of North Vietnamese T-34/85s with tank-riding infantry., Public Domain They’ve also returned home at a time when Russia under Vladimir Putin has been steadily looking to revise and leverage the history of the Soviet Union to tap into nationalist fervor. Post-Soviet Russia has found itself increasingly the target of international criticism and scrutiny since its illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula in 2014 and began actively backing separatist movements opposed to the government in Kiev. Since then, Russian forces have also supported Syria’s brutal dictator Bashar Al Assad in the civil war in his country and have engaged in a growing array of malicious activities around the world, including meddling in foreign elections and attempting to assassinate defectors and other political opponents, often with success . International condemnation of these acts, along with international sanctions, has only prompted Russia’s increasingly dictatorial President Putin to adopt even more aggressive stances . Weaponizing history , especially with regards to periods of time that many Russians see as high points in the country’s international standing, has become an important tool for the Kremlin. Though the exact timing appears to have been a coincidence, given that the deal with Laos dates back to 2017, the T-34s did arrive in Russia just as a state-sponsored film centered around a T-34 crew broke box office records in the country for a domestically produced movie. The film, simply titled T-34 , took in more than $10 million in ticket sales in its opening weekend. The movie follows what do not appear to be specifically Jewish Russian soldiers in a concentration camp. It is true that Soviet troops suffered hellish conditions at the hands of the Nazis, but the Soviet Union, and now Russia, have also routinely used that reality as a way to downplay the especially horrific experience of the Jews during the Holocaust. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YCZrStvzp-0 In the film, which came out around the beginning of the New Year, the Nazis force their captives to repair and then drive an unarmed T-34 so that their own tankers can practice against a “live” target. Needless to say, the Russians get the drop on their captors and use the tank to escape “in an attempt to preserve his life, love and devotion to the Motherland,” according to a statement from Russia’s Ministry of Culture . Early in November 2018, Russian theaters began screening Crimean Bridge: Made with Love! , a romantic comedy that focuses heavily on the Kremlin’s bridge from Russia into occupied Crimea. On Nov. 25, 2018, this structure became the scene of a violent skirmish between Russian and Ukrainian naval vessels. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7GCFsBsMdHE Holiday , sometimes also translated as Celebration , a black comedy set against the backdrop of the Nazi’s devastating multi-year Siege of Leningrad , which did not glamorize the Soviets, also came out around New Years. However, this privately-funded film has only gotten a Russian-language release through YouTube after falling afoul of the Ministry of Culture. Though property of the Russian Ministry of Defense, it is almost certain that the T-34s will end up in future state-supported movies, as well as make an appearance at other events. Russia also says the vehicles will allow them to rehabilitate various outdoor monuments and indoor displays. Some of the tanks will likely appear during the annual Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which commemorate the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany. They could easily make appearances at events marking the anniversary of other notable World War II engagements, such as the massive running tank battle near Kursk between July and August 1943. Whatever happens, that these tanks are still workable after 75 years is a testament to the durability of the design. They’ll likely continue to take part in parades and other non-combat activities for years to come. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Land Tanks"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 25, 2019",US Navy Plans To Send More Ships Into The Arctic As It Looks To Establish New Polar Port,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it is considering sending surface ships into the Arctic this summer and that it could establish a new strategic port facility in the Bering Sea to support more of those patrols in the future. These announcements come as the ice in the region continues to recede, opening up new maritime trade routes and other economic opportunities, as well as the possibility of conflict over competing interests . This has already prompted America’s “great power” competitors, especially Russia , to dramatically expand their military presence in the far north. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer discussed his service’s plans for the Arctic at a gathering at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 8, 2019 . He did not say what ships might be headed for the Arctic later this year or when and where exactly that deployment might occur. “As an example, this summer, the [Chief of Naval Operations] and I have talked about having some ships make the transit in the Arctic,” Spencer said, according to USNI News . “We’re just fleshing it out right now.” The Navy already has a well-established history of operations above the Arctic Circle. However, it has traditionally conducted most of these operations using submarines or patrol planes, both of which can more deftly avoid the threat of floating pack ice in the far north. The sail of the Seawolf -class attack submarine USS Connecticut pierces through the ice during Ice Exercise (ICEX) 2018., USN In October 2018, the service sent the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and the other ships in her strike group above the Arctic Circle , the first time a flattop had gone that far north in nearly three decades. This visit to the Norwegian Sea was part of NATO’s large-scale Exercise Trident Juncture , but also offered the Navy an opportunity to gather more contemporary insight into the challenges of operating in this environment. Beyond the cold temperatures, the bodies of water in and around the Arctic are notorious for their rough seas and extreme weather. The Whidbey Island -class landing ship dock USS Gunston Hall suffered damage and some members of her crew ended up with minor injuries as the ship encountered heavy seas on its way to join the Trident Juncture drills. The mishap forced the ship had to turn around and return to Iceland. Deck crews on USS Harry S. Truman brave the elements above the Arctic Circle during Exercise Trident Juncture in 2018., USN “But what is the purpose of that?” Spencer asked rhetorically about the plans for a new Arctic deployment. “We have to learn what it’s like to operate in that environment.” Though the Navy is well aware of the strategic importance of the Arctic, and has increasingly made it a priority issue , the service is up against a number of issues that might make it more difficult to expand its presence in the near-term. For one, it has no icebreakers and the U.S. government as a whole only owns two such ships . The U.S. Coast Guard operates both the heavy icebreaker USCGC Polar Star and the medium icebreaker USCGC Healy . The former ship, the more capable of the two, is increasingly old and unreliable. The National Science Foundation does hire contractors to provide icebreaking support in Antarctica, as well. The Coast Guard has been trying to acquire a new fleet of icebreakers for years , but has persistently run up against funding issues, a separate saga you can read about in more detail here . The partial U.S. federal government shutdown that began in December 2018, which affects the service, could delay those plans further . The heavy icebreaker USCGC Polar Star ., USCG Though the polar ice cap has been steadily receding due to global climate change, and areas of the Arctic are increasingly ice-free entirely for extended periods during the summer, this hasn’t totally eliminated the risks to non-ice-capable ships. “It’s going to be a multi-service task – I think you’ll see the Coast Guard involved,” Navy Secretary Spencer noted about the proposed summer trip to the region. The desire to have an icebreaker on call in case something happens could be a major limiting factor for the mission. A lack of naval support facilities above the Arctic Circle could make it harder to conduct sustained patrol and sea control operations, as well, which is the exact reason for wanting a new port on the Bering Sea in the future. “A strategic port up in the Bering [Sea] area is being explored, but that would be a whole-of-government approach: that would be Coast Guard, Navy and [Department of] Commerce in that regard,” Spencer explained. “But it’s an area we have to focus on, most definitely.” The Coast Guard’s medium icebreaker USCGC Healy helps free a Russian-flagged tanker from ice off the coast of Alaska in 2012., USCG But beyond the environmental hazards and limited infrastructure, many of the Navy’s non-ice-capable surface ships are not necessarily equipped to conduct protracted operations in extreme cold weather conditions, to begin with. The Ticonderoga -class cruisers , the first of which got laid down in 1980, was the last of its surface ship designs to feature a purpose-built steam de-icing system. This is apparently not a feature on Arleigh Burke -class destroyers , which form the core of the service’s combat surface fleets. Ice buildup on weapon systems, radomes, antennas, and other features on the Navy’s ships could limit their functionality or even cause damage. Without specialized de-icing features, a crew might have to spend significant effort manually removing the ice without causing any additional harm. That’s to say nothing of the need to clear flight decks and helicopter landing pads on carriers, amphibious ships, and other warships. Sailors clear snow from the deck of the Whidbey Island -class landing ship dock USS Fort McHenry during an exercise in 2016., USN These are all issues the Navy will have to address if it wants to be able to challenge any potential opponents in the Arctic. Russia, in particular, is far more comfortable with naval and other military activities in the region. The country has the benefit of an expansive coastline above the Arctic Circle, as well as numerous islands with increasingly robust military infrastructure . The Russians have also made steady investments in icebreakers and ice-capable warships , as well as other modernization efforts to increase the capabilities of their forces in the far north. In his talk, Spencer highlighted the Kremlin’s extensive Arctic capabilities in relating a story of a visit to NATO member Iceland shortly after taking up his post as Navy Secretary in October 2017. During his visit, “there was Russia, lighting up five Cold War runways with 10,000 Spetsnaz for ‘search and rescue,’” he said, using the Russian term for its special operations forces , according to Defense One . Russian special operators from the country’s National Guard during an Arctic training exercise., National Guard of Russia Since 2014 , Russia has made a point of rehabilitating disused Soviet-era military infrastructure in the Arctic, as well as building new facilities to better support sustained operations there. The Kremlin is certain to take notice of any increased American activity and may redouble its efforts in response. China is also increasing its presence in the region, which has been less visible, but is no less important. In September 2018, the country launched its first domestically produced heavy icebreaker and the state-run China National Nuclear Corporation is looking to build a nuclear-powered type in the future. All of this is in support of what the Chinese government has referred to as a “ Polar Silk Road ” in the region. The region is set to see an increase in commercial maritime traffic in the near future, as well. In 2017, the specialized ice-capable liquid natural gas tanker Christophe de Margerie became the first commercial ship to make a run through what is known as the Northern Sea Route at high speed without an escorting icebreaker. Last year, Denmark’s Maersk Line announced plans to become the first company to sail a container ship through the route. “Is that requirement a full requirement?” Spencer asked about whether the U.S. military’s over-arching plans for the Arctic were sufficient in response to the current and existing challenges in the region. “I think we can do more. We’re starting to do more in the Navy as we flesh it out.” Sending surface ships above the Arctic Circle is an important step toward more regular operations in the region and plans for an actual Arctic-focused base will be important to support those future missions. At the same time, the summer sortie may also highlight that the U.S. military still has a significant way to go to catch up with its competitors.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",U.S. Navy Destroyer Fired Off Advanced Hyper Velocity Projectiles During 2018 Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Dewey reportedly fired 20 Hyper Velocity Projectiles , or HVPs, from its main gun during the biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise, or RIMPAC, last year. It’s another major step forward for the program, which aims to give any Navy ship equipped with a five-inch deck gun, as well as other large caliber naval and land-based guns , a game-changing capability to conduct prompt strikes against various targets. It also holds the potential to give those same platforms a new way to shoot down helicopters, small drones, and even incoming anti-ship cruise missiles . USNI News got the scoop on the previously unannounced tests, citing anonymous sources, but did not say specifically when the test firing had occurred or if the experiments had successfully fulfilled all of the test points. RIMPAC 2018, which occurred in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, ran from June 27 to Aug. 2, 2018. RIMPAC 2018 included a number of live-fire drills, including the sinking of the retired Newport -class Landing Ship Tank the ex-USS Racine with a combination of air-, sea- , and ground-launched anti-ship cruise missiles and other weapons . We don’t know if Dewey fired any of its HVPs at the doomed ship. Despite the test being unclassified, according to USNI News , the Navy has refused to confirm or deny it occurred at all. It is increasingly apparent that the service has something of a gag order, formal or not, on public discussions about the HVP, as well as its Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG) program. Originally intended for the railgun specifically, the HVP, sometimes referred to now as the Gun Launched Guided Projectile (GLGP), has since evolved its own effort to develop a high-speed, multi-purpose projectile that will also work in traditional naval guns and land-based howitzers that use powder as a propellant. BAE Systems is the lead contractor on both projects. Mockups of the HVP for use in various different weapons. The five-inch type is at the top., Joseph Trevithick In January 2018, Vincent Sabio, the individual then in charge of the Hypervelocity Gun Weapon System (HGWS) program, an effort related to the HVP within the Pentagon’s secretive Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), seemed to imply there would be a test involving the projectiles before the end of the year. “My program ends less than a year from now,” Sabio told a gathering at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, D.C. In 2016, SCO conducted separate tests of the HVP using unspecified conventional weapons, but it’s not clear if those experiments occurred on land or at sea. SCO worked together with the Navy for the subsequent tests in the Pacific, according to USNI News . Whatever the exact nature of the tests and their results, an at-sea demonstration of the HVP is still definitely a major milestone for the program. The new projectiles offer a relatively low-cost and low-risk capability boost for the Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyers , Ticonderoga -class cruisers , and any other future ship that uses a variant of the Mk 45 five-inch gun . A three-dimensional rendering of the HVP., BAE Systems The Navy wants to be able to shoot the HVPs at velocities up to Mach 3 from the Mk 45s using traditional propellant charges. This is half as fast as the service has been able to send the projectiles flying from its prototype railguns , but is still significantly faster than the speed of traditional five-inch shells. With a maximum range close to 50 miles, the HVPs also dramatically outrange existing ammunition and can quickly cover that greater distance. This makes the rounds well suited to time-sensitive strikes against targets ashore. That speed and range would allow them to more quickly engage other warships and even fast-moving smaller watercraft , too. This would improve the Mk 45’s anti-surface warfare capabilities and give it a secondary close-in defense role against swarming boats . The Navy hopes that the speed of the new projectiles will also give the Mk 45 much more robust anti-aircraft and all-new anti-missile capabilities, as well. At present, the service’s various warships rely on a mix of surface-to-air missiles and close-in defense systems to defend against those threats. A graphic showing the various possible roles for HVP-armed ships, as well as those equipped with railguns., USN The problem is that weapons such the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) and the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) are expensive per-shot especially for taking down small drones or incoming missiles. Close-in systems, including the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) and Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS), are true to their name and only provide a last line of defense against air and missile threats. “That [hyper velocity] projectile has been independently costed – not by me, I wouldn’t expect you to believe my costing – but … by Navy IWS [Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems] at about $85,000 a round,” SCO’s Sabio said in January 2018 . “You can shoot a lot of those things and not feel badly about it.” For comparison, each of the latest Block II ESSMs costs the Navy around $2 million, while individual RAMs set the service back around $640,000 apiece. The new gun-launched projectile’s $85,000 price tag is more than three times higher than the initial estimates , but is still exponentially cheaper than these missiles. The Mk 45 also has the benefits of significant magazine depth and a relatively high rate of fire for a naval gun. Arleigh Burkes can carry around 600 shells for the guns, which can pump out shells at between 16 and 20 rounds per minute. This also means the gun could rapidly shoot multiple rounds to impact nearly simultaneously over a larger area. The HVP’s cost could still grow in the future as the Navy continues to explore exactly what guidance options it might want to use to improve the projectile’s capabilities against different target sets and reduce its vulnerability to jamming, spoofing, and other countermeasures. Air and missile defense-focused subvariants would also need to be more maneuverable than surface strike types. We don’t know the exact HVP configuration the Navy tested during RIMPAC 2018. But even at $100,000 per shell, it would still be a tenth of the price of a Rolling Airframe Missile and even cheaper than more advanced types. The fast-flying projectile’s capabilities and price also make it attractive as an option for the Zumwalt -class stealth destroyer ’s 155mm main guns. The weapons have been dead weight on those ships since the Navy canceled its plans to purchase the guided Long-Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) after its price point grew to whopping $800,000 per shell . If everything goes according to plan now, the HVP will work with Mk 45 guns, the 155mm guns on the Zumwalts , as well as 155mm howitzers on land and railguns the U.S. Army and Navy are testing separately. This will also help keep development and procurement costs low, since the main difference between the ammunition types will be the sabot that keeps the round steady as it travels down the barrel. At least from what we’ve seen so far, the projectiles themselves will be largely uniform no matter what weapon is firing them. The Navy has not said when it expects the HVP to transition from a research and development effort into a fully-fledged procurement program or when its destroyers and cruisers might begin carrying the projectiles on actual operational patrols. But the testing at RIMPAC shows that the service is steadily pushing ahead to get this game-changing ammunition ready for action on its Arleigh Burkes and Ticonderogas , as well as other platforms at sea and on land.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 9, 2018","Listen To This Incredible Audio Of Israel F-15 Pilots Losing Their Canopy At 30,000 Feet","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israeli Air Force has revealed a harrowing mishap occurred last week in which an F-15 combat jet’s canopy broke off while the plane was flying a training mission at 30,000 feet. Amazingly, the two pilots, who you can hear talking with ground controllers in audio that the Israel Defense Forces released, were able to maintain control of the plane and make an emergency landing. The two pilots involved in the incident, identified for security reasons only as Captain Yod and Lieutenant Resh, the first Hebrew letters of their first names, took off from Tel Nof Air Base in central Israel on Jan. 2, 2019. Sometime after Yod and Resh turned southward to begin their training mission, the canopy separated from the rest of the aircraft. So far, it’s unclear what happened and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are conducting an investigation into the accident. IAF commander Amikam Norkin a halt to all F-15 training flights pending the results of that review. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has not named their unit or the exact type of F-15 Eagle they were flying, but Tel Nof is home to 106 and 133 Squadrons, which fly a mix of Israeli upgraded F-15B/C/D “Baz,” or Falcon, aircraft. With two pilots involved, the plane in question would have been a B or D model , both of which are two-seaters. The IDF says that technicians are already investigating whether the mechanism that keeps the canopy closed failed or whether the there was a fault in the plane’s emergency ejection system, according to The Times of Israel . In the latter case, when the crew pulls the handle on their ejection seats, small explosives blow off the canopy so that they don’t go rocketing through the glass. An Israeli Air Force F-15D Baz., USAF The only reason that personnel on the ground can take a direct look into the cockpit is because Yod and Resh were able to make an emergency landing at Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel. This was no easy feat. Flying at 30,000 feet without the canopy, the crew was exposed to bone-chilling temperatures of nearly -50 degrees Fahrenheit, violent winds, and deafening noise. Though the aircraft’s oxygen system allowed them to breathe at that altitude, they would still have suffered the potentially serious effects of explosive decompression from the loss of pressurization in the cockpit, too. You can hear both of the men screaming after the canopy separates in the radio chatter that the IDF subsequently made public. Yod calls out to his back-seater Resh and contacts the control tower at Nevatim to alert them to the situation and request permission for an emergency landing. “Are you alright?” a Resh asks. “Yes, I’m fine,” Yod responds as they begin heading toward Nevatim. Resh asks Yod to slow the plane down, which would help mitigate some of the wind and noise. Yod then assures the controllers on the ground that they are still able to make it to the base. “Are you with me, brother?” Yod says to Resh. “Is everything okay? Is your seat down?” he continues, possibly asking whether or not his backseater’s ejection seat may have misfired or otherwise ensuring that it hasn’t outright malfunctioned. Resh assures him that everything is okay and they proceed to make their emergency landing. “The aircrew in the plane had full control of the incident throughout,” a subsequent IDF statement read. They “acted with calm,  professionalism and expertise in handling the unusual fault, and brought the plane to a safe landing at the Nevatim Air Force Base.” A trio of Israeli F-15Ds., MinoZig via Wikimedia The canopy dislodging from a combat jet in flight is an uncommon occurrence, but hardly unheard of . An unnamed IDF spokesperson told The Times of Israel that this is the first time this had happened to the IAF since 2004, when an A-4 Skyhawk suffered a similar mishap. In that case, the crew had to eject and the plane crashed. It’s also not the first time Israeli F-15 pilots have been able to successfully make an emergency landing after a near catastrophic in-flight incident. In 1983 , two F-15Ds and four A-4 were conducting an air combat training exercise in southern Israel, when one of the Bazs collided with one of the smaller Skyhawks. The mishap ripped off one of the F-15D’s wings and forced the Skyhawk pilot to eject. In a testament to the robust nature of the F-15’s lifting-body design and the skill of the Israeli crew, the Baz made it back to base and, after substantial repairs, returned to service. The damage in this latest mishap is thankfully far less severe, but Israel is unlikely to write the plane off, regardless. The IAF has a long history with the type and was instrumental in demonstrating the type’s capability as a long-range, multi-role strike and reconnaissance platform, something you can read about in more detail here . To this day, F-15s are a core component of the IAF’s force structure, complimenting other types , including the country’s growing fleet of stealthy F-35I Adir aircraft. With any luck, thanks to the quick and calm response from Yod and Resh, the canopy-less Baz will hopefully get back into action soon.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I was talking to a Joint Terminal Attack Controller recently who spent a lot of time in Afghanistan. We were discussing the different platforms that are lifesavers to troops in contact with the enemy. Obviously, the A-10 came up as he made it very clear that the airframe-gun combo that makes up the A-10 is incredibly powerful, especially when trying to surgically take out Taliban fighters operating very close to friendly troops and/or in urban environments where the chances of harm to innocent bystanders is really high. He pointed me to a video he said was a great example of what this looks like, so I thought I would share it with you and break it down a bit. The setting of the video is above a village in Afghanistan, one surrounded by steep mountains and made up of very similar looking low-rise structures that are so prevalent in the country. In it, troops are under direct fire from fighters taking cover around a number of buildings close by. A section of A-10 Warthogs, callsign  HOG 01 and HOG 04, have arrived overhead to give much needed close air support to American soldiers that have found themselves in an increasingly dire situation. What comes next are a number of gun runs in which the A-10 pilots rapidly employ their extremely potent 30mm GAU-8 Avenger cannons against the nearby fighters with great precision. The voice you are hearing requesting the strafing runs is the JTAC on the ground, callsign NIGHT OWL. Youtube Screencap To help you interpret what you are seeing in the A-10’s Heads Up Display (HUD), above is a screencap from the video. Here is the important information it is displaying in regards to what is going on. The 323 on the left is the airspeed in knots. Across from it, the 4860 is the barometric altitude. Below it is a -9, which means the aircraft is in a nine-degree dive. The 590 below that in the corner right stack is the radar altimeter’s altitude, so the true height above the ground in this case. The next three lines have to do with steering points, which can include tagged locations on the earth’s surface and their time and distance to the aircraft’s present location. The bottom number is the current time. At the center bottom of the screen is the heading, with the jet pointing north. ARM means the master arm is on and the aircraft is ready to employ its weapons. Above that is the selected weapon profile and the quantity and type of weapon. In this case, the aircraft shows 950 rounds of high-explosive incendiary 30mm ammunition ready to fire. The upper left figure is the G-force on the aircraft at any given moment. In this case 1.4G. In the center is the pitch ladder with the gun’s aiming reticle towards the top. Once in firing range, the inner circle highlight begins to diminish, with the approximate range to where the gun is pointing, or the constantly computed impact point on the ground, showing in miles. In this case 1.5 as in 1.5 miles. The little ball-bar inside of the reticle is the velocity vector showing where the aircraft is headed. With all that being said, here’s the video: The A-10s arrive for a show of force pass over the target in an attempt to scare the enemy away and to get a better idea of the situation on the ground and where everyone is at. NIGHT OWL calls in, with the rackety sounds of battle loud in the background, frantically requesting the A-10s fire their guns on the enemy. What comes next is the lead A-10 pilot working to deconflict bad guys and the friendlies in the target area. The JTAC tells the flight that he has marked the target with smoke, to strafe it as soon as they can, and that friendly forces are clear of the target location. Keep in mind that when the gun is used instead of high-explosive missiles or bombs, it often means that friendly troops are in fact in very close proximity to the marked target. The A-10 pilot calmly confirms that the target building is in sight, friendly forces are in sight, and that he is going to make a north to south run on the target firing the jet’s cannon. The JTAC on the ground responds that the A-10 is cleared hot in a manner that sounds like it couldn’t happen soon enough. The A-10 then pumps 220 rounds into the target in two bursts and pulls off into a climb. You can see the intense effects of the HEI ammunition as it impacts the target area. USAF Then the A-10 asks NIGHT OWL for the status of him and his troops on the ground. NIGHT OWL responds in a much more up-beat tone that everyone is ok. The strafing run was clearly successful, but his position is still taking fire so the A-10s prepare for another pass. The smoke from the attack is used by the A-10 pilot as a point of reference for NIGHT OWL to correct his fire to better target the remaining enemy forces. NIGHT OWL tells him to start his next gun run 200 meters south of the smoke. It is this high-pressure game of three-dimensional visual-verbal situational awareness building that A-10 pilots master to an astonishing degree. Their expertise and experience mean faster re-attacks that are more precise and thus deadly. The gun plays into this special ability as it is the tool that can bring a lot of hurt to the enemy quickly while troops are still very close to the bad guys. This time HOG 01 and HOG 04 make consecutive runs on the target, with the NIGH OWL correcting HOG 01’s fire 100 meters to the north with rapid directions to HOG 04 which has already rolled in on the target. NIGHT OWL, now sounding far more relaxed, exclaims “HOG element good guns, good guns!” meaning their attack runs were a success. USAF HOG 01 then asks if NIGHT OWL needs another gun run. NIGHT OWL responds, telling the flight of A-10s to standby as he assesses the situation. HOG 01 then says he is going to make a non-firing pass to mark the target area’s location in his navigational computer system. That’s where the video ends. It’s worth noting that at the end of the video, HOG 01 had expended 410 rounds and still has 740 more left in its magazine. An F-16 carries 511 20mm rounds and an F-35A carries 180 25mm rounds , both of which are far inferior to the A-10’s coke bottle sized 30mm shells. All in all, it is a compelling example of A-10 pilots and JTACs plying their deadly trade with incredible efficiency and yet another reminder of the unique value the Warthog brings to the fight. No other jet aircraft or their crews are as adept at flying and fighting at low-level and bringing pain to the enemy as quickly, as accurately, or as ferociously.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 18, 2019",Ukrainian Il-76 Airlifter That Was Tracked Across U.S. Delivered Radar Asset To Utah Air Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Ukranian Air Force Il-76 ‘Candid’ cargo plane has appeared at an Air National Guard facility attached to Salt Lake City International Airport. We now know that it has delivered an unspecified mobile radar system as part of a U.S. Air Force contract. Online plane trackers first noticed the Il-76, of which the Ukrainian Air Force has around five in service in total, traveling westward from Ottawa/Macdonald–Cartier International Airport in eastern Canada on the morning of Dec. 3, 2019. The Candid was on the ground in Salt Lake City before 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. Curiously, at the same time, information from our friend and intrepid plane tracker @CivMilAir indicated that the aircraft was showing up as 737 airliner with the registration UR-IVK, which belongs to Ukranian airline Dniproavia . But Dniproavia does not fly any routes to the United States at all and a 737 from that airline would be a very long way from home. @CivMilAir also noted that this could be an error with the tracking software or an issue with the aircraft’s transponder—one made by mistake or otherwise. @CivMilAir @CivMilAir @CivMilAir Then, at 4:00 PM EST, plane spotter Anthony Carpeneti posted a picture on Twitter confirming that the aircraft in question was indeed an Il-76 and was sitting at the Roland R. Wright Air National Guard Base, which is situated at the eastern side of Salt Lake City International Airport. This facility is home to the Utah Air National Guard’s 151st Air Refueling Wing , which operates KC-135R tankers . The 151st is assisting with the “download of mobile radar asset under [a] contract managed by Hill Air Force Base,” U.S. Air Force Major Kevin Larsen, a spokesperson for the Utah Air National Guard, told The War Zone in an Email. We were then directed to reach out to Hill for further information, but, at the time of writing, the public affairs office there has not yet been able to respond to our queries. It is not entirely clear why the Il-76 would deliver the radar to the airport in Salt Lake City rather than to Hill directly, which is situated less than 25 miles to the north. We also do not know whether the contract that calls for the radar involves work at that base itself. Contracting offices at Hill are known to manage projects at Air Force facilities elsewhere in the United States , including at the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) and Tonopah Test Range (TTR), both situated in neighboring Nevada. We also don’t know the specific reason why the Air Force has received this radar system by way of Ukraine. One possibility is that the Il-76 was simply returning a Joint Threat Emitter, a training system that can mimic various air defense threats that you can read about in more detail here , to the United States. The U.S. military often brings these systems to exercises and other events overseas, but often handles the shipping itself or through private contractors. Based on what we know, it seems more likely that the Air Force has purchased or leased a radar from Ukraine for so-called “ foreign materiel exploitation ” (FME) purposes. The U.S. military is always looking to acquire “threat representative” systems to pick them apart and look for potential vulnerabilities, as well as seeing how threatening they might actually be to American forces while operating in real-world conditions. Ukraine, a friendly former Soviet republic that still maintains and produces various Soviet-era systems, has become an increasingly valuable source for this type of equipment. In September 2018, the U.S. Army reportedly took delivery of another Ukrainian air defense radar, a 36D6M1-1 , which is associated with the S-300 surface-to-air missile system. Variants of the S-300 remain in service in Russia , as well as numerous other countries around the world, including other potential American opponents, such as Iran . The new Ukranian radar could also be similar, if not identical to a system still in widespread use. A Ukrainian trailer-mounted 36D6M1-1 radar in its deployed configuration., UKROBORONPROM If the radar does go to Hill, it would almost certainly find its way out onto the nearby Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR). It might also end up at the NTTR or TTR in Nevada or make appearances at various different sites, depending on the nature of the Air Force contract. Regardless, the Air Force would be keen to fly various aircraft against it, including the stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighter . This gives the service an opportunity to see how well the radar can spot and track different targets. It also offers a chance to see how well the electronic warfare and other self-protection systems on any U.S. military aircraft handle the threat. Hill, one of the Air Force’s premier F-35 bases , and the associated UTTR, would be a prime location to test out the radar and how the jets react to it. The Air Force, as well as other U.S. military services, might look to pit other types of non-stealth fighter jets, including those tasked with suppression or destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), against the radar, too. It could be a valuable training target for electronic warfare , electronic intelligence , and potentially other manned or unmanned aircraft against the radar, as well. Beyond that, foreign military systems can be a wealth of intelligence information broadly. As such, the demand for foreign military equipment to analyze is consistently high, regardless of how its obtained . But, the U.S. military’s recent shift in focus toward potential “great power conflicts” with countries such as Russia or China under President Donald Trump has no doubt added to the desire to acquire analogs to equipment from those countries. It’s very possible that we could see similar deliveries from Ukraine in the near future, especially given Kiev’s own particularly cold relationship with the Kremlin. In the meantime, we’re still working to get more details about this particular delivery and we’ll be sure to keep you updated as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 17, 2021",China’s Historic Mission To The Dark Side Of The Moon Is About More Than Science,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s has become the first country ever to land a spacecraft on the far side, or “dark side,” of the Moon, a major achievement for its civilian space program. The mission offers numerous scientific research opportunities, but there is also a possibility that it could be another stepping stone to improving and expanding Chinese military capabilities in space . The lander, known as Chang’e 4 , touched down in the Von Kármán crater at around 9:30 PM EST on Jan. 2, 2019. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) had launched the craft on top of a Long March-3B/G3Z space launch rocket on Dec. 7, 2018. It then entered orbit around the Moon on Dec. 12, 2018. “China is on the road to become [sic] a strong space nation,” Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the Chang’e 4, told state-run CCTV after the landing. “And this marks one of the milestone events of building a strong space nation.” The lander itself has various cameras, a spectrometer, and a neutron dosimeter in order to gather scientific data. It has also deployed a mobile rover weighing more than 300 pounds that carries its own electro-optical systems, spectrometer, energetic neutral atom analyzer, and ground-penetrating radar. The Chang’e 4’s primary mission is to study geophysics and radiation characteristics of the far side of the Moon, as well as peer out into deep space. Due to a situation called “ tidal locking ,” the dark side never faces the Earth, giving it unique characteristics. “Since the far side of the moon is shielded from electromagnetic interference from the Earth, it’s an ideal place to research the space environment and solar bursts,” Tongjie Liu, the deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center at the China National Space Administration, explained, according to CNN . “The probe can ‘listen’ to the deeper reaches of the cosmos.” While the information the lander and its rover are set to gather could be of high scientific value, just getting the spacecraft to the far side of the moon was an achievement in of itself. Since there is no direct line-of-sight to Earth, the Chinese can only communicate with Chang’e 4 via a dedicated communications relay satellite, known as Queqiao . The team at CNSA overseeing the mission spent much of the time between when the spacecraft arrived in orbit around the Moon on Dec. 12 and when it finally set down on the lunar surface four weeks later ensuring that these data links worked as intended. Chang’e 4’s landing itself was entirely autonomous. An image of the Von Kármán crater as seen from the Chang’e 4 during its descent to the Moon’s surface., CNSA/CLEP The potential risks and associated costs have long stood in the way of a mission to the dark side of the Moon. U.S. astronaut Harrison Schmitt had proposed that the Apollo 17 mission, the United States’ last manned lunar mission, head to the far side using a satellite relay arrangement. NASA rejected the idea. Chang’e 4 is also the latest in the Chang’e series, all of which have been stepping stones toward China’s plans for a manned lunar mission and the potential construction of a semi-permeant outpost on the Moon as part of the overarching Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP). The present mission’s scientific research will support studies into the practicality of sending actual humans to the dark side of the moon and potentially leaving them there for protracted periods of time. In addition to its various sensors and data collection systems, the lander also has a self-contained “biosphere” with various seeds and silkworm eggs. Chinese scientists are interested to know whether the plants and insects can create a sustaining, symbiotic relationship inside the artificial habitat. The future Chang’e 5 and 6 missions’ goals are to conduct round trips to the Moon where the semi-autonomous craft comes back to earth. This will set the stage for the actual manned operation, set to occur sometime in the 2030s. The European Space Agency (ESA) has indicated it might be interested in working together with China on the CLEP program. The Chang’e 4 mission includes silkworm eggs, with the hope that the larvae, such as the ones seen here, will be able to hatch and thrive., Fastily There is great hope that new manned missions to the Moon, and a potential base there, will further humanity’s understanding of the moon and space in general. At the same time, there are concerns that China may have more ambitious designs and that these missions could have a military component. “China has been very clear in its understanding of this. They have compared the moon to the South China Sea and Taiwan , and asteroids to the East China Sea ,” Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told The Guardian . “They’re making a very clear geopolitical comparison with what’s happening with space and we need to pay attention to that.” In recent years, China has become increasingly assertive of its expansive terrestrial claims, especially in the South China Sea , using a constellation of militarized man-made islands to try to force other countries out of the region. A lunar outpost might similarly give the Chinese a very tangible and unprecedented national claim to a portion of the Moon’s surface. Though there is no agreement about whether it will ever be practical to extract natural resources to exploit on the Moon , as well as asteroids further out in space, or what regulations might apply , China’s lunar missions could give it a leg up in any such future endeavors. In October 2018, Jeff Gossel, the top intelligence engineer within the U.S. Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center’s (NASIC) Space and Missile Analysis Group warned about the potential for a more nefarious purpose to the Queqiao relay satellite specifically. Though he noted that the likelihood of the threat remained small, the engineer described a nonetheless worrying theoretical possibility that the Chinese could the dark side of the Moon to hide anti-satellite weapons. https://youtube.com/watch?v=DIXoUzOgFV8 “You could fly some sort of a weapon around the moon and it comes back — it could literally come at [objects] in GEO [geosynchronous orbit],” he explained at an Air Force Association gathering on Oct. 12, 2018. “And we would never know because there is nothing watching in that direction.” Any spacecraft that can semi-autonomously travel to the dark side of the moon and then launch back toward Earth on command unannounced would also have a distinct potential as a space-based weapon. Since the dark side of the moon is difficult to monitor from Earth and space in general, it could be hard to independently confirm whether or not a Chinese outpost there is exclusively scientific in nature in general. International treaties presently ban the deployment of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in space or on the Moon, but do not prohibit conventional types or dual-use systems. This has already caused significant consternation between the United States and Russia over the exact purpose of Russia’s “ space apparatus inspectors .” The U.S. government contends that these small, highly maneuverable satellites, which you can read about in more detail here , are inherently dual-purpose and give the Kremlin a cover story for fielding space-based weapons. Russia also has a variety of ground-based and air-launched anti-satellite weapons in various stages of development. The Chinese have also demonstrated a terrestrial anti-satellite capability and continue to invest in these weapons. A low-quality image of a transporter-erector carrying a modified Chinese DF-11 ballistic missile with what may be a Dong Neng-series anti-satellite weapon on top., Chinese State Media All of these developments are meant to challenge to the advantages America has long enjoyed through its military space assets tasked with early warning , intelligence gathering , navigation and weapons guidance , and communications . We at The War Zone have continually highlighted these growing threats to the U.S. military’s space-based capabilities. All said, Chang’e 4’s mission to the dark side of the Moon is certainly a major achievement for the CNSA and will hopefully provide important benefits for space research. But it may also presage an all-new front in the steadily evolving nature of military activities in space.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 4, 2018",Spain To Pit Its Eurofighters Against France’s Stealth Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Spanish Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets and supporting personnel recently arrived in France to take part in evaluating the stealthy qualities of the Dassault nEUROn unmanned combat air vehicle , or UCAV. This comes as the Spanish are considering buying more of the fighters and are looking to join the French and Germans in the development of a new stealth fighter , as well as advanced unmanned combat aircraft. Spain’s Ministry of Defense announced the deployment in a press release on Dec. 28, 2018. The Spanish contingent consisted of two Typhoons, along with pilots and maintenance personnel, from Ala 11, or 11th Wing, which is based at Morón Air Base. The jets will operate from the French Air Force’s Istres-Le Tubé Air Base, which serves, in part, as a major French military aviation test facility, for the duration of their visit. Dassault During that time, the Typhoons will try to spot and track the nEUROn using their onboard radar, infrared search and track (IRST) system, electronic support measures suite, and the imaging infrared seeker in the IRIS-T short-range air-to-air missile. “It must be taken into account that the nEUROn was conceived as a stealth aircraft with very low radar and infrared signatures; hence the interest of facing this system with radars and other aerial sensors,” a basic translation of the Spanish statement said. The nEUROn program dates back to 1999 and, while France’s Dassault leads the project, it is really the work of a European team. Spain, through what had been known as EADS-CASA, has been involved in the drone’s development since 2006 and has been responsible for work on the wings, ground control station, and data link integration. In 2009, European aviation consortium Airbus’ military division absorbed EADS-CASA completely. A pair of Spanish Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets. The aircraft’s infrared search and track system is visible in front and to the left of the cockpit., Spanish Air Force Billed as a UCAV technology demonstrator, nEUROn has been flying since 2012 and has already gone through a number of tests to determine its ability to remain undetected and penetrate air defense networks. In 2016, the aircraft was reportedly able to successfully breach the air defense perimeter around the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle , a clear demonstration of its stealth characteristics. But there’s no indication it has ever squared off against the Eurofighter Typhoon specifically. Though Spain plans to upgrade its late-model Typhoons with the new active electronically scanned array (AESA) CAPTOR-E radar, its current jets still employ the mechanically scanned CAPTOR radar . They also feature EuroFirst Passive Infrared Airborne Track Equipment ( PIRATE ) infrared search and track system. The nEUROn and a Dassault Rafale M manned fighter jet fly in formation past the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle during tests in 2016., Dassault Aviation In looking for nEUROn, Spanish pilots will get a chance to see how their sensors work, or don’t, against a real-life, very stealthy target and provide important baseline data on how CAPTOR, PIRATE, and IRIS-T fare against the unmanned aircraft’s low signature design. This, in turn, could support the development of improvements or replacements for those sensors. The radar data specifically might be valuable as a control variable for future tests of the improved CATPOR-E. The Franco-Spanish testing is also likely to help inform the development of new tactics, techniques, and procedures for Typhoon pilots operating in future conflicts against opponents with manned or unmanned stealth aircraft . IRST systems, which have steadily improved in terms of range and precision, have become increasingly important alternatives to radar when it comes to detecting aircraft that feature low radar cross-sections , for fourth-generation fighter jets, in particular. The video below shows Spanish Eurofighters conducting NATO air policing missions in the Baltic region armed with both IRIS-T and AIM-120 air-to-air missiles . Fighters with IRST systems can scan for targets passively without having to turn on their radars, reducing their own vulnerability to a degree, as well. They’re also impervious to jamming, making them a valuable backup sensor in any modern air-to-air fight. You can read all about the history and capabilities of these systems in detail here and here . The tests in France will similarly give Dassault and its European partners additional information about the unmanned aircraft’s capabilities that can only help in improving and refining nEUROn and its future operational successors. Just as the Spanish Eurofighter pilots will get a chance to test their air combat tactics against a stealthy adversary in a more realistic environment, the team in charge of nEUROn will have an opportunity evaluate any recent updates to the aircraft’s physical design, sensors, flight control systems and software, and semi-autonomous capabilities. This can only help advance the nEUROn program, which is supposed to serve, in part, as a stepping stone to a serial production UCAV, known as the Next Generation Weapon System (NGWS). This follow-on project is part of the broader Future Air Combat Systems (FCAS) program, which also includes plans for a stealth fighter jet, or Next Generation Fighter (NGF). The French and Germans are leading the FCAS effort, but the Spanish Ministry of Defense publicly announced its desire to join the partnership on Dec. 3, 2018. At the same time, on Dec. 18, 2018, the Spanish Ministry of Defense said that it was considering purchasing additional Typhoons as interim replacements for at least some its aging EF-18A/B Hornet fighter jets. At least 20 Hornets will need replacing by 2025 and the entire EF-18A/B fleet is supposed to be out of service by 2030. Buying more Eurofighters would be a logical course of action in the near term given that Spain already operates this type, which would help keep training, maintenance, and logistics requirements to a minimum. An infographic describing the various components of Airbus’ FCAS concept, including the “new fighter,” which is now known as the Next Generation Fighter., Airbus Still, Spain ultimately wants to replace all its remaining Hornets , and possibly some of its older Typhoons, with the NGF. The country could also be interested in acquiring any production-ready UCAV design that evolves from nEUROn. The FCAS program envisions the manned fighter jets working networked together with the unmanned aircraft as “ loyal wingmen .” However, present projections and past experience with stealth aircraft development programs, indicate that the NGF won’t begin entering service until sometime between 2030 and 2040, if it makes it into large-scale production at all. This would create a further impetus for upgrading existing and future Spanish Air Force Eurofighters to be better suited to taking on stealthy threats. nEUROn under construction., Dassault In the same timeframe, UCAVs, such as the future NGWS, will only become more advanced thanks to lessons learned from types that are already flying, such as nEUROn. These have the potential to offer a far more cost-effective and more capable alternative to manned aircraft to satisfy a large number of missions. China , and to a lesser extent Russia , among others , are pushing ahead with the development of UCAVs for exactly these reasons and it is a trend that is only likely to grow exponentially as time goes on. With these potential threats in mind, it’s not surprising that Spain is eager to see how its front-line, non-stealthy fighter jets fare against a UCAV. Also, trials like this one in France will only become more common around the globe, as knowing just how vulnerable one’s air defenses might be to this game-changing technology will be an increasingly urgent priority.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 9, 2019",Russia Projects Heavy Airpower In The Arctic From Constellation of New And Improved Bases,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says its combat aircraft flew dozens of patrols over the Arctic during 2018 and that it expects to continue those activities from various bases in the region this year. The ability to conduct persistent, localized air operations would be critical for the Kremlin during any potential conflict in the increasingly strategic part of the globe . It will also help the Russians realize their economic ambitions there during peacetime. In 2018, Russian Tu-142 Bear and Il-38 May martime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft, as well as Su-24MR Fencer tactical reconnaissance jets, flew more than 100 sorties in total above the Arctic circle, according to a statement from Russia’s Ministry of Defense on Jan. 1, 2019. These flights occurred over Russian national territory and out in international airspace. This operational tempo will continue, if not increase in 2019, the statement continued. Russian crews flying aircraft in the region have been expanding their training regimens to include the development of specialized Arctic navigation and weather-related skills sets, as well. Ambient temperatures in the Arctic can often be extremely low and the region is prone to other extreme weather , including severe storms. The Russian military, and the country’s Northern Fleet, in particular, has significantly expanded its physical presence in the Arctic region. This includes the refurbishment of existing airfields and the establishment of new ones, along with the rehabilitation and construction of associated living spaces and other support facilities. A Russian Il-38 maritime patrol and anti-submarine patrol aircraft., Papas Dos via Wikimedia Among the most significant of these is the Arctkicheski Trilistnik , or Arctic Trefoil or Arctic Shamrock, an all-new site at Nagurskoye on Alexandra Land, an island in the Franz Josef archipelago, which sits relatively high in the Arctic Circle, less than 500 miles from the North Pole. The site is designed to house around 150 personnel and can go months at a time without resupply via ship or through its attached airfield. Typical winter temperatures in Alexandra Land can easily drop to -40 degrees Fahrenheit and at these northern latitudes, the site never sees daylight for an extended period each year. It’s these sorts of conditions that simply make air operations, military or otherwise, impractical in many cases and require a high degree of training even in relatively benign weather. https://youtube.com/watch?v=C58AdoDqk6A In 2016, the Russian military said it planned to expand the airfield in Nagurskoye to include a runway more than 8,000 feet long. This would go along with plans to semi-permanently deploy MiG-31 Foxhound long-range interceptors and Su-34 Fullback combat jets at the base. Beyond the Arctkicheski Trilistnik , there are now new and refurbished Russian bases on other islands in Russia’s far north, including Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, New Siberian Islands, Wrangle Island and Cape Shmidt, according to a report from The Barents Observer . There is another airstrip on Kotelny in the New Siberian Islands already in operation. Some of these sites are little more than seasonal ice runways , which do not allow for year-round operations, but could grow in size and scope in the future. Russia is also exploring the possibility of using floating nuclear reactors to provide power at these sites. A Russian MiG-31 Foxhound., Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia The air bases at Nagurskoye and Kotelny already give Russian patrol and reconnaissance aircraft excellent coverage across the Arctic. With a combat radius of close to 4,000 miles, the Tu-142s, in particular, would be able to fly persistent orbits over certain zones, watching for potential threats and perform more general maritime surveillance and sea control duties. Being able to send out the Tu-142s, as well as the Il-38s, which can themselves remain airborne for up to 13 hours, from bases within the region will also present a challenge to foreign submarine operations as Russia looks to expand its own undersea presence . The ice in the Arctic has historically offered a way to hide underwater activities , but that has already begun to change as this natural cover has steadily receded due to global climate change. Having more aircraft in total that are capable of performing a more diverse set of missions from a number of sites throughout Arctic will only improve Russia’s overall combat capability in the region. Having MiG-31 interceptors, as well as other fighter jets , to threaten an opponent’s own aircraft, along with Su-34s and other planes able to strike at their ships and ground forces, would give the Kremlin a full range of options for defending its regional interests during a crisis. The airfields will also enable Russian cargo aircraft to deliver reinforcements and supplies to remote sites and more rapidly move units around the region, as necessary. Russia’s own naval and ground assets, including land-based surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles , could further help the country deny an enemy access to entire portions of the Arctic at a time. A Russian Il-76 Candid cargo plane comes into land at the airstrip at Nagurskoye., Russian MoD The Kremlin’s airpower in the Arctic also looks set to provide important non-combat roles during peacetime, as well. Among the tasks Russian military aircraft reportedly performed in 2018 was mapping ice fields and their movement, accord to the January 2019 statement from the Defense Ministry. Knowing the ice situation is as vital for civilian maritime traffic in the region as it is for military movements. With polar ice receding in general and as the period where season pack ice threatens ships continues to shrink, Russia has only become more eager to open up its Northern Sea Route to regular commercial shipping. In August 2018 , the Danish firm Maersk Line declared it would seek to become the first shipping company to ever send a container ship through the Northern Sea Route. This initial run will serve as a proof of concept for whether the route is indeed practical for this kind of cargo operation. In 2017, the liquid natural gas tanker Christophe de Margerie became the first commercial ship to make the run at high speed without an escorting icebreaker, though it has its own ice capable hull design. The ice capable tanker Christophe de Margerie , DSME The Russian Navy and the country’s civilian agencies do have dozens of icebreakers to help in further mitigating the dangers and aerial patrols would help them better prioritize their work. Patrol planes might also be able to spot rapidly changing situations and alert ships down below to new hazards. They’d be on station more regularly in case an accident or other incident did occur and required authorities to rush to the scene for some reason. Russia has already been steadily expanding its force posture in the Arctic for years now, but the increased deployment of heavy airpower is yet another sign of the Kremlin’s efforts to assert its territorial claims and challenge other countries who might be looking to expand their own military or commercial presence in the region.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What a crazy year it has been. It went by so fast, but It’s like jumping in Doc Brown’s Delorean and taking a trip back in time just looking through the hundreds of articles we posted over the last 12 months, which ranged from humor pieces to exclusives on undisclosed secret programs. What a wild ride it’s been. With this in mind, we thought it would be fun to package up some of our favorite pieces of 2018 all in one place. If anything else, it serves as some great New Years Day reading and is a good sampling of what we do here on a daily basis. So without further adieu, here’s our year in review: Confessions Of… Without a doubt, our most popular series of features is our ongoing long first-hand accounts from those who have been there and done that. As we put in our recent letter to our readers: “Often times, our readers become the subjects of our biggest and best pieces. Their stories, their insights, and their unique points of view are a huge part of what makes us different. I always envisioned this concept as a space that relies heavily on the perspectives of those who worked on the lower decks, or spent their careers in cockpits, foxholes, hangars, machine shops, and laboratories, and not as another showcase for the polished buzzword-filled speak from the Pentagon’s brass or those with corner offices in corporate towers. This site is often about the unsung heroes of the defense apparatus that deserve to have their voice heard.” Here are those pieces from 2018: Confessions Of An E-2C Hawkeye Radar Operator What It’s Like To Work Inside The Navy’s Secretive China Lake Weapons Development Center Tales Of Nuclear Cruiser USS Long Beach From A Sailor Who Built His Career Aboard Her Recollections Of Life At Sea And Some Advice From A U.S. Navy Force Master Chief Confessions Of A U.S. Marine F/A-18 Hornet Maintainer Big Exclusives We here at The War Zone are always striving to bring our readers a little extra no matter what the story, but 2018 was a great year for being able to offer exclusive looks at military systems and programs that you just couldn’t find anywhere else. Here are some highlights: Exclusive: Unmasking The F-15X, Boeing’s F-15C/D Eagle Replacement Fighter Here’s The F-22 Production Restart Study The USAF Has Kept Secret For Over A Year The Air Force’s Elite Weapons School Has Given The F-35 A New Nickname Markings On Scaled Composites’ ARES Confirm Its Connection To Mysterious Model 401 Jets Exclusive Images Unmask Name Of Scaled Composites’ Mysterious Model 401 ‘Son Of Ares’ Jet Exclusive Photos: Lockheed Skunk Works’ X-44A Flying Wing Drone Breaks Cover Exclusive: Lockheed Skunk Works’ X-44A Flying-Wing Drone Revealed This Is What A Boeing F-32 Would’ve Looked Like If Lockheed Lost The JSF Competition Northrop Grumman Plans To Upend Aerial Surveillance Market With Their Optionally Manned Firebird Lockheed’s Wayne Roberts On Looping The Hercules, Test Flying, And All Things C-130 In the news To put it mildly, 2018 was a big year for big news, from Donald Trump’s historic meeting with North Korean Premier Kim Jong Un to the ever-evolving conflict in Syria to major developments in international treaties and arms control deals, just to name just a few. It would be impossible to cover it all again quickly, but here is a sampling of our coverage and analysis of some of the biggest events: Syrian Standoff: Kurds Ask Assad For Help Fighting Turkish Forces As Americans Leave What Pulling Out Of The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty Means And What Comes Next Iran To Practice Blockading Strait Of Hormuz As Saudis Say Mandeb Strait Is No Longer Safe A USAF C-17 Flew A Secretive Mission Into Yemen To Rescue Wounded Emirati Troops In 2017 First Images Of New VH-92 Marine One Helicopter Landing On White House Lawn China’s J-20 Stealth Fighter Stuns By Brandishing Full Load Of Missiles At Zhuhai Air Show Recent MALD-X Advanced Air Launched Decoy Test Is A Much Bigger Deal Than It Sounds Like Kim And Company Arrive In Singapore Via A Procession Of Chinese And North Korean Jets (Updated) American General In Syria Confirms US Forces Killed Hundreds Of Russians In Massive Battle Here’s The Six Super Weapons Putin Unveiled During Fiery Address Kim Jong Un’s Praetorian Guards Are Really A 100,000 Man Personal Army Secretive units and missions There’s a whole black world of U.S. military units and operations and it can be very challenging to get official information about these activities. But we’re always keeping our eyes open for new information or other released details or statements that give new insights into this shadowy world. Here are some examples from 2018 of how we cover this unique space like nobody else: Censored Craft Near Hangar Appears In Satellite Image Of Secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport Shedding Some Light On The Air Force’s Most Shadowy Drone Squadron Congressman Details Integration Issues With The B-21’s Exotic Air Inlet Design Mysterious B-21 Raider Combined Test Force Patch Emerges The Dark World Of USAF Special Ops Air Refuelers And Their Modified KC-135RT Tankers This Isn’t An Early B-2 Cockpit Mockup, It’s For A Previously Undisclosed Special Ops Transport Listen To This Highly Interesting Radio Recording Of The F-117’s Latest Flight Over Nevada U.S. Special Operations Command’s Elusive Mothership Is Packing Stealth Speedboats We Have More Info On The Presidential Motorcade’s New Satcom-Packing Super Truck Bitten by the Black Widow One of our goals in 2018 was to create an ongoing series examining the story of an aircraft that has taken on a near cult following—Northrop’s YF-23. The aircraft lost the Advanced Tactical Fighter competition to the YF-22, but even nearly three decades after that tender was awarded, the YF-23 remains one of the most enigmatic and misunderstood aircraft of our time. We are working hard to connect the dots and paint a more realistic picture of what the aircraft was and what it wasn’t. Here are our features that aimed to do just that and stay tuned for more installments in 2019: This Is What A Northrop F-23A Would’ve Looked Like If It Had Beaten Lockheed’s F-22 The YF-23’s Weapons Bay Layout Was One Of Its Best Features And One Of Its Worst The YF-23’s Air Inlet Design Was Its Most Exotic Feature You Never Heard Of The venerable A-10 Warthog 2018 was a particularly significant year for the future of the A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft and we made sure to keep tabs on it every step of the way. Our own Tyler Rogoway also got the unfortunate news that a program to turn one of the jets into an armored storm-chaser had finally come to an inglorious end. Here a sampling of our ongoing coverage on the A-10’s plight: What’s To Come Of The A-10 Now That It Has Lost Its Loudest Defenders In Congress? The U.S. Air Force Is Hiding Its Controversial Flyoff Between the A-10 and F-35 The Tragic Tale Of The A-10 Thunderhog Storm Chasing Jet That Almost Was The Storm Chasing A-10 Thunderhog Program Is Officially Dead, Jet To Be Returned To USAF Watch The “Final Cut” Of A Glowing Film About The A-10 That The USAF Tried to Suppress The hypersonic craze There were a number of stand-out military technologies that routinely grabbed headlines in 2018, but hypersonic weapons were a particularly important topic of discussion. The United States, Russia, and China, all showed off significant developments during the year ranging from boost-glide vehicles to high-speed aircraft to electromagnetic railguns. Staying on top of this rapidly changing technological landscape isn’t easy, but thankfully we decided early on to prioritize it in 2018: USAF, Army, and Navy Join Forces To Field America’s First Operational Hypersonic Weapon Putin Announces Early ‘New Years Gift’ Of Successful Hypersonic Glide Vehicle Test This Is Our Best View Yet Of China’s Ship-Mounted Railgun Prototype Video Appears To Show China Testing Hypersonic Glide Vehicles Via High Altitude Balloon Boeing’s Hypersonic Valkyrie Will Likely Struggle To Catch Up With Lockheed’s SR-72 The Pentagon Spent Decades Developing Hypersonic Anti-Tank Missiles, Then They Vanished Battlefield space With talk of a possible new U.S. military branch, the Space Force, as well as reports of new space-based capabilities and threats emerging in the United States and among potential opponents, its safe to 2018 was a big year for discussing the realities of a battlefield in space.

This year hasn’t disappointed in that department. Some of these we’ve been happy to debunk. Others, though, remain unexplained in one way or another and we continue to keep our eyes and ears open for new developments: You Need To Hear These FAA Tapes From That Oregon UFO Incident That Sent F-15s Scrambling Detailed Official Report On Harrowing Encounter Between F/A-18s and UFO Surfaces Piper Aircrew Saw Bright Orange Glowing Object During Strange Encounter Over Long Island Learjet And Airbus Had Strange Encounter With Mysterious Craft Over Arizona These Are Real Pentagon Reports On Warp Drive, Extra Dimensions, Anti-Gravity, And More Let’s Talk About That Mysterious ‘Rocket Launch Over Whidbey Island’ Photo Now Massive Plumes Of Chaff Are Lighting Up Radar Over Maine and Florida Too Listen As Multiple Airline Pilots Report Very High-Speed Unidentified Objects Over Ireland (Updated) Here’s What That Commando Laden UH-60 Black Hawk Was Doing Whipping Around Chicago That Qatari Royal Flight 747-8i That’s Up For Sale Just Made A Very Strange Flight To Istanbul Making our case It’s no secret that we here at The War Zone are passionate about certain topics. We’re often eager to make our case and 2018 saw us argue a number of points we felt were especially important: Fizzled Singapore Summit Showcases North Korea’s Art Of Not Making A Deal Pentagon’s New Nuclear Strategy Is Unsustainable And A Handout To Defense Industry The Compelling Case For Turning S-3 Vikings Into The Navy’s New MQ-25 Tanker Drone No, The Su-57 Isn’t ‘Junk:’ Six Features We like On Russia’s New Fighter Rogoway’s Reviews: First Man Is A Stunningly Raw Tale Of Rockets And Reality Russia Proved How Stupid Western Media Is At Defense Reporting With This Ridiculous Contraption No, Assassination By Drone Isn’t A New Concept, I Have Been Warning Of It For Years Rogoway’s Reviews: Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan Please, U.S. Air Force, Don’t Let Trump Schlock Up Air Force One’s Iconic Appearance It’s Not What Trump Said About Germany At The NATO Summit, It’s How He Said It Navy’s Revamped Stealth Destroyer Looks Less Stealthy As It Leaves San Diego For Trials Don’t Be So Quick To Blame Trump’s No-Show At WWI Ceremony On The President Himself No, Israel’s Interest In Buying New F-15s Isn’t A Referendum On The F-35 Where Were The Fiscal Hawks When The Navy Threw Itself The Mother Of All Flying Parades? Boeing’s T-X Win Is Really Much Bigger Than Just Building A Replacement For The T-38 China Is Surging Forward With Its Development Of Advanced Stealth Combat Drones Not A Surprise: North Korea Is Back To Publicizing Weapons Tests Overseen By Kim Jong Un Historical interludes We here at The War Zone are as much students of military history as we are of the latest technology. It’s hard to truly understand the significance of one without the other and we’ve made sure to find time for deep dives into many historical topics, too: SR-71’s “R2-D2” Could Be The Key To Winning Future Fights In GPS Denied Environments This Is The Only Photo Of A U.S. Navy Supercarrier Being Sunk (Updated) White House Sinkhole Is A Reminder Of The Bunkers That Are Buried Beneath It The Navy’s Giant Hangar That Housed The Hindenburg Hides A Mock Aircraft Carrier Inside F-117 Program Used These Futuristic Hand Scanners While Highly Classified In The ’80s Navy’s Blue Ridge Class Command Ships Once Had This Wacky Air Defense Missile System Take A Rare Glimpse Inside The Navy’s Massive Blue Ridge Class Command Ships The Talos Missile Had A Wonderfully Complex Shipboard Assembly Line Of A Launch System The Harrowing Tale Of The Nuke-Laden Russian Typhoon Class Sub That Almost Sunk In 1991 This Massive Naval Exercise In 1989 Was The Pinnacle Of U.S. Cold War Maritime Might The OV-1 Mohawk Was One Of The U.S. Military’s First Forgotten Light Attack Planes The British Army Hoped This Rifle Could’ve Helped Halt The American Revolution Watch This Haunting Video Of Gunner Being Buried At Sea In Badly Damaged Torpedo Bomber The Time Air Force One Took Evasive Maneuvers To Defend Itself Against Syrian MiGs Check Out This Vintage Mystery Navigation Screen In The Conn Of A Sturgeon Class Nuke Sub Old Coast Guard Tower In The Atlantic Is The Unlikely Star Of Hurricane Florence Coverage The U.S. Sold This Unique Stealth Drone Called ‘Scarab’ To Egypt In The 1980s George Bush Saved The CIA USS Desert Ship Sits In A Sea Of Sand And Launched The Navy To The Forefront Of Missile Tech Veteran Aerospace Reporter’s Old File Cabinet Is Full Of 2000s Military Treasure So much more Beyond these easy to categorize posts of major significance and interest, one of the most popular features of our site is how we cover major events as they unfold. We activated our rolling coverage operations on a few occasions this year. We largely broke the stolen Q-400 commuter plane story this summer and we went wall to wall for over 24 hours straight feeding our readers the best intelligence we could find on what was happening during the trilateral cruise missile strikes on Syria earlier in the year. Smaller events, like when the Norwegian Helge Ingstad frigate ran aground or when Russia’s largest dry dock sunk also sent us into reporting overdrive. We even covered the unique nexus where the military world intersects with video game universe—from those who have actually operated above the surface of the earth and below it . But above all else, our most hard-hitting and important item of the year has to be our intrepid reporting on this issue of massive impact. Thanks for reading and we plan to kick 2019 off in a big way with a very special feature that you won’t want to miss that should post tomorrow, so stay tuned for that!

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 2, 2019",Letter From The Editor To The War Zone’s Readers As A New Year Dawns,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have a hard time believing it’s almost 2019. This year went by so fast. But before the clock strikes midnight and 2018 becomes history, I want to talk a little bit about what I have been thankful in 2018 as it relates to the ongoing journalistic experiment now known as The War Zone . First off, I want to thank all of you. I started writing about these issues that I care so much about many years ago for nothing. I didn’t just graduate from journalism school and go looking for a job and this is where I ended up. This is the passion of my life and this site is my baby . The fact that so many people from all walks of life and from so many places around the globe enjoy our work means so much to me. Thank you all for clicking and sharing our work. But really, my appreciation for my audience goes well beyond those basic forms of online patronage. So much of what I do here occurs with my readership’s help. Leads, topic ideas, suggestions, criticisms, and more are the building blocks of my daily workflow. Thank you for taking the time to reach out, and in some cases, to participate deeply in the creation of the content published on this site. In all honesty, this place is about a colorful cast of characters above all else. Often times, our readers become the subjects of our biggest and best pieces. Their stories, their insights, and their unique points of view are a huge part of what makes us different. I always envisioned this concept as a space that relies heavily on the perspectives of those who worked on the lower decks, or spent their careers in cockpits, foxholes, hangars, machine shops, and laboratories, and not as another showcase for the polished buzzword-filled speak from the Pentagon’s brass or those with corner offices in corporate towers. This site is often about the unsung heroes of the defense apparatus that deserve to have their voice heard. Realizing this objective is one of my greatest accomplishments and none of it would have happened without our readers. Then again, when it comes to readership, no group of people deserves more of a hearty thank you from me than our esteemed discussion section crew. We have a totally unique community, one based on humor, a broad knowledge base, and mutual respect. One thing binds us all together—we are ultra-curious people who realize that we have much to learn from others. Nothing like it exists anywhere else. It truly is like no other place on the net. USAF This level of engagement and the lack of the usual BS that goes with it in a discourse community is something I decided to foster against pretty much everyone’s advice nearly a decade ago with the hopes that I could prove all the ugly online trends wrong. Over time, that has come to pass, albeit the hard way. But in recent years, our members have really self-regulated the community above anyone else, which is downright astonishing. I thank every one of you for actually caring about our little corner of the internet and working together to make our brilliantly chaotic forum a positive anomaly in an internet full of negativity and incessant drive-by garbage tossing. You all deserve so much credit. Thank you! Also, my big web of contacts, including our open-source investigators, photographers, subject matter experts, plane trackers, and avgeeks do deserve a lot of credit too. As do our fellow defense reporters who do marvelous work that we often source when building our unique takes of stories. Some veteran reporters that I have long looked up to, like Aviation Week’s newly minted Defense Editor Stephen Trimble , have been so great to us in the past that I would consider them honorary members of our little team. The fact of the matter is that readers don’t see just how many people I reach out to on a daily basis for stories, whether it be for background information, quotes, to see if they would be subjects of a piece themselves, or just to bounce ideas off of and talk about what’s going on in an effort to build a clearer picture and present that picture to our audience. The site could not run like it does without you, thank you all. The same can be said for our industry partners, many of which have finally realized just how potent and unique of a platform we have and are engaging with us on a whole new level. This is really exciting. In the end, it means better and more accurate information for the stories we write, and more unique content and opportunities for us to ask the really hard or downright obscure questions that others don’t. While I am at it, I want to give a very special thanks to my partner in crime here at The War Zone , the one and only Joseph Trevithick. Quite frankly, when industry folks hear that we are a tiny team of just two people that produces all this deep-dive content, they are absolutely stunned. So much so that it has become a recurring inside joke between me in Joe. I think if any of our readers saw what a work week looks like for us it would be downright frightening. Joe is already writing when I sign on and is usually right there when I sign off for the day. That alone is near superhuman. But it’s not just about putting in the hours. When I was finally cleared to search out a teammate, the last thing I wanted was another one of me. Instead, I looked someone with a very different skill set that had a bit of overlap, but not all that much. The idea was that over time we could bridge the divide and be far more potent together than otherwise. That search lasted nine months. Joe was the one that had those exact qualities I was seeking and every day I am thankful he said yes when I offered him the job. Bylines are a funny thing at The War Zone. The truth is that most of our articles are at least some sort of a team effort, and Joe’s research often backs up some of our most exciting and challenging pieces to produce. In fact, we have become such a seamless team that some of the most intricate and popular articles posted on this site were written by both of us in one voice with zero integration editing required. I can turn over rolling coverage of a huge news breaking event to him after hours of updates with complete trust he will get it right and the continuity will be perfect. In fact, he often helps feed me those updates that come as supersonic speed as events unfold. It really is quite amazing. Every weekday, and sometimes on the weekend too, we debate the day’s headlines and red-team information at a blistering pace. As heated as our debates can get, in nearly two years of spending most of our waking moments in contact, there has never been anything I would even consider a fight. And that really is something because he puts up with a lot from me. I am not always the easiest person to work for, and I have one speed of operations which is far from leisurely, but he knows it’s because I care about what we do and want us to succeed in doing it as a team. I very much look forward to growing the site with Joe in the New Year. USN I also really want to say thanks to our new ownership. These are hands-on and talented people who have plunked down their own checkbook to see The Drive and The War Zone succeed in ways that were never even remotely possible under the previous ownership. They want your user experience to be great and are ready to fix chronic issues with the site that many of us are all too aware of the second they physically can as we continue through this transition. The truth is that the entire corporate reality has changed 180 degrees in such a short period of time and it really is awesome to be a part of it. In this crazy and often downright depressing industry, having private ownership that is really interested in what you do and is directly involved in helping you grow and succeed is maybe the best bonus a guy like me can get. So please support The Drive and The War Zone . Our new owners aren’t some faceless investment firm or big fat-laden media conglomerate. They are people who believe in us, love the topics our brands service, and I am in contact with them on a near-daily basis to see that we rise to new levels of success. Finally, I want to thank Mike Guy, the Editor In Chief at The Drive . Mike has kept the ship together against incredible odds and has given me the freedom I need to make The War Zone the plucky little defense site that punches far above its weight that it is. When things looked down, he never fed us to the wolves or made us a sacrificial lamb to the corporate gods. When I really need him, he has been there. And on a personal level, that is really important when you invest so much of your life into a project like this. With all that said, we are looking to harness the momentum described above and expand our operation in new and exciting ways in 2019. I have some big ideas for the site and where it could go. Not all of them will work, but some certainly will. The potential for The War Zone is glaringly obvious, and with your continued support and interaction, I truly believe we finally have a real shot of realizing that potential in full. Thank you so much for being a part of this crazy voyage. We have so much incredible content already in process for the New Year. I can’t wait to share it with all of you. A happy and prosperous New Year to you and your loved ones! -TR Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2019",China’s NYC-Sized ‘Earthquake Warning System’ Array Sounds More Like A Way To Talk To Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China has reportedly constructed a massive extremely low frequency, or ELF, antenna array the size of New York City, as well as a smaller system and associated data processing and signal transmission facilities at various locations throughout the country. Officially, the entire system, known as Project Wireless Electromagnetic Method or Project WEM, will support the Chinese resource extraction industry and provide early warning about potential earthquakes. However, there is significant evidence that its primary function may actually be to provide long-range communication with Chinese submarines , a critical capability to support its growing number of nuclear-armed ballistic missile boats . The South China Morning Post provided the update on Project WEM on Dec. 31, 2018. The antenna arrays and other sites have been more than decade in the making, with the program being a major component of China’s 11th Five Year Plan , which began in 2006. However, China has been especially secretive about the project and has not officially disclosed the location of the main array. Available information points to the bulk of Project WEM being situated within the country’s central Huazhong region, according to the Post . ELF radio waves have a proven ability to penetrate deep below water and the ground. In principle, this means that a huge antenna array could be useful in detecting natural resources underground, such as precious metals or fossil fuels. Mining companies already employ ground-penetrating radar and laser imaging systems for similar purposes. It might also be possible to use such a system to monitor movement below the Earth’s surface. This, in turn, might provide early indications of impending earthquakes, which are not uncommon in many areas of the country. The deadliest known earthquake of all time occurred in China in the 16th century, killing between 820,000 and 830,000 people based on Ming Dynasty records. A worker at a Chinese coal mine in Inner Mongolia., AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein There is very real scholarship on ELF’s application in both of these civilian roles and Chinese researchers have published work on these topics. Project WEM’s funding also came via government budgets for civilian projects, according to the Post . But, at the same time, there is significant information that suggests that any civilian applications may be of secondary importance to the Chinese government. The ability of ELF radio waves to penetrate hundreds of feet of water has long made them attractive as a way of communicating with submerged submarines. By comparison, very low frequency , or VLF, waves can only make it down to around 100 feet below water at best. This means that submarines have to get relatively close to the surface or deploy a towed antenna to use these types of communications systems. There is a risk that doing so could give away their position and make them vulnerable to opposing anti-submarine forces. A US Navy chart showing various submarine communications options and their relative risk. The “bell” icon for VLF/ELF “stealth” transmissions reflects that these are one-way only “bell ringers” typically used to alert a submarine that it needs to find a safe place to get closer to the surface to receive additional information. , USN One of the major benefits of modern submarines, especially nuclear-powered types and boats with advanced, non-nuclear air-independent propulsion systems, is their ability to remain largely hidden underwater for extended periods of time. This gives them inherent deterrent qualities. It also makes them well suited to covertly collecting intelligence or, in the case of subs armed with conventional land attack or nuclear-capable missiles, to quietly positioning themselves for short- or no-notice strikes during a crisis. So, it’s not necessarily surprising that China’s 724 Research Institute, part of the state-run China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), a major supplier of communications and other electronics to the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), has been responsible for the Project WEM construction. Lu Jianxun, the project’s chief scientist, is also publicly involved in advanced communications work for the PLAN, the Post reported . A Chinese Type 091 nuclear-powered attack submarine., Qiao Tianfu/Color China Photo/AP CSIC President Hu Wenmin visited the site in May 2017. He “expressed his appreciation for the construction of the WEM project and put forward opinions and requirements for the follow-up development of the project and the technical application in related fields,” a subsequent statement from the company read. The Post also published a translated map showing the various components of the Project WEM system, which it said came from the PLAN. In addition to the huge array in central China, there is also reportedly near the county’s South China Sea coastline, which would put it relatively close to the country’s main submarine base on Hainan Island . A map reportedly showing the general location over the various Project WEM components., PLAN via South China Morning Post “Though I am involved in the project, I have no idea where it is. It should be up and running by now,” Chen Xiaobin, a researcher with the Institute of Geology, China Earthquake Administration, told the Post , indicating a level of security around the project that seems excessive for its stated civilian aims. “This facility will have important military uses if a war breaks out.” Unfortunately, ELF systems are notoriously inefficient and require large sites in very specific positions to provide any reasonable communications capability. They are also limited in the amount of information they can carry and how fast they can send it out, transmitting text-only messages extremely slowly. Since submarines don’t have the space required for their own ELF transmitters, these one-way alerts often simply tell the boat’s crew to get safely into position to receive actual instructions. Only three other countries – the United States , Russia , and India – have or have had ELF submarine communications sites. The U.S. Navy shut down the last of its arrays in 2004, officially because they were obsolete in light of improvements to very low frequency , or VLF, communications systems. The Navy’s fleet of 16 E-6B Mercury strategic communications aircraft, together with ground-based VLF stations , presently provide the U.S. military’s core means of communicating with deployed submarines. A picture of the main building at the U.S. Navy’s Clam Lake ELF transmitter facility in 1982., USN The U.S. military still uses VLF waves to transmit so-called “ Emergency Action Messages ,” a key part of the nuclear strike process, which you can read about in more detail here . The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon’s top research and development arm, among others, has also been exploring the potential for further improved laser- and space-based communication options. Still, for China, which has the single largest submarine force on the planet , being able to communicate with those boats without them needing to surface or almost surface is essential capability. China had previously built a super low frequency, or SLF, array in 2009 and subsequent demonstrated an initial capability to communicate with submerged submarines over long distances. ELF offers an additional way to at least alert any boats deep below the sea that there are new orders or other information that they need to receive. It also provides an extremely long-distance communication capability, which will be valuable for the PLAN as it continues working to grow from a regional force into a global one . More importantly, though, Project WEM could be essential for the Chinese government’s development of its nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) deterrent capability. In that case, the ability of the ballistic missile submarines, or SSBNs, to remain underwater for long periods of time is vital to shielding them from detection and attack and ensuring they are able to carry out their mission if necessary. At present, the Chinese military does not have anywhere near the nuclear command and control infrastructure that the United States does in the air and on the ground . One or more large ELF arrays would be a cost-effective means of expanding communications options in the near term with regards to the country’s SSBN force, which is growing in size and scope. In 2018, information emerged that pointed to China’s submarine-based nuclear deterrent being far more mature than publicly understood. In November 2018, one of the PLAN’s Type 094 Jin -class nuclear ballistic missile submarines reportedly conducted the first test flight of the solid fuel JL-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile, which has an estimated range of close to 5,600 miles. The existing JL-2 can only hit targets around 4,350 miles away. That same month, satellite imagery appeared to show that the PLAN has four operational Type 094s and may have two more under construction. China has not publicly confirmed how many Jin -class boats it has or is expecting to produce. “China’s four operational Jin -class SSBNs represent China’s first credible, sea-based nuclear deterrent,” the U.S. military said in the 2018 edition of its annual China Military Power report . “China’s next-generation Type 096 SSBN, reportedly to be armed with the follow-on JL-3 SLBM, will likely begin construction in the early-2020s.” For any expanded Chinese submarine-based nuclear deterrent force to be credible, it will increasingly require sufficient communications and command and control architecture to go with it. The timeline of Project WEM, which began the same year that the first Type 094 appeared in public satellite imagery, is well in line with the kind of developments one would expect to see. Placing the main array in central China also makes it more difficult for opponents to target it during a crisis. It remains to be seen whether or not China continues to employ ELF communications in the long run, or ultimately abandons it as the United States has done in favor of other options. But Project WEM that the country is willing to make significant investments in the technology now to improve its ability to communicate with and control its vast and growing submarines forces.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 2, 2016",Russia Wants To Replace Its Giant An-124 Airlifters With Updated Decades-Old Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s lumbering AN-124 Condor cargo aircraft provide a vital capability for the Russian military. After talk of building an updated AN-124 variant in Russia—AN-124 aircraft originate from Ukraine, a country with anything but good relations with Russia these days—it now seems that the Russian Ministry of Defense may be pursuing an update of a decades-old indigenous design to eventually replace the Condors and possibly other aircraft as well. According to a new interview with Nikolai Talikov , Chief Designer at Ilyushin Aviation Complex, this aircraft, dubbed the IL-106, is currently deep in development and will be updated with new avionics, engines, and other critical systems. Russia’s AN-124 Condors highlighted their extreme value back in early Fall of 2015 when they creating an air-bridge of sorts between Russian territory and Syria, carry massive loads of cargo and outsized weaponry to Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base located south of the Syrian port city of Latakia. That logistics train has continued ever since to some degree, with Condors making regular appearances at the airfield which is now ‘leased’ to Russia more or less indefinitely. In fact, Russia’s Syria operation would have looked very different and maybe wouldn’t have happened at all without the AN-124 in the Russian Air Force’s inventory. https://youtube.com/watch?v=K2ZYOzoZVEM With this in mind, Russia’s push to come up with firm plan to replace these aircraft, some of which date back to or shortly after the Soviet era, isn’t a surprise. Going with an indigenous design isn’t that far-fetched either. Russia has a track record of rebooting defunct weapons programs that benefited from decades of expensive research and development under the Soviet Union and the decade that followed. That data already in hand cuts costs and development timelines while also allowing for some innovation by incorporating new technologies. This is precisely what is envisioned for the IL-106. Nikolai Talikov stated the following to RT (computer-translated): “Military transport aviation of Russia is in the sky every day and performs tasks, including abroad. Therefore, the issue of extending aircraft resources and creating new vehicles is so acute. An-124 play a huge role in the country’s defense. It is no secret that they performed a large volume of cargo transportation to Syria. In this regard, the question arose of extending the resource of these aircraft. Given the reluctance of Ukraine to cooperate, our design bureau is engaged in the extension of the resource and the maintenance of the technical health of the AN-124 fleet. Indeed, the question of the re-establishment of the AN-124 was repeatedly raised. We looked at this situation more broadly and came to the conclusion that it was necessary to create a new military transport aircraft. Such a plane, in our opinion, should be the IL-106. We worked on it for a long time. But in the 1990s and 2000s we carried out sluggish work. Today IL-106 is recorded in our program, and we are starting to create it. The cargo cabin of the IL-106 will be the same dimension as the Ruslan (Condor). On the plane will be installed new engines, new avionics and everything else. The creation of the IL-106 will be a step forward in updating the military transport aviation of Russia. IL-106 will meet all modern requirements for the aerobatic flight complex, and for the resource, and for the transported goods. Thus, discussions about the need to recreate the AN-124 ended. We are starting to develop the IL-106.” As for the particulars, Talikov said that the new engines that will power the Il-106 will be provided by United Engine Corporation and will be capable of 24-26 tons of thrust. The design will be able to regularly haul 80 tons of cargo, and could lift off with 110-120 tons in a pinch. Talikov also says the aircraft will be rolled out around 2025-2026 based on the Russian MoD’s requirements. A model of the IL-106 that has been in on and off development since the late 1980s., Public Domain Really what he is describing is something between a C-17 and AN-124 in terms of raw airlifting power. This makes sense as the vast majority of missions do not require the extremes of the Condor’s weight-lifting abilities, but do require a large internal volume. An aircraft that is a bit less capable would also cost less to manufacture and maintain, while also keeping within the limits of current Russian aerospace technology. This also makes sense investment-wise as saving money to create an aircraft that is more tailored to the Russian military’s modern needs instead of an exact replacement for the An-124, an aircraft that first flew in the early 1980s. Beyond new engines and avionics, exactly how much in common an updated IL-106 design would have with the one that originated nearly thirty years ago remains unclear, but it is likely that modern manufacturing techniques and material science would be applied to the old design. Public Domain Up until recently, it was announced that Russia would produce its own new-build AN-124 airframes—basically updated clones of the Ukrainian design. But that plan was quickly subject to international controversy as Ukraine’s Antonov Aircraft Corporation said that Russia had no right to copy the design and that they would have trouble doing so technically even if they tried. By early last Summer, it was reported that Russia had abandoned the plan and was looking at other alternatives, chiefly among them upgrading existing AN-124s in service and in storage with Russian-specific systems. According to a recent RT report , the breakdown of Russia’s current AN-124 inventory is as such: Today, the Air Force of Russia (16 vehicles), the commercial cargo airline Volga-Dnepr (12), the state airline 224th Flight Squad (8) and the SE Antonov (7 vehicles). What’s not clear is exactly how many of these are truly operational at any given time. It is assumed that the Russian Air Force has about a dozen AN-124s readily at its disposal, but Russian charter companies can also support the Russian military when needed. An-124 with Su-27 Flankers off its wing.  , Sergey Kustov/Wikicommons So we are talking about high-value, low-density assets here. As a result, the Russian military would not require a big production run of IL-106s to replace its AN-124 fleet. But the AN-124s flying for Russia’s charter companies won’t be able to fly forever either and supportability is becoming more of an issue due to the aircraft’s age and the deep row between Moscow and Kiev. So eventually having an aircraft to replace the semi-civilian An-124s is also becoming increasingly important. The Russian Air Force could and would likely choose to replace some of its older IL-76s and the handful of AN-22s still in service with IL-106s as well. This would increase total production volume over time and lower unit costs. But where Moscow may really substantiate the program’s cost is in potential export sales. https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXmYRsI01bM Currently, there isn’t a quad-jet cargo aircraft in production that is capable of carrying outsized loads outside of China. The C-17 recently ended its production and China’s Y-20 transport has as much in common with the smaller IL-76 as the C-17 capability-wise and is still in its early teething phase. With this in mind, Russia is likely eyeing potential IL-106 export sales as a way to offset its development costs and possibly make money on the program overall down the line. The big issue that hangs over every major Russian weapons program is funding , more specifically the chronic lack of it . Can Russia afford an IL-106? Quite honestly, it seems somewhat clear that they really can’t afford to let the capability that the AN-124 provides whither. By building an intermediate-sized heavy-lift jet cargo aircraft, Russia could better justify the costs and even make a business opportunity case for it that is somewhat compelling. It would seem that IL-106 checks all these boxes. Still, with the Kremlin’s defense funds only becoming scarcer , even logical procurement initiatives needed to maintain critical capabilities could be passed over for other priorities. And even if the general design is already in hand, putting a new large aircraft type into production is never a cheap affair without major financial risk. We will probably hear more about this initiative from official sources in the Russian government now that this interview has been published. Stay tuned for future updates.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force T-38 Talon jet trainer went skidding off the runway at Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport in Virginia earlier today, but thankfully no one was injured. This is the latest in a series of major accidents for the T-38 community, which has suffered multiple crashes , including one that led to the death of a pilot , this year already. This new incident occurred at around 11:15 AM local time on Dec. 28, 2018. Only one pilot was on board the two-seat Talon, which belonged to the 71st Fighter Training Squadron, part of the 1st Fighter Wing at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, also in Virginia. The accident shut down the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport’s main runway and was expected to impact a small number of commercial flights, spokesperson Jessica Wharton told the Associated Press . “Today we are fortunate that our pilots have the training they need to react in emergency situations, such as the incident that occurred today,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Jason Hinds, the commander of the 1st Fighter Wing, said in a statement on Facebook. “I am thankful that everyone is safe, and thank you to the Newport News Airport for your support and understanding.” The exact condition of the aircraft is unclear, but a picture from Virginia’s 13News Now television channel, a local ABC affiliate, suggests it could have suffered significant damage. The outlet reported that the plane experienced an unspecified problem with its landing gear before veering off the runway. Since November 2017, the Air Force’s Talon community has suffered five major accidents, including one in the vicinity of Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas in November 2018 that killed one of the pilots on board the jet. Two months earlier , another T-38 had skidded off the runway at Sheppard Air Force Base, also in Texas, prompting both pilots to eject. Thankfully, they only sustained minor injuries. The Air Force’s Air Education and Training Command (AETC) decided not to ground its Talon fleet after the November 2018 crash. “AETC is committed to using the lessons learned from the results of any investigation to prevent similar accidents from happening again across the 19th Air Force fleet,” Jennifer Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the command, told Military.com in a subsequent statement. The 71st Fighter Training Squadron falls under the purview of Air Combat Command and may not have been impacted by any AETC-specific decisions, regardless. The unit directly supports the training requirements of the F-22 Raptor stealth fighters assigned to the 1st Fighter Wing by acting as airborne aggressors .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 28, 2018",Syrian Standoff: Kurds Ask Assad For Help Fighting Turkish Forces As Americans Leave,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kurdish fighters have allowed Syrian government forces into the outskirts the strategic northeastern city of Manbij to try to block Turkish-supported groups . This is the most visible outcome so far of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to hastily withdraw American forces from the country. However, U.S. troops are still in the process of leaving and it’s unclear whether other members of the international coalition fighting ISIS remain in the area, any of who may be at risk of getting caught up in any ensuing fighting. The Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG , issued a statement welcoming the Syrian Arab Army into Manbij on Dec. 28, 2018 . The Syrians issued their own, triumphantly declaring their arrival from the southwest, on the same day . This comes as Turkish forces and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, or TFSA , have begun moving toward the city from the northwest, with the goal of uprooting the Kurdish fighters, which Turkey views as terrorists that threaten its national interests. “We invite the Syrian government forces … to assert control over the areas our forces have withdrawn from, in particular Manbij, and to protect these areas against a Turkish invasion,” the YPG said in their press release. “Out of the commitment of the Syrian army to handle its responsibilities, and upon the calls of the people of Manbij, the general command of the Syrian army declares entering Manbij and hosting the Syrian flag in it,” the Syrian Arab Army’s statement read. Long-standing tensions For years now, the YPG has been the primary contributor of forces to the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which has received its support from the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Turkish threats to intervene in Syria against the Kurds prompted the public deployment of American forces in and around Manbij in 2017 to keep the two parties apart. But the area had been of critical importance well before then. Manbij has been a major, strategic hub in northeastern Syria, sitting on a major highway that connects northwestern cities, such as Aleppo, with population centers in the eastern portion of the country. Rebels fighting the Syrian government took control of the city in 2012, but lost it to ISIS in 2014. Two years later, the SDF, supported by American air strikes and special operations forces, liberated it from the terrorist group. A map showing various points of interest in Syria, including Manbij in the north., DOD The Turkish government views the YPG as a terrorist group, inseparable from the Kurdish Workers Party , or PKK, which operates in Turkey and along that country’s border areas in Syria and Iraq. In January 2018, the Turks launched a major offensive into the northwestern Syrian cantonment of Afrin to eject the Kurdish fighters. At the time, this prompted similar appeals from the YPG to Assad , as well as his Russian benefactors , though they were ultimately not enough to prevent Turkey from establishing its own occupied buffer zone in northwestern Syria. The United States said that any groups that left the SDF to aid the YPG in Afrin would no longer be eligible for American support. Now, Trump’s snap decision to pull American forces out of Syria entirely within months, which he announced on Dec. 19, 2018, has put the SDF as a whole, as well as U.S.-backed civil authorities in cities across northeastern Syria, in limbo. For its part, the U.S. military has rejected the new reports that Syrian forces had entered Manbij proper, a technicality that ignores the significance of the Syrian Arab Army, and potentially militias aligned with Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad, taking up positions along the city’s southwestern flank. Dozens of U.S. special operations forces and supporting personnel remain in the city center, where they had been working hand-in-hand with SDF forces and local civilian officials. More recently, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan threatened to extend the area of operations for his forces eastward and that his military would fight its way through its ostensible American allies to crush the YPG if necessary. Since Trump’s withdrawal announcement, Turkey has pledged to both defeat the Kurds and the remnants of ISIS, which the SDF is still in the process of containing to try to prevent those terrorists from staging a major comeback . Any distraction from those operations will only give ISIS breathing room to regroup. Turkish and American armored vehicles on patrol near Manbij in November 2018. This was one of a number of confidence-building measures the United States had hoped would stave off a major Turkish intervention in the region before Trump’s decision to pull out of Syria entirely., US Army Shifting allegiances Erdoğan has sought to temper concerns about an all-out conflict with the Syrians, framing the developing situation as one in which his forces and those of the Syrian government can stand together as “terrorists.” The dispute with the United States over support for the Kurds has pushed Turkey closer to Russia, as well as the Syrian government, in recent years. Turkish authorities, together with their counterparts from Russia and Iran, have been working together on a separate political solution to the Syrian civil war . “In the current situation, we are still supporting the integrity of Syrian soil,” Erdoğan told reporters on Dec. 28, 2018. “These areas belong to Syria. Once the terrorist organizations leave the area, we will have nothing left to do there.” Whether or not this is actually true is debatable. Turkey also has a history of supporting ethnic Arab and Turkmen groups opposed to Assad , many of whom are now part of the TFSA, and would likely be interested in resuming that fight in earnest in the future. In addition, the Turkish government was instrumental in blocking a planned Syrian government offensive into the western governorate of Idlib , seen as the last major bastion of anti-Assad rebels, in September 2018. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, at center, shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin, at right, and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, at left, during a meeting in Ankara about the future of Syria in April 2018., AP A test case in Manbij Regardless, the situation in Manbij is a prime example of just how rapidly the situation is already changing in Syria, even before American forces have completed their expected withdrawal. It exposes just how quickly a major rift between the United States and its erstwhile Kurdish partners has emerged, as well. President Trump has expressed his faith in Turkey’s ability to continue the fight against ISIS. At the same time, it’s unclear whether the United States would have any plans to come to the aid of its NATO ally should Turkish or Turkish-backed forces find themes in open conflict in northeastern Syria with an alliance of convenience between Kurdish groups and the Syrian Arab Army. On top of that, reports have generally focused entirely on potential risks to American troops still in the area, which are now growing as opposing forces are positioning themselves on either side of Manbij. But the international coalition against ISIS is 70 members strong and observers have spotted French forces , who have been elsewhere in Syria already, near the city recently. British military personnel are also in northeastern Syria, along with other coalition parties supporting the SDF, and may be moving further west to fill in the developing gaps left by the departure of U.S. forces. The coalition’s position is that the SDF and the YPG remain distinctly separate entities, but that line could easily blur more than already has if the latter Kurdish group finds itself engaged with Turkish and Turkish-backed forces in the same operating areas. This danger, as always, is that the close proximity of the different parties makes it difficult for them to discriminate between each other. The various combinations of Kurdish and Syrian forces, Kurdish and western coalition forces, Turkish forces and their local partners, and Assad and his own allies, make for an especially confusing battlefield picture. Any mistaken artillery strike or shootout could easily escalate into a larger conflict. Broader impacts The Shifting alliances and allegiances could have impacts elsewhere in Syria’s sprawling if the YPG’s appeals to Assad and his allies push the Turks and other parties to expand cooperation with other groups. A mass exodus of Kurdish forces from the SDF could force the remaining anti-ISIS coalition members to seek out other partners in that fight, for instance. Elsewhere in Syria, the question of Idlib remains unsettled, though a ceasefire generally appears to be holding . Assad does look well positioned to continue reasserting his authority throughout the country, though, and there have been reports that he is liquidating captured rebels as the tide of the civil war continues to shift further in his favor. On Dec. 28, 2018, Bahrain reopened its Embassy in Damascus, the latest sign that other Arab nations who were once opposed to the Syrian regime are increasingly willing to re-accept Assad as the legitimate leader of the country. Israel is continuing its own campaign against Iran and Iranian-backed fighters, primarily the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Earlier this week , Israeli combat aircraft launched strikes on sites near the Syrian capital Damascus, targeting shipments of Iranian rockets bound for Hezbollah. Russia condemned those operations , which Israel has not officially acknowledged, saying they put civilian aircraft at risk. Ties between the Russians and Israelis have been growing, as well. However, they were strained by a bizarre incident in September 2018 in which Syrian air defense forces accidentally shot down a Russian surveillance plane while responding to another Israeli strike. Whatever the case, the situation in Manbij is very much still evolving. But how things play out in and around the strategic city, and how the different parties involved align themselves, could set the tone for further altercations in northeastern Syria and elsewhere in the country in the absence of American forces.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 28, 2018",Trump Orders Sudden Withdrawal From Syria Which Could Result In A Huge Power Vacuum (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump has ordered the U.S. military to begin planning to withdraw entirely from Syria in the near term, which would be a major reversal in his administration’s stated policy for the country. The decision comes on the heels of U.S.-backed forces ejecting ISIS terrorists from their last major physical stronghold in the Syrian town of Hajjin. But a complete American departure from the country would almost certainly give the terrorists room to regroup and create a power vacuum beneficial to the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies , as well as Turkey . A rush to exploit a chaotic situation could provoke a new set of conflicts. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the new developments, on Dec. 19, 2018, with various other outlets quickly following suit , all citing anonymous sources. The White House subsequently confirmed publicly that the United States was looking to pull military personnel specifically out of Syria, a move that the Pentagon reportedly opposes, but offered no further details or schedule. “Five years ago, ISIS was a very powerful and dangerous force in the Middle East, and now the United States had defeated the territorial caliphate,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Dec. 12, 2019. “We have started returning United States troops home as we transition to the next phase of this campaign. The United States and our allies stand ready to engage at all levels to defend American interests whenever necessary, and we will continue to work together to deny radical Islamic terrorists territory, funding, support, and any means of infiltrating our borders.” “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,” Trump himself had Tweeted out earlier in the day. The president has argued in the past for pulling American forces out of Syria, as well as potentially replacing them with another foreign force, including one with Saudi Arabia in the lead. Sanders and Trump both appeared to be referring to the announcement on Dec. 14, 2018 , from the U.S. backed, predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that it had taken control of Hajjin, seen as the last remnant of ISIS’ actual “Islamic State.” It would also seem that Trump is now seeking a total withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria as soon as possible. However, Sanders statement suggested this may not be the case, at least initially, referring to a “next phase of this campaign.” Dana White, the Pentagon’s top spokesperson echoed Sanders’ language, but also did not elaborate on the scope of the withdrawal and seemed to backpedal on the prospect of any imminent moves, reaffirming that “the campaign against ISIS is not over.” The United States officially has approximately 2,000 troops in the country, with the majority of them in the northeastern corner situated between Turkey and Iraq. A smaller number operate out of an outpost in the south near the city of At Tanf along the Jordanian border. These troops, along with other coalition partners, support around 8,000 local fighters, the bulk of whom belong to the SDF. There is also no information so far on how Trump’s decision might impact other interagency components in the country, including elements of the Intelligence Community, State Department, and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), or the activities of any of the more than 70 members of the Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS. The State Department leads little-reported U.S.-led transition, reconstruction, and humanitarian aid efforts through the Syria Transition Assistance Response Team (START) in Turkey and the Southern Syria Assistance Platform (SSAP) in Jordan.

The United States has also supported the establishment of local governments and security forces in these same areas, notably in the strategic towns of Manbij and Raqqa , the future of which would uncertain in the absence of an American military presence. The Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad and its Russian and Iranian allies decry these entities as illegal parallel authorities. As with the SDF, these local councils and security elements are also predominantly made up of ethnic Kurds. This has drawn the ire of Turkey, who views these groups as inseparable from terrorists it sees as a direct threat to its own national interests. Separate from the fight against ISIS, the United States does actively support Turkey’s counter-terrorism campaign against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which both countries had designated as a terrorist group. Members of the US-supported Raqqa Internal Security Force conduct a training exercise., US Army But in January 2018 , Turkish forces launched a major intervention into northwestern Syria with the goal of routing Kurdish militants. Turkey’s increasingly dictatorial President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has repeatedly criticized U.S. government support for Kurdish groups and has threatened to have his troops fight their way through their ostensible American allies if necessary to crush those fighters. On Dec. 14, 2018, the Turkish president warned, yet again, of a new offensive into northeastern Syria was imminent, though, at the time, the U.S. military said there had been no change in its force posture in the region. Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria did reportedly come in the wake of a series of calls with Erdoğan, who has long pressed for the United States to at least abandon its support of the SDF and instead rely on the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (TFSA), a group of ethnic Syrian Turkmen and Arab fighters. But there’s no indication that the Turkish president had to actually sway his American counterpart’s opinion on whether or not to remain engaged in Syria. The Trump administration has already successively curtailed support for other non-SDF groups, or so-called “Vetted Syrian Opposition,” or VSO, since 2017. Turkish forces distribute aid to civilians in the Afrin region of northwestern Syria in 2018. Turkey and its local partners are accused of killing numerous civilians as they drove Kurdish forces from the region., Turkish MND There is, of course, no guarantee that the withdrawal plan will proceed in the way Trump desires right now, or at all. Just this week, various U.S. government offices and officials, including Ambassador Jim Jeffery , the United States Special Representative for Syria Engagement, have made it clear that the United States expects to remain in Syria indefinitely. Trump’s new announcement runs counter to with the otherwise well-established publicly stated U.S. policy on the matter. Though he certainly has the authority to order the withdrawal as commander in chief, the president has had to back away from multiple previous attempts to force significant policy shifts in the face of fervent opposition from within the U.S. government in the past. “I’m not at all complacent about the work that remains to be done,” U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Dec. 6, 2018. “I would say we’re well along in clearing ISIS from the ground that they’ve held in Syria and we still have a lot of work to do in terms of the stabilization phase.” “I think it’s fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring,” Brett McGurk, the Special Presidential Envoy for Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, explained during a press conference, on Dec. 11, 2018. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, among others, has reportedly spent days trying to convince Trump not to go through with a full withdrawal with the situation on the ground still so fluid. It should go without saying that ISIS loss of physical territory does not mean that the group is defeated as Trump has claimed. U.S. officials, as well as experts and observers, including us here at The War Zone , have highlighted how a rapid withdrawal of American personnel from Syria could easily provide the space need for the terrorists to regroup and craft a newly threatening “ ISIS 2.0 .” Splinter groups pose their own threat, with one such group called The White Flag , made up of former ISIS terrorists and Kurdish militants, emerging in the wake of an Iraqi crackdown on the Kurds in 2017. ISIS itself is simply the latest incarnation of what began in 2004 as Al Qaeda in Iraq . General Dunford said earlier in December 2018 that it would take approximately 40,000 local forces, more than four times the number the United States has trained and supports now, to adequately prevent ISIS from re-emerging as the major, regional threat it had become in 2014. It continues to be true that the U.S.-led coalition is the only force in the region actually focused on fighting ISIS primarily and that has the adequate resources in terms of vital air, artillery, and persistent intelligence gathering capabilities to keep up the pressure on that terrorist group. Between Dec. 9 and 15, 2018, predominantly American forces conducted more than 200 air and artillery strikes against targets in Syria. Though it is reasonable to debate whether it is legal or appropriate under present mandates from Congress, the presence of American troops in northeastern Syria especially has come to represent a not insignificant check against myriad agendas of the various different actors in the country. Without those U.S. forces there, Turkey would have free reign to expand its campaign against Kurdish fighters, including the SDF, which has been, by far, the most effective local force in the fight against ISIS. Abandoning the Kurds, who have fought and died alongside U.S. troops for years now, could make it difficult to call upon them in the future. A joint US-Turkish patrol near the city of Manbij, one of many United States initiatives to try to maintain a buffer between Turkey and US-backed Kurdish groups., US Army The Turkish campaign has already prompted Kurdish groups outside of the SDF to appeal to other actors, including Assad , for support, planting the seeds for a new multi-faceted and potentially destabilizing conflict. Turkey has historically opposed Assad, though it grew closer to Russia as its relations with the United States cooled after a failed coup attempt against Erdoğan in 2016. More recently, tensions between Ankara and the Kremlin have also flared over Turkey’s own growing occupation of northwestern Syria. There remains a decided risk that pro-Assad groups and Turkish-backed fighters could come to blows, drawing their respective allies closer to a direct confrontation. Without Americans on the ground, there would also be no reason for Assad, with the help of his Russian and Iranian benefactors, not to push to reassert control over the entire country. As it stands now, American-backed forces occupy around a third of Syria. Assad and his allies will almost certainly claim they “ forced ” the Americans out, giving them a major propaganda win and validating of their brutal tactics, to include the indiscriminate use of chemical weapons , which have enabled the dictator to remain in power after years of civil war. “Hope emerges that this location on the Syrian map will follow the example of Aleppo and other Syrian towns and villages which begin getting back to peaceful life,” Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Maria Zakharova declared in response to Trump’s announcement. “Once Americans were there, there was no such hope.” It would also help stabilize Russia’s presence in the country, as well as that of Iran. The United States and Israel both have publicly said they will not tolerate Iranian forces establishing a firmer foothold in Syria, which they say only enables the regime in Tehran to more directly support other terrorist and militant groups in the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon . Israel has already been pursuing an active campaign against Iranian-linked militias and interests in Syria. Iranian forces flooding into the vacuum provided by the departure of the U.S. military from Syria could easily prompt Israel to respond with its own escalation. A bizarre incident in September 2018, in which Syrian air defense forces accidentally shot down a Russian Il-20 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance plane while ostensibly trying to shoot down Israeli F-16 fighter jets only serves to highlight how much an escalation in fighting between one or two groups in Syria runs the risk of easily drawing in other actors and creating a larger conflict. An Israeli F-16I Sufa fighter jet, a type that has been a major contributor to strikes in Syria., IAF A unilateral withdrawal would also simply weaken the U.S. government’s position and influence in the region. Such a move risks sending the signal to allies and opponents both that the United States is an unreliable partner and ineffective guarantor in any future negotiations about the future of Syria or the settling of other regional conflicts. This could have a cascading impact more broadly , limiting the ability of the Trump Administration, or its successors, to seek concessions and other terms that are in its interests in future peace deals and other international agreements. With so few details about Trump’s withdrawal decision at present, and the U.S. military reportedly only now in the process of crafting possible options , it is very likely that the exact nature of the plan will continue to evolve in the immediate future. The administration could also face opposition from Congress, with South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who has become a vocal Trump supporter, taking to Twitter to argue that pulling out of Syria would be “an Obama-like mistake” – a turn of phrase referring to former President Barack Obama that seems specifically geared toward the current president’s political and personal sensitivities. That’s not to say U.S. policy toward Syria or ISIS has been stable or clear beforehand. The Iraqi demand for U.S. forces to leave that country, which George W. Bush signed right before turning things over to Obama, was a major contributing factor to the rise of the terrorist group as a regional threat. Obama’s own self-imposed assertion that Assad’s continued use of chemical weapons would be a “red line,” and his failure to act decisively when it became clear the Syrian regime was not abiding by international agreements, similarly took a toll on U.S. credibility with regards to the conflict in Syria as a whole. So it’s not surprising that other legislators, both Republicans and Democrats, have offered their support to Trump’s decision ostensibly on anti-interventionist grounds. Many lawmakers have long opposed what they see as “mission creep” in Syria, from defeating ISIS to broader involvement in the Syrian civil war, without any clear strategy or legal authority. It’s too soon to know for sure how any withdrawal of American forces from Syria might play out in the long run, but what seems clear is that it would weaken the U.S. government’s position in the region and give breathing room to terrorists and other malign actors, which threatens to touch off all-new crises. The number of conflicting and contradictory statements from the different arms of the U.S. government are already injecting worrying uncertainty and instability into what has always been a complex conflict in Syria. Update: 7:10pm EST— Reuters has reported , citing unnamed officials again, that all State Department personnel will depart Syria within 24 hours and that the full withdrawal will be complete within 60 to 100 days. Earlier reports had indicated the U.S. military was still developing its plans for how to withdraw and it remains unclear whether these initial changes to the American posture in Syria will proceed as planned. In addition, at an official White House briefing later on Dec. 19, 2018, the Trump administration could offer no specific details about the timeline for any withdrawal on the record. They referred reporters to the Pentagon, who, in turn, referred them back to the White House. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 20, 2022",Ukraine Returns Electronic Warfare Choppers To Service Amid Fears Of War With Russia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ukraine recently got two electronic warfare helicopters back into service after an overhaul at the Konotop Aircraft Repair Plant. This is just one of the Ukrainian military’s efforts to refurbish older Soviet-era systems and acquire more advanced weapons and military equipment amid an ongoing conflict with Kremlin-backed separatists . Experts and observers have also been watching for possible signs of a more overt Russian intervention following a naval skirmish between the two countries’ security forces in November 2018. The Ukrainian Air Force formally accepted delivery of the Mi-8MTPB and Mi-8MTPI helicopters at a ceremony at Ozerne Air Base in the western half of the country on Dec. 21, 2018. It is not clear how many of either of these Cold War-era variants Ukraine still has in operation in total. The two types are instantly recognizable by the large, phased array antennas fitted to the outside of both sides of the main cabin, as well as additional antennas and aerials on the tail and elsewhere. Both are based on the extremely popular Mi-8MT helicopter, an upgraded version of the original Mi-8 that is also commonly known by its export designation, Mi-17 , or its NATO nickname, Hip. Mi-8/Mi-17 types remain in service in Russia and in dozens of counties around the world. The Mi-8MTPB carries the Bison system, also written “Bizon,” a communications jamming suite . This version has the main antennas mounted near the rear of the central fuselage and features large heat exchangers to keep the powerful electronics cool. Ukraine’s refurbished Mi-8MTPB. , UkrOboronProm Bison’s main job is to scramble hostile radios and other communications nodes, but also has a radio direction finding capability to locate those targets. This gives it a very limited secondary ability to act as an electronic intelligence platform, identifying enemy positions based on their transmissions. The Mi-8MTPI has the Ikebana jamming system , which is a stand-off jammer intended to disrupt an opponent’s battlefield radars, including air search and fire control types associated with air defense systems. This variant has its antennas more centrally located on either side of the helicopter, making it easy to differentiate it from the MTPB version. The overhauled Mi-8MTPI., UkrOboronProm The MTPI also has the ability to detect and determine the general location and type of hostile emitters, giving it a limited capacity to conduct intelligence gathering missions on enemy defenses. When the Soviet Union introduced the type in the latter half of the Cold War, part of the goal was to provide more of a multi-mission capability over existing Mi-8/Mi-17-based jammers. We don’t know if Konotop, also known as Aviakon, which is part of the Ukrainian state arms conglomerate UkrOboronProm , updated the actual electronic warfare equipment in any way as part of the overhaul. Giving the MTPB an actual communications intercept capability, for instance, would greatly improve the system’s ability to function both as a jammer and intelligence gathering platform. Both variants would almost certainly benefit from upgrades to expand the range of frequencies they can detect and jam, as well. We also don’t know if the helicopters themselves received any substantial upgrades during the overhaul process, either. In 2016, Ukrainian aviation firm Motor Sich announced plans for an update package for the country’s basic Mi-8MT armed transport types, known as the Mi-8MSB-V , in cooperation with Polish companies. The new variant would feature updated avionics and cockpit features, including multiple digital multi-function displays, as well as new sensors and self-defense features. A Mi-8MSB-V helicopter, immediately recognizable by the upturned exhaust “scoops,” which help reduce the helicopter’s infrared signature and vulnerability to heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles., Motor Sich Regardless, electronic warfare has already been a major component of the conflict between the Ukrainian government and Russian-supported separatists in the country’s eastern Donbass region. The Kremlin has deployed and otherwise supplied various ground-based systems that have given the rebels a decided edge in many instances. “In Eastern Ukraine, these EW [electronic warfare] systems have proved devastating to Ukrainian radio communications, are capable of jamming unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and can broadcast false GPS signals (an effect called spoofing),” a 2016 U.S. Army manual outlining Russian hybrid warfare tactics and capabilities explained. “In another example from Eastern Ukraine, a Ukrainian army unit was broadcasting a radio message when it received accurate artillery fire, sustaining multiple casualties. The Ukrainian unit then received text messages on their cell phones from the Russian Led Separatist commander asking how they liked the artillery.” R-330Zh Zhitel, which is focused on jamming cellular satellite communications, one of many electronic warfare systems that Russia has available and may have employed, or could be employing now, in and around Ukraine ., Vitaly Kuzmin Those same separatists have often had access to surface-to-air missile systems from Russia, if not direct support from actual Russian units, which have proven to be a significant threat to Ukrainian fixed and rotary wing aircraft in the past. In one particularly infamous instance in 2014, a Russian-operated Buk SAM system shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 as it flew over the country, possibly mistaking it for a Ukrainian military plane. Having a clear picture of the separatist and Russian electronic order of battle – radars, command and control nodes, and other emitters it has in place – would be vital for Ukrainian forces during any major, all-out conflict with Russia and its proxies. Any available Mi-8MTPIs, or possibly even MTPBs, could help in gathering that information and watching for any changes in posture. Road-mobile and off-road capable surface-to-air missile systems, in particular, might regularly shift positions. Persistent monitoring would also give Ukrainian personnel better insight into the standard operating procedures of Russian and Russian-backed forces, which, in turn, could expose useful vulnerabilities. The jamming helicopters could work directly with fixed and rotary wing aircraft conducting destruction of enemy air defenses missions, or DEAD, by helping to spot and jam targets and potential threats, too. Another view of the Ukranian Mi-8MTPB., UkrOboronProm Jamming systems such as the Bison and Ikebana, though older and with more limited capabilities, could still help Ukrainian forces close the electronic warfare gap in other ways, too, such when fighting against separatists who often use cell phones and other unencrypted, commercial communications systems . The direction finding and target locating functionality the Mi-8MTPB and Mi-8MTPI offer might be useful for near real-time monitoring the movement of insurgent forces, as well. On the other hand, the limited number of total jamming helicopters in Ukrainian inventory would unfortunately also limit the overall area they would be able to cover at once. Since Russia illegally seized control of its Crimea Region in 2014 and began supporting the separatists, Ukraine has been working to modernize its military in general, too. Just in 2018, the country refurbished a small number of S-300V long-range surface-to-air missile systems, worked to modernize shorter range S-125 SAMs , and pushed ahead with development of its Neptune ground-launched anti-ship missile system. It has also reached out to acquire new weapons and other military equipment abroad , especially from the United States . The impetus for modernizing the Ukrainian armed forces has only grown since a trio of the country’s naval vessels squared off with the Russians in the Strait of Kerch, which separates the Black Sea from the Sea of Azov, on Nov. 25, 2018. This engagement left three of Ukraine’s boats and a number of Ukrainian sailors in Russian custody and inflamed tensions to the point there have been fears that a full-blown war between the two countries might erupt in the future. A member of Russia’s security forces, at right, escorts a Ukrainian Navy sailor, in handcuffs, into a courtroom in occupied Crimea after the skirmish in November 2018., Alexey Malgavko / Sputnik via AP A resolution urging Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to formally declare war on Russia is presently making its way through the Rada , Ukraine’s parliament. More worrisome, though, are completely unsubstantiated reports, amplified by Kremlin officials and Russian state and quasi-state media , suggesting that Ukraine is preparing to launch chemical weapon attacks in the Donbass. This appears to be part of a coordinated information warfare campaign and has all the hallmarks of similar disinformation Russia has spread about rebel forces in Syria . The Russians have used accusations of Syrian insurgents conducting chemical weapons attacks to justify the brutal campaign by Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad to defeat his opponents, which they actively support and that has killed thousands of civilians in the process. The unsupported claims about rebel chemical weapons attacks in that country also deflect from the very real use of those types of weapons by government forces. Russia stands separately accused of using a nerve agent to try to kill a former Russian intelligence agent in the United Kingdom in 2018, as well. So far, thankfully, the actual threat of a broader, open conflict between Russia and Ukraine still seems relatively low. Despite reports of an uptick in fighting between Ukrainian and separatist forces, there are reports that a ceasefire may begin on Dec. 29, 2018, just in time for New Years. The Ukrainian government also ended a period of limited martial law , which began after the naval skirmish in the Kerch Strait, on Dec. 26, 2018. The Kremlin had sent additional armor and artillery into areas along the border between the two countries earlier in December 2018. More recently, the Russian Air Force deployed more than a dozen Su-27 and Su-30 Flanker fighter jets to Belbek Air Base in occupied Crimea , adding to the Russian combat aircraft already situated at that base. The Kremlin has significant qualitative and quantitative advantages in airpower over Ukraine in general. Still, Russia’s latest disinformation efforts may simply be intended to dissuade Ukrainian forces from launching their own new offensives into the Donbass. Its military buildup in the region may similarly be more of a deterrent to authorities in Kiev, as well as their international partners , than a prelude to a major operation. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OYnlAR9gktg But these are exactly the kind of movements that Ukraine’s small fleet of electronic warfare helicopters might get called in to try to monitor. Any unusually elevated signal activity could be a good sign that the various Russian and separatist maneuvering is actually turning into a more imminent threat.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 5, 2019",Here’s Our First Look At Sikorsky and Boeing’s Defiant Compound Helicopter Prototype,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A team consisting of Sikorsky and Boeing has unveiled the prototype of its SB>1 Defiant helicopter . The rotary wing aircraft’s public debut is an important development for the two companies, which recently had to push back plans for its first flight yet again. Lockheed Martin, of which Sikorsky is now a part, released pair of pictures of the Defiant, which presently carries the U.S. civil registration code N100FV, along with a brief official statement on Dec. 26, 2018 . The SB>1 is set to go head-to-head with Bell Helicopter’s V-280 Valor tilt-rotor, which you can read about in more detail here , as part of the U.S. Army’s Joint Multi-Role (JMR) technology demonstration program. This project, in turn, will help inform the requirements for “medium” segment of the larger Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program, which is seeking replacements for its UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopters and AH-64 Apache gunships . The Defiant is an advanced compound helicopter , which combines rigid, coaxial rotors with a pusher propeller at the rear. This configuration offers increased speed and greater maneuverability over traditional helicopters, with an expected top speed that is more than 100 miles per hour faster than a Black Hawk. The Sikorsky-Boeing team also says the SB>1 will have improved stability while hovering and be quieter than existing types. The new helicopter draws heavily from previous work at Sikorsky on the X2 and S-97 Raider designs. The X2, a technology demonstrator that the Connecticut-headquartered firm first revealed in 2008, helped prove many of the features present in the SB>1, including the active vibration control that reduces the noise inside the aircraft during flight. A look at the rear of the SB>1 Defiant prototype., Sikorsky-Boeing Team The company also hopes that the S-97, a private venture that has been flying since 2015, or a derivative thereof, could be a contender for the “light” component of the FVL program, which is focused on developing an armed scout rotorcraft akin to the now-retired OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. A Raider-based design might also fulfill the requirements for other emerging programs, such as the Army’s proposed pilot-optional Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Competitive Prototype ( FARA CP ). Other services have expressed an interest in the results of the FVL program, as well. Boeing, which is separately working on a compound helicopter conversion kit for the AH-64 , brings its own extensive experience with advanced rotorcraft to the partnership. The two companies also previously worked together on the abortive RAH-66A Comanche stealth helicopter program, which the Army canceled in the early 2000s after major cost-overruns. The SB>1 name itself is meant to reflect that the partnership is greater than the sum of its individual parts. A graphic showing the lineage of the SB>1 Defiant and plans for future variants., Lockheed Martin At present, Sikorsky and Boeing hope to get the Defiant prototype into the air for the first time in early 2019. The team had hoped this would occur this month, but had to push back the timeline after discovering unspecified issues with a drivetrain testbed. “Sometimes its instrumentation that was installed [that didn’t] get the measurements we were hoping to get, or the software wasn’t reading properly,” Randy Rotte, Boeing’s Director of Business Development for Cargo Helicopters and Future Vertical Lift program, told FlightGlobal earlier in December 2018. “We have some pieces… that required some mechanical repair.” “It’s nothing that’s going to require a redesign of major components or any of those pieces,” Rotte continued, as he emphasized that the issues were minor. “It’s candidly just some interactions that the models didn’t all capture.” This is another setback for the Defiant, which was originally scheduled to fly first in late 2017 . That was when the Army had initially hoped to begin comparative flight testing between the SB>1 and Bell’s Valor, which first flew in December 2017. At that time, Sikorsky also indicated that the Honeywell T55 turboshafts that the Defiant is using now, similar to the engines Boeing has used for the CH-47 Chinook helicopter family, could limit the aircraft from delivering its full potential . The Army is pursuing a new, common engine for its UH-60 and AH-64 helicopters in parallel to the JMR and FVL programs and hopes that the improved powerplant will be available for future rotorcraft, as well. Whatever the case, the Army is undoubtedly eager to get started in earnest on the JMR technology demonstration effort and move closer to the full FVL program. UH-60s and AH-64s “are not going to be what we need in the future,” Lieutenant General James Pasquarette, the Army’s Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of overseeing the resourcing of programs, told Defense News in October 2018. “Our competitors out there, that we anticipate having to be ready to operate against, [that’s] the environment drives us to make decisions,” he continued. “We are very much studying the decisions we made in Comanche to make sure we don’t repeat them.” With the V-280 already flying and Sikorsky and Boeing’s Defiant moving closer to its first flight, comparative tests look set to finally begin in the new year and get the Army another step closer to its next generation of rotary-wing aircraft.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Trump Is Finally Winging His Way To The Middle East To Visit The Troops (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After nearly two years as Commander In Chief, President Donald Trump appears to be finally flying overseas—likely to the Middle East—to visit American troops deployed abroad, and possibly in a war zone. On Christmas Eve, I predicted would occur, as seen in the tweet below. Trump has received a stream of seemingly never-ending criticism for talking up his love of the military, but even with all the resources at his disposal, not visiting troops deployed abroad during the holidays, and especially not in an area where a major conflict is ongoing. This peculiar situation has been attributed to a number of reasons, including straight up fear and the advice of those in his cabinet . Whatever reason, the situation hasn’t been flattering. It directly contradicts his often obtuse claims about his own bravery and invites critics to remind everyone that he dodged service in Vietnam due to phony bone spurs . In fact, this Christmas, he didn’t even visit military personnel here in the United States or locally around Washington, D.C. This is the first time this has occurred since 2002 , but now that appears to be in the works of being remedied. Our plane tracker friend @Civmilair have been keeping a very close eye on the movements of the flying limousines that belong to the USAF’s 89th Air Wing at Andrews AFB, located outside of Washington, D.C., over the holidays. The unit flies a mix of C-20, C-37, C-40, C-32, and VC-25 aircraft that are largely tasked with flying around Federal Government elites and top military leaders. But most notably, they support the White House Military Office and move around the First and Second families and top cabinet officials. So, it was quite odd when a C-32A , most often used in the role as Air Force Two or Air Force One, launched at around 10pm on Christmas Eve and headed over the Atlantic, eventually making its customary fuel stop in Germany. Then a C-17, callsign REACH 358, started making its way across the Atlantic from Andrews AFB in the wee hours of December 26th. The hex code used by the aircraft’s transponder—which are commonly assigned to aircraft themselves—hasn’t been seen before. This appears to have been a cover for VC-25A 92-9000—one of the two modified 747s that serve as commonly as Air Force One . Further confirmation came that this was indeed Air Force One as plane spotters in the United Kingdom looked up at REACH 358 and saw a VC-25 barreling through the skies above. That same flight was last spotted over Eastern Europe heading towards Turkey. The aforementioned C-32A would be used as a spare aircraft for the President and can also carry additional support personnel to or near the final destination. It’s also worth noting that when President George W. Bush visited the troops in Iraq in 2003, Air Force One used a bogus hex code and identified itself as a C-37 (Gulfstream V). That was a much more cloak and dagger affair, but Air Force One’s cover was almost blown en route due to curious airline pilots that appeared to realize the type discrepancy. While all this plane tracking has been going on, it has been noted that there has been no sign of the President at the White House, nor any tweets from him, which is quite odd considering the ongoing government shutdown, instability in the stock market, among other things. There isn’t even a Marine posted outside the West Wing. Nothing is posted on the President’s official schedule either. Where President Trump will turn-up is still unknown, although there are some indications that I won’t go into at this time. We will update this post as more information comes available. Update: 11:40am PST— The President and the First Lady have arrived in Iraq: Update: 12:50pm PST— The visit was to Al Asad Air Base in Western Iraq. It is a fairly remote installation. Apparently the meetings were very limited and the Iraqi Prime Minister was not present, but Trump did talk to him via phone and invited him to the White House. So where to next?

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 24, 2018",Putin Announces Early ‘New Years Gift’ Of Successful Hypersonic Glide Vehicle Test (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has released multiple videos of a recent test of its nuclear-capable Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, offering the best imagery publicly available so far of the complete weapon system. The Kremlin says this combination of vehicle and booster rocket is now in serial production and the Russians still plan to deploy the first examples operationally in 2019. Russian forces conducted the test, meant to be operationally representative, from a silo at Dombarovsky Air Base near the country’s border with Kazakhstan on Dec. 26, 2018. The Avangard vehicle then successfully struck a designated target area at the Kura range on the Kamchatka Peninsula, which the Kremlin regularly uses as a proving ground for strategic weapons, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), according to statements from Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s Ministry of Defense. There is no independent confirmation that the test met its objectives. “This is a great success and a big victory. This is a wonderful, excellent gift for the country for the New Year,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting after the test, which he personally oversaw. “It was a hard and time-consuming work which required breakthrough solutions in principal areas, and all this was done by our scientists, designers, and engineers.” Dombarovsky has hosted operational tests of strategic weapons in the past, being home, in part, to an active division of the 31st Missile Army of the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces. In 2004 , an improved R-36M2 ICBM blasted off from one its silos during a test, for example. The two videos of the Avangard launch, shot from different angles, show the silo door opening and the rocket lifting off. There is still no publicly available imagery of the hypersonic vehicle itself. The new clips do appear to confirm that the weapon system is using a refurbished rocket booster from the Soviet UR-100N UTTKh ICBM. In March 2018, Russia announced that it would put the still-in-development RS-26 Rubezh ICBM, which it had originally expected to carry the Avangard, on hold indefinitely in order to refocus resources into the development and fielding of the hypersonic weapon. Russia’s Strategic Rocket Forces only have a limited number of UR-100N UTTKh missiles still in operational service, but acquired a number of deactivated boosters from Ukraine in the early 2000s. Independent Ukraine had inherited these weapons after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, but subsequently deactivated the silos and missiles. The modified UR-100N UTTKh carrier rocket for Avangard also appears to use a payload shroud similar to the SHS-2 on the Strela space launch vehicle . Strela uses a modified rocket booster from a UR-100NU ICBM. The Strela space launch vehicle, which combines a modified rocket booster from a UR-100NU ICBM and the SHS-2 payload shroud., Roscosmos The longer shroud likely reflects the overall length of Avangard. This is undoubtedly longer than the UR-100N UTTKh’s original payload bus, which carried six multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) nuclear warheads. As we at The War Zone have noted in the past , substituting the UR-100N UTTKh for the RS-26 as the carrier for the Avangard vehicle makes good sense as a way to get the high-tech weapon into service faster. Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles eliminate a significant number of vulnerabilities traditionally associated with ICBMs, which typically have readily detectable signatures and follow predictable flight paths. Existing U.S. space-based early warning systems would be able to spot the plume of the missile launch, but the United States has no effective means of tracking Avangard, which is reportedly capable of rapid and frequent course changes along a flatter trajectory, during its mid-course flight. The U.S. military’s existing ballistic missile defense shield has no way of engaging the actual Avangard vehicle, either. Of course, at present, those defensive systems are in no way capable of undermining Russia’s overall nuclear deterrent capabilities, either. All of this reduces the required capabilities of the booster rocket component of the system to the sole job of getting the hypersonic boost glide vehicle to the appropriate initial speed and altitude. The speed of the weapon itself also mitigates some of the delay in using the liquid-fueled UR-100N UTTKh, which reportedly takes around 25 minutes to prepare for launch. A standard UR-100N ICBM sits in its silo., Sergey Kazak/TASS As such, using the existing UR-100s, a known system that has been in service since 1975, is a pragmatic choice. Of the various new strategic weapons that Putin highlighted in a state-of-the-union style speech in March 2018, the Avangard boost-glide vehicle appears to be, by far, the most mature. The RS-28 Sarmat, a new heavy ICBM that is also known as the SS-X-30 Satan 2, recently suffered a new setback . The Poseidon nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered long-range torpedo/unmanned underwater vehicle and the Burevestnik nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered ground-launched cruise missile, are both still very much under development. On Dec. 25, 2018, an unnamed Russian defense industry source told state-run news outlet TASS that underwater trials of Poseidon had just begun using an unnamed nuclear-powered host submarine. The Kremlin says it has also been flight testing Burevestnik , but it remains unclear whether the test weapons have a functioning nuclear-powered propulsion system yet. Putting Avangard into service on top of UR-100s is also a cost-effective decision, both in terms of production and sustainment, with existing knowledge bases and logistical networks to support the booster rocket.  This is important since Russia’s persistent economic woes contributed to the RS-26 program ending up on hold and cancelation of the Barguzin rail-mobile ICBM program entirely. Limited funding and other defense industrial resources have also threatened a variety of other Russian strategic and non-strategic military modernization efforts. It remains to be seen just how rapidly the Kremlin can actually get its new hypersonic weapon into service and to what degree. That being said, using the existing rocket boosters gives the Kremlin perhaps the best chance of getting Avangard into service in the very near term. Russia would be free to re-boot the RS-26 program in the future when sufficient funds are available. It could also seek to adapt road-mobile RT-2PM2 Topol-M and RS-24 Yars IBCMs to carry the new warhead to expand its hypersonic weapons capacity without the development of entirely new missiles. Regardless, Just having units equipped with the UR-100N-based Avangard system would likely change the strategic calculus of its potential opponents, chiefly the United States. American military officials have been sounding the alarm all year about the growing threat of hypersonic weapons from both Russia and China . U.S. officials have warned about limited defensive options , as well as the lack of comparable U.S. systems that might be able to better hold these new weapons at risk and deter their use. The U.S. military has also initiated a program, known as Glide Breaker , to explore ways to physically intercept boost-glide weapons. The Kremlin is well aware of this reality and with Russia-U.S. relations at a recent low point , the Russians are almost certainly eager to be able to further challenge the United States with a new class of operational strategic weapon. “We will continue to work according to the plans that were designed for this system and other promising systems for equipping the army and the fleet,” Putin declared at the Dec. 26, 2018 meeting. We’ll have to wait and see whether the Russians can actually field some level of operational capability with Avangard in the new year. If nothing else, the latest test shows that the Kremlin is still very committed to that goal. Update: 2:50pm EST— Our good friend and Aviation Week ‘s defense editor Stephen Trimble has spotted an interesting detail in a report on the Avangard test from Russia’s state-run Channel One television network. A previously unseen computer-generated rendering shows the complete weapon system launch three total hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, which would then be able to strike independent targets. A computer-generated image showing multiple hypersonic boost-glide vehicles separating from the top of the complete Avangard weapon system., Russia Channel One There have been reports that this could be the case in the past, but previous computer renderings had only shown a single hypersonic vehicle inside the missile’s payload shroud. There is so no official pictures of the vehicle or the actual payload configuration.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just a few days before his now infamous resignation letter hit the White House like a wrecking ball, Secretary of Defense James Mattis sent a communique out to the commands under his purview to remind those in uniform of what their sacrifices over the holidays really mean, as well as their historical context. The message, which is uniquely moving for such a straightforward piece of correspondence, now stands as something of a specter of what was. A belatedly furious President Trump has ordered Mattis out of his role now instead of in February—a timeline Trump himself originally put forward. As it currently sits, ex-Boeing executive turned Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan will be taking the reins of the DoD on January 1, 2019. But above all else, this communique is a reminder of the unique talent and rich perspective that was lost with Mattis’s abrupt and turbulent exit from the Pentagon. The retired Marine General with multiple colorful nicknames has always been most comfortable surrounded by young sailors, soldiers, airmen, and Marines. Preferring the fox hole to the war room and the chow hall to a Washington D.C. steak house, it is well known that Mattis’ greatest joy is spending time with the warfighters he commands. His impromptu and often unfiltered pep talks to personnel in the field have made news on multiple occasions and really highlight how different of a Secretary of Defense he really was. DoD Also a historian with thousands of books on his shelf , the “Warrior Monk” often injects deep historical perspective in his decision making and the carefully calculated advice he offers. His communique dated December 18th, 2018 highlights all these traits. It is almost a perfect sample of James Mattis the idea and the man. The message, written by Mattis and released by DoD Executive Secretary Captain Hallock Mohler, reads : R 192339Z DEC 18 FM SECDEF WASHINGTON DC TO ALDODACT INFO RUEKJCS/SECDEF COMMUNICATIONS WASHINGTON DC BT UNCLAS SUBJ/HOLIDAY MESSAGE 2018 ALDODACT 26/18 ADDRESSEES PASS TO ALL SUBORDINATE COMMANDS 1.

RELEASED BY: CAPT HALLOCK MOHLER JR., DOD EXECUTIVE SECRETARY BT www.iwcsync.org James Mattis wasn’t perfect, there were some things I didn’t like during his time as Secretary of Defense, but those things were far outweighed by the things I did. Maybe what’s most impressive, is that he garnered near universal respect across both sides of the isle. The fact that a lifelong military man who made a career following orders had to leave a job he clearly loved and the military family that has surrounded him his entire adult life due to the baffling decisions and actions of the Commander In Chief is extremely troubling. That being said, hopefully we won’t see the last of him, although I doubt he has any political aspirations as some have posited. Then again, it is James Mattis we are talking about here, so if he is called upon to serve, there’s a probably a good chance he will answer the call if the premise is logical. On a personal note, to all our military personnel that will spend the holidays away from loved ones in chilly watch towers, dimly lit bunkers, dusty forward operating bases, alert barns on windswept airfields, and stacked three high above and below the waves, thank you from all of us here at The War Zone and The Drive !

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This week at the The War Zone has been somewhat E-2 Hawkeye themed as we published our big feature on what it is like to work aboard these fascinating aircraft acting as the eyes and ears of the carrier battle group from on high. So, it’s only fitting that we close the week out with this beautiful shot published by the Navy Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD). It shows the latest and by far the greatest iteration of Northrop Grumman’s Hawkeye, the E-2D, testing out its new-found aerial refueling capability behind a USAF KC-10 Extender set against a near otherworldly and breathtaking backdrop. The game-changing E-2D made its first cruise in 2015, but new capabilities for the aircraft continue to be put through their paces out of NAS Patuxent River in Maryland—the Navy’s master aircraft test base which is roughly equivalent to the USAF’s Edwards AFB in California . Liz Wolter/NAWCAD The inclusion of aerial refueling capability has the potential to drastically boost the aircraft’s endurance, but for normal carrier operations, it will push its average mission time from around four to seven hours. This will allow Carrier Air Wings to get more out of these critical, low-density, high-value assets, but it may not be all that welcome to the Hawkeye’s crew. The “Delta One” E-2D test aircraft pulls to a drogue trailed behind a KC-10., Liz Wolter/NAWCAD The E-2 is not that comfortable of an aircraft to fly on as veteran E-2C Naval Flight Officer Craig “Slim” Picken described in detail in our Hawkeye special feature. He even mentioned how lucky him and his squadronmates were that the E-2C Hawkeye was not air-to-air refueling capable, stating: “The Hawkeye is a very uncomfortable airplane. The three Naval Flight Officers (NFO) in the back sit sideways for four-plus hours in a dark tube, on a de-armed ejection seat, with the nose of the airplane slanted 12 degrees nose-up. The vibration of the then four monstrous (now eight) propeller blades was loud and exhausting. The air conditioning never worked well, either. Thus, the guy furthest aft always froze his ass off while the NFO closest to the radar boxes burned up. There were five radios with constant chatter, 20 or more airplanes to control, and radar systems that required constant attention, and so on. It was busy. I was always thankful that the airplane didn’t have in-flight refueling capability. The torture was limited to five hours. A single flight was tiring. Two in the same day was exhausting!” What will be welcomed by the E-2’s crews is the ability to get extra gas in case there is a long delay with being able to recover aboard the ship during “blue water” operations where there isn’t a divert airfield within the aircraft’s range. This added flexibility could even be lifesaving for the big carrier-based turboprop plane that is always the first to launch and the last to recover aboard the ship. Liz Wolter/NAWCAD Northrop Grumman has begun to manufacture new E-2Ds with air-to-air refueling capability built into the airframe from the ground-up. This began with the 46th airframe out of the 75 that are on order. The first five equipped with this capability will hit the fleet in 2020. It isn’t clear yet if the Navy has moved forward with an initiative to retrofit the first 45 E-2Ds with probes and flight control modifications needed for aerial refueling—an upgrade that would cost roughly $6M per airframe. It costs around $2M more to get the capability built-into new airframes from the ground up. https://youtube.com/watch?v=RW0N_9YOqQ4 This may seem like a lot of money, but considering the critical capability these aircraft provide and the cost of more frequent sorties from the ship and diverting to airfields ashore over the life of the aircraft, it really is quite logical. When combined with new tactics, it could also provide a much farther “look” for the carrier strike group for certain missions. As advanced networking becomes increasingly important to modern warfare, pushing the Hawkeye out farther over the horizon could also be crucial in anti-access and area-denial combat situations. The aircraft works as a central data-fusion and communications relay node for the air wing and is a key component of cooperative engagement capabilities (CEC) . USN This type of mission profile, and any mission in general in which the E-2 would need more fuel than what it can be launched with, will also benefit from the Navy’s upcoming MQ-25 carrier-based tanker drone. This platform will have ability to fly out hundreds of miles from the carrier and quench the Hawkeyes thirst. An E-2C test an earlier rudimentary refueling setup back in 2012. , USN It’s almost a bit bewildering to think that the Hawkeye has gone this long, 55 years to be exact, flying from carriers operationally without aerial refueling capability. The concept has been in the works for years now so it’s great to see the Hawkeye community finally getting the investment it deserves. Now let’s talk about getting some more comfortable seat cushions and maybe an actual airplane toilet.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 4, 2019",USAF’s Next Budget Request Will Include New F-15X Advanced Eagle Fighter Jets: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last July, I broke a story about the existence of Boeing’s F-15X Advanced Eagle concept, one that the plane-maker had been in discussions with the USAF about for many months. That aircraft would be procured to replace America’s existing F-15C/D aircraft, the vast majority of which are operated by the Air National Guard . Since my expose, the USAF has officially remained somewhat flippant about the F-15X and its talks with Boeing, which isn’t surprising, but according to a Bloomberg report, that is about to change dramatically very soon. The F-15X airframe would be single seat, but it would incorporate decades of innovations that are being applied currently in the latest F-15 Strike Eagle derivatives being purchased by Saudi Arabia (F-15SA) and Qatar (F-15QA) . With an airframe life of a whopping 20,000 hours, and the latest sensors, flight control systems, and avionics, the F-15X would serve for many decades at an operating cost that Boeing claims will trounce that of the existing F-15C/D fleet—the youngest of which is now 32 years old—basically paying for the airframes with savings within about a decade. Roxana Tiron of Bloomberg Government writes that the USAF will include “$1.2 billion for 12 Boeing F-15 X fighter aircraft” in its 2020 budget request that is due to be published in February. The story also notes that pressure to buy the F-15X is coming from the powers that be inside the Pentagon that are external to the USAF itself, which would explain the disconnect over potential procurement program with the service’s top leadership: “The decision to buy the newest kind of F-15 aircraft, so far only sold to U.S. allies, comes from the Pentagon’s top leadership, including with some prodding from Deputy Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan, and not the Air Force, which would be flying the planes, the two people said. Shanahan, a former Boeing Co. executive, recused himself from any decisions related to Boeing when he was confirmed by the Senate.” You can read Tiron’s report in its entirety here . Boeing Until the budget request is released, these things can always change. But this report would line up with what I have heard about the concept and how it has support from top officials at the Pentagon. We also don’t know what the structure of the deal would look like, if it is just for a dozen F-15s or if it also includes additional items and services. Our sources say that Boeing has been eager to package the F-15X with aggressive business terms in order to make the USAF an Eagle customer once again. This could include a low or even zero cost development of the new subtype, as well as guarantees on unit cost and even the price of elements of the aircraft’s sustainment over time. Boeing has been ultra-aggressive with their aircraft bids as of late—a strategy that helped win them the UH-1 replacement tender , the Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray tanker competition , and the prized T-X next generation Air Force jet trainer contract. The idea behind the whole F-15X initiative is not to compete directly with the F-35 , but to provide the USAF with a fiscally and operationally attractive “plug and play” option for replacing the rapidly aging F-15C/D fleet comprised of roughly 235 aircraft. These jets will need invasive and costly upgrades in the coming years in order to remain airworthy and relevant for front-line operations. USAF The USAF has been contemplating what to do with the F-15C/D fleet, which has received some major upgrades in recent years . Paying for major structural and technological upgrades has been looked at, but that would mean investing heavily in airframes that are already over three decades old. Retiring the force outright and possibly replacing them with F-16s upgraded with active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars is another option, albeit a very controversial one. The F-15X would provide a third and highly attractive alternative, both on capability and fiscal grounds and due to the fact that it can plug directly into the USAF’s existing Eagle infrastructure. The reality is that for many tasks, including the homeland air sovereignty operations , the low-observable features of an F-35 are useless. There are many combat missions that actually benefit from a heavy fighter that can carry large stores over long ranges, as opposed to a stealth fighter with more limited payload and range capabilities. Israel seems to have come to this conclusion as well , incidentally. This is where the F-15X also comes into play for the USAF. Once again, read all about this aircraft and how it fits into the USAF’s force structure in my past feature that unveiled it. The F-15X is not intended to compete directly with the F-35A, but it will be incredibly hard to make this clear considering the special interests behind the F-35 program. Historically, any tactical aircraft program that siphons a dollar away from the DoD budget that could even potentially be used to buy more F-35s is labeled as a threat to the program and/or wasteful. , USAF Above all else, this report underscores what I have been hearing, that the F-15X is not only still alive in Pentagon planning circles, but the need for it has only become more apparent. We’ll have to wait for the final budget to be released to see the F-15X as an official procurement program for ourselves, but suffice it to say, the Eagle’s chances of rolling off the production line in St. Louis and being flown directly to operational U.S. fighter squadrons once again is greater now than it has been in many, many years.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Washington, D.C. has been aflutter this week with a burst of major year-end news on U.S. government foreign and domestic policy issues . Now, a partial government shutdown seeming inevitable, right in time for the peak of the holiday season. But yesterday, a U.S. Air Force C-37A Gulfstream V VIP jet, part a unit that caters to senior members of the executive branch and Congress, flew from the nation’s capital down to the island of Saint Martin in the Caribbean. Plane spotters using online tracking software watched the C-37A, serial number 99-0404 and assigned the 99th Airlift Squadron , using the callsign SAM003, leaving Joint Base Andrews, situated just outside of Washington, D.C., and heading south on Dec. 20, 2018. A PTZtv webcam at Saint Martin’s Princess Juliana International Airport recorded video of the jet taking off again on Dec. 21, 2018 and listened in on air traffic control conversations with the crew, who were using the same callsign. There is no indication of who might be on board. The video from the 21st only shows the jet taxiing to the end of the runway, waiting for clearance to take off, and then departing. The 99th Airlift Squadron, however, is part of the 89th Airlift Wing at Joint Base Andrews. This Wing also includes the 1st Airlift Squadron, which flies C-32A and C-40 aircraft, and the Presidential Airlift Group, responsible for operating the highly specialized VC-25A aircraft , better known as Air Force One. Collectively, the 89th’s mission is to provide world-class VIP airlift for the president, the vice president, cabinet members, congressional delegations, other senior officials and foreign dignitaries. C-37As have a very comfortable interior and a flight attendant to cater to passenger’s needs. This is known as the as a “Special Air Mission,” or SAM, as seen in the callsign 99-0404 was using on its way to and from Saint Martin. Trump is still in D.C. due to the possible government shutdown, but First Lady Melania and their son Barron could have headed to the island to start a holiday vacation early. The president has a villa there, though he has been trying to sell it and you can now stay there through Airbnb for around $11,000 a night . The president and his family had been set to take a 16-day holiday to the Mar-a-Lago resort , which now appears to have gotten delayed by the budget showdown. The inside of one of the 99th Airlift Wing’s C-37As., USAF Other members of Trump’s cabinet or other senior officials might have taken the trip, as well. Various members of the Trump Administration have weathered criticism over the past two years for using government aircraft to take trips of dubious official value. In a particularly controversial instance in August 2017, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, his wife, Louise Linton, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, and others flew to Fort Knox ostensibly to review the nation’s gold stockpile there. It also happened to be a prime location to view a solar eclipse. A C-37B jet, similar to the A model, but based on the Gulfstream 550 business jet, flew Mnunchin, Linton, and others to Fort Knox at a cost of nearly $27,000 dollars . The Treasury Secretary later reimbursed the U.S. government for his wife’s travel costs. This and other flights prompted an investigation into Mnuchin’s travel that found there wasn’t anything explicitly illegal about the flights, which had a combined cost of around $811,000, but questioned their necessity. Air Force flight attendants assigned the 99th Airlift Squadron prepare food on board a C-20B, another Gulfstream variant similar to the C-37A, during a training mission in 2017. , USAF It could also be a more mundane flight for training or other purposes. Jets from the 99th will sometimes fly “off station” training missions to foreign airports. This provides an opportunity “for pilots to fine-tune their approaches and landings, perfect for communications systems operators to upgrade or gain certifications,” according to the Air Force . But considering wide swathes of the federal government looks to be shutting down in the coming hours, a nasty pill for government workers to swallow over the Christmas holiday, the flight seems particularly interesting. It would be interesting to know who exactly jetted off to Caribbean paradise aboard a government GV, if indeed anyone was onboard, and what their official purpose was for doing so. We’ve reached out to the 89th Airlift Wing already to see if they can give us more information about the holiday flight to Saint Martin. We’ll be sure to keep you updated when and if we get any more details. Update: 10:35pm EST— Well, it wasn’t Melania and Barron, who took an 89th Airlift Wing C-32A to Mar-a-Lago, as planned, but without President Trump.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 10, 2017","Awe-Inspiring Images From Underneath A Well-Worn USS Nimitz, The Navy’s Oldest Carrier","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The fact that USS Nimitz (CVN-68) is the Navy’s oldest operational aircraft carrier really ages you. Following the early retirement of USS Enterprise (CVN-65), America’s supercarrier fleet is all Nimitz class, but that will change once the atrociously expensive USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) actually enters operational service. In the meantime, Nimitz has been receiving some much needed TLC up at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington as part of a nine month long planned incremental availability maintenance period. The shipyard has released a string of amazing photos showing a well-worn Nimitz during its time in dry dock over the better part of the 2018. They almost have a cathedral-like vibe to them and the proportions of the ship, seen from its keel up, are hard to get your head around. PSNS PSNS PSNS PSNS PSNS PSNS PSNS PSNS This image shows the Nimitz’s relatively new rear sponson configuration. Both Phalanx CIWS that are usually seen on the lower sponsons have been removed for this maintenance period. , PSNS PSNS PSNS This is a crop of the above image, showing this interesting historic inscription on Nimitz’s hull. , PSNS With calls to expand the U.S. Navy’s carrier inventory, as well as the Navy’s fleet size in general , to meet growing threats from peer state competitors like China and Russia, Nimitz may serve well past its 50 year service life. As it sits now, the nuclear-powered supercarrier will be retired from service in 2023, but further maintenance and upgrades may allow it to serve on, which would significantly help maintain a 12 supercarrier force. Today 11 supercarriers are in the Navy’s fleet. You can read all about this possible life extension initiative in a past TWZ article linked here . If the option to extend Nimitz’s life is executed, other Nimitz class supercarriers in the U.S. Navy’s fleet could also potentially receive similar life extensions as needed. The Navy is also looking at extending the service lives of some of its surface combatants, such as its Aegis-equipped cruisers and destroyers, as well. PSNS PSNS PSNS PSNS PSNS So, there you have it, the old lady of America’s supercarrier fleet, still going strong as she approaches her 50th birthday with the help of the hard working folks up at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 16, 2018",Failure To Launch? Pentagon’s Space Force Plan Could Hamstring The New Service’s Leadership,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After considering a number of possible options , the Pentagon is pushing to create an independent U.S. Space Force within the umbrella of the Department of the Air Force, similar to the relationship between the U.S. Marine Corps and the Department of the Navy. Unfortunately, the chain of command the present proposal outlines would put the service’s future top officer at an immediate disadvantage in deliberations over budget and policy , potentially exacerbating the exact issues that it’s supposed to solve. DefenseNews ’ Valerie Insinna was first to get the scoop on the latest Space Force plan, getting a chance to look at the draft proposal. On Dec. 13, 2018, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who is in charge of trying to make the new service a reality, said his office had settled on one option , but was not prepared to say which one. The formal announcement is supposed to come when the Pentagon publicly releases its next budget request, for the 2020 Fiscal Year, in February 2019. “There is established a United States Space Force as an armed force within the Department of the Air Force,” the proposed legislation reads, according to DefenseNews . President Trump and his administration, who have been ardent supporters of an independent Space Force, will need Congress’ approval to create what would be the sixth military service branch. This is an arrangement that is similar to one that Mike Rogers, a Republican Representative from Alabama, and Jim Cooper, a Democratic colleague from Tennessee, had pitched in 2017 as part of the defense budget deliberations for the 2018 Fiscal Year. That proposal, which called for a Space Corps, subsequently got nixed from the final annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act. The US Air Force’s experimental unmanned X-37B spacecraft, one of many assets that could be shifted to a new Space Force., USAF Space Corps was intended to reflect the fact that the new branch would exist as a separate entity under the Department of the Air Force, the same way the Marine Corps operates under the Department of the Navy. Trump, who has become an ardent supporter of creating a Space Force, described the future arrangement as “separate but equal” when he publicly directed the Pentagon to begin planning for the Space Force in June 2018 . Proponents of an independent Space Force argue that the U.S. military’s space-based activities do not get the attention they need under existing arrangements. At present, the Air Force is responsible for the vast majority of procurement and research and development related to space capabilities, with the other services playing far smaller roles. It is definitely true that space has been an often neglected aspect of the U.S. military enterprise, even as it has become central to its everyday workings . It is only becoming more and more critical for the United States to be able to defend itself against rapidly emerging threats from jamming, spoofing , and physical attacks on satellites that handle vital communications , intelligence gathering , and early warning missions. At the same time, the U.S. military will have to ensure that its own space-based developments, including new satellites and other spacecraft , move ahead as smoothly as possible to ensure the United States retains its edge against potential adversaries. A modified Russian MiG-31, in the foreground, carries what appears to be an anti-satellite weapon during a test in September 2018 . This is just one of many threats facing U.S. military assets in space., Shipsash Space Force, at least in theory, would give the “space domain” an equal seat at the various tables within the Pentagon and create a single manager who can better prioritize space policy and procurement decisions. Critics contend that it will simply create an additional layer of bureaucracy that will only make things worse. At least based on the draft document DefenseNews reviewed , this criticism may well be justified and there should be serious concerns about how separate or equal the Space Force might actually be in the end. Most notably, while the service would have a uniformed Chief of Staff of the Space Force, its top civilian official would be an Undersecretary of the Air Force for the Space Force. This is important, because, in the United States, civilian military leadership outranks uniformed leadership. The Chief of Staff of the Space Force would be subordinate to the service’s civilian leader, who in this case, is subordinate to the Secretary of the Air Force. This is not at all how the Marine Corps’ relationship with the Navy exists. There is no Undersecretary of the Navy for the Marine Corps and the Commandant of the Marine Corps reports directly to the Secretary of the Navy. Space Force’ structure is significantly different, which may have budgeting and policy ramifications. The basic command chain structure the Pentagon describes in its draft Space Force legislative proposal., Joseph Trevithick The basic command chain structure for the top leadership of the Navy and Marine Corps., Joseph Trevithick DefenseNews did not say how Space Force’s budget, already a serious point of contention between the Air Force and the Pentagon, might be structured. Previously proposals to put the new space-focused service under the Air Force featured a shared Air Force/Space Force budget . If that is the case, the Secretary of the Air Force will get the final say in how much money would go to its sister service. So, what the Space Force proposal is describing is creating an intermediate level of bureaucracy between the service’s top uniformed officer, the primary advocate for its actual operational units and their needs, and the person in charge of their budget. It is not hard to see how this relationship could implicitly prioritize the Air Force’s requirements over those of the Space Force. Furthermore, this Space Force chain of command would put the Chief of Staff of the Space Force in a differently awkward situation within the overall Joint Chiefs of Staff. The “separate but equal” Space Force chief would be sitting next to the Air Force chief and only one of them would have a direct line to the same civilian top boss. Every other individual in the room would report to a civilian service secretary – Secretaries of the Army and the Navy. It’s hard to see how the Space Force commander’s policy opinions, which would rely on the agreement, at least to some degree, of an Undersecretary of the Air Force, could carry the same weight as any of their other service counterparts. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, at left, and Chief of Staff of the Air Force General David Goldfein., USAF It is entirely possible that this is simply the first phase of the proposed creation of Space Force. The Pentagon has outlined a number of steps building up to the formation of the independent service, including the re-establishment of U.S. Space Command , or SPACECOM, akin to U.S. Cyber Command . President Trump issued the order to stand up SPACECOM on Dec. 18, 2018. Even if the plan is only transitional, it risks creating parochial animosity between the Air Force and the Space Force if and when the latter becomes truly independent. The Air Force is already often at odds with the Pentagon and Congress over the Space Force concept at its most basic level. Deputy Defense Secretary Shanahan, who is now taking on increased duties after Defense Secretary James Mattis’ decision to resign in February 2019, has previously sought to dismiss concerns about the difficulties in rearranging the U.S. military’s organization charts. This draft proposal, unfortunately, only seems to serve to highlight the myriad pitfalls that exist when creating a new service branch. If the Trump Administration is determined to push ahead with Space Force as a way to give military activities in space the increased attention they rightly deserve, it’s essential to ensure that the future service’s leadership isn’t hobbled from the very beginning.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 21, 2018",They’re Back! Drones Briefly Bring Reopened Gatwick Airport To A Grinding Halt Again,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Authorities at Gatwick Airport in the United Kingdom only got only a brief respite from small unmanned aerial systems disrupting services , despite the deployment of U.K. military forces with sophisticated counter-drone equipment. Less than two and a half hours after re-opening the main runway this afternoon, new sightings of remotely piloted vehicles shut down the airport’s operations again. Thankfully for holiday travelers, this latest disruption was much shorter. Reports that Gatwick was in the midst of a “ground stop” first began to emerge at around 5:20 PM local time. Plane spotters using only fight tracking software had noticed inbound planes in longer than usual holding patterns and subsequently were able to see them begin diverting to other airports. Gatwick had only resumed flight operations at 3:00 PM after drones first brought everything to a halt on Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2018. “We have currently suspended airfield operations as a precaution due to a suspected drone sighting,” a spokesperson for the airport subsequently told Sky News . Small drones can present a significant safety hazard to air traffic, we at The War Zone explained in our piece on the initial drone incident yesterday, which had shut down operations for more than 20 hours causing major disruptions. By around 6:30 PM, Gatwick had once again reopened. “The military measures we have in place at the airport have provided us with reassurance necessary to re-open our airfield,” Airport authorities said in an official post on Twitter. At present, the perpetrator or perpetrators still remain at large, though they face jail time under U.K. law, which bans flying drones within just over half a mile of an airport perimeter. Sussex Police, which had deployed officers armed with conventional firearms to the scene, had reached out to the U.K. military on Dec. 20, 2018, who, in turn, deployed personnel to assist in countering the rogue unmanned aerial systems. The U.K. Ministry of Defense declined to say what support it had provided, but pictures have emerged showing uniformed individuals manning what appeared to be the Israeli defense contractor Rafael’s Drone Dome defense system. The United Kingdom announced it had purchased Drone Dome in August 2018 . Military and law enforcement groups around the world have been investing significant resources in an attempt to begin countering the threat of small, remotely-piloted vehicles on and off the battlefield. Counter-drone systems in place at Gatwick on Dec. 21, 2018., AP Drone Dome features a number of compact, active-electronically scanned array radars to detect and track drones in over a highly localized area. This information then cues a separate, traversable system that features a radio-frequency jammer to scramble the control link between the unmanned aerial system and its operator and an imaging system for visual identification of the target. A solid-state laser that can burn a hole through small drones is also now an option for the system. Depending on the exact model of drone in question, a disruption of the remotely-piloted aircraft’s link with the control unit on the ground could lead it to fall out of the sky or attempt to return to its point of origin. You can read more about the growing number of different counter-drone systems available, and their limitations, here and here . Other drone-detection systems have also been deployed to Gatwick Airport, including this mysterious system, which looks like something akin to an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter’s mast-mounted high-frequency radar installed on a vehicle with a telescoping mast. Something like this would be well suited for detecting small drones even in an urban area. Needless to say, this is yet another major disruption for Gatwick, the United Kingdom’s second busiest airport, on a Friday that will be a long Christmas weekend for many people. Over 100,000 travelers were already reportedly impacted by the hours-long closure yesterday, causing significant economic damage. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 21, 2018",Rogue Drones Have Paralyzed U.K.’s Gatwick Airport For More Than 20 Hours (Update),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Flights at the United Kingdom’s Gatwick Airport, the second busiest in the country, have been grounded for more than 20 hours at least due to small drones flying in the vicinity. The incident, which comes right as hundreds of thousands of travelers are beginning to set out for the holidays, underscores the dangers that easy to obtain hobbyist type unmanned aerial vehicles, such as quad- and hex-copter designs, present at home and on the battlefield. It’s a growing, but glaringly foreseeable threat that we at The War Zone have been raising the alarm about for years . Authorities at Gatwick halted all incoming and outgoing flights first at 9:00 PM local time on Dec. 19, 2018, after sightings of multiple drones. Officials tentatively expected that order to be lifted at 3:00 AM on Dec. 20, 2019, but have now extended the closure to at least 4:00 PM, as they continue to coordinate with Sussex Police and the U.K. military to ensure that it is safe to resume airport operations. Flights already in the air headed for Gatwick got diverted to other airports as far away as Paris, France . Approximately 110,000 people across 760 flights were set to use Gatwick on the 20th. “We are carrying out a joint search w/ @Gatwick_Airport for the operators of #drones sighted at #Gatwick,” the Sussex Police wrote in a Tweet on their official account on Dec. 20, 2018. “Public safety is paramount and we will take all available actions to disrupt this deliberate act. There are no indications to suggest this is terror related.” Under new regulations that the United Kingdom enacted on July 30, 2018, it is illegal for private citizens to fly small drones above 400 feet and within just over a half a mile of an airport perimeter. U.K. Prime Minister Teresa May has said any suspects involved in the incident face prison time when they are caught. The most immediate danger from the small drones to air traffic at and around the airport is that they might collide with an airliner. If the remote-controlled aerial vehicles ended up ingested into a jet engine, banging into in a propeller, or crashing through the windscreen of an aircraft the results could be particularly devastating. It is unclear what tools authorities have employed or considered employing so far to neutralize or mitigate the hazard. Airports typically have various protective measures in place to chase away birds, which present some of the same potential problems. However, these tools, such devices that create loud noises to scare flocks away, would have no impact on a drone. Pictures have emerged showing members of the Sussex Police carrying shotguns, which they could use to try to shoot down the drones. Some companies have developed specialized shotgun shells to reduce the chance of missed shots posing a threat to nearby innocent bystanders or private property. Police helicopters have also been involved in the search for the operators of the remotely piloted aircraft. Regardless, small unmanned aerial systems, especially quad- and hex-copters that can hover and quickly change direction, present difficult targets to hit, though, especially if they’re flying at higher altitudes. Authorities have described the drones over Gatwick as being of “an industrial specification,” suggesting that the pilotless aircraft involved may be on the more capable end of commercially available types . “Sussex Police have requested some support from the armed forces and we will be deploying the armed forces to give them the help that they need to help deal with the situation at Gatwick Airport,” U.K. Secretary of State for Defence Gavin Williamson told reporters later that same day. “Sadly, at this moment, it [what we are deploying] is not something we can actually reveal, but the armed forces have a range of unique capabilities and this isn’t something we would usually deploy, but we are there to assist and do everything we can so that they are in a position to open the airport at the earliest opportunity.” These military capabilities most likely include additional tools to defeat the drones themselves and locate the individuals controlling them. Military short-range air defense or counter-battery radars , able to spot low-flying and even smaller targets, such as artillery shells and mortar bombs, could be useful in monitoring the drones and potentially tracing them back to an originating point. Electronic warfare systems, either on the ground or in the air , that can detect and geolocate transmitters , such as the drone’s control unit, would also help immensely. The U.K. military could also have more effective means of knocking the drones out of the sky, as well. Faced with the growing use of small drones , sometimes carrying grenade-like munitions , by both nation-state militaries and non-state actors, such as terrorists, militaries around the world have been investing heavily in active countermeasures. The most common examples are man-portable and vehicle-mounted radio frequency jammers , though more advanced systems, including solid-state lasers and high-power microwave directed energy weapons are also in development. The jamming systems typically work by breaking the command link between the controller and the drone, either causing it to fall out of the sky or follow a pre-programmed route back to its operator. In the latter case, this could also help in finding the individuals responsible. Jammers do have a significant number of limitations , though, including their relatively indiscriminate focus, which can interrupt signals from other nearby emitters operating on the same or adjacent frequencies. Jamming systems that work on a more narrow range of frequencies, or have more limited power, may mitigate those issues, but also have more limited effectiveness. US Marines with the IXI Technology Dronekiller, one of a growing number of portable drone jammers on the market., USMC But however British officials ultimately tackle the situation at Gatwick, it will provide yet another call to action to further investigate how to regulate civilian use of small drones and how to defend against them when they become threatening. These are concerns we at The War Zone have raised on numerous occasions and you can read about them in greater detail here and here . The hazard of small drones flying near airports is hardly new. In 2017, there were reportedly 100 potentially dangerous interactions between manned aircraft and drones in the United Kingdom alone, according to the BBC . Remember, the drones at Gatwick have done nothing but fly near the airport, as well. On July 2, 2017, another drone intruder shut down Gatwick for a total of just 14 minutes, causing headaches for hours afterward . It will take days, if not longer, for the cascading impacts of these cancellations and delays, which have already stranded thousands of individuals or forced them to seek alternative travel options, will take days, due to this new incident to finally disappear. Gatwick had expected to see nearly 3 million travel through its facilities during this holiday season and 143,000 are presently booked to fly in and out of the airport just on Dec. 30, 2018. This means that individuals responsible have been able to cause millions of dollars worth of economic damage with drones you can buy online right now for less than $5,000. Between diversions and people scrambling to find other ways of getting where they need to go, these impacts can easily spill over to other airports, as well. Perhaps the best example of an extreme worst-case situation is when nation-wide civilian air traffic in the United States ground to a halt in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the impact of which is described in the video below. It took the airline industry years to fully recover from the billions of dollars worth of losses. There was absolutely nothing stopping the individuals responsible for this latest crisis at Gatwick from adding more malicious payloads to their drones, either. These items could range from explosives and other actual weapons to laser pointers and hazardous waste . The drones in question appear to have been operating independently, as well, but the technology to employ swarms of small unmanned aerial vehicles is rapidly evolving and proliferating. A large flock of drones acting in unison would be even more threatening and difficult to counter. All told, this incident should be yet another wakeup call for authorities at Gatwick, and operators of airports and other major civilian infrastructure around the world, that they will only need to be more prepared to tackle these threats in the future. Update: 3:25pm EST— Authorities at Gatwick have said that flight operations at the airport will remain shut down “for the foreseeable future including tomorrow” and have told travelers not to come. As we noted could happen, this incident appears to have become a massive disruption for air travel in the United Kingdom and in other countries with flights to and from Gatwick at one of the business travel times of the year. Update: 12/21/18— At 3:00 PM local time, Gatwick Airport finally resumed flight operations. However, delays and disruptions due to the lengthy shutdown are likely to continue in the immediate future.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 3, 2019",Joint Threat Emitters Train Pilots How To Defeat Enemy Air Defenses And The USAF Wants More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has handed Northrop Grumman a contract worth up to $450 million for more Joint Threat Emitters , or JTEs, over the next seven years. These systems have the ability to mimic the threatening emissions associated with a wide array of potential enemy air defense systems , adding valuable realism to aerial combat training. The Pentagon first announced the deal in its daily contract announcements on Dec. 6, 2018. Under the indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery contract, the Air Force will be able to exercise various options and decide how many JTEs it wants to purchase in total over the first five years. The service asked for a dozen of the systems in its budget request for the 2019 Fiscal Year alone. At present, Northrop Grumman will be delivering the systems and related services through December 2025. “Our Joint Threat Emitter systems enable aircrews to train in environments that match actual combat situations,” Rob Fleming, Vice President, Land and Avionics C4ISR, Northrop Grumman, said in a subsequent press release on Dec. 20, 2018. “These training systems are critical in preparing members of the military to respond to threats.” U.S. military aircrews are facing an ever-growing and evolving array of surface-to-air missiles and associated radars and other tracking sensors, as well as electronic warfare systems . Potential “great power” adversaries, such as China and Russia , are hard at work on developing and fielding new threats, but less advanced systems that are still very threating are increasingly proliferating around the world. This is to say nothing of various non-state and quasi-state actors, some of whom have access to man-portable air-defense systems, or MANPADS , or have been able to craft improvised anti-aircraft missile systems. Components of the Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) system at the Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center in Mississippi during Exercise Southern Strike 17., USAF The United States, as well as many of its allies, do have access to various actual examples of representative threats acquired through direct purchases or obtained via espionage or other indirect means . Just in September 2018, the U.S. Army took delivery of a Ukrainian 36D6M1-1 air defense radar, which is associated with certain variants of the Soviet-era S-300 surface-to-air missile system that remain in service around the world. But actual foreign systems can be difficult to use and problematic to fix if they break. The U.S. military might not even be able to acknowledge that it has these systems on hand and so it might be reluctant to use them outside of specially designated high-security areas. They’re few and far between, to begin with, and aren’t something you’d necessarily want to risk damaging by bringing it with you to an exercise in a remote location or another country or even use up in daily training. Full-scale replicas might be good for certain training tasks, such as practicing to find targets at night using various electro-optical and infrared sensors, but they can’t necessarily simulate an actual threat, which can present itself from many miles away. A Ukrainian trailer-mounted 36D6M1-1 radar in its deployed configuration. The U.S. Army recently obtained one of these in a direct purchase from Ukraine., Ukroboronprom This is where the JTE comes into play. The system includes two, separate components, the Threat Emitter Unit (TEU) and a Command and Control Unit (C2U). At present, the TEU, a trailer-mounted collection of dishes and other emitters, comes in two basic flavors. The standard model is a modular design that can accommodate a number of different emitter configurations to emulate various types of radar, electronic warfare, and other threats. A Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) Threat Emitter Unit (TEU)., USAF When running at full Effective Radiated Power (ERP), a standard TEU can pump out signals associated with up to six different air defense systems. There is also a wide-band kit, also known as the WTEU, which “emulates the EW [electronic warfare] threats across the spectrum needed by test and training ranges when less than full ERP is suitable,” according to Northrop Grumman’s website . Each C2U, which comes in fixed and mobile, trailer-mounted types, can control the emissions from up 12 TEUs at once, allowing the system to mimic larger, integrated air defense networks with multiple tiers of threats. Linked together with the Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) system, the JTEs can simulate both long-range search and short-range fire control radars. A JTE operator monitors air traffic from inside a Command and Control Unit (C2U) van during an exercise., USAF As such, the complete JTE systems provide for valuable “train-as-you-fight” opportunities for U.S. military aviators, especially units that are tasked with the suppression or destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) and would be actively searching for and targeting hostile emitters during a real conflict. These would include the Air Force’s F-16CJ “Wild Weasel” multi-role combat jets and the Navy’s EA-18G Growler jamming aircraft, among others. The JTEs don’t just pump out hostile signals, either. The system has the ability to respond to an aircraft’s own countermeasures and aerial combat maneuvering, mirroring enemy tactics, techniques, and procedures. It’s a great, low-cost way for aircrews to train with their onboard electronic warfare systems . Operators can pre-program the TEUs to function autonomously, too. An F-16CJ “Wild Weasel” takes off during a training exercise carrying practice AGM-88 High-speed Anti-radiation Missiles (HARM) under its wings. During a real mission, the pilot would use these missiles to destroy threatening air defense radars., USAF The TEUs also record high-fidelity video and electronic countermeasures signals from the targets they tracks, which can help crews better understand which of their tactics and maneuvers worked the best and why. In this way, the JTE also has the ability to support the development of new air combat tactics, techniques, and procedures and the testing and evaluation of new defensive countermeasures and electronic attack systems . On top of that, the emitters are reprogrammable so that the Air Force and other operators can add in new threat profiles as they emerge in real life without necessarily having to buy all new systems. All of this comes in a package that’s relatively mobile and can be deployed to meet the training requirements of various units instead of necessarily requiring the use of a specialized range . As of 2018, the Air Force and the Navy together had 19 TEUs, two WTEUs, 10 fixed C2Us, and two mobile C2Us, according to Air Force contracting documents . These have been deployed, either permanently or temporarily, to ranges in Alaska, Guam, Louisiana, Washington State, and Nevada. With more JTEs, the Air Force will be able to have them ready to go at more ranges or be able to pre-position additional mobile versions closer to potential exercise locations. A US Navy EA-18G Growler jamming aircraft., USN This means less time traveling and more time training, something that is immensely valuable for the U.S. military’s diverse combat and combat support aviation communities, which have been under increasing strain after years of constant combat operations, personnel shortages , and budget cuts . It also helps save money on fuel and other operating costs , since aircraft do not necessarily have to fly as far to train with this level of threat simulation. The JTE’s portability means that the United States can also readily provide this capability during multi-national exercises overseas. They’ve made appearances at drills overseas in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well. The Air Force brought one of the systems to Exercise Pitch Black , Australia’s premier annual air combat exercise, earlier in the year. There are 28 JTE systems in service in the U.S. and foreign militaries in total, according to Northrop Grumman. Many of these countries, such as Saudi Arabia , received the JTEs with assistance from the U.S. government. The December 2018 Air Force contract includes provision for sales of the emitters and related systems to existing and new foreign military sales customers, as well. US Air Force personnel maneuver a JTE onto a cargo aircraft Exercise Pitch Black in Australia., USAF The demand from foreign air arms for their own JTEs should balloon in the coming years. While the system is very beneficial for many fourth-generation fighters, but for fifth-generation assets, namely the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , it fulfills an essential requirement for squeezing the very most out of what is an expensive platform. One of the F-35’s most prized secondary capabilities is its ability to soak up electromagnetic signals like a flying sponge, then classify and record those emissions for exploitation in real-time by the pilot and assets that his or her F-35 is data-linked too, as well as for intelligence gathering purposes after the mission. Virtual training on how to react to disparate electromagnetic threats can only provide limited fidelity. With the JTE, emissions from the “enemy” appear as real in the cockpit. Pilots and their wingmen must decide whether to continue on their route as planned, avoid the threat by modifying their course, engage and eliminate the threat, or if the mission can even be completed at all. The mission objectives, available electronic warfare capabilities, weapons on board, fuel state, number of aircraft in a formation, other assets in the area, and so on all factor into these decisions. JTE presents a cost-effective and highly flexible way to train for these contingencies and to practice tactics that go along with them, in a very realistic manner. A formation of four US Air Force F-35As., USAF In addition, many countries that never had a high-end Wild Weasel (SEAD/DEAD) capability before are getting it as it since it is baked into their new F-35s . “Weaseling” is a very different art form than strike, counter-air, close air support, battlefield interdiction, or any other broad tactical air combat mission set. It takes a lot of practice to become proficient in it and the stakes are extremely high. Weasels have to intimately know the limitations of the enemy’s systems and their own in order to walk the fine line between acceptable risk and a suicide run. Once again, this takes practice, lots of it, to learn how to work as a team to dismantle various threat types. And although the F-35 brings big advantages to the table—especially in terms of stealth, electronic warfare capabilities, and sensor fusion—it’s not invisible to radar , especially from certain aspects and when particular bandwidths are employed. All this has to be learned and applied in real-world training scenarios before any “weasel” becomes comfortable leveraging it in combat. So in order for countries large and small to make the best of the F-35’s capabilities, JTEs, or other systems like it, are nearly essential tools of the trade. And considering how precious each hour of flight time will be on the F-35, getting the very most out of that time will be far more important than it has been in the past with less complex and costly fighter aircraft. As such, JTEs are investments that can be easily rationalized. Private adversary support companies are stepping in to provide better air-to-air target saturation for fifth-generation fighter assets and to help save flight hours on high-end fighter types that would otherwise be used needlessly in their place, as well as saving money overall. In the same fashion, JTEs will also become a more popular, if not essential solution when it comes to providing challenging yet fiscally responsible training for fighter aircraft crews. With all of the benefits that the JTEs offer to the U.S. military and its allies and partners, $450 million is a relatively modest investment to expand the capacity to provide realistic, tailorable threat emulation on an even more regular basis during aerial training exercises throughout the United States and around the world.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 24, 2018",Mattis Is Out As Defense Secretary In Wake Of Trump’s Sudden Syria Withdrawal Order,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Retired General James Mattis has officially resigned as the 26th U.S. Secretary of Defense. The news comes after President Donald Trump decided with little warning and against overwhelming advice from his cabinet and senior advisers to rapidly withdraw all personnel from Syria and end combat operations in the country overall, something Mattis has made clear time and time again would be an error with profound consequences. Trump framed the resignation as a “retirement” in the Tweet seen below, but Mattis’ resignation letter makes it clear that the two do not see eye to eye and that someone whose “views are better aligned with your own on these and other subjects” would better serve Trump. Mattis also mentions the need to treat our allies with respect and to provide clear global leadership—a clear swipe at Trump’s foreign policy —in the relatively long resignation letter that is also posted in the tweets below. Mattis Resignation Letter via @Calbon This also comes as multiple reports that Trump will also order a withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan are surfacing. This is something I said would be a very likely possibility after yesterday’s sudden orders. Mattis is very highly regarded on both sides of the aisle and is seen by Trump’s political opponents as “the last adult in the room” after it was announced retired General John Kelly was also leaving his position as White House Chief of Staff. Combined with a looming government shutdown over funding for Trump’s border wall —even after a stop-gap spending measure has been passed by Congress—as well as the tightening focus of the Mueller Investigation—one of 17 investigations into Trump’s political and business practices—this news is sure to rattle Washington to its core.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Vietnamese fisherman Tran Minh Thanh landed an unusual catch the other day, finding what appears to be a Chinese torpedo off the country’s coast. Under the watchful eye of local border guards, Tran dragged it ashore where onlookers got a chance to see it before government officials took it away for further inspection. Tran reportedly found the torpedo more than four miles out to sea from his village in Vietnam’s central Phu Yen province, which would be within the country’s national waters, on Dec. 18, 2018. The weapon is slightly over 22 feet long and has a diameter of just over 21 inches. It’s size and shape, coupled with Chinese markings, strongly suggest that it is Yu-6 from the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). We don’t know where it originated, but pictures and video show the torpedo has a bright orange colored section where the warhead would normally be, typically associated with test and training rounds. One of the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s nearly 80 submarines may have fired it during an exercise in the South China Sea. If Chinese forces were unable to recover it, the torpedo could have subsequently drifted towards the Vietnamese shore. Phu Yen sits about 300 miles southwest of the Paracel Islands , a region at the center of a long-running dispute between Vietnam and China . The province is also less than 400 miles south of Hainan Island, home to one of China’s biggest submarine bases . Of course, the entirety of the South China Sea is contested at present, with China insisting that the bulk of the region is its own national territory. It conducts regular air and naval training exercises in and around a series of man-made military outposts to assert its claims. It’s hardly the first time a training torpedo has gone missing during a drill only to wash up in a foreign locale, either. The apparent Yu-6 torpedo after being dragged ashore., via TuoiTre Online A look at the torpedo from the rear.

There is relatively little publicly available information about the Yu-6, which reportedly entered PLAN service in 2005. It is understood to be a, at least in part, a reverse-engineered U.S. Navy Mk 48 and is virtually identical visually to the American weapon. It may also include design features lifted from the Soviet-era Type 53 series. An operational Yu-6 with more typical markings on the warhead section., Chinese internet Chinese reports have described the torpedo as an analog to the Mod 4 variant of the Mk 48 specifically, which entered Navy service in 1982 and featured improved doppler tracking capability over previous variants. In the United States, the Mod 4 variant has long been supplemented with more advanced models . Work on the Yu-6 began in 1995, but was repeatedly delayed due to technical difficulties, especially with its acoustic guidance and propulsion systems. The final design reportedly has a maximum range of nearly 30 miles, a top speed of almost 75 miles per hour, and features options for remote-controlled wire guidance, active and passive sonar homing, or wake homing. Today, it is one of the most advanced torpedos in Chinese service and its development was such a significant achievement for China that the lead designer, Dong Chunpeng, received a 2006 State Science and Technology Prize. The modern members of the Mk 48 torpedo family., USN The Yu-6 also served as the basis for an improved, electrically-powered variant known as the Yu-9 . Electrically powered torpedos are generally quieter, and therefore harder to detect, than those with some form of chemical propellant , but have also historically been slower. More modern electric designs have significantly closed that speed gap and also feature long-lasting batteries to extend their shelf-life. The torpedo that washed up in Vietnam does not appear to be one of these more advanced types, which only entered service in 2012. That’s not to say that having a Yu-6, even a training round, in relatively good condition isn’t still valuable. The Vietnamese could conduct tests to determine just how quiet this type is and what sort of acoustic and other signatures it does produce. Any guidance system components would also be of great interest. They could also decide to share those findings, or components of the torpedo itself, with their allies. Chinese sailors load a Yu-6 onto a Type 039 Song -class submarine., Chinese internet With the prospect of potential undersea warfare in the South China Sea only becoming more pronounced, any new information on Chinese torpedos is likely to be beneficial for the development of both countermeasures and naval tactics techniques and procedures. As the PLAN steps up operations in the region, it’s possible that debris from training exercises washing up on shore might become a more common occurrence and those materials could be a boon foreign U.S. and allied intelligence services and vice versa for Chinese intelligence. Mysterious underwater gear has fallen into Chinese hands in recent years, as well. As the underwater battlespace becomes increasingly unmanned, just plucking a potential foe’s technology from the relatively shallow waters of the contested South China Sea is also likely to become more commonplace. With all this in mind, South China Sea fisherman may find themselves netting catches that are far more prized than they could ever have imagined.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 25, 2019",Venezuela Agreed To Let Russia Set Up A Bomber Outpost On This Caribbean Island: Reports,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian media outlets are reporting that the Kremlin is planning to establish a forward outpost on the Venezuelan island of La Orchila in the Caribbean Sea and base nuclear-capable Tu-160 Blackjack bombers, two of which just wrapped up a recent deployment to the country, at the site. If true, this could help bolster the embattled regime of Venezuela’s dictatorial president Nicolás Maduro and would significantly change the strategic reality in the Western Hemisphere for the United States. Russian newspapers Nezavisimaya Gazeta and Kommersant both reported the possible basing deal on Dec. 12, 2018. Russia had sent a pair of Tu-160s to Venezuela on Dec. 10, 2018, and those bombers left the country on Dec. 14, 2018. This was the third visit by these type of aircraft to the Latin American country since 2008 and they conducted a 10-hour long-range patrol in the Caribbean for the first time ever during this trip. “Our strategic bombers will not only not have to return to Russia every time, but also won’t perform aerial refueling while on a patrol mission in the Americas,” retired Colonel Shamil Gareyev, formerly chief of the Uzbekistan Defense Ministry’s Operations Department and now a commentator on military affairs, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta . “Our Tu-160 aircraft arrive to [sic] their base in Venezuela, conduct flights, execute their missions and are then replaced on a rotating basis. This is how it should be done.” So far, there are no details about what the Russian outpost might consist of, what forces might go there and when, and what timeframe the Kremlin and Venezuela might have agreed to for starting the project at all. La Orchila, which sits less than 500 miles from Puerto Rico and less than 1,500 miles from Florida, has significant space for new and expanded military facilities, though, as seen below. Having a forward base capable of accommodating strategic aircraft would enable Russia to conduct flights near the United States on a regular basis, something it is otherwise largely incapable of doing at present. As it stands now, Russian aircraft are generally only able to fly sorties in the vicinity of Alaska without the commitment of substantial support assets. For the Kremlin, the imbalance has long been glaring. The Russian government routinely complains about the large number of intelligence-gathering and other missions that Western military aircraft, especially those from the United States, fly near its borders on a regular basis. Satellite imagery of the runway on La Orchila as of 2015., Google Earth The recent deployment of Blackjacks to Venezuela came after a surge in American aerial activity along Russia’s western flank after the Kremlin launched an unprovoked attack on Ukrainian naval vessels in the Kerch Strait, which separates the Black Sea from the Sea of Azov, on Nov. 25, 2018. The United States and its allies condemned Russia’s actions and offered to increase military and other support for Ukraine, to the ire of the Kremlin. That the Tu-160s have the ability to carry nuclear weapons, including nuclear-armed cruise missiles that give a stand-off capability, would also give the forward location an added deterrent quality, presenting an unprecedented standing strategic threat to the mainland United States within the Western Hemisphere. The outpost could also potentially accommodate other types of combat aircraft, as well as anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles and associated radars and other sensors. All of this would present potential threats to American warships and combat aircraft operating in the Caribbean during a crisis. China has already had increasing success in denying maritime areas to opponents, including the United States, by using similarly militarized islands in the South China Sea. Two Russian Tu-160 Blackjack bombers fly in formation with a Venezuelan F-16B fighter jet in December 2018., Russian MoD It is worth remembering that the Soviet Union’s decision to base nuclear weapons in Cuba in 1962 was driven, in part, by a similar desire for more flexibility and the ability to directly threaten the United States proper. Though there’s no indication that a Russian presence on La Orchila would immediately create the same level of crisis, at least not initially, the U.S. government would almost certainly furiously object to a similarly provocative deployment to Venezuela. All told, it goes without saying that this could significantly alter the U.S. government’s strategic calculus. This, of course, would be the point. The United States was quick to decry the brief deployment of the two Tu-160s, and the rest of their supporting force, to Venezuela last week, as well as the Kremlin’s overall support for Maduro. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov chided U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo and others as being “undiplomatic” and “inappropriate.” A member of the Russian contingent, at right, gives a Venezuelan officer a Tu-160 model after arriving in the country on Dec. 10, 2018., Russian MoD In establishing a more permanent Venezuelan outpost, Russia would gain a foothold it hasn’t had in the Caribbean region since the height of the Cold War and it would also be better able to help shield a friendly regime from outside intervention in the process – a model that has worked particularly well for the Kremlin in defending the Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad. Though there is no clear evidence to support claims that the U.S. government is actively seeking to overthrow Maduro, the Venezuelan president repeatedly claims that foreign agents from the United States and elsewhere are attempting to destabilize his regime . Maduro’s attacks have only grown amid President Donald Trump regular suggestions that he could launch a military intervention into the country and that his administration has met with potential coup plotters . Maduro, who took power in 2013 after the death of his populist predecessor Hugo Chavez , has overseen the country as it has slid into a massive economic crisis characterized by hyperinflation and shortages of basic necessities. He has responded by consolidating power and cracking down on opposition political parties, who say his domestic policies are to blame. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, shakes hands with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. , Sputnik/Aleksey Nikolskyi All this being said, there is no guarantee that an actual base will ever materialize on La Orchila, which features a runway long enough to accommodate Tu-160 operations, but with limited infrastructure to support regular operations by large combat aircraft. In addition to serving as an outlying Venezuelan military outpost, the island is also a presidential retreat. Rebellious military officers briefly held the late Hugo Chavez captive there during their abortive coup attempt in 2002 . Russia and Venezuela would have to invest significant time and resources they may not have into expanding facilities on the island, especially fuel and weapons storage, as well as and living areas before regular operations could commence. This could be a multi-year endeavor and it is not at all clear how long Maduro might remain in power. On top of that, the idea of actually deploying nuclear weapons to the base, even temporarily, seems highly unrealistic without massive improvements in security. There is no indication that Russian Tu-160s have carried any weapons whatsoever on their previous visits to the Latin American country. It is worth noting, however, Russia and Venezuela did discuss a similar arrangement in 2009, which Chavez eventually rejected. However, publicly available satellite imagery shows that between 2009 and 2013, Venezuelan authorities did expand and refurbish the runway, the associated ramp, and other infrastructure on the island, potentially with an eye toward combined operations with the Russian in the future. The present facilities are certainly austere, the base is not bare. The runway turnaround getting expanded in 2009., Google Earth The same area in 2013, showing the completion of the work. , Google Earth Regardless of whether the outpost becomes a reality, just scheduling more regular deployments of Tu-160s and other strategic aircraft, such as Tu-95 Bear bombers, to Venezuela, as well as using La Orchila as a temporarily staging location for training flights and other aerial activities in the Caribbean, would be a significant development. It is possible that Nezavisimaya Gazeta and Kommersant or their sources misunderstood what they had heard and that the Kremlin is simply planning to increase military cooperation in the near-term. With Venezuela’s crises far from over and Russian relations with the United States at the West at a new low, it is possible that both parties may now see it in both their interests to invest in developing an expanded, shared military presence. How, or even if that involves La Orchila still needs to be confirmed. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces Bombers Russian Air Force"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The Army’s Search For Its First Light Tank In Decades Is Down To These Two Designs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army have picked two defense contractors to proceed with development of a light tank to provide additional firepower for its airborne and dismounted infantry brigades. The program is part the service’s larger effort to modernize its armored vehicle fleets amid the U.S. military’s push to be better prepared for a potential conflict with conventional nation-state opponent , especially a “great power” adversary, such as Russia or China. The Army awarded the deals to BAE Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS), worth more than $375 million and $335 million respectively, on Dec. 17, 2018. Each firm will build a total of 12 prototype vehicles within the next 14 months for further tests and evaluations as part of what the service formally refers to as the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program. The Army rejected a third bid from a team-up of U.S. defense company SAIC, Singapore’s ST Engineering, and Belgium’s CMI Defense. “Our offering integrates innovative technology that reduces the burden on the crew into a compact design deployable in areas that are hard to reach,” Deepak Bazaz, BAE Systems’ Director of Combat Vehicles Programs at BAE Systems, said in a company press release . “We’re confident our design meets the requirements and the unique capabilities the IBCT needs.” “We are excited about this opportunity to provide the U.S. Army a large-caliber, highly mobile combat vehicle to support the infantry brigade combat teams,” Don Kotchman, Vice President and General Manager of General Dynamics Land Systems U.S. Market, said in a separate release from that company. “We are especially proud of this new opportunity to serve in the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) formation, which we have not done until now.” Both of the vehicles are tracked designs with manned turrets. BAE’s updated M8 Armored Gun System (AGS), which it had previously been referring to as the Expeditionary Light Tank (ELT), features a 105mm cannon, while GDLS’ Griffin II has a 120mm main gun. BAE’s entrant also had the lightest configuration, weighing in at around 20 tons with additional applique armor and other add-ons. The basic Griffin II is closer to 28 tons. Both vehicles will feature various secondary weapons and there are plans to add active protection systems (APS) in the future. The Army is presently conducting separate tests of APS options as part of a program seeking to develop a modular self-protection architecture for all of its armored vehicles. On-board launchers for small drones or loitering munitions , improved sensors, and other advanced equipment may also become requirements for the final MPF design as time goes on. The first formal MPF requirements emerged in 2015 in the aftermath of Russia’s lightning takeover of Ukraine’s Crimea region and subsequent armed intervention on behalf of separatists fighting that country’s central government. These events sent shockwaves through the U.S. military establishment and reinvigorated calls for improving capabilities to combat conventional opponents who might be armed, at least in part, with heavy armored vehicles . At present, Army airborne and other dismounted infantry brigades rely on man-portable and light vehicle-mounted anti-tank guided missiles as their sole means of tackling enemy armor. These units also have limited options for defeating other hardened targets, including fortifications and similar obstacles. As such, the goal of the MPF program is to provide these units with a light tank with a large caliber main gun that can defeat opposing armor and reinforced defensive positions. The vehicle would also be able to engage enemy forces without automatically needing to first close within range of their weapons. A briefing slide showing early MPF program requirements, some of which have already changed., US Army For paratroopers, who have a core mission to be prepared drop into enemy or enemy adjacent territory to seize control of key objectives, this sort of vehicle could be particularly valuable. These units might otherwise find themselves ill-equipped to deal with a dug-in opponent or especially vulnerable to counter-attacks from enemy heavy forces as they await follow-on forces after jumping into the target area. This next phase of the MPF looks set to be a spirited competition. BAE Systems is touting the technological maturity of its design, which is an updated iteration of a vehicle the Army funded development of in the 1990s. The service canceled that program in the face of budget cuts. That decision contributed to the Army’s adoption of the Stryker wheeled armored vehicle family, which are also receiving new weapon systems and other updates . GDLS’ entrant similarly leverages existing work by using the hull from its Ajax armored scout vehicle , which the company is already building for the United Kingdom, and turret features from the M1 Abrams tank . The company is also using a 120mm cannon design that it originally developed as part of the Army’s abortive Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. An Ajax armored scout vehicle for the British Army., UK MoD The Griffin II could have another leg up in the competition depending on how the separate Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program progresses, too. GDLS has entered the Griffin III, which is configured as an infantry fighting vehicle and features a 50mm automatic cannon, into that competition, which is seeking a replacement for the Bradley fighting vehicle family . Both the OMFV and MPF fall under the larger Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program. Adopting multiple Griffin variants would help the Army reduce training, maintenance, and logistics demands as well as future development costs. BAE’s OMFV contender, the Swedish-designed CV90 Mk IV , is an entirely separate design from the M8. General Dynamics Land Systems’ infantry fighting vehicle-configured Griffin III, which shared various components with its Griffin II entry into the MPF program., Joseph Trevithick The MPF program could still face a number of hurdles, too. The Army has been trying to field a vehicle like this for decades, but has consistently run up against the difficulty of finding a design that is sufficiently light to be suitable for operating with otherwise dismounted infantry units and that is armored enough to be survivable against its intended opponents. We at The War Zone previously examined this debate in-depth in regards to the MPF program. After axing the M8 in the 1990s, the Army retired the M551 Sheridan air-droppable light tank, a vehicle with its own, at best checkered history, without a direct replacement. The decision was certainly made easier by the fact that with the end of the Cold War, it appeared that large-scale, conventional conflicts were a think of the past, a belief that has increasingly proven to be short-sighted. On top of that, though, there were concerns that the M8 was too lightly armored in its air-droppable configuration to be survivable and too heavy in its up-armored configurations to fit inside medium-size airlifters, such as the C-130 Hercules, at all. Now, with the MPF, the Army has yet again dispensed with the air-drop requirement and now expects a single U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III to be able to air-land two MPFs. This will require a secure landing zone on the ground in order for airborne units to bring in their new light tanks. Advanced lightweight APS could help mitigate a lack of armor on either of the MPF designs, but these systems only work against typical infantry anti-tank systems, such as anti-tank guided missiles and rocket-propelled grenades . They would do little, if anything, to shield the vehicle against hostile armored vehicles with large caliber automatic cannons or main battle tanks with full-size main guns. One of the original M8 prototypes at Aberdeen Proving Ground in the 1990s., US Army Regardless, the Army is already planning for the MPF to be a relatively niche asset, at least in the near term, with a total initial fleet size of just 54 vehicles. This would include a first batch of 26 vehicles, plus a second lot of 28 more, including eight refurbished prototypes. The Army says it could eventually buy more than 500 examples , though. A typical Army armor company has around 14 Abrams tanks, which would mean the service is looking to start with a buy of less than four companies worth of the new light tanks, or about the necessary number for a battalion attached to the 82nd Airborne Division, which was the last Army unit to use the M551. The 82nd is already acquiring ex-U.S. Marine Corps LAV-25A2 light wheeled armored vehicles, which are air-droppable, to provide more immediate added firepower during airborne operations. In spite of these potential challenges, the Army hopes to select a final MPF design before the end of 2022 and have the first examples in service between 2024 and 2025. It’s an aggressive schedule that makes it clear the service wants to get its first light tank in decades into the field and ready to support its lighter forces as soon as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 17, 2019",Russia’s Satan 2 ICBM Service Entry Delayed As Arms Control Deals Falter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Kremlin has revealed that the planned date for deploying its new RS-28 Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, also known as the SS-X-30 Satan 2, has gotten pushed back, even as it announced which unit will be the first to receive these weapons. The delay could be due to technical issues with the missile, Russia’s slumped economy, or a combination of factors. It also means the country won’t be fielding the weapons until after a key arms control deal with the United States, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START , potentially expires, which has sparked concerns about an impending arms race. The RS-28 is a silo-launched, liquid-fueled, nuclear-armed ICBM. Russia has been working on the missile for nearly a decade and it will reportedly have a host of capabilities intended to defeat ballistic missile defenses ranging from decoys and other countermeasures to a fractional orbital bombardment capability , independent post-boost vehicles (IPBV), or even a payload of multiple hypersonic boost-glide vehicles . “We plan to start the rearmament with this missile complex starting in 2021 in the Uzhur-based missile force division, which currently has in operation its predecessor – the Voyevoda missile complex ,” Russian Strategic Missile Force Commander Colonel-General Sergei Karakayev told Krasnaya Zvezda , the official newspaper of Russia’s Ministry of Defense, in an interview published on Dec. 17, 2018. The RS-28s are set to replace the older Voyevodas, also known as R-36Ms or SS-18 Satans, which have been in service since the 1970s, though they have received with various upgrades in the intervening years. A liquid-fueled ICBM might seem somewhat dated, but it does offer the advantage of a more capable and dynamic propulsion arrangement. But unlike a solid fuel design, it has historically been difficult to keep these type of missiles in a fueled state indefinitely, often meaning that launch crews had to go through a lengthy process of fueling the weapon shortly before launch. However, a hydrazine-based liquid rocket fuel with nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) as the oxidizer, provides a more stable, less corrosive option, that allows for long-term storage of missiles in a fueled, ready state when combined with the right component materials and environmental controls. Russian state media outlet TASS added that, “according to earlier reports,” serial production of the RS-28 was set to begin in 2020 before entering service the next year. There have also been statements suggesting that mass production of the missiles won’t actually start until 2021 . However, as recently as May 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin himself had said that the Sarmat was supposed to become operational in 2020. “Trials of other promising systems continue,” he said at a meeting of senior Russian military officials and the heads of state-run defense companies on May 18, 2018. “Soon, they are to begin service in our strategic forces. I mean first of all the Sarmat system that is to enter operational service in 2020 … ” The exact reason for this latest delay is unclear, but it’s not the first time the RS-28 program has run into trouble. In 2015, there were reports that the schedule had slipped and, two years later, a series of tests got pushed back due to the need to re-inspect certain missile components for apparent quality-control issues. The first successful ejection test of a Saramat prototype occurred in December 2017. It would seem that any continuing issues lie with the missile itself or in ramping up production of the weapons. “Over the past few years, we have created modern infrastructure for deploying [RS-24] Yars [road-mobile ICBM] complexes and the infrastructure for the Sarmat missile system has already been prepared,” Russian Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov said in a separate interview that the business daily Kommersant published on Dec. 17, 2018. It is possible that technical or quality-control problems still dog the missile. On or about Dec. 10, 2018, Russia suffered what appears to have been a catastrophic failure of an IBCM during a test at the Kapustin Yar missile test facility. After video of the incident surfaced on social media, Russian officials claimed that the weapon in question was an S-350 Vityaz surface-to-air missile, but experts and observers have had their doubts. “This account appears inconsistent with the sheer scale of incident depicted in the video,” Joseph Dempsey, a Research Associate for Defense and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) think tank in the United Kingdom, Tweeted out on Dec. 12, 2018. There is no evidence that this was an RS-28, though, with unconfirmed reports that the missile was actually an RS-12M Topol ICBM . Russia routinely uses these older weapons to test new warheads and countermeasures systems. That serial production of the RS-28 isn’t set to begin until 2020 might point to broader economic difficulties that make it difficult to pay for the weapons, too. International sanctions against Russia over illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and its active military involvement in and around that country , on top of its actions in Syria and elsewhere , have taken their toll. The low price of oil , Russia’s major revenue generating exports, has also been a factor. The Kremlin has already canceled the Barguzin rail-mobile IBCM project – originally set to be in service by 2018 – and shelved the RS-26 Rubezh silo-launched ICBM program indefinitely to free up funds for more pressing strategic weapons efforts. Chief among these is the Avangard nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, which Russia says will enter service in 2019 using older, refurbished rocket boosters. There are reports that Avangard might eventually be a warhead option for the RS-28, too. But the delay could prove advantageous for the Kremlin in the long run, since the New START treaty is set to expire in 2021. The deal places hard limits on the number of deployed and non-deployed land-based ICBMs , total available launch tube for submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and nuclear-capable heavy bombers that Russia and the United States can have in total. The agreement also sets a firm limit on total deployed and non-deployed systems. With those limits in place, Russia might not be able to deploy both the new Avangard-equipped missiles and replace the R-36Ms with SS-28s on a one-for-one basis, while still maintaining its other ICBMs and moving ahead with other strategic weapons modernization programs . It is true that Russia had less than 520 deployed “launchers” – the total of land-based IBCMs, SLBM launch tubes, and heavy bombers – as of September 2018 , while the treaty allows for a maximum of 700 such systems. New START also includes a provision that would allow the U.S. and Russian governments to extend it, but only through 2026. Negotiations for a follow-on deal will have to begin in earnest soon, if they haven’t already, but those talks will come at a time when the two countries are at odds over a separate nuclear weapons deal, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF . The United States has presented evidence to the Russians and its own allies that the Kremlin has a missile that violates the INF and has announced its own intention to withdraw from the agreement in early 2019 if Russia does not return to compliance with its terms. The Russians continue to insist that the weapon in question does not breach the treaty. As such, they have been growing calls from within the U.S. government, especially from Congress , arguing that the United States should not simply extend New START, but should seek to negotiate a new deal that better incorporates various American demands about both intermediate-range and strategic nuclear weapons. President Donald Trump and his administration have shown great willingness to dispense with major existing international agreements that they argue have not served America’s interests . But without New START, or the INF, in place in 2021, Russia would have a free hand to deploy systems such as the RS-28, on top of its other missiles, without any restrictions. It could also indefinitely retain the R-36Ms in an active state for any future purpose, without those missiles counting against its total non-deployed weapons. The Kremlin has already warned that an end to the INF would prompt it to deploy missiles in that category – likely simply officially fielding the missiles it already has – and touch off an arms race. All told, while the Russians might have had to delay putting the first SS-28s into operational service, it could let them hold on to the ICBMs they have now and deploy even more missiles in the future.

This set of scenes almost seems as if it is part of a caper of sorts, with Cruise and Miles Teller—who plays Goose’s son—possibly stealing the Tomcat in question. We really can’t be sure, but the jet also has what looks like a phoenix painted under its canopy, so exactly who owns this F-14 and where the setting is supposed to take place in relation to the greater plot is puzzling. We can say one thing for certain, that bird logo has meaning to the film as the F-14 didn’t have it when it was towed to the set. Earlier set photos showed cruise in some sort of a black pressure suit , so maybe Mav executed a very high altitude skydive into the area to steal the Tomcat. Cruise, an avid skydiver, loves to incorporate jumps into his action films, so that pressure suit being more about skydiving than flying a high-altitude aircraft could make some sense. Here was my take on what a Top Gun 2 plot should look like back in 2015: As far as a good Top Gun II plot goes, I think the best one possible is obvious: It is 2015, and tensions are rising between the US and Iran, which has recently sent its F-14 Tomcats to China (or even better, Russia) for an extreme upgrade. Now, through an ironic turn of events, US Navy pilots flying Super Hornets may have to take on the legendary Tomcat in a more potent form than ever before. One retired fighter pilot knows the Tomcat better than anyone else and has applied it to great success in combat. That one pilot is Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell. Will Mitchell, who left the Navy under negative circumstances, accept their urgent request for his Tomcat expertise? Can Maverick teach the young gun “Rhino” drivers how to defeat the very steed he learned to master and love?… Iran would be an ideal foe as its air force still flies a couple dozen Tomcats and has upgraded them over the years, so it is not a completely unfounded plot device. As far as peer competitors on the high seas go, China would be the obvious choice, but that would mean missing out on the lucrative Chinese box office, so that surely isn’t happening. A division of upgraded Iranian Tomcats., Iranian Air Force Could Mav be stealing an F-14 from Iran because the U.S. doesn’t have any that can be rapidly put in the air for dissimilar training? Or maybe a ‘live specimen’ is needed in order for the U.S. intelligence community to evaluate upgrades to the jet so that they can be countered? It could also be that Maverick gets shot down while flying a high-altitude aircraft over Iran and steals the Persian Tomcat to escape enemy territory? The F-14 could have also been ‘sold’ by Iran to another country, like North Korea, to help get the Tomcat to the bad guys that the scriptwriters wanted to include in the film. All these plot points seem pretty silly, which makes them perfectly viable for a Top Gun sequel. We will keep you up to date as more about the particular Tomcat that is staring in the film surfaces.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 5, 2018",Edwards AFB Test Wing Commander Posted A List Of What A Week In His World Looks Like,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Brigadier General E. John “Dragon” Teichert III has one hell of a responsibility. He oversees the Air Forces sprawling 412th Test Wing . The Wing is headquartered at the heart of USAF flight testing, legendary Edwards Air Force Base, which he also runs, but the unit’s operations spread far from home in nearly every direction. Flight testing of virtually all the aircraft in the Air Force’s inventory is managed by the long list of squadrons that are attached to the 412th. The Wing also executes operations at satellite locations, including supposedly having a major hand in the goings on at Area 51 deep in the Nevada Test and Training Range . So, on any given day, to say that the 412th and its commander have a lot on their plate is a vast understatement. In a creative move, Teichert posted the major accomplishments of the 412th on a given week—the first week in December, 2018 to be more precise—seemingly to give people an idea of just how critical the unit is to America’s air combat abilities, but also to convey just how big its operational purview is. Keep in mind, this list is of major events, there are many smaller events that contribute to these and other larger accomplishments that occur on a daily basis. And obviously, there are a ton of fascinating things that the 412th Test Wing does that aren’t disclosed to the public . Regardless, this list is impressive and provides a good big-picture look at what the 412th Test Wing is up to on a weekly basis. The posting reads: This past weekend was not particularly different than the norm here at Edwards Air Force Base. Yet, our routine provided another stark example of how we are making history here today at the Center of the Aerospace Testing Universe as our mission has global and lasting impact: We celebrated our annual and amazing Winterfest on base with over 1,300 in attendance. We had a C-5 crew in Spain testing new satellite communications technology for our mobility aircraft. We had a C-17 crew in Guam preparing for an upcoming Missile Defense Agency testing where we will drop and launch a 70,000 pound missile out of the back of the aircraft to test our nation’s defensive capabilities. We flew a KC-46 from Alaska over the North Pole and landed it at Ramstein in the last major operationally-relevant developmental test of America’s new air refueling aircraft. We had an F-22 hanging from the ceiling of our anechoic facility on base to begin electromagnetic interference testing of the Raptor’s newest capabilities. We flew two F-16s and a KC-135 over the Pacific Ocean to the west of Los Angeles to launch supersonic missiles, verifying the effectiveness of the Australian Navy’s new Aegis cruiser. We performed fit checks on America’s next cruise missile , further strengthening our capability to arm the warfighter. We completed base-wide accountability for members and families who may have been impacted by the earthquake in Alaska. We prepared for cargo and personnel movement for a large scale readiness exercise that began today. We hosted the British Secretary of State for Defense (the peer of our Secretary of Defense) for a tour of the base with our British partners. Each of these events is important. Each of them is impactful. Each of them is vital to the warfighting capabilities of our nation and our allies. Each of them would be the highlight of a base’s weekly performance. Combined, they highlight the world-class team here at the Center of the Aerospace Testing Universe that regularly makes history today as we strive together for the warfighter. This is an interesting approach to outreach that shouldn’t go unnoticed. Not only is it really interesting to hear what the Wing is up to specifically, but it provides a grander context of what the 412th Test Wing and Edwards AFB do to usher in new capabilities to the Air Force, other services’ air arms, and the air forces of a number of America’s allies. USAF It would be great if this format of post turned into a weekly segment, but even if it’s done sporadically, it really does put color on the canvas when it comes to understanding all that the 412th does. And its schedule is only likely to become more hectic in the coming years as the Pentagon comes to terms with the reality that peer state warfare is once again its overwhelming focus. This means new munitions and aircraft—both manned and unmanned—will need testing. For instance, hypersonic weapons will increasingly become more dominant within the USAF’s portfolio, and this will include air-launched types , and the B-21 Raider will be entering testing at the base relatively soon. Networking and deeply integrated the sensor pictures from a wide variety of aircraft that carry disparate data terminals will also become increasingly important as time goes on. This is a big problem the 412th is working on solving in an integrated testing manner that you can read about here . These are just a few new initiatives in addition to all the established fleet aircraft testing they already do, and there are so many others, including those that live in the shadows. All this will also require a steady stream of test pilots and the USAF’s prestigious Test Pilot School is also under the control of the 412th Test Wing. In an era when the Air Force is having a really tough time retaining experienced aviators , keeping the most capable of the lot engaged in the flight test world will be absolutely key. USAF Here’s a little bit more about the impressive career of General Teichert who was minted the new commander of the 412th Test Wing just months ago. As you can see, on paper he is clearly a logical choice for the position: Brig. Gen. E. John “Dragon” Teichert is the Commander, 412th Test Wing, Edwards Air Force Base, California. He leads a wing of 7,847 personnel in the developmental test and evaluation of the F-35, KC-46, F-22, F-16, B-1, B-2, B-52, C-17, C-130, KC-135, Global Hawk, joint remotely piloted aircraft and emerging technologies. Additionally, General Teichert is the Installation Commander responsible for operating the base and supporting more than 11,000 active duty, reserve, civil service and defense contractors at Edwards AFB, the second largest base in the Air Force. … EDUCATION 1994 Bachelor of Science in aeronautics and astronautics, ROTC distinguished graduate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. 1995 Master of Science in aerospace engineering, Stanford University, Calif. 2001 Squadron Officer School, distinguished graduate, Maxwell AFB, Ala. 2003 U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School, distinguished graduate, Edwards AFB, Calif. 2007 Air Command and Staff College, distinguished graduate, Maxwell AFB, Ala. 2008 School of Advanced Air and Space Studies, Maxwell AFB, Ala. 2012 Industrial College of the Armed Forces, distinguished graduate, Fort Lesley J.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 4, 2018","U.S. Psyops Blasted ISIS With Recordings Of Crying, Troops Retreating, And Other Confusing Audio","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has made no secret of using psychological warfare against ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria and the civilian populations they operate within. From what we’ve seen in the past, the leaflets and radio messaging have focused primarily on urging fighters to abandon a futile cause and calling on civilians to support U.S.-backed authorities. Thanks for a Freedom of Information Act Request, we now know that it has also included darker audio broadcasts, including simple recordings of crying, to confuse, unsettle, and maybe even try to convince militants they’re going crazy. In October 2016, U.S. cultural advisors assigned to Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), or the Combined Joint Operations Center-Jordan (CJOC-J) approved 25 separate audio messages that American forces wanted to blare out at ISIS. CJTF-OIR is main U.S.-led coalition fighting the terrorists in Iraq and Syria. The CJOC-J is a smaller forward command specifically coordinating activities in neighboring Syria . To help expedite the FOIA request process, which began in December 2016, the author limited his request to only items CJTF-OIR and CJOC-J had approved during October 2016. Among other events in Iraq and Syria, this month marked the beginning of the U.S.-supported push to liberate the Iraqi city of Mosul from ISIS control. The internal control codes for the 25 audio messages that month begin with “OIR” and “SY” prefixes, but it is unclear exactly where they got sent out. In response to the FOIA request, U.S. Central Command provided translated transcripts, but U.S. forces would have broadcast the actual recordings in local languages, most likely Arabic or Kurdish. Iraqi Special Operations Forces fight along a street in Mosul in late 2016., AP For the most part, the transcribed audio is relatively mundane and play on psychological operations – or psyops – tropes that modern militaries have employed for decades, such as the uselessness of fighting and a longing for the safety and comfort of home. One, coded OIR16A024vaTC0005, reads as follows: “Do you regret choosing this life with Da’esh [another name for ISIS]? You probably miss your family at home… Or, perhaps you long for some of the comforts of your life before Da’esh… Electricity that works all day… Or being able to watch television, or freely use the internet…join your comrades now that have already saved their lives by leaving Da’esh.” Another one, SY16A02aaTC2000, seeks to spur mistrust between ISIS’ local recruits and foreign fighters, saying: “I don’t know whether to laugh at you or pity you, Brother. You joined Da’esh to fight and be part of something. But look! The foreign fighters get paid more than you; they get better food, better places to live, and the spoils of war. What do you get? Honestly, my friend, you have been cheated! Da’esh would be nothing without you, and look, you are barely treated better than they would treat a nonbeliever, and enemy prisoner. Is this what you signed up for?” Others, such as OIR15A02aaRD4010, are simply insulting and threatening: “To Da’esh rats: Dig as many tunnels and trenches as you wish, and hide as many containers [caches] as you wish. I swear by Allah, we know all of these things, where they are located, and what’s in them. We even know what type of clothing you change into in your homes. God willing, we are coming! And we shall stomp on your heads.” But the last two messages on this list, OIR15A02aTC0008 and OIR16A02vaTC0008, are wholly unlike the rest. The latter sounds as it if it meant to evoke intercepted radio chatter from an ISIS mid-level commander, with the transcript reading: “Fall back!  They are everywhere! (Pause w/ static) Why is no one answering me? You need to move back! We cannot hold our position if you do not fall back you will be overrun! (Pause w/ static) If you can hear me fall back, I cannot hear you. You must fall back now or you will be killed! Is there anyone there? (Static that fades out)” The transcript describes OIR15A02aTC0008 even more sinisterly simply as “crying.” We have no way of telling how long this particular recording lasts. There is nothing in the FOIA release to indicate how U.S. forces disseminated these messages. At present, the U.S. military has a mix of fixed radio broadcasting systems , vehicle-mounted speakers and so-called “ acoustic hailing devices ,” and a small number of specially configured psyops EC-130J aircraft assigned to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard’s 193rd Special Operations Wing. The 193rd’s main aircraft are six EC-130J Commando Solos , which are unique platforms that can function as flying radio or television stations as required. The Wing also now has a number of additional EC-130Js with far less intensive modifications and slightly different capabilities, including the ability to send out SMS text messages. Coalition forces have, on occasion, dropped leaflets with the frequencies of numerous “approved” radio stations, which could include Commando Solo broadcasts. One of the EC-130Js was seen at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait in June 2017. A leaflet that US forces dropped over Iraq during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 with various “approved” radio stations where civilians could get news and other information. , DOD Early in the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the EC-130s flew over the country and quickly provided a popular service since “they broadcast music and for almost everyone,” Weapon of Choice : U.S. Army Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan , an official U.S. Army monograph, explains. As with ISIS, the Taliban government had banned music and other forms of entertainment that it saw as subverting the values of its Islamic Republic. ISIS fighters would still need to tune into any radio broadcasts from stations on the ground or aircraft up above, though. The lack of context in the “Fall back!” message suggests the intent might have been to confuse the enemy rather than simply demoralize them. This could point to a more complex operation in which electronic warfare assets identify enemy communication nodes and then other elements seek to insert the false message into those nets. An EC-130J Commando Solo, at rear left, an EC-130H Compass Call electronic warfare aircraft, in front, at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait in June 2017., USAF Of course, the lack of context may have simply been meant to be confusing or disorienting and that the message was blared out via radio or an audible speaker to unsettle terrorists. There is a possibility, albeit remote, that It may have been actual repurposed audio from intercepted communications or captured video footage, with the hope that it might resonate more, especially among any remaining fighters who knew the individual behind the voice personally. U.S.-backed forces often release captured footage from ISIS fighters showing their final moments for the obvious propaganda value. Trying to just unsettle and disturb the terrorists was almost certainly the aim of the other “crying” audio. That message fits in with a different kind of long-running tactic that American forces, as well as law enforcement agencies, have employed, involving blasted out loud, obnoxious, or disturbing sounds toward opponents. The goal is to make it difficult for them to operate and sleep, driving them crazy to the point of giving up or disorienting them ahead of an attack. The United States and other countries have also employed these methods as controversial interrogation techniques . One of the most notable examples was when the U.S. military employed this type of psychological warfare to help drive Manuel Noriega , then the de facto leader of Panama, out of the Apostolic Nunciature, the Vatican’s embassy, in Panama City in December 1989. The United States had intervened in the country, an operation nicknamed Just Cause , to depose the autocratic Noriega and he finally emerged from the diplomatic refuge in January 1990 after 10 days of audio harassment and negotiations. The U.S. military, in cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies, infamously used similar tactics during the still-controversial siege of the Branch Davian cult compound in Waco, Texas in 1993. That incident ended with a raid that led to the deaths of 76 individuals inside, including a number of children. Four agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) and six other Branch Davidians had died in an earlier raid. We don’t know where and when U.S. forces employed the “crying” broadcast, but it is easy to imagine American personnel in Mosul, or their Iraqi and other coalition partners, playing it from huge speakers on trucks on a loop for hours on end. In a dense urban environment, this type of psychological warfare might have been useful in trying to get ISIS fighters to finally surrender or otherwise drive them out of particular buildings or neighborhoods. They could also have transmitted this audio out on various radio frequencies with the hope that it might flood terrorist radio nets with unsettling sounds, along with simple interference. None of this is to say that his kind of darker and more bizarre psychological warfare, which dates back centuries, is new or necessarily out of the ordinary, either. For example, the U.S. military has also dropped especially gory propaganda leaflets in Iraq and Syria urging ISIS fighters to leave the group or die. Don’t forget that the Central Intelligence Agency once commissioned prototype dolls of Osama Bin Laden, with a removable head that made him look like a demon , reportedly to discourage children from supporting Al Qaeda, too. A US Marine trains an Iraqi soldier to operate a long-range acoustic hailing device mounted on top of Humvee in 2018 specifically as part of efforts to improve the Iraqi Security Forces’ “Inform, Influence, and Persuade capabilities.”, US Army But it’s still fascinating to see the breadth and scope of messaging U.S. forces have and are likely still employing against ISIS and other groups. As time goes on, especially with the rise of social media, we’ll very likely see similar messaging appear on other media beyond audio recordings and paper leaflets, too. The U.S. and its coalition partners are already engaged in a separate cyberwarfare campaign against ISIS. With the increasing ability to target individuals and their personal electronic devices, such as smartphones , there could easily be a psychological warfare component to these activities, if there isn’t already. Specialists might be able to overtly or covertly insert confusing or disturbing messages, as well as more conventional propaganda, onto various devices with the same basic impact as a leaflet or unsetting audio recording. Whatever the case, we here at The War Zone intend to keep our eyes out for more examples of how the U.S. military has been trying to demoralize and freak out terrorists and militants and we’ll be sure to with you.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 17, 2019",Northrop Grumman Plans To Upend Aerial Surveillance Market With Their Optionally Manned Firebird,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the most exciting developments in aerial surveillance isn’t happening at some shadowy Air Force Base in the middle of Nevada desert, it’s occurring at Mojave Air and Space Port, a bustling bastion of aerospace creativity, located 50 miles to the southeast of Bakersfield, California. There, Northrop Grumman is working hard to make Medium Altitude, Long Endurance (MALE) unmanned aircraft capabilities accessible to a far larger global customer base than what exists today. They believe this lofty goal can be achieved by bringing an optionally manned, highly unique looking aircraft to the marketplace. That aircraft is the Northrop Grumman Firebird, a plane whose obscure development we here at The War Zone followed intensely , albeit from a distance , as nobody in an official capacity has been willing to discuss it—that is until now. The concept is as bewilderingly logical as it is downright exciting—create an aircraft that can fly very efficiently at medium altitudes for very long periods of time while also possessing the ability to swoop down below bad weather if need be. Ideally, this aircraft would also carry a wide variety of sensor and communications payloads, many of which can be outfitted concurrently during a single mission. These payloads would also have to be rapidly reconfigurable in the field, allowing for a single aircraft to accomplish disparate mission types simultaneously. But above all else, this transformer of a flying machine would need to be able to go from manned to unmanned operations in just a handful of hours. All this is precisely what Firebird was built to do. The Firebird concept actually dates the back to the latter half of the 2000s, with Scaled Composites, Northrop Grumman’s storied subsidiary, eventually building a technology demonstrator. That highly experimental aircraft was a forerunner to the current Northrop Grumman designed Firebird, which is a clean-sheet, production-ready aircraft. Scaled Composites’ Firebird demonstrator first flew in 2010 and proved that an optionally manned, highly flexible surveillance aircraft could not only work, but it could compete for missions with both unmanned and manned platforms at the same time and win on both fronts. Earlier in the decade, the Firebird demonstrator paved the way for the Firebird production aircraft now in testing: The current Firebird’s greatest trick is its ability to transform in the field. It can go from manned to unmanned mode in just four hours. The process of converting the aircraft is remarkably straightforward. A Northrop Grumman official described the process to us in detail, stating: “It’s a Garmin glass cockpit, with a standard three screen display. One of the really interesting things about the way that we designed the cockpit is that the ground station is highly similar. It’s very easy for the pilot to transition from flying in the aircraft to flying it from the ground. It’s also easy to transition from manned to unmanned mode. That is a four hour flop, with very simple mechanical and electronic interfaces. There is only a handful of them and they are very straightforward. The flight test program continues to demonstrate the full capability of the system. We have flown both manned and unmanned now, and are continuing to mature the system, switching between manned and unmanned operations almost daily. We actually flew UAV, did a software update the following day and flew manned with the new software load. Even in the test phase, we’re really reaping the benefits of that flexibility. When we go into the unmanned mode what happens is the canopy comes off, the seats come out, the instrument panel comes out. A B-LOS (Beyond Line Of Sight) dish goes in and a bigger canopy to cover the dish goes in. Again, it’s a very simple interface.” Firebird in UAV/unmanned configuration. , Northrop Grumman Firebird’s ability to rapidly convert from a manned to an unmanned aircraft opens up a whole new universe of flexibility. Just being able to self-deploy an aircraft with MALE capabilities to forward operating locations by having a pilot onboard solves many issues that dog relatively advanced unmanned aircraft till this very day. Unlike its unmanned counterparts, Firebird doesn’t need to be able to be broken down and stuffed in ‘caskets’ before being loaded onto an airlifter and flown to where it is needed—an expensive and logistically complex affair that is outside the budgets of many potential customers that have a need for MALE capabilities. A USAF MQ-9 being prepared for transport., USAF Also, because of its ability to self-deploy, it seems as if Firebird ‘s designers weren’t constrained by the need to be able to ship the aircraft as a kit. As such, it could be optimized to its fullest potential for its intended operating envelope and mission set. What resulted was an elegant but also hardy twin-tail boom, two-seat design—one that can carry a big and diverse payload while leveraging a relatively pedestrian and comparatively ultra-efficient engine. Firebird, which is not a small aircraft, with its big wingspan optimized for long endurance missions, runs on a Lycoming TEO-540 engine . This six-cylinder, turbocharged engine packs about 350hp in stock form and runs on the same 100LL avgas as a Cessna 152. In comparison, the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper/Predator B uses a Honeywell TPE331-10 turboprop engine, pumping out 900hp and slurping down jet fuel in the process. This alone is maybe the best indicator of just how efficient Firebird is, not just when it comes to doing more with less thrust in relation to raw performance, but also when it comes to overall operating cost. The cost difference of operating a light airplane piston engine compared to a turboprop is substantial. Beyond the unique logistical challenges of moving unmanned aircraft over great distances and setting up operations in often unfamiliar areas, the flexibility of being able to fly manned or unmanned mission profiles based on the customer’s mission needs, the operating environment, and even their budget has the potential to be truly revolutionary. The reality is that unmanned aircraft operations—at least the traditional kind where there are people “in the loop” flying the aircraft and operating its sensors via data-link—is not a cheap or simple affair. With man-in-the-loop operating concepts, unmanned aircraft are actually very much manned and quite expensive to operate when you factor in all the support infrastructure that is essential to bringing the capability to life. The fact that a pilot can just jump in Firebird and cut most of that infrastructure out of the cost-equation while still leveraging many of the aircraft’s unique benefits, efficiencies, and capabilities, is huge. The Northrop Grumman official we talked to about Firebird made it clear that price point and flexibility will be the major drivers in making the program a success: “It’s a capability that’s truly new in the space. And what we believe is a really competitive price point that’s going to allow us to provide an ISR capability so more customers can better have access to this level of capability than ever before. The key to how we are doing that is through the system flexibility. This is a system that’s all about flexibility.” Northrop Grumman Sometimes it is just best to have a person in the cockpit for mission-related situational awareness reasons and it can be essential for flying in crowded and highly regulated airspace. You simply don’t have these options with a strictly unmanned aircraft. Also, when it comes to cost and flexibility, Northrop Grumman built Firebird with very austere operating locales in mind. The aircraft has a hardy landing gear and a tough airframe that allows it to be able to operate from semi-prepared fields, something nearly unheard of among the roster of unmanned aircraft with similar capabilities. This also means Firebird can be based closer to the action, potentially cutting down on transit times drastically, and as a result also cost, or operators can use that time saved to enhance on-station time. Payload-wise, Firebird and its open-architecture avionics system is all about moving away from heavily integrated sensors and communications systems and leveraging highly modular components with standard interfaces. As a result, Firebird can be so much to so many people without altering the airframe itself. The Northrop Grumman official described the Firebird’s modularity in detail: “We have a sizable payload bay for an aircraft of this size. It’s 45 cubic feet, fits two 19-inch racks and is really focused on flexibility and multiple payloads for ISR missions. There’s a number of serial and IP interfaces. We’ve demonstrated payload changes in as little as 30 minutes. We’ve demonstrated new payload installations in under a day. We’ve demonstrated over two dozen payloads integrated into this architecture, including EO/IR (Electro-Optical/Infrared), tactical radios, radar, signals and communication payloads, and we’ve also demonstrated operating four payloads simultaneously while imaging different areas. This is truly a multi-int (multiple intelligence) flexible system. We designed it that way because we envision a broad range of payloads that our customers are going to want to bring to do a number of current and emerging missions across the mission space.” Being able to pack radar, EO/IR, signals intelligence, and communications payloads all at the same time offers a big multi-spectral view of wherever Firebird is operating over at the time. The ability to exploit all this intelligence concurrently and in near real-time makes it far more impactful than the sum of its parts. This modularity and flexibility mean that one plane can be a lot of different things for different customers too, potentially resulting in a huge return on investment for Northrop Grumman. Firebird’s potential applications aren’t just military in nature, either. They include commercial , scientific , law enforcement , and other federal agency work , as well. Pushing out over the ocean for maritime surveillance is also a very real possibility for this unique aircraft. The Northrop Grumman official describes this possibility, along with many others: “One of the key differences between an over land and an over sea mission is the payloads you put on the plane. And Firebird is designed for payload flexibility. We have de-ice capability and a weather radar in the plane. So it’s designed for all weather, sometimes that can be a concern over the sea. But when you think about the kinds of ISR needs, it really runs the gamut. From what we view as traditional missions to an emerging need for law enforcement, forest service, environmental missions, scientific ISR and, climate change. Even commercial ISR is becoming a growing market, with oil and gas, pipeline monitoring, and disaster zone monitoring. We’re really thinking about this as a product line because we’re thinking about the broad range of markets that we can touch in that way. Because it’s such a big market, we’re looking to build an ecosystem of industry partners to help us get access to the enormous amount of global markets this platform is going to be relevant in.” There are indicators that Northrop Grumman is going to bridge Firebird’s mission flexibility with business model flexibility that will provide potential customers a menu of options for accessing the aircraft and modular payload components to fly on it. Selling aircraft outright in a traditional sense is still an option, but being able to lease the aircraft on multiple levels could also be highly attractive for less cash-rich customers or for those who just are not in need of large enough ISR capacity that would necessitate standing up a dedicated fleet of aircraft. Even providing fixed per-hour contracts with various payload configurations factored in could provide some customers with economic certainty not offered by other business arrangements. This sort of deal structure is becoming increasingly popular for other aerial contractor air services that have been traditionally furnished by organically owned and operated fleets of aircraft. Even chartering the aircraft’s services for short periods of time, like for scientific surveys or specific law enforcement operations, would allow Firebird to bring a higher-end ISR capability to far more customers than what the more inelastic unmanned MALE market offers currently. The so-called ‘ecosystem’ that could be intrinsic to making Firebird a big success will include multiple partners that extend outside of the aircraft and its payload systems. Tenax Aerospace , a company which offers many types of aerospace services to U.S. government agencies, including VVIP airlift and contracted ISR aircraft, is currently exploring how to team up with Northrop Grumman on the Firebird product line to bring its services to customers that aren’t currently serviced by such high-end ISR platform capabilities. Other external players will likely emerge in the coming months as the aircraft continues to prove its chops in flight testing as well. As for Firebird’s aforementioned flight testing, it is proceeding at a quick pace with two aircraft now in the test program . According to our sources, the aircraft is already exceeding many of its design goals, but it’s still early on in the testing process. If everything goes as planned, the aircraft will be in a totally different developmental position by the latter half of 2019, at which time we may get some official performance metrics from Northrop Grumman. You can see detailed images of Firebird heading out on a test flight in this previous article of ours . Before the current Firebird program really spun up, we know what the Firebird demonstrator was capable of and what Northrop Grumman had in mind for Firebird’s performance. You can read all about that in this past article of ours , but generally speaking, the aircraft was supposedly envisioned to be able to fly at around 30,000-35,000 feet and at around 200 knots during normal surveillance missions. As for unmanned endurance, the Firebird demonstrator could fly for a whopping 40 hours, so one would imagine between 24 and 40 hours for this new model depending on the exact configuration. If these figures prove accurate, the current Firebird could possess performance capabilities in excess of the MQ-9 Reaper/Predator B in some respects, and potentially at a far smaller operating cost. By now, you are probably asking yourself “can this multi-intelligence platform also attack the targets it spots?” At this point, it seems as if the program is exclusively focused on squeezing the most non-kinetic capability out of the aircraft as possible, but it is equipped with a pair of underwing hardpoints. They were supposedly designed into Firebird to carry extra sensors and equipment. The payload bay could also potentially be modified to carry small and micro-sized munitions . This aircraft’s possible latent attack capability leads one to imagine how a Firebird could be a very powerful hunter-killer with a few precision guided glide-bombs at its disposal. Once again, this is all conjecture and the program has a long ways to go before such a capability could even be experimented with in the first place. It would be hard to imagine that an optionally manned, clean sheet design aircraft with MALE capabilities couldn’t find a place in the ever-expanding aerial surveillance marketplace, especially as new technologies, like Wide Area Aerial Surveillance , migrate from the battlefield to the homefront . But developing a new aircraft that is ready for widely deployed operations in some very rough neighborhoods around the globe is not a cheap affair and a company can lose countless millions if customers don’t materialize for whatever reason. In Firebird’s case, this doesn’t appear to be a problem. According to the Northrop Grumman official, the aircraft already has customers, including the biggest one of them all: “We’re on contract with multiple U.S. government customers to provide this capability… But, really we’re viewing this as a capability launch that’s going to meet a bunch of needs. And we’re in conversations that are too premature for me to share at this point with a number of customers across the traditional, nontraditional slate, so more to come on that.” Northrop Grumman With all this in mind, Firebird seems so logical that it is outright puzzling why something very similar hasn’t been brought to market on a large scale before. In just the last ten years, open architecture avionics and ISR payloads have miniaturized and become far more modular in nature, adding to the feasibility of a truly flexible concept like this. And other optionally manned aircraft do exist, but most of them are based on existing general aviation aircraft . None of them are clean-sheet designs that also have a giant prime aerospace-defense contractor like Northrop Grumman behind them. That could change now that Firebird is creeping out of the shadows, though. While Scaled Composites has a long pedigree of making the impossible possible when it comes to aircraft design, Northrop Grumman has the financial horsepower, brain trust, system integration experience, and industry relationships to really turn what is still an experimental idea into an operational moneymaker that has a global customer base. And that is clearly the big opportunity here, as the Northrop Grumman Official we talked to made abundantly clear: “This is something the world needs, has needed, and will need increasingly in the future. I think we’re going to collectively have to teach the world how to think a little bit differently. This is a system that’s going to do missions that today are performed by unmanned aircraft and manned aircraft. There’s going to be a growing need, we believe, for this kind of flexibility. So you are going to see a play in both of those market spaces.” It’s true that when it comes to sales of any product, educating the customer is one the hardest and most expensive things to do, but considering the potential this aircraft brings to the table in what is likely to be a very affordable overall package with the right team behind it, the apple might be just too sweet for customers not to take a nibble. And because Northrop Grumman is looking at offering this aircraft’s services under a variety of structures, patrons could probably give it a good test before plunking down larger sums of money for more capacity or even their very own Firebird fleets. That in itself is a great business strategy for an innovative concept like this that could find some resistance from traditional big spenders in the space that are totally unaccustomed to the optionally manned concept. Whereas buying a fleet of aircraft is a massive commitment of resources that can last many decades, contracting a couple airplanes in a turn-key fashion for a finite period of time to do a specific set of missions is a far more affordable and lower-risk proposition. So there you have it, the Firebird is rising from the ashes of its demonstrator predecessor like a phoenix in a major way and Northrop Grumman is betting that this aircraft and its many plug-and-play sub-systems have the potential to be the next big thing in airborne intelligence collection. If they can deliver on the concept as it is currently envisioned, it’s probably safe to assume their calculated gamble will have been well worth the risk.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 21, 2018",A USAF C-17 Flew A Secretive Mission Into Yemen To Rescue Wounded Emirati Troops In 2017,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In 2017, a C-17A Globemaster III airlifter landed in Yemen in order to collect six wounded members of the United Arab Emirates’ military and deliver them to safety. As Congress continues to debate whether or not to keep supporting the Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, this mission is a good reminder that U.S. military will almost certainly remain engaged in its own murky operations against Al Qaeda- and ISIS-affiliated groups in the country regardless. The Air Force Association revealed the existence of the aeromedical evacuation mission, which a crew from the 62nd Airlift Wing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State had carried out, during its main annual conference and exhibition in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 17, 2018. U.S. Air Force Captain James Jenson accepted the 2018 Lieutenant General William H. Tunner Crew Award for most outstanding strategic airlift crew in the Air Force on behalf of himself and the rest of his crew, referred to by their callsign during the mission, Reach 865. “The crew of Reach 865 executed an aeromedical evacuation of six Emirati soldiers from Yemen,” the announcer explained during the presentation. “They overcame a denial of air traffic services and degraded communications, deconflicted themselves from other American assets, and mitigated rapidly changing patient status to safely deliver the patients.” We don’t know the exact date of the operation took place or where the C-17 landed in Yemen, how dangerous that location might have been, and where it subsequently delivered the wounded Emirati troops. U.S. Central Command confirmed the mission had occurred, but was unable to say whether or not any other aeromedical evacuations or Emirati or other U.S. partner forces in Yemen had occurred before that. A C-17A Globemaster III from the 62nd Airlift Wing touches down at the Selah Airstrip within the Yakima Training Center in Washington State during an exercise., USAF There was also no indication that the CENTCOM public affairs office was aware of this particular mission at all before we inquired about it. At the time of writing, we have not received any response from Joint Base Lewis-McChord or the 62nd Airlift Wing regarding our queries about this mission. Aeromedical evacuations are not unusual for C-17s and their crews, though. The U.S. Air Force has even developed a full surgical suite , called the Tactical Critical Care Evacuation Team-Enhanced (TCCET-E), which is designed to fit inside the aircraft so medical personnel can perform life-saving operations in flight. The inside of a C-17 configured for aeromedical evacuations., USAF “During operations U.S. forces provided the Emiratis with intelligence support; airborne ISR; advice and assistance with operational planning; maritime interdiction and security operations; medical support; and aerial refueling,” a CENTCOM public affairs officer told The War Zon e in an Email in September 2018. “However, due to security and force protection considerations, we will not discuss specifics regarding this operation.” The Email did note that, at that time, the U.S. military did not have any standing aeromedical or casualty evacuation assets in place that were dedicated to supporting any operations in Yemen. However, in May 2018, U.S. Transportation Command had announced that it was looking to hire contractors to operate fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters and provide casualty evacuation and personnel recovery services at any of 10 different sites inside the country. A map showing 10 seperate locations in Yemen, as well as other sites in neighboring countries. The ones within Yemen encompass what the U.S. military calls the Yemen Joint Special Operations Area. In May 2018, U.S. Transportation Command expressed an interest in hiring contractors to provide casualty evacuation and personnel recovery services within range of these locations. , Google Maps/The War Zone “Please note, this was in support of counterterrorism operations, not the Saudi-led Coalition in their fight against the Houthis,” the CENTCOM public affairs officer stressed in their Email. “DoD [the Department of Defense] provides non-combat advisory support, refueling support to Coalition aircraft and intelligence support to assist Saudi Arabia in preventing cross-border attacks.” This is a critical distinction. The U.S. government has been under increasing pressure from within to end the latter support to the Saudi-led coalition in the face of a still growing humanitarian disaster in Yemen, brought on in no small part by often indiscriminate Saudi airstrikes , as well as Houthi intransigence . On top of that, U.S.-Saudi relations are at an all-time low after the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi , a Saudi-born journalist and sometimes critic of the ruling monarchy in Riyadh, who had been living in self-imposed exile in Turkey, in October 2018. The U.S. government has been providing various types of support to the Saudis and their allies in Yemen since 2015, but Congress has never officially approved any of it. A recent report from The Atlantic , found that U.S. taxpayers had actually been footing the bill for mid-air refueling for Saudi and Emirati jets flying missions against the Houthis specifically. Today, the Pentagon has still not formalized an agreement requiring those countries to pay for the tanker services, despite a clear legal requirement to do so. In September 2017, The Intercept had already revealed that the U.S. military was not accurately tracking when and how much it was fueling Saudi and Emirati aircraft at all. Earlier in November 2018, the Pentagon announced it would no longer refuel Saudi-led coalition aircraft at all, officially at the request of officials in Riyadh. A US Air Force KC-135R tanker refuels a United Arab Emirates F-16E Desert Falcon fighter jet during operations against ISIS in Iraq in 2016., USAF On Dec. 13, 2018, the U.S. Senate voted to pass a resolution invoking the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and calling for an end to all U.S. support for the Saudis and their allies in Yemen engaged in fighting the Houthis. That same day, they passed another non-binding resolution rebuking the Saudi government over Khashoggi’s murder and directly accusing Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman of ordering the hit. Better known as MbS, the Crown Prince is widely seen as the real leader of Saudi Arabia as his father, King Salman bin Abulaziz, becomes increasingly old and frail . The War Powers measure is unlikely to have any practical impact immediately since the U.S. House of Representatives has already rejected it. When the Democratic Party takes control in the House in January 2019, they will almost certainly revisit it, though. It is still a strong statement from legislators, including some Republicans, to President Donald Trump’s Administration, which has very publicly advocated for continuing to support the Saudis in Yemen. The U.S. government has also been highly supportive of the ongoing political process to end Yemen’s civil war, which that has seen more momentum recently with direct talks starting between the rebels and the country’s Saudi-backed, internationally recognized government in Sweden on Dec. 12, 2018. It is worth noting, when it comes to supporting the Saudi-led coalition’s operations, the Trump Administration has simply been continuing a policy that President Barack Obama put into place. It’s also important to understand that the resolutions that the Senate passed and the House voted down both included carve-outs for U.S. operations in and around Yemen that are otherwise approved under other legislation. In its September 2018 Email, CENTCOM would not say what specific operation the 62nd’s aeromedical flight had been in support of, but we do know that U.S. forces were actively working with UAE personnel in 2017 to loosen Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula’s ( AQAP ) grasp on Yemen’s central Shabwah Governorate. “We have been working there with airstrikes as necessary and the authority to do ground operations where necessary,” U.S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told The Washington Examiner in August 2017. At the same time, U.S. special operations forces were taking part in an operation known as Yukon Sceptre. While we don’t know the exact details about that operation, the so-called “first word” “Yukon” in operational nicknames is almost exclusively linked to activities in Yemen. Sometime prior to 2017, there had been another counter-terrorism operation in Yemen known as Yukon Viking . A slide from a 2017 briefing by the heads of the US Navy’s Bataan Amphibious Ready Group and the US Marine Corps’ 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit covering their activities that year. This included support for US special operations forces engaged in “Op Yukon Spectre” and “Shabwah Offensive.” , USN/USMC In February 2018, the U.S. military began Yukon Journey, which the Pentagon only publicly acknowledged in November 2018. Yahoo News later confirmed this was indeed a new American operation in the country. However, this specifically referred to American support for the Saudi-led coalition’s fight against the Houthis. It is possible that Yukon Sceptre referred to the separate fight against AQAP- and ISIS-affiliated groups in the country, which the U.S. government understands to be authorized under the 2001 Authorization For Use of Military Force, or AUMF , which Congress passed into law after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. If all these different operations, with unclear timelines and objectives, seem confusing and murky, that’s because they are. A list of operations and other activities within US Central Command, which Yahoo News was first to report. Yukon Journey, misspelled “Youkon Journey” is at the bottom. the US mission to counter AQAP in Yemen is listed without a nickname at the top., DOD It’s also difficult to say for sure where the U.S. counter-terrorism operation ends and the Saudi-led coalition fight against the Houthis begins. For example, there’s no indication the U.S. knew or knows now whether Emirati aircraft it was refueling as part of aid to the Saudi-led coalition went on to strike Houthi or AQAP targets. Further underscoring the complexities of the situation in Yemen, in their fight against the Houthis, the Saudis have decided to embrace other Islamist groups they had previously opposed and accused of having links to AQAP and the Muslim Brotherhood . This most notably includes the Yemeni political party Al Islah . At the same time, the Saudi’s ostensible ally the UAE continued to target Al Islah members until December 2017, going so far as to reportedly hire an American-based hit squad to murder them. It remains unclear still whether the Emiratis conducted those activities under the guise of the fight against the Houthis, their U.S.-backed mission against AQAP and ISIS, or as part of a third front they pursued entirely independently. The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, second from the left, meets with members of Yemen’s Al Islah during a meeting organized by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, to his right, in December 2017., Saudi Press Agency As such, no matter what support the U.S. military does or does not render to the Saudi-led coalition, there remains a significant risk that American personnel in Yemen will find it difficult to segregate their operations from those of other countries fighting the Houthis. A good example of this was when Houthi forces shot down a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper in 2017 . We don’t know what operation this drone was supporting and, for all practical purposes, it doesn’t matter. Had the Houthis seen the 62nd’s C-17 on its aeromedical mission, there’s no reason to imagine they might not have decided to engage it, too, thinking that it might have been delivering personnel or equipment to the Saudi-led coalition. The U.S. military’s designated “Yemen Joint Special Operations Area” spans the entire country . In addition, the UAE itself operates its own C-17s, further increasing the likelihood that the rebels would seek to shoot it down. All told, even if Congress succeeds in ending U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, which looks increasingly likely, there is absolutely no indication that this will bring an end to American operations in Yemen. It would not automatically end support for members of that coalition, primarily the UAE, ostensibly fighting AQAP and ISIS, either. There have been far fewer calls for more public oversight of these other American military activities in Yemen, as evidenced by the aeromedical mission in 2017 that apparently went unnoticed even by certain elements of the U.S. military itself. Congress has shown little stomach for repealing or amending the 2001 AUMF, despite some recent attempts to do so. Unless more dramatic changes in U.S. foreign policy occur, the U.S. military looks set to be involved in Yemen for years to come. Without clarity as to the full scope of its activities there, the United States’ activities in the country will similarly remain as controversial as ever.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 4, 2019",Commandos Ride Black Hawk Helo And Stealth Boats During Shadowy Exercise In Miami Port,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, a reader of The War Zone happened to look outside their office overlooking the Port of Miami and see what appears to have been an interesting inter-agency training exercise. Unlike some drills that have occurred in and around major U.S. metropolitan areas , this one, which included a UH-60M Black Hawk very similar to one that appeared over Chicago this past September and specialized stealth boats , seems to have gone largely unnoticed. Owen from Miami has been nice enough to share with us the pictures he was able to take of the activity he could see, as well as a timeline of events. At around 9:30 AM, he first noticed what was going on at a portion of the Port of Miami that the non-profit Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) owns and operates from. The drill appeared to wrap up some time after 3:00 PM. Initially, there was a green painted UH-60M Black Hawk sitting on the dock together with a black-and-gold Bell Model 407 helicopter . Tied up together in the water alongside were four rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) and four other, larger watercraft. More than 20 uniformed military or law enforcement personnel were also present. The scene at a dock at the Port of Maimi that Omen from Miami saw when he initially looked out his office window., Owen from Miami Despite its coloring, often associated with the U.S. Army, the Black Hawk does not appear to be a military helicopter. It lacks the titles and other markings that Army UH-60s have and has a distinctly different antenna arrangement. As we mentioned earlier in this post, a similarly configured helicopter took part in a separate training exercise in Chicago on Sept. 26, 2018, which most likely belonged to an element within the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG). CIRG includes a variety of elite, specialized FBI units, including the famed Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), the U.S. government’s top national law enforcement counter-terrorism force. The Department of Justice has been publicly acquiring UH-60Ms for the FBI via the Army since 2009. It is not clear who the boats belong to, but the larger ones are similar, if not identical to the U.S. Navy’s Combatant Craft Assault (CCA) Mk. 1. Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCC) assigned to three Special Boat Teams operate these and other custom boats in support of the Navy SEALs. These boats have also been seen on the super secretive special operations mothership M/V Ocean Trader . You can read more about the 41-foot long CCAs here . The CCAs have a distinct and purpose-built stealthy design that allows them to sneak close to shore to deploy and recover special operators. It also gives them the ability to approach other, larger ships discreetly so teams can board them, especially under the cover of darkness, leveraging the element of surprise. This is a valuable capability to have and helps enable raids on potential smuggling vessels or rescuing hostages from pirates and terrorists . They can also execute more general littoral patrol duties. US Navy CCAs lead a formation of RHIBs while US and Jordanian helicopters fly overhead during an iteration of the annual Exercise Eager Lion in Jordan, DOD It’s not clear from the pictures that Owen was able to take whether these are CCA Mk. 1s or a very similar design. The examples in the Port of Maimi have the notable low-observable rear-mounted mast, which has a small surface search radar and other sensors. However, they appear to have a slightly different style of windscreen and protective panels around the main crew area in the center. The Navy has been working on a CCA Mk. 2 and may have some of these improved boats in service already. At the same time, any apparent differences could also just be an illusion as a result of the angle and distance at which he took the pictures. A short of one of the stealthy boats showing what appears to be a slightly different mold line from the Navy’s CCA Mk. 1s., Owen from Miami Whatever their exact configuration and whoever was operating them, the stealth boats might help explain what Owen saw from his office window. He told us that shortly after the boats had left the dock and headed out to sea, The Florida Explorer , one of MRSC’s Responder -class Oil Spill Response Vessels (OSRV), also left the port. At that time, Florida Explorer ‘s civilian crew, with their orange hard hats, were the only ones visible on deck. While the boats were out, the Black Hawk came and went a total of three times. The first time it left, personnel on the dock had loaded up what appeared to be a particularly heavy piece of gear that took two of them to carry. The second time the helicopter was only on the ground briefly. On its final trip, it returned to the Port of Miami along with Florida Explorer. Owen from Miami Owen from Miami Owen from Miami Owen from Miami When the OSRV docked again, its orange hardhat wearing crew and uniformed personnel disembarked. The uninformed individuals got into two pickup trucks and a sport utility vehicle (SUV) and left. The small boats never came back. A very plausible scenario is that the Florida Explorer acted as a target and its crew was masquerading as either smugglers, pirates, terrorists, hostages, or some mix thereof. Personnel on board the UH-60M and the boats would have practiced intercepting and boarding the vessel from the air and the sea. The U.S. government routinely charters privately operated ships to support training activities, either as platforms to operate from or as simulated objectives. Uniformed personnel walk by an SUV on the dock., Owen from Miami Personnel leave the Florida Explorer after the apparent conclusion of the drill. A member of the crew is visible wearing an orange hardhat. Other individuals appear to be from the uniformed force., Owen from Miami For instance, every year, Tampa, Florida hosts the National Defense Industry Association’s Special Operations Forces Industry Conference, or SOFIC, which includes a demonstration by U.S. and foreign special operators. This often includes some sort of maritime component , with commandos sometimes seizing control of a “captured” boat. FBI SWAT Team members from the Tampa Field Office joined SEALs, SWCCs, and other military special operators during the most recent iteration of this event, which occurred in May 2018 . The FBI’s HRT, and other specialized units within CIRG, routinely train together with elite U.S. special operations forces, including the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , in general, too, especially during realistic exercises in domestic urban areas . In addition, both the FBI’s CIRG and the U.S. military, including U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), are actively involved in port security and otherwise securing America’s maritime borders . For example, U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) leads an annual, regional inter-agency counter-terrorism exercise known as Vital Archer. The 2015 iteration of that drill reportedly involved a simulated radiological or nuclear attack in or around Northumberland, Canada, which sits on Lake Ontario. A member of the FBI’s Tampa Field Office’s SWAT Team takes part in the special operations demonstration during SOFIC 2018. , USAF In August 2017, we at The War Zone also investigated a still largely unexplained training exercise involving a super-secretive U.S. Air Force CN-235 surveillance aircraft flying near Seattle . One of our working theories was, and remains, that the drill including watching for simulated threats at the city’s sea and airport facilities. The requirement for this kind of realistic training is obvious. Personnel rappelling on a fixed spot on land or climbing ropes and ladders onto a “ship” on land cannot ever truly represent what it’s like to board a ship sailing in the open ocean. Just like joint training within the U.S. military, interagency training is also an especially valuable opportunity for different units and organizations with different standard operating procedures to practice working together in a simulated real-world scenario. It provides a chance for these groups to share lessons learned and best practices, too. So, if you live or work near a port, you might want to keep an eye out like Owen did and possibly catch elite law enforcement and military units practicing these operations yourself.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says a pair of its Tu-160 Blackjacks flew a 10-hour patrol over the Caribbean Sea from a base in Venezuela. The Kremlin had recently sent the strategic bombers, along with other aircraft and supporting personnel, to the Latin American country, which is in the grips of a protracted political and economic crisis . The deployment also came in the wake of renewed criticism of Russia’s intervention in Ukraine following a skirmish in the Kerch Strait in November 2018. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced that the sorties over the Caribbean had taken place on Dec. 12, 2018. Venezuelan Air Force F-16A/B Viper and Su-30MKV Flanker-C fighter jets also flew with the bombers during certain points of the mission, according to Russia. The two Tu-160s, along with an An-124 cargo plane and an Il-62 passenger transport, touched down at Maiquetía “Simón Bolívar” International Airport in Venezuela’s capital Caracas, which also serves as a military airbase, on Dec. 10, 2018. “During the international visit of the Aerospace Defense Forces’ delegation to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, pilots of strategic bombers Tu-160 conducted a flight in the airspace over the Caribbean Sea.

The Latin American nation has been dealing with political and economic upheaval for years now, which has led to extreme shortages of food, medicine, and other basic necessities. “Russia’s government has sent bombers halfway around the world to Venezuela,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Tweeted out on Dec. 10, 2018. “The Russian and Venezuelan people should see this for what it is: two corrupt governments squandering public funds, and squelching liberty and freedom while their people suffer.” #ВКС #Venezuela Ночные полеты Ту-160 в Венесуэле.

Blackjacks first traveled to the country in September 2008 , in what appeared to be a response to international criticism over its brief war with Georgia the month before. In October 2013 , the bombers returned, in what seemed like a show of support for the Venezuelan government after the death of long-time anti-American populist firebrand and increasingly repressive President Hugo Chavez . Maduro, then Vice President, had succeeded him. A Venezuelan Air Force Su-30MKV Flanker-C fighter jet., André Austin Du-Pont Rocha via Wikimedia During that deployment, the Tu-160s touched off a minor international incident as they made their way from Venezuela to Nicaragua, another long-time Russian partner, for a brief visit. The bombers did not have the appropriate clearance to fly through Colombian airspace on the way and Colombian Air Force IAI Kfir fighter jets eventually scrambled to intercept and escort them out. This new deployment appears to be another signal from both Russia and Venezuela to the United States and its allies to stay out of Venezuelan affairs. There have been a number of reports that U.S. President Donald Trump has been personally supportive of a military intervention in the country to unseat Maduro, who has increasingly clamped down on political dissent and consolidated his own power in recent years. Certain members of Congress have implicitly voiced support for a military coup to bring down the government. The world would support the Armed Forces in #Venezuela if they decide to protect the people & restore democracy by removing a dictator — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 9, 2018 This, in turn, has given new ammunition to Maduro, who already routinely accuses the United States and its allies, especially the Colombians, of seeking to undermine and overthrow his regime. In August 2018, he survived an assassination attempt involving drones loaded with explosives, which he promptly blamed on foreign operatives. There is no evidence to support a direct link between that incident and the U.S. or other foreign government authorities. At the same time, the Russian bombers may also be visiting Venezuela in order to give Russian President Vladimir Putin his own means of needling the United States in its own hemisphere in response to U.S. government criticism over a recent incident in Ukraine. On Nov. 25, 2018, Russian and Ukrainian forces engaged in a violent skirmish in the Kerch Strait , which separates the Black Sea from the Sea of Azov. Russian state and quasi-state media have been hyping up the deployment of the Tu-160s to Venezuela and outlets have conducted the usual to-close-for-comfort-style reporting that is popular in the country and among many former Soviet republics , as seen below. There was widespread international condemnation of Russia over the incident, which appeared to be an unprovoked attack on Ukraine’s ships sailing in international waters and past Russian territory in accordance with international and bilateral agreements. The U.S. government, as well as NATO, subsequently pledged their full support to for the Ukrainian government. Under President Donald Trump, the United States has stepped up deliveries of weapons and other military equipment to Ukraine, as well as continuing on-the-ground training activities , to the ire of the Kremlin. Since it illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and subsequently began actively supporting a pair of breakaway regions within Ukraine, Russia has looked to expand its military and intelligence activities, including reported covert attacks on American diplomatic personnel, in the Western Hemisphere in response to American criticism and economic sanctions. In addition to increasing ties with Venezuela and other friendly governments in Latin American, the Kremlin has looked to reboot more permeant operations at Soviet-era facilities in Cuba . Whatever the case, the Russian bombers’ visit to Venezuela looks set to be brief. “We have spoken with representatives of Russia and have been informed that their military aircraft, which landed in Venezuela, will be leaving on Friday [Dec. 14, 2018] and going back to Russia,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told Reuters in an Email on Dec. 12, 2018. A member of the Russian contingent, at right, gives a Venezuelan officer a Tu-160 model after arriving in the country on Dec. 10, 2018., Russian MoD It’s not at all clear if the Russians could afford the expenses of a more protracted, semi-permanent deployment of bombers or other combat aircraft to the region, or that the Venezuelan Air Force has the necessary infrastructure to support such a presence anyway. Russia only has 16 operational Blackjacks, to begin with, though it claims it is planning to more than double the size of the fleet in the future. The Kremlin could look to deploy Tu-95 Bear bombers, which are also nuclear capable, or the related Tu-142 long-range maritime patrol aircraft, assets that it has in far greater numbers than the Tu-160, to Venezuela on a semi-permanent basis. Smaller maritime patrol or other combat aircraft might also be options. Any Russian bombers or similarly long-range aircraft in the region conducting regular flights in the Caribbean would be something of a thorn in the side of the U.S. government. It’s, of course, worth noting that the U.S. military routinely flies along the edge of Russia’s airspace, especially in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea regions , and the Kremlin has long been eager to do the same to the United States more broadly. At present, Russian planes generally only conduct similar flights near Alaska . Regardless, the deployment does show that Russia remains intent on proving it continues to be capable of worldwide military operations and that it is willing and able, at least to some degree, to come to the aid of its international partners. It also reflects an eagerness to challenge the United States in its own proverbial backyard, something that the Kremlin has already been doing through a significant uptick in submarine activity in the North Atlantic Ocean, in particular. With U.S.-Russian relations persistently chilly and no clear end in sight for the crisis in Venezuela, we may see the Kremlin look to step up military engagements with its Venezuela counterparts, which could include more deployments of bombers or other combat aircraft, naval vessels , and more.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two days after a huge cloud of chaff lit up weather radar covering portions Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky, as well as social media, more plumes have now appeared over Maine and Florida. We have no official confirmation as of yet, but the formations look very similar in composition to the one that developed in the Midwest . The first reports of the apparent chaff plumes in Maine began to appear on social media around 5:30 PM EST on Dec. 12, 2018. Early on, four distinct clouds were visible, but these had blended together into a larger blob with a peak length of more than 100 miles by 7:45 PM. The huge cloud was moving southwest and looked like it could easily drift into New Hampshire and beyond. It’s unclear exactly when on Dec. 12, 2018 that the incident in Florida occurred. The plume developed over the Florida Keys and appeared to move northward.

The official Twitter account for the National Weather Service station between Gray and Portland, Maine issued an assessment that the formations in that area on the radar were very likely chaff, but there have been no reports as to what type of aircraft might have been involved. Definitely looks like chaff. High reflectivity, low CC, and high ZDR are pretty typical of chaff. — NWS Gray (@NWSGray) December 12, 2018 The Maine Air National Guard has just one flying unit, the 101st Air Refueling Wing , which flies KC-135R Stratotankers and is based at Bangor Air National Guard Base in the city of the same name, situated to the northeast of where the plumes first developed. However, the KC-135Rs are not equipped to dispense chaff. As such, another type of aircraft from another state’s Air National Guard, or an active U.S. military unit, released the chaff over Maine. This was the case in with the chaff cloud that first appeared over Illinois on Dec. 10, 2018, and later drifted into Indiana and Kentucky. As it turned out, a West Virginia Air National Guard C-130H Hercules airlifter flying through the area was responsible . In that case, the initial release was over a Military Operations Area (MOA), a piece of airspace U.S. military aircraft can set aside for training purposes. This appears to have been the case again in Maine, with the chaff seeming to develop first over the Condor 1 and 2 MOAs. A map showing the Condor 1 and 2 MOAs, the trapezoidal areas outlined in red, in Maine., via SkyVector.com Southern Florida and the Florida Keys are full of various active and reserve component units that conduct regular training exercises in the area, so plumes in this region are not particularly uncommon. The Gulf of Mexico is also a massive playground for military combat aircraft to conduct air training events and has some of the biggest MOAs anywhere in the country. Another set of chaff clouds were recently visible in the same general area on Nov. 28, 2018, as seen below. More chaff releases today! Really impressive presentation with strong mid-level westerlies.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 17, 2019",A West Virginia Air Guard C-130H Was Responsible For Massive Chaff Cloud Over Midwest,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A search for more information about a massive cloud of chaff that recently appeared over southern Illinois before drifting into Indiana and Kentucky has led The War Zone to speak with Air National Guard public affairs officers across four states, as well as the National Guard Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C. We can now confirm that a C-130H Hercules from the West Virginia Air National Guard was behind the mysterious incident. On Dec. 10, 2018, the C-130H from West Virginia’s 130th Airlift Wing was returning to its home station at McLaughlin Air National Guard Base in Charleston after taking part in a training exercise at an unspecified location on the “West Coast,” according to Captain Holli Nelson of the West Virginia Air National Guard. The plane needed to dump the excess chaff in its countermeasures dispensers before landing as a safety precaution. We don’t know what drill the Hercules had participated in, but it may have been coming back from a recent Joint Forcible Entry Exercise (JFEX). This is a regularly scheduled large force employment exercise that brings dozens of airlifters and other aircraft together over the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) in support of the  U.S. Air Force Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base. Regardless, as it passed over the Red Hills Military Operations Area (MOA), the crew requested and received permission from air traffic controllers at Indianapolis Center to drop the chaff. MOAs are specially designated pieces of airspace across the United States that U.S. military units can activate in order to conduct training and other activities. Even within MOAs, the Federal Aviation Administration does put restrictions on the use of chaff because of the potential, albeit relatively low risk that it could interfere with civil and commercial air traffic control and weather radars. There is no indication that the countermeasures the C-130 released over Red Hills interfered in any way with other aviation activities in the region. The Hercules itself continued on to McLaughlin without incident. A map showing the boundaries of the Red Hills Military Operations Area., via Skyvector.com At the time of writing, the West Virginia Air National Guard had not yet been able to confirm exactly how many chaff cartridges the C-130H employed in total. C-130 types carry multiple countermeasures dispensers, depending on their exact configuration, each of which can hold dozens of individual cartridges. On an actual operation, the aircraft can carry a mix of flares and chaff in order to best defend against infrared-homing and radar-seeking missiles depending on the expected threats. The large-scale release could help explain why the resulting plume was so dense and long and maybe why it persisted for more than 10 hours. Specific weather conditions would have also been necessary to keep the material airborne as it floated into Indiana and Kentucky. We also don’t know exactly why the plane needed to jettison the chaff. There may not have been a de-arm crew available for when the C-130 was scheduled to arrive at McLaughlin or there might have been an indication of a technical fault in the countermeasures system. In addition, releasing it at 10,000 feet, well below the C-130’s cruising altitude also seems odd. Maybe the crew descended to a lower altitude for the operation in hopes the chaff would make it to the ground faster. Countermeasures dispensers on a U.S. Air Force C-130 aircraft., USAF It’s also unclear clear why the crew chose Red Hills as the drop site, either, if the C-130 was traveling all the way from the western United States.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 22, 2018",USAF Command Behind Light Attack Aircraft Program Now Says It May Never Fly Those Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s Air Combat Command, or ACC, the command that was responsible for the service’s most recent light attack aircraft experiment , now says it might not ever take delivery of any of those aircraft. Depending on how many planes the Air Force decides to ask for in the next budget, and ultimately receives funding for, they might all go to Air Force Special Operations Command, or AFSOC, in the end. U.S. Air Force Major General Scott Pleus, ACC’s Director of Plans, Programs, and Requirements offered the status update on what is now known as the Light Attack Aircraft (LAA) program at the Military Flight Training USA 2018 conference on Dec. 7, 2018. The command halted the second round of tests and evaluations of two aircraft, SNC and Embraer’s A-29 Super Tucano and Textron’s AT-6C Wolverine , after a deadly accident in June 2018, saying it had all the information it needed to move into the full LAA program. The Air Force expects to release its final request for proposals by the end of 2019, after which it plans to select a single winning aircraft to purchase. ACC will have “very little play” in that process and the LAA program as a whole if the Air Force opts to purchase less than 100 aircraft, with AFSOC taking the project’s reins, according to Pleus. AFSOC would primarily use the LAAs for combat operations in low-end conflicts, the Major General said. That command is also responsible for training and advising U.S. allies and partners, some of which operate the A-29 and other light attack aircraft already. The Air Force has repeatedly noted that having a fleet of its own light attack planes could help support those activities, whether conventional or special operations units fly them. An Afghan Air Force pilot walks out to a US-supplied A-29 Super Tucano ahead of a mission., USAF ACC would become more involved in the LAA program if the Air Force were to proceed with a larger buy, closer to 300 aircraft, Pleus explained. This is the total number the Senate Armed Services Committee, then led by the late Senator John McCain , argued for in a 2017 White Paper . The Air Force has since said it might purchase as few as 20 light attack aircraft in the end. In that case, ACC might propose basing aircraft at certain locations in the United States and forward deploying other units to sites in Europe and Asia, from where they could more rapidly move into a potential conflict zone. Pleus also outlined a deployment model where the aircraft would remain in theater throughout an operation, with pilots and ground crews rotating through assignments to operate the light attack planes. At present, the Air Force typically rotates units and their aircraft through deployments. It’s not unreasonable for the Air Force to base its decision about how many light attack aircraft to buy and where assign them based on the total fleet size in principle. Still, this latest development only re-raises various questions about how the service has proceeded with the LAA program. A pair of AT-6C Wolverines., Textron AFSOC, which has its own complimentary light attack aircraft project in progress, has always stood out as one of the most likely operators of any future light attack aircraft within the Air Force. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) as a whole has long been interested in the possibility of acquiring this type of aircraft to provide cost-effective, organic air support during lower-risk operations in remote and austere locations. In 2008, the U.S. Navy leased a single Super Tucano to support the SEALs and other special operations forces as part of a project known as Imminent Fury . This evolved into a SOCOM-led program, with Air Force and Navy involvement, called Combat Dragon II , which saw the deployment of a pair of heavily modified OV-10G+ Broncos to Iraq for an actual combat trial in 2015. These experiments already proved the value of the light attack aircraft for supporting special operations elements. If AFSOC ends up being the sole operator within the Air Force for the type, it calls into question why it was necessary for ACC to conduct its own months-long evaluations of planes it may have had little intention of flying in the first place. One of two modified OV-10G+ Broncos that went to Iraq in 2015., Nick Thomas Of course, we at The War Zone have repeatedly questioned how the Air Force as a whole could still need more information about light attack aircraft to inform its procurement and employment decisions with the wealth of previous experience just within the service itself. ACC was directly involved in Combat Dragon II. On top of that, for more than four years, its own 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force base has flown A-29s to help train foreign operators. Still, the idea of buying light attack aircraft for both the Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps has enjoyed congressional support in recent years. Lawmakers have repeatedly included millions for purchasing this category of aircraft into defense budgets despite the lack of a formal procurement plan from any service. Legislators have been generally supportive of the plan given the benefits light attack aircraft could offer the Air Force during conventional, as well as special operations during more limited conflicts. The smaller, cheaper to operate planes would help ease the strain on over-worked combat jets in low-risk environments . Since the aircraft require far less infrastructure and logistics support that fast-flying jets, as well, with a large fleet, the Air Force could also disperse them to multiple locations within a theater to provide flexible and persistent support. The Marines still have their own requirement for light attack aircraft and could easily decide to join a joint program with the Air Force, which could help share the budget burden and boost the total purchase order. This all should have, at least in part, informed Air Force decision making before now. An F-16 Viper fighter jet rolls away after refueling during operations over Afghanistan in 2018., USAF Unfortunately, the continued uncertainty over who would use the light attack aircraft and where has already prompted concerns that the Air Force might seek to cut the program entirely depending on how the U.S. defense budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year shakes out. As recently as Dec. 3, 2018, President Donald Trump had been publicly talking about cutting federal government spending across the board in the next fiscal cycle. There’s also the matter of the Air Force historically resisting the adoption of light attack aircraft in general. A similarly confused debate over roles in missions, together with budget cuts, doomed the Air Force’s last light attack aircraft procurement plan, known as the Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) program, in 2012. The Air Force Chief of Staff at the time, General Norton Schwartz, had flatly rejected a concept, developed within ACC, to integrate those aircraft more widely into the service’s operations. The current state of the LAA program is also reminiscent of the Air Force’s handling of the C-27J light airlifter amid disputes with the U.S. Army. Those aircraft also ended up dispersed to special operations units, albeit Army ones, as well as the Coast Guard and other federal agencies. Light attack aircraft could also help the Air Force meet its new, self-imposed goal of 386 operational squadrons , but also keep costs to a minimum. This plan will require adding dozens of new units, but does not explicitly include expanding manned close air support-focused elements. With the service also still planning to start retiring its fleet of A-10 Warthogs in the coming years, the LAA program could help those units continue on performing similar missions and retain their extensive close air support skills sets and knowledge base. A pair of US Air Force A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft fly in formation with a Colombian Air Force Super Tucano, in the foreground., USAF On Dec. 9, 2018, POLITICO reported that Trump may have reversed course on the budget after further consultations with Defense Secretary James Mattis and prominent congressional Republicans. Democrats, who are set to take control of the House of Representatives in January 2019, have said they will still push for cuts to certain defense programs . The president’s budget proposal is due to come out in February 2019. The Air Force says this will include the first formal outlay of how many light attack aircraft it plans to buy and when. How many planes the Air Force says it intends to purchase will have an impact on where they go within the service and could determine whether they actually enter service at all.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 8, 2019",RAAF Hornet Escorts Pull Off Jaw-Dropping Overhead Break To Welcome Home First Aussie F-35As,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first two Royal Australian Air Force F-35As were delivered to their new home at RAAF Base Williamtown today in one hell of a triumphant manner. Four RAAF F/A-18s joined the pair of stealth fighters in a tight echelon formation as they came screaming in very low over the base. At the midfield point, the Hornets peeled off in quick succession as the F-35s powered on, streaking their way down the runway. Checkout out the spectacle for yourself below. The unique maneuver was highly symbolic of what’s to come for the RAAF. The F-35A will increasingly displace the Australian air arm’s aging F/A-18A/B Hornet force that dates back to the mid 1980s and will take its place alongside two dozen F/A-18F Super Hornets and a dozen EA-18G Growlers that round out service’s future frontline fast jet inventory. We summed up Canberra’s F/A-18A/B replacement plan in a previous piece as such: “Australia originally ordered 57 F/A-18As and 18 F/A-18Bs, for a total of 75 airframes, in 1981. The vast majority of the jets were assembled in Australia. 71 are still flying today, which is pretty amazing in itself and a testament to the maintainers and pilots who worked with the fleet over the years… …. The plan is for the Australian Hornet fleet to be divested as a near equal number of F-35As—72 at this time but that number could grow—come online. The process that should be completed by 2023 with an initial operating capability (IOC) [for the F-35A] slated for 2020.” Australia has received 10 F-35s so far, all of which had been based at Luke AFB in Arizona for pilot training before these two inaugural jets started their voyage east on December 3rd. The aircraft flew around the globe to their new home with the help of a RAAF KC-30 MRTT . In all, around 50 jets will be based at Williamtown in the future, with about another dozen rotating in and out of the base from RAAF Tindal. This will make RAAF Williamtown Australia’s most heavily equipped tactical fighter base and is sure to become a Mecca of sorts for international F-35 operations in the hemisphere. Canberra plans on spending roughly $17 billion on its F-35s, but even though the unit price for the fighter has declined, operational costs and overall readiness remain major concerns . This is especially true for the RAAF considering their F-35s will be replacing a significantly less complicated design that has been the backbone of their fighter force for decades. Parts shortages and re-work issues alone have plagued the F-35 program and now the aircraft’s radar-absorbant skin is also becoming a publicized issue after years of promises from the aircraft’s manufacturer that it will be far less troublesome than the coatings found on stealthy aircraft that came before it—almost all of which are also Lockheed Martin designs. News.com.au quotes a Lockheed official as telling reporters the following about the established stealth coatings issue: “It’s not a human problem; that’s just the result of our ability. We’re approaching the limits of our ability to build some of these things from precise-enough technology.” Hornets representing three squadrons greet the RAAF’s first officially delivered F-35As near Williamtown Air Base., CPL David Gibbs/ © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence At the same time, the program has finally entered into the long-awaited operational test and evaluation stage which will stress the aircraft, the weapons it uses, its support infrastructure, and its combat doctrine like never before. If it completes these tests to a satisfactory degree, the aircraft will enter into full-rate production. But really, this idea is a bit of misnomer as hundreds of F-35s—roughly 340 at this time—have already been built, many of which aren’t likely to make it through anywhere near their intended service lives or ever be capable of combat operations. Still, finally getting to this phase is really good news for the program overall. The F-35 will bring some exciting new capabilities to the RAAF—low observability (stealth) being a huge one—that will integrate extremely well with the Super Hornet and Growler fleets that will fight alongside them for decades to come. One of the most promising of all the F-35’s attributes is its ability to be a flying sponge that gathers up and processes electronic intelligence in real time. The F-35 is unique in that it can also do this while penetrating very near or even into enemy airspace to gain high fidelity information on the enemy’s electronic order of battle, as well as radar and electro-optical imaging intelligence on enemy positions and activities. The RAAF is investing heavily to become a top-tier electronic warfare and intelligence gathering air power, so these specific capabilities that the F-35 brings to the table will only turbocharge that effort. Regardless of how the RAAF ends of leveraging the F-35’s special talents, you have to hand it to them, they sure know how to make an entrance!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 21, 2018",USAF Says Insurgent Drones Are Watching One Of Its Bases In Afghanistan ’24/7′,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Insurgents are using small unmanned aircraft to regularly monitor activity at a major American base in Afghanistan. This is yet another example of how the Taliban and other militant groups in the country are expanding their capabilities and further highlights the increasingly common threat of readily available commercial drones to nation-state security forces both on and off the battlefield . Tom Lockhart, the Director of the Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation Office (SDPE) at the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), disclosed this detail during a test of various counter-drone technologies at the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in October 2018. At present, SDPE is exploring the viability of solid-state lasers and high-power microwave directed energy weapons as base defense tools against tiny unmanned aircraft. “Coming back from Afghanistan last year in October [2017], I was at a base where we had a lot of unmanned systems sitting over and watching everything we do,” Lockhart explained in an interview at White Sands. “For the future, our airmen would like to not be monitored 24/7 and this will push that [the drones] back so they [the militants] don’t have that monitoring capability.” The SDPE director did not say what base he had visited in Afghanistan. The U.S. military has personnel at various locations across the country, but the Air Force’s two biggest operating locations at Bagram Airfield , situated north of the capital Kabul, and Kandahar Airfield in the southern province of the same name. Another AFRL researcher was assigned to Bagram in July 2017, supporting a field test of unspecified counter-drone systems. “Air Force has three major areas [of directed energy research and development], air base defense, precision engagement, and aircraft self-protect,” Dr. Michael Jirjis, Chief for Directed Energy Experimentation at AFRL, added in his own interview at White Sands. Base defense “is the first, probably near-term low-hanging fruit that we can actually get after as we start opening up the bottleneck for directed energy, transitioning it … to operationalizing it.” Video of the testing at White Sands, seen above, shows at least three different systems at work. Two of these were solid-state lasers, while the last one was a high-power microwave. All three have various sensors, including electro-optical and infrared cameras, to spot and track their targets. Lasers physically destroy their targets , burning holes in them, while high-power microwaves might simply disrupt the drone’s ability to communicate with its operator. A burst of high-power microwave energy would also be enough to fry the electronics inside the unmanned aircraft, depending on how powerful the directed energy beam is and how far away the target is from the weapon. The first of the laser-based counter-drone systems was a trailer-mounted arrangement from defense contractor L3, which appeared visually similar, if smaller, to the proven AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System (LaWS) that the company developed for the U.S. Navy . Developing a static, land-based version would be a relatively low-cost and low-effort way of producing at least an interim laser base defense system with a known capability to destroy small drones. The other laser system was from Raytheon. The Massachusetts-headquartered company debuted the turreted weapon system, which uses many components from its Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) sensor turret, in 2017. Raytheon has been demonstrating this directed energy weapon using the popular Polaris MRZR all-terrain vehicle as the platform, highlighting its compact design and rapid deployability. For Air Force base defense purposes, where drones might only appear briefly at extreme edges of critical infrastructure on the base before retreating to safety, having a mobile system would be especially valuable. On top of that, directed energy weapons are notoriously sensitive to environmental conditions, with the beams often becoming more diffuse at extended ranges. A mobile platform could help mitigate these issues, since the operators would have more flexibility to simply close the distance to the target. The high-power microwave, another Raytheon product , was another trailer-mounted system, but was significantly larger than L3’s laser weapon. The design is reminiscent of microwave directed energy weapons the U.S. military has been developing to disable vehicles on the ground , such as car bombs that might be speeding toward a base’s main gate. It is possible that either laser or microwave-based systems could have secondary roles engaging targets on the ground, as well. As SDPE’s Director Lockhart noted, these systems have given even small, non-state groups a cheap and readily available tool to monitor their opponents as never before. For the Taliban, or other insurgent groups in Afghanistan, having that capability would help them track force movements within the base to help plan or execute attacks . The could also observe forces arriving or departing the base, which could signal an impending offensive or a shift in attention to another region. A 2016 briefing slide describing development of a high-power microwave-based “vehicle stopper” that appears similar in many respects to the counter-drone system the Air Force tested at White Sands in October 2018., USN via FOIA Videos that these small drones might capture have a propaganda value as well, especially if taken during an actual attack. The Taliban, among other insurgent groups around the world, are well aware of how useful this footage is for recruitment efforts and for sapping the morale of their opponents. Militants have shown that these small drones can be weaponized, too, which makes them even more dangerous. ISIS, in Iraq and Syria, helped shove the image of a modified quad- and hex-copters dropping small grenade-like munitions into the modern military consciousness. In January 2018, Syrian rebels conducted a relatively long-range mass drone attack on Russian bases in that country, helping to further highlight the evolving scope of the threat. In August 2018, Venezuela’s dictatorial President Nicolas Maduro survived an assassination attempt by hex-copters loaded with explosives, making it clearer than ever that concerns about these systems are hardly limited to traditional conflicts. Even if the small bomblets that these drones are capable of carrying do not do significant damage to their targets, their ability to strike at opponents, often with little warning, in areas that nation-state security forces often view as safe , can only have a demoralizing effect. So, it’s not surprising that the Taliban may be making even greater use of small drones than in the past . The group has already been working to expand their technological capabilities to enable steadily bolder attacks on Afghan security forces and the U.S.-backed coalition when they least expect it. Night vision , especially, has given the insurgents a means of challenging America’s long-held advantages during engagements after dark. It has provided the militants with a decided edge over more poorly equipped Afghan troops and police, too. Of course, this threat is hardly new , but the United States is still playing catch-up after decades of almost completely ignoring potential aerial threats, manned or otherwise , entirely. The directed energy weapons the Air Force was testing out at White Sands are just some of a wide array of man-portable, mobile, and static defense systems that the U.S. military as a whole is testing now as it rushes to fill these obvious capability gaps. These include everything from shotguns firing small nets to automatic cannons , hit-to-kill interceptors , and missiles . There are individual jammers that can block the signal to the drone from the operator and even other drones to intercept and destroy incoming threats. US Marines test the IXI Technology Dronekiller, a portable jammer that a single individual can carry and employ to disrupt a small drone’s link with its operator, potentially causing it to crash., USMC Various companies are developing new and improved supporting sensors, including compact radars , to improve the ability of a complete system to detect and engage small targets. As concerns about hobby drones have grown, an entire industry working on countermeasures has grown with it. Swarms of drones networked together and operating in concert look to be the next evolution of the threat. This, in turn, is already driving the development of new defenses . Hopefully, the Air Force will be able to prove that directed energy weapons for base defense are indeed “low-hanging fruit” and field one or more operational systems in the near term. The SDPE’s director can attest himself, the threat of small drones is not only real, but is an issue Amercian personnel are staring down every day in real conflict zones without necessarily having ways to combat them.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s that time a year again! Air Mobility Command’s airlifters have hit the skies en masse under the cover of night to fly across the U.S. and into the vast military training ranges in the American Southwest. The goal is to simulate prying open the enemy’s back door and setting up combat shop on their lawn as part of an annual drill called Joint Forcible Entry Exercise (JFEX). Our plane tracking friends started catching the peculiar streams of Air Force cargo aircraft popping up on their flight tracking software earlier in the evening. Within a short amount of time, it was clear that a major exercise was underway and the timing is perfect for this iteration of JFEX. At this same time last year, social media was flooded with videos of lights filling up the night sky as strings of C-17s and C-130s crossed the U.S. on their way primarily to the Nellis Test and Training Range (NTTR) in desolate Southern Nevada . This unique large force employment exercise (LFE) is among the most complex drills the USAF executes and it combines assets of all types, including fighters, surveillance aircraft, electronic warfare platforms, and throngs of ground troops and equipment that are dropped into or dropped off in simulated enemy territory. Here is a taste of JFEX action seen during a daylight portion of the exercise from a few years back. The C-17s are working out of Keno Airstrip in the NTTR. As you can see, it is one impressive display of airpower. Also, keep in mind that there are so many other moving parts you don’t see in the video. It is literally the tip of the operational iceberg: Beyond being fantastic training for all involved, the exercise works as part of the capstone project for the graduating class of the U.S. Air Force’s prestigious Weapons School. The soon to be minted Weapons Instructors (also called ‘Target Arms’ in some flying communities) put all their new and old knowledge to the test to successfully orchestrate what is among the most complex aerial combat ballets on the planet. You can read all about this exercise and how it fits into the Weapon’s School’s larger aims in this past article of ours . In addition to tonight’s mass migration of cargo haulers, the Nellis Test and Training Range has been very active over the last week or so as the Weapons School, which services all types of combat aircraft and their communities, enters into the final phase of its curriculum . The full gamut of surveillance aircraft, from RQ-4 Global Hawks to RC-135 Rivet Joints, have been tracked flying orbits around the range complex as the Weapons Instructors put their carefully evaluated war plans into motion. JFEX has become far more relevant in recent years as the U.S. has started to come to terms with the reality that winning an expeditionary fight against a peer state competitor is an increasingly dubious challenge. Anti-access and area-denial strategies have left the services scrambling to adapt to having to fight an enemy over long distances and breaking open new avenues into their increasingly expansive and fortified domain. Being able to use the Pentagon’s potent but limited airlift capacity to rapidly open up new bases of operation and vectors of attack even at very austere and remote locales in becoming a key tenet of future combat operations . This is exactly what JFEX is all about, punching into contested territory over long distances by surprise and setting up a foothold for expanded operations. So if you look up in the sky tonight and see a long string of blinking lights, no it’s not Santa on a dry run, it’s your U.S. Air Force practicing to make good on its own naughty or nice list. We will keep you update as more information and photos from this iteration of JFEX emerge.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 2, 2018",USAF Plans To Have Dozens Of F-35s Take The Place Of F-22s At Rebuilt Tyndall Air Force Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Almost two months after Hurricane Michael decimated Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, the U.S. Air Force is recommending the permanent redeployment of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters from that base to other locations around the United States. At the same time, the service is now pushing to bring Tyndall back to its former glory as home to as many as three full squadrons of F-35A Joint Strike Fighters . The Air Force announced its preferred course of action, which will be contingent on approval and funding for Congress, in a statement on Dec. 7, 2018 . Tyndall is presently operating at a significantly reduced capacity after 95 percent of the base sustained damage as Hurricane Michael passed directly over it on Oct. 10, 2018. Hangars and other facilities associated with flight operations were among the hardest hit and the service expects it to take years to rebuild the base. “We have been given a chance to use this current challenge as an opportunity to further improve our lethality and readiness in support of the National Defense Strategy,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said in the statement. “We are talking with Congressional leaders about this plan and will need their help with the supplemental funding needed to restore the base,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson added. The plan the Air Force has unveiled would permanently reassign F-22s from the 325th Fighter Wing’s 95th Fighter Squadron, an operational unit, to other Raptor squadrons at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. This would bring the total number of stealth fighters in each of the remaining squadrons from 21 to 24. An F-22 leaves Tyndall Air Force Base on Oct. 22, 2018, in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael., USAF The Air Force had already moved the 95th’s jets to those locations to continue operations in the aftermath of the storm. A July 2018 Government Accountability Office report had already recommended that the service consolidate Raptor operations to improve readiness and reduce operational and maintenance costs. Tyndall was also home to the 43rd Fighter Squadron, an F-22 training unit, and its supporting 372nd Training Squadron, Detachment 4, and the Air Force is still exploring possible options for their future homes. That decision will have an impact on the future of the T-38s of the 2nd Fighter Squadron, which provided dedicated adversary support for the Raptors at Tyndall. All three of these units have since moved to Eglin Air Force Base, also in Florida. The locations of F-22 operational and training units prior to Hurricane Michael., GAO There is no word on what might happen to units operating QF-16 target drones and Mu-2 training aircraft from the base. The QF-16s, in particular, are important, if often ignored assets supporting Air Force training and weapons development requirements. But whatever units assigned to Tyndall continue operating there in the end, the Air Force says it remains intent on continuing to use it a major base. In place of the Raptors and T-38s, the service could assign as many as three squadrons of F-35As to the base in the future, totaling approximately 72 aircraft. “The F-35 is a game-changer with its unprecedented combination of lethality, survivability, and adaptability,” Goldfein declared in the Dec. 7, 2018 statement. “Bringing this new mission to Tyndall ensures that the U.S Air Force is ready to dominate in any conflict.” The Air Force expects to take delivery of hundreds of Joint Strike Fighters in the coming years. The first F-35s could arrive at Tyndall as early as 2023. Nearby Eglin Air Force base is already home to the Air Force’s main F-35 training unit, the 33rd Fighter Wing. The 33rd also presently supports U.S. Navy and Marine Corps F-35 training activities, as well as those of a number of foreign operators. An F-35 from Eglin Air Force Base’s 58th Fighter Squadron sits on the flightline at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado ahead of a flyover of the Air Force Academy., USAF There had already been questions about how the Air Force would proceed with rebuilding Tyndall given the extent of the damage, which also exposed questions about building standards for hangars and other facilities situated in hurricane-prone areas. After Hurricane Andrew flattened Homestead Air Force Base in Florida in 1992, the service ultimately decided to dramatically scale back operations there permanently and turned it into an Air Reserve Base. Today, it is home to a single Air Force Reserve F-16 squadron and acts as a remote alert site for F-15C/Ds from the Florida Air National Guard. Tyndall’s direct access to approximately 130,000 square miles of training airspace over the Gulf of Mexico appears to have helped the base avoid a similar fate, at least for now. It also supports around 20,000 jobs in the communities surrounding the base and generates millions of dollars for the local economy each year. This has prompted state politicians and Florida’s members of Congress to press to not only keep it open all, but to ensure it will eventually operate at or even above its pre-hurricane capacity. There Air Force’s stated plans still leave a number of questions unanswered, though. Overall, the service seemed to have largely dodged a figurative bullet with Hurricane Michael. The F-22s that were forced to weather the storm all escaped with only minor damage in most cases, but it was unclear initially whether that would be the case. There are concerns that global climate change will only increase the likelihood of especially severe hurricanes and other extreme weather in the future, only increasing the risk that no matter what improvements the service makes to the rebuilt Tyndall, that there will still be a danger of it getting wiped out again. In addition, rebuilding Tyndall into a major base again will be a costly undertaking under any circumstances, but there will almost certainly be calls to build stronger hangars to prevent similarly widespread damage from occurring during future storms. In addition to those added expenses, the F-35s will require their own unique infrastructure and present new sustainment requirements . This all raises additional questions about whether it would make more sense for the Air Force to expand F-35 operations at Eglin, where the service has already invested significant resources in expanding Joint Strike Fighter operations. If that base becomes a permanent home for F-22 training activities previously located at Tyndall, it will require added infrastructure anyway. On top of that, the U.S. military as a whole is well overdue for another Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process to ensure its facilities are meeting demands in a cost-effective manner. The 1993 BRAC had a direct impact on the final decision not to fully rebuild Homestead and a future review of facilities could alter the Air Force’s plans for Tyndall. Any plans for Tyndall will depend on funding from Congress, too. President Donald Trump has already indicated that he will propose a defense spending cut for the 2020 Fiscal Year, but it remains to be seen how significant the decrease might be and whether legislators will seek to add in additional money for various projects. The Air Force will also have to conduct environmental and other assessments to confirm that Tyndall can accommodate rebuilt and new structures to support the service’s plans. From the Air Force’s new announcement, it seems increasingly likely that the F-22s have left the base for good, but also that Tyndall’s future could still be very bright.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 25, 2022",Boeing Nixes Satellite Deal Amid Concerns The U.S. Buyer Was A Chinese Government Front,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing says it has canceled a controversial satellite order from a U.S.-based startup, which had received the bulk of its funding from a Chinese-government owned financial company. The deal, which critics warned could give China access to sensitive technology, comes amid a period of especially acrimonious relations between Washington and Beijing over a host of issues, including industrial espionage and intellectual property theft . The Chicago-headquartered aerospace company announced its decision, which it said was only because of non-payment on the part of the customer, to nix the deal, worth more than $200 million, on Dec. 6, 2018 . Two days earlier, the Wall Street Journal had published an expose detailing the links between the official buyer, Global IP, and a string of Chinese government operated entities and individuals with significant connections to China’s Communist Party and military establishment. “When we resigned over a year ago, we informed Boeing of the reasons for our decision,” Emil Youssefzadeh, one of Global IP’s founders, told the Journal , referring to concerns about China’s involvement and a hope that the company would be able to shake off worrisome Chinese government influence. “It’s unfortunate that this did not happen at the time.” Some of the first inklings that there might be problems with the satellite sale came when Youssefzadeh and co-founder Umar Javed resigned from their own California-based company in 2017. They subsequently lodged a suit in federal court alleging that the Chinese government had effectively taken control of Global IP. Boeing Wideband Global Satcom (WGS) System satellites under construction for the US military., Boeing U.S. law prevents any American company from selling satellites or certain related technologies directly to the Chinese government or companies based in China. This appears to have created a loophole that authorities in Beijing sought to exploit with the deal through Global IP. Global IP’s own goal was to procure the satellite, known as GiSAT-1, to help expand affordable internet coverage in areas of the African continent. In 2015, China Orient Asset Management, a wholly-government owned entity, approached the founders with a financing offer. What followed was a meeting between Global IP’s Javed and China Orient’s president in Beijing, along with Geng Zhiyuan. Geng, who is the son of a former top leader of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), is an influential businessman and member of the Chinese Communist Party, with links to present Chinese President Xi Jinping. China Orient has also publicly touted its links to the PLA, according to the Journal . Geng Zhiyuan, Xinhua The resulting arrangement saw at least $200 million funneled from China Orient to Global IP through Dong Yin, a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of the Chinese financing firm, to a shell company in the British Virgin Islands, called Bronzelink Holdings Ltd. The Chinese investors reportedly assured Youssefzadeh and Javed that Bronzelink was independent of Chinese government influence. The former Global IP executives say that this turned out not to be the case. Instead, China Orient, through its subsidiaries, effectively owned a 75 percent stake in the company, which is formally headquartered in the Cayman Islands, but has a wholly-owned subsidiary in Los Angeles, and gained the right to appoint four members to its board of directors. The Chinese then demanded to see the contract with Boeing and technical details about the satellite. Bronzelink and the present leadership of Global IP deny the allegations, citing, among other things, a legitimate export license from the U.S. Commerce Department for the satellite. They also dispute the assertion that they should have at least alerted the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ), an inter-agency board that reviews deals with foreign funding to ensure that there are no national security risks. The panel can then recommend the U.S. government block deals based on those concerns. Boeing had initially indicated its intention to proceed with the deal, though it has now finally abandoned the contract in the face of new public scrutiny. Without the Journal’s reporting, it may have gone ahead as planned. The future of the satellite itself, which is nearing completion, is also unclear, though the company will almost certainly begin looking for another buyer. SpaceX had also been under contract to launch it and that deal will almost certainly be terminated now, as well. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with another payload. This is the type of rocket that would have launched the Global IP GiSAT-1 before the deal with Boeing collapsed., SpaceX The entire episode highlights long-standing issues for American businesses dealing with sensitive technology, who are often eager to enter Chinese markets and are attracted to lucrative financing offers from the Chinese government or Chinese government-adjacent entities. Those same deals have historically been fraught with controversy over potential intellectual property theft and the ability for the repressive totalitarian government in Beijing to set terms or demand additional concessions as times goes on. In 2011, General Electric faced similar criticism over plans to cooperate with Chinese companies on aircraft projects involving jet engine development, which continue to this day. More recently, Google and Facebook have faced growing criticism over their cooperation with Chinese authorities to block access to certain parts of the Internet and turn over information regarding dissidents and activists. The Boeing satellite case also comes as concerns are growing about threats to U.S. military space-based assets, including terrestrial interceptors , “ killer satellites ,” and electronic and cyber warfare attacks. The Chinese are also pushing to expand their own presence above the Earth’s atmosphere, further emphasizing their likely interest in acquiring advanced satellite technology by any means available. In October 2018, Jeff Gossel, the head intelligence engineer within the Space and Missile Analysis Group, part of the U.S. Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center, warned that otherwise innocuous Chinese communications satellites circling the moon could actually be space-based threats . China says these satellites are part of its Chang’e 4 lunar research mission . https://youtube.com/watch?v=DIXoUzOgFV8 Beyond that, President Donald Trump’s administration’s foreign policy agenda has focused on curtailing dubious U.S.-Chinese deals, China’s industrial espionage, and other Chinese trade practices that don’t align with U.S. interests. The two countries have been locked in a bitter trade row for months now. Despite a general agreement between Trump and Xi during the G20 conference in Argentina earlier in December 2018, there is no guarantee the two parties will make any progress on that any time soon. Hopes for a successful resolution of the situation have already been tempered by Canada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou , CFO of Chinese communications giant Huawei and daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, at the U.S. government’s request. The United States alleges that Huawei, under Meng’s direction, skirted U.S. and international sanctions against Iran . On top of that, in August 2018, Trump signed the latest National Defense Authorization Act, which barred the U.S. military from dealing with Huawei, as well as it major Chinese competitor ZTE, primarily over fears that Chinese intelligence could exploit those links. In addition, Huawei has been accused in the past of intellectual property theft by major tech companies, including Microsoft and Dell . Huawei’s CFO Meng Wanzhou., Handout via South China Morning Post This is the latest in a string of such incidents. In October 2018, Belgian authorities extradited a member of China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS), the country’s top intelligence agency, to the United States over efforts to infiltrate the American aviation and aerospace sectors and steal technology, especially related to modern jet engines. In September 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) detained another Chinese national , Ji Chaoqun, on suspicion of helping the MSS recruit engineers and other individuals in high technology industries for industrial espionage purposes. A month earlier, the FBI had arrested Xiaoqing Zheng for stealing documentation on power-generating turbines from General Electric, but reportedly only to support the work at his own company rather than at the direct behest of the Chinese government. In June 2018, The Washington Post reported that China had stolen data related to a top-secret U.S. Navy missile program called Sea Dragon . These are only some examples of China’s well-known espionage efforts . “Worst of all, Chinese security agencies have masterminded the wholesale theft of American technology – including cutting-edge military blueprints,” U.S. Vice President Mike Pence declared in a speech on Oct. 4, 2018. “And using that stolen technology, the Chinese Communist Party is turning plowshares into swords on a massive scale.” So, while Boeing may have ended this one particular deal, there seems to be little doubt that the Chinese will continue to explore all the options available to them to secure sensitive air and space technology to support their own development efforts.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 5, 2018",The Best Videos Of Hornets Executing A Moving Missing Man Formation For Bush’s Funeral,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Today, President George H.W. Bush’s journey officially came to an end, and it did so in a beautiful and moving way. Texans lined the railroad tracks as the specially painted Union Pacific locomotive 4141 pulled a train that included a windowed car with the 41st President’s casket inside of it. It was an awesome sight seeing all those people saying goodbye to the President even though the rain was coming down. Sadly, the flyover of 21 Navy F/A-18 Hornets wasn’t covered well by the networks. As the President’s casket was carried by the honor guard to the burial site on the grounds of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, the jets roared overhead under a thick ceiling of moist clouds. What most of us did see was still a moving tribute, with groups of four Hornets flying in diamond formation over the site with their arresting hooks down. The image was a quintessential salute from a group of Naval Aviators to one of the most notable Navy flyers in history and a Commander In Chief. But the most emotional part of any memorial flyover , the missing man formation, was not shown on television, although it sure was heard. Thankfully, other cameras were rolling, a few of which did catch the missing man formation. The quartet of Super Hornets were barreling in quite low and fast when one lights the burners and peels off from the fingertip formation and roared into the heavens. Here are the best videos we have seen of the formation so far: Here is another view: The team from NAS Oceana, which included jets from eight squadrons with the Commodore of Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic flying in the lead jet with the President and the First Lady’s name on it, did a great job considering the foul conditions. A Navy news release discusses what went into the operation, including the fact that 30 jets in total and 50 ground crew made the trip to Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth to support the Hornets and their crews on their historic mission: We coordinated with Joint Reserve Base (JRB) Fort Worth and reached out to the commanding officer, executive officer and operations officer to make sure we had ramp space and hangar maintenance facilities,” said Hagge. “Cutting orders for the aircrew and all 50 maintainers and the other administrative details was the easy part. The tactical level detail was a lot more complex.” All told, 30 jets made the trip to JRB Fort Worth in addition to the ground team on station at the presidential library in College Station. The extra nine jets served as backups to ensure mission success. “It was reactionary to make sure we had the requisite number of aircraft with spares to make sure we could fill [the request] with 21 aircraft,” Hagge said. The extra nine jets comprised of five airborne spares with four more spares on ground ready to support. Cmdr. Justin Rubino, assigned to CNAL, served as the forward air controller on the ground. He remained in radio contact with the aircraft to match the flyover’s timing with the funeral events on the ground. “I like the responsibility and feel like I had the most direct role in ensuring success – other than the aircraft of course,” Rubino said. “I like being the ‘point person,’ communicating what’s happening on the ground, relaying that information and directing when the flyover occurs.” … Coordinating a nationally televised 21 jet flyover for a state funeral is no small task, but Hagge remains humble, giving much of the credit to the Joint Task Force National Capitol Region, which was responsible for the overall planning. “As far as the complexity goes, for us, we are a really small portion of an incredibly complex machine.” The “small portion” included executing the Navy’s first 21-jet formation that originated from an Air Force formation already in existence. “We pretty much took the Air Force plan and put a little Navy spin on it,” Rubino said. That “spin” included changing the distance between the aircraft and altering the formation to a diamond shape for the first four jets. The last formation utilized the standard “fingertip formation” in order to do the missing-man pull. Hagge and his team were honored to support. “A funeral is a family’s darkest hour and a flyover, an opportunity where we can support them in a time of mourning, means the world to them,” said Hagge. “But this one, I think, means the world to our nation.” We have celebrated the President’s life and highlighted unique elements of his memorial, from his heroic naval service and the flyover that was designed to commemorate it, to the backstory of the special train that carried his body to its final resting place. In the end, it was awesome to see all of it come together in a crescendo that our nation could experience and appreciate together, and frankly, such a reflective national moment was sorely needed during these times of extreme political division.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has flown the first observation flight under the much-debated Open Skies Treaty in 2018 over Ukraine. The mission comes as Russian and Ukranian forces hold dueling missile drills amid inflamed tensions following a violent skirmish in the Kerch Strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The U.S. military announced it had conducted the “extraordinary flight” over unspecified areas of Ukraine on Dec. 6, 2018 . Earlier plane spotters using online flight tracking software had recorded one of the Air Force’s two aging OC-135B Open Skies observation aircraft departing from Kiev. Russia’s Tu-214ON Open Skies aircraft later took off from Moscow, but it is unclear if it was on its own mission under the terms of the treaty. “The timing of this flight is intended to reaffirm U.S. commitment to Ukraine and other partner nations,” the Pentagon said in a brief statement on Dec. 6, 2018. “Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukrainian naval vessels in the Black Sea near the Kerch Strait is a dangerous escalation in a pattern of increasingly provocative and threatening activity.” The Open Skies treaty , which entered force in 2002, gives signatories the right to conduct observation flights and collect imagery over the territory of other member states. The agreement sets out how high fidelity that imagery can be and at what altitude the aircraft can gather it. The deal ostensibly is to allow countries to monitor foreign military movements to ensure that they are non-hostile and reduce the chances for dangerous escalations and potential conflicts. Per the treaty, an extraordinary flight comes at the request of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s (OSCE) components “authorized to deal with respect to conflict prevention and crisis management” or other “international organizations” rather than a particular country that is party to the agreement. Individual members can volunteer their airspace or otherwise agree on a bilateral basis to conduct extraordinary flights, as well. The U.S. military says this is the first such mission under the treaty since 2014 . Regardless, the country where the flight takes place, in this case Ukraine, still has to approve it, but Kiev was likely eager for the mission to occur. On Nov. 25, 2018, Russia’s security forces rammed Ukrainian naval vessels and shot at them in order to stop them from passing through the Kerch Strait, injuring multiple Ukrainian sailors in the process. The Kremlin claims that they had violated Russia’s maritime border and were sailing through the area without having provided advanced notice. Ukraine has countered by citing international maritime law regarding innocent passage, as well as a 2003 agreement between Moscow and Kiev on shared use of the strait and the Sea of Azov. Video and audio that Ukrainian intelligence services subsequently made available strongly suggest that the Russians were determined to stop Ukraine’s vessels, and may have had a premeditated plan to do so, as well as to demonstrate their ability to enforce a blockade of the strategic Sea of Azov. Russia has dismissed growing international condemnation of its actions. It is looking to put the Ukrainian sailors on trial for charges including violating its border and has moved many of them from Ukraine’s Crimea region, which Russia illegally seized in 2014, to Moscow . The two countries have been in a de facto low-level conflict since then, with the Kremlin actively supporting separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region. Nearly two weeks after the brawl in the Kerch Strait, significant portions of Eastern Ukraine are under martial law and Ukrainian security forces have reinforced positions along the border with Russia. The Kremlin has also deployed additional S-400 surface-to-air missiles onto the Crimean Peninsula and sent more mechanized and airmobile troops to its Southern Military District . Airmobile forces were instrumental in Russia’s blitz to take control of Crimea more than four years ago. On Dec. 3, 2018, Russia also kicked off snap missile drills , involving Bal and Bastion-P coastal defense missile systems, which fire the Kh-35 and P-800 Oniks anti-ship cruise missiles respectively. The Kremlin reportedly sent out alerts indicating that it could be launching missiles into the Black Sea through Dec. 9, 2018 . The Bal and Bastion-P systems, combined with the S-400s, would present a major threat to any potential opponent during a conflict in and around the Black Sea or Sea of Azov. This is entirely design and since 2014, Russia has steadily built up its military presence on Crimea with this in mind. It has effectively become a fortress to deny freedom of movement to Ukraine’s military, or that of any country that might seek to come to its aid, full of missiles, fighter jets and other combat aircraft, gunship and transport helicopters, and general purpose ground forces. In response to the latest crisis, the United Kingdom has still sent a small survey ship, HMS Echo , to the Black Sea and the United States plans to send a warship into the area soon. Given the extent of Russian defenses, these ships would face significant dangers in any actual conflict, though. A new Russian S-400 battery covered in snow in Crimea on Nov. 29, 2018., Viktor Lyashсhenko / Sputnik  via AP In addition, Ukraine is at a severe numerical disadvantage to the Russians when it comes to surface-to-air missiles and shore-based anti-ship defenses. But in response to the Russian actions, Ukrainian forces did conduct their own missile drills involving the “newish” Neptune anti-ship missile , a derivative of the Soviet-era Kh-35, and modernized S-125 short-range surface-to-air missiles. What is particularly interesting are reports that the Ukrainians destroyed a number of maritime targets with the S-125s, demonstrating a potential limited anti-ship capability. The surface-to-air search and fire control radars could definitely have a secondary ability to spot and track targets of sufficient size on the water. The United States has similarly shown that ships equipped with the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) surface-to-air missile can engage surface targets with those weapons. Employing the S-125s in this way could definitely help expand Ukraine’s short-range anti-ship missile capacity, at least to some degree, before production of Neptune ramps up. It is also possible that something got lost in translation and the Ukrainians only meant to indicate that they had engaged targets over the water with the surface-to-air missiles. Ukraine is in need of new and improved anti-aircraft defenses , as well, given the threat of Russian aircraft. The country continues to rely heavily on Soviet-era systems , many of which are increasingly obsolete. Since the incident in the Kerch Strait, there have also been rumors of Russian forces massing for a major push into Ukraine, reports of a spike in fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists, and generally increased tensions between the two countries all around. All told, using the Open Skies treaty to gain more insight into the situation and collect imagery that the OSCE can freely share among treaty members, and within the organization itself, makes good sense. The European bloc has also been acting as an international monitor to the conflict in the Donbass, using satellite and other imagery to track direct Russian involvement in the fighting and other violations of the Minsk II agreement. That deal, which Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany crafted in 2015 is supposed to de-escalate the conflict and requires Russia to move armored vehicles, artillery, and other heavy weapons away from its borders with the Donbass region. Depending on where in Ukraine the OC-135B flew, it could have spotted Russian forces newly massed near the border. The last extraordinary Open Skies flight turned up evidence of Russia’s military presence within Ukraine despite the Kremlin’s denials. The Pentagon has declined to say what areas the flight covered, but it reportedly did not include Crimea or other disputed parts of the country. Imagery from an OSCE drone overlaid on commercial satellite imagery showing a possible Russian violation of the Minsk II agreement in October 2018., OSCE The flight also serves to highlight the value of the Open Skies treaty, especially for smaller countries that do not have the benefit of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft able to gather useful information from international airspace or ready access to high-fidelity satellite imagery of areas of interest. The agreement also gives member states big and small, as well as the OSCE itself, a powerful mechanism to demand oversight of their neighbors’ potentially provocative moves. That the United States conducted the mission on Dec. 6, 2018 has added significance given that the treaty has been under increasing fire from critics in the U.S. government. Members of Congress and the U.S. military have accused the Kremlin of exploiting the deal to gather more detailed intelligence about its military capabilities and had long opposed plans by Russia to field improved observation aircraft with digital cameras. Regardless of the merits of those complaints, the United States had already acquiesced to the Russians field the same digital camera system on Russia’s existing Tu-154M-ON plane. The U.S. government finally agreed to certify the new Tu-214ON aircraft in September 2018. Russia’s Tu-214ON Open Skies aircraft., Oleg Belyakov via Wikimedia In addition, the flight over Ukraine is notable in that it is the first Open Skies flight for any reason in 2018. It remains unclear why this has been the case, as the certification dispute between the United States and Russia, as well as those two countries registering complaints about each other’s flights over certain areas , would not have prevented all flights from occurring. Georgia had refused to sign off the annual agreement regarding quotas of total flights that signatories are allowed over a separate dispute with Russia, but reportedly this issue has been resolved. This could still explain why the latest mission over Ukraine was an extraordinary one under the auspices of the OSCE, which does not count against the quota for any particular country. Regardless of the present state of the Open Skies treaty or its future, the latest flare-up in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia showing no signs of abating. It’s very possible that the OSCE and its partners may increasingly turn to extraordinary flights as an important tool to keep a closer eye on troop movements and other developments that could point to the beginnings of a larger conflict in the region.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain extremely limited at this time, but what we know is that a two-seat F/A-18D collided with a KC-130, supposedly during a refueling operation off the coast of Japan. Both aircraft crashed into the sea. A large search and rescue operation is now underway. Supposedly two were onboard the Hornet, which would make it a Marine F/A-18D, and five were onboard the KC-130. Both had launched out of Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni and the mishap occurred at around 2:00am local time. USMC ATARS equipped F/A-18D refueling from a KC-130. , USMC We have no idea what happened, but aerial refuel is a very challenging task , especially at night. The base hosts a single Marine Hornet squadron that rotates from the United States on a regular basis. Often times these are from Marine Strike Fighter All-Weather squadrons that fly the missionized F/A-18D. Two squadrons were the norm up until the F-35B came online operationally and deployed to Japan. The base has seen serious expansion in recent years and is now home to fixed-wing aircraft belonging to CVW-5, USS Ronald Reagan’s air wing, which moved from its long-established home at NAF Atsugi earlier in the year. MCAS Iwakuni is also home to the ‘Sumos’ of VMGR-152, a Marine KC-130J squadron that is highly active throughout the Western Pacific. You can read all about this wonderful unit in this piece of mine. We have no idea if this was the unit involved in the mishap, though. We will be live updating this post with more information as it comes available. Update: 2:50pm PST— I have some good news here. One of the lost crewmen has been found alive, but keep in mind that these details can still change: Update: 3:35pm PST— Hearing this happened about 200 miles off the coast. Update: 4:57pm PST— USMC confirms that one of seven the crewmen lost between both aircraft is being medically evaluated at this time. Here is the complete official statement: MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP BUTLER, Okinawa, Japan – The United States Marine Corps confirms one of the personnel involved in the mishap is being evaluated by competent medical authorities at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 7, 2018",Navy Hornet Adorned With George Bush’s Name To Lead 21 Jet Flyover For Presidential Funeral,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Navy Strike Fighter Squadron VFA-103, the famous “Jolly Rogers,” will lead a huge formation of 21 jets over College Station, Texas where the George H.W. Bush library is located, to pay tribute to the legendary Naval Aviator and 41st President of the United States. Bush will be laid to rest next to First Lady Barbara Bush on the library’s grounds on Thursday at the culmination of the memorial services. The F/A-18F that will lead the formation has “President George H.W. Bush “41”” scrawled below the front seat’s windscreen and “Barbara “First Lady”” below the back seat canopy rail—a fitting tribute to one of the most famous Navy flyers of all time. USN The Jolly Rogers, which are based at NAS Oceana in Norfolk, Virginia, have their iconic skull and crossbones mascot that is deeply ingrained in the unit’s history and lore. This symbolism is also fitting as Bush’s time as a Bonesman at Yale greatly influenced him, but not as much as the time he spent fighting the Japanese in TBF Avenger torpedo bombers over the Pacific during World War II. Six months after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and on his 18th birthday, George joined the war effort and became the youngest naval aviator ever. Bush, with the callsign “Skin” due to his lanky frame, flew with VT-51 aboard the light aircraft carrier USS San Jacinto (CVL-30) during many battles at the height of the war. During a mission on June 19th, 1944, San Jacinto and its task force trounced the Japanese during the battle that is now called the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot . Ensign Bush was returning to the carrier when his aircraft experienced mechanical trouble and he and his crew were forced to make a perilous water landing. The destroyer USS Clarence K. Bronson ended up rescuing Bush and his crew and they were returned to their air wing after the harrowing ordeal. Avengers on high., USN But it was on September 2nd, 1944, when a fateful mission would change the future President’s life forever and the course of American history. Bush and his two crew, Radioman Second Class John Delaney and Lieutenant (JG) William White, were on a bombing raid that targeted highly defended Japanese positions on Chichi Jima, a tiny island 700 miles west of Japan, when their Avenger was blasted with flak. Bush still successfully struck his target with his bomb load and kept flying the plane as long as possible to separate him and his crew from the Japanese below. After telling his crew to bail out, Bush also jumped from the burning aircraft, smashing his forehead on the Avenger’s tail in the process. Bush climbed into his tiny survival raft as American fighters circled overhead and beat back Japanese boats that were trying to capture him. Once secure in his raft, he realized his squadronmates didn’t make it to the surface alive. While other crews that were shot down during the raid were captured, tortured, executed, and even eaten , by chance Bush was saved hours after hitting the water by the crew of the submarine USS Finback that was lurking in the area. Video of the moment a frazzled Bush climbed to safety aboard the submarine became one of the most historic pieces of footage from the Pacific theater. Bush stayed aboard the submarine for weeks assisting with rescues of other aircrews that were otherwise left to die in the lonely and unforgiving waters of vast Pacific. Little San Jacinto pulled far more than her weight during World War II., USN This ordeal changed Bush dramatically and he was haunted by questions as to why he had survived by his brothers in arms hadn’t his entire life. But those questions also helped shape his dedication to service and his kindness towards others throughout his illustrious public service career and eventually as the head of a large and influential family. Listen to the 41st President describe the events of that day in his own words below: In total, Lieutenant George H.W. Bush went on 58 combat missions and was highly decorated for his service, receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals. The Presidential Unit Citation was also awarded USS San Jacinto for the carrier’s incredible actions during the war. Naval Aviator George H.W. Bush went on to be an instructor in Norfolk and stood up a new squadron before being discharged once the war drew to a close. Amazingly, this was just the start of what would become one of the most impressive public service careers in American history. So yeah, if anyone deserves a 21 fighter flyover and his name on Super Hornet it’s Lieutenant turned Command In Chief George H.W. Bush. The flyover will occur at 4:15pm at the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 3, 2019",Eurofighter Consortium 2.0 Takes Shape As Spain Set To Join Franco-German Stealth Jet Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Spain has formally announced its interest in joining the Franco-German stealth fighter project , commonly referred to as the Next Generation Weapon System, or NGWS. At the same time, the Spanish Ministry of Defense claims that Italy and The Netherlands have signed on to be part of the United Kingdom’s Tempest sixth-generation fighter jet program, which it also predicts will merge with France and Germany’s effort to create a true European fighter jet project. Spain’s Ministry of Defense unveiled its plans in a press release on Dec. 3, 2018 . France and Germany have been publicly working together to craft the requirements for an over-arching Future Air Combat System (FCAS) since July 2017. This would include a manned component, known as the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), networked together with unmanned “ loyal wingmen ,” which now carry the NGWS moniker specifically. FCAS could also include other types of drones, including a stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), in the future. Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles “requests that the Spanish incorporation be formalized, through the signing of a Letter of Intentions (LOI, in its English acronym) or a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),” a basic machine translation of the Spanish language-only press release explains. “The cost of being a member of the program is estimated at around 25 million euros [approximately $28.4 million at the time of writing] for the next two years.” France’s Dassault and European aviation consortium Airbus are presently working on the various components of the FCAS, including the NGF and NGWS. French engine maker Safran has reportedly entered into an agreement with German firm MTU to build the jet engines for the fighter jet component, according to Reuters . You can read more about the overall FCAS program here and here . The Spanish announcement does not make any specific mention of desired industrial cooperation, though Spain appears interested in becoming a full partner in the program. Spain is already a major partner in Airbus’ EuroMALE medium-altitude long-endurance drone program. It’s hardly surprising that Spain would be eager to join the program. The Spanish Ministry of Defense’s press release notes that the country has 20 EF-18A/B Hornet fighter jets that will need replacing before 2025 and expects to retire the remaining 65 examples by 2030. The Spanish Air Force received the first of these planes in the late 1980s. In addition, in 2016, the Spanish and German governments had already worked together with Airbus to develop the initial requirements for the FCAS concept. In June 2017, shortly before the announcement of the Franco-German effort, it was Germany and Spain who were calling on France to join their effort . A Spanish EF-18A Hornet., Chris Lofting via Wikimedia It is also worth noting that France, Germany, and Spain had initially collaborated, together with Italy and the United Kingdom, on the Eurofighter EF-2000 Typhoon fourth generation fighter jet. The French subsequently dropped out of that program and purchased the indigenously designed and built Dassault Rafale . We at The War Zone had already pointed out in the past that France and Germany would likely be very welcoming of Spanish interest in the project, as well as requests to join from smaller countries, especially those in Europe and elsewhere that had not already selected the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . Additional partners would help spread out the cost burden of both developing and producing the aircraft, as well as operating and sustaining them . Development, production, and sustainment costs have continually proven to be extremely high for advanced stealthy aircraft programs. Airbus, in particular, has touted the greater possibilities for industrial cooperation when it comes to the FCAS program, as well as the development of systems that are not covered by the U.S. government’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations ( ITAR ) regime. “ ITAR-free ” aircraft would be exportable to any country without any need for approval from the United States, which often creates additional hurdles for third-party countries. The Spanish Ministry of Defense said that it made its decision based on the two European options that are presently available, one being the Franco-German FCAS. The other option would have been to look into joining the United Kingdom’s Tempest program , which the U.K. government first announced in July 2018. Similar in most respects to FCAS, Tempest also envisions a combination of stealthy manned and unmanned aircraft working together in a highly-networked environment. You can read more about that project here . The Spanish Defense Ministry’s statement says that the FCAS and Tempest requirements are so similar that they are highly likely to combine in the future to form a single program. Airbus has also suggested that the international fighter market and the costs associated with stealth fighter development mean that multiple European projects are unsustainable. A graphic giving an overview of the components of Airbus’ FCAS concept, including the “new fighter,” which is now known as the Next Generation Fighter., Airbus “I strongly believe it has to be a full European solution [for a new combat air program],” Dirk Hoke, the CEO of Airbus Defense and Space, told reporters ahead of the biennial Farnborough Air Show on July 6, 2018. “Two or more different solutions is not sustainable, it will bring Europe into the second league.” What is also interesting about the Spanish statement regarding Tempest is the disclosure that Italian and Dutch governments are also part of that program. Italian defense contractor Leonardo and European missile consortium MBDA, which includes an Italian component, are already part of Team Tempest , but there have been no formal announcements of the Italian government considering purchasing the aircraft. This appears to be the first mention of Dutch interest or involvement at all. There are still concerns that the United Kingdom’s plan to leave the European Union, also known as Brexit, could upend plans for cooperation on this program with other countries in Europe for political and practical reasons. British defense contractor BAE, which is leading the Tempest program, has already laid off workers from its aviation units as a result of a flagging U.K. economy . It remains to be seen when either program might deliver an operational capability, as well. In addition to significant upfront costs, stealth fighter programs working with clean sheet designs have historically had lengthy development cycles. France and Germany have previously said they don’t expect to begin taking deliveries of any new jets until some time between 2030 and 2040. BAE similar says it hopes Tempest will be ready to begin entering service in 2035. MBDA This timeline has already created problems for the Germans, who need to replace their aging Panavia Tornado combat jets before then. Spain would face the same problems and would have to procure an interim aircraft to bridge the gap unless some sort of extreme life extension measures can be put in place for existing airframes. With regards to Tempest, the United Kingdom , Italy , and The Netherlands have all decided to procure some number of F-35s in the meantime, giving them their own stealthy fifth-generation capability in the meantime. Italy became the first European F-35 operator to declare an initial operational capability with the Joint Strike Fighter on Nov. 30, 2018. Spain still has yet to make its involvement in Franco-German fighter jet program official, but it looks as if they will make the arrangement formal in the near future. If the Spanish truly believe that FCAS will blend together with the United Kingdom’s Tempest program, there’s not much of a choice to be made, anyway.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",F-15s Arrive For Rebooted “Cope India” Air Combat Drill As US-Indian Relations Tighten,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. and Indian Air Forces have kicked off an important bilateral air warfare exercise known as Cope India. This is the first iteration of this drill in nearly a decade and comes as the two countries are working to expand defense and security cooperation in the face of regional security challenges and threats , especially with regards to China . Cope India 2019 began on Nov. 3, 2018 , at Air Station Kalaikunda and Air Station Arjan Singh, both of which are in India’s eastern West Bengal state, with approximately 200 Americans and an unspecified number of Indian personnel taking part in the exercise. U.S. Air Force personnel from the 18th Wing in Japan has brought F-15C/D Eagle fighter jets for the drill, while the Illinois National Air National Guard’s 182nd Airlift Wing will contribute C-130 Hercules cargo planes. Indian Air Force (IAF) Su-30MKI Flanker-H and Mirage 2000 fighter jets, Jaguar combat jets , A-50EI airborne early warning and control aircraft, and C-130Js will be flying, as well. “We are excited and grateful for the opportunity to fly and train with our Indian Air Force counterparts within their home country,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Darryl Insley, commander of the 13th Air Expeditionary Group, said in an official statement . “Through participation in Cope India, I’m confident that all Airmen involved will both increase their skills and build meaningful bonds through bilateral engagements and exchanges.” The 13th Air Expeditionary Group is a provisional unit that the Air Force can activate as necessary to control forces deployed for exercises and other contingencies. Officially, Cope India will focus on developing the two countries’ air warfare tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as sharing best practices related to force employment and otherwise helping both countries build on their existing capabilities. Pilots flying the F-15C/Ds will have a prime opportunity to train against dissimilar aircraft flown by their Indian counterparts. Flying air-to-air drills with the Russian-made Su-30MKIs are especially valuable given the continued use of Flankers and Flanker derivatives among the United States’ two potential “great power adversaries, Russia and China . Various iterations of the Flanker are also in service with smaller air forces around the world. Having a chance to train to operate together those aircraft, as well as the others that the IAF will be flying during Cope India, is also important if the United State and India hope to be able to deploy and fly together in response to any sort of contingency. This applies equally to the C-130 crews, who could easily find themselves working side-by-side in response to violent crises or humanitarian disasters in the Pacific region or even further afield. India’s Su-30s feature 3D thrust vectoring , making them a particularly unique challenge for F-15C/D pilots when fighting within-visual-range under certain circumstances. The Air Force is hardly unaware of the value of having a regular bilateral exercise with the Indians. The service had held five other Cope India exercises between 2003 and 2009. The 2004 drill is particularly infamous in that the IAF’s upgraded MiG-21s , known as Bisons, notably carrying Israeli-made Elbit EL/L8222 self-escort jamming pods, were able to repeatedly get the drop on American F-15C/Ds. The improved Soviet-era jets also had the benefit of a small radar cross section and helmet mounted sights that allowed them to fire high-off boresight short-range infrared-seeking dogfighting missiles at the most opportune times. “The MiG-21s would be embedded with a [MiG-27] Flogger for integral protection. There was a data link between the [Su-30MKI] Flankers that was used to pass information,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Greg Newbech, who took part in the 2004 iteration of the exercise, said afterward . “They built a very good [radar] picture of what we were doing and were able to make good decisions about when to roll [their aircraft] in and out.” An IAF MiG-21 Bison., Sheeju via Wikimedia Retired U.S. Air Force Major General Michael Snodgrass, then a colonel commanding the 3rd Wing at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, which had sent jets to take part in the exercise, said that the Bisons and the Su-30MKIs proved to be the most formidable opponents. “The outcome of the exercise boils down to [the fact that] they ran tactics that were more advanced than we expected… They could come up with a game plan, but if it wasn’t working they would call an audible and change [tactics in flight],” he explained in a 2004 interview with Aviation Week & Space Technology . It is important to note that none of the Eagles had received the AN/APG-63V3 active-electronically scanned array radars at the time. In addition, the Air Force had reportedly agreed not to simulate engagements using certain beyond-visual-range missile parameters and had fought at a significant numerical disadvantage in most cases. IAF MiG-27s and US Air Force F-15Cs fly together during Cope India 2004., USAF Still, the exercise’s results prompted an uproar in Washington. The United States returned for the 2005 iteration of the drill with improved tactics and procedures, but the outcome still featured notable Indian successes. It reportedly became an argument in some defense circles for restarting production of the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter and helped spur the fielding of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System ( JHMCS ) and AN/APG-63(V)3 AESA radar . It helped inform later upgrades, some of which are still in the pipeline, such as infrared search and track (IRST) pods , too. The U.S. Air Force returned to India again for the exercises in 2006 and 2009. The latter of these drills, however, was entirely airlift focused, involving only American C-130s and C-17s. It’s not immediately apparent why the exercises came to an end. However, U.S.-India defense relations began to grow again during President Barack Obama’s second term, marked in particular by greater defense industrial cooperation . President Donald Trump’s administration has made an even stronger push to expand military-to-military ties with Asia’s largest democracy. In 2017, the Pentagon announced plans to reboot Cope India , and expand the size and scope of bilateral military exercises in general, as part of that overall effort. In May 2018, the United States renamed Pacific Command (PACOM) as Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), in part to highlight the importance of this relationship. A pair of US Air Force F-15Cs fly between IAF Mirage 2000s, in front, and Su-30MKIs, behind during Cope India 2004., USAF This makes good sense as the United States and India have a number of shared regional and global security concerns, including the threat of international terrorism, piracy , and an uptick in severe natural disasters linked to global climate change . India is a major partner in working to support the government in Afghanistan in reaching a conclusion to its civil conflict and addressing the threat of Pakistan-based militant groups . Both the U.S. and Indian governments are also concerned about expanding Chinese political, economic, and military influence in the Pacific region and elsewhere around the world and oppose many of China’s controversial territorial claims, including in the South China Sea . Cope India 2019 “showcases U.S. and India’s efforts and commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” the Air Force said in an official statement about the exercise, almost certainly a veiled reference to China’s increasingly assertive foreign policy. With all this in mind, it seems highly likely that the already storied Cope India exercise will once again become a key feature of U.S.-Indian military cooperation.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Donald Trump is truly the Tweeter in Chief, having adopted Twitter as his communications platform of choice, for better or worse. Since becoming the 45th President of The United States, Trump has sent out plenty of puzzling and contradicting messages on the popular social media platform, but one sent today is especially peculiar. In it, he talks of needing to stave off an arms race he previously seemed to welcome and lamented defense spending, which his administration spurred and that he has touted in the past as one of his greatest achievements. The tweets read: “I am certain that, at some time in the future, President Xi and I, together with President Putin of Russia, will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race. The U.S. spent 716 Billion Dollars this year. Crazy!” It seems very strange that he is calling his own self-touted achievement and a policy his administration presided over “crazy.” Trump has repeatedly claimed that he “ rebuilt the military ” after a couple years of increased budgets. Although there has been increased defense spending across the board, Secretary of Defense James Mattis’ prioritization of funds into readiness and sustainment have helped the military recover from years of sequestration, not just a larger total defense spending figure alone. The problem is that a quick spurt of research and development and procurement dollars will actually end up hurting the military in many ways compared to a far more constrained, but reformed defense spending agenda. With Trump already talking about possible cuts to defense spending before this tweet, the reality of having throngs of immature programs being jettisoned after ghastly wasteful spending is very real. This is exactly what I have been predicting for some time, that these current budget levels are wholly unsustainable and a snapback in spending will come far sooner than later, leaving the military with huge amounts of zombie programs, half-developed weapons, and new weapons that will be mothballed as soon or even before they formally enter service. The push for new nuclear weapons and delivery system concepts is by far the most vexing and frustrating. Instead of rationalizing America’s aging and bloated nuclear weapons ecosystem, the Nuclear Posture Review , and the Trump administration’s policy that went along with it, demanded not only to upgrade the entire existing arsenal , but also expand it in significant ways . In addition, there is the administration’s hard push for an independent Space Force, which is already mired in service-level infighting and will cost billions to establish and sustain. How will all this, and so many other new conventional weapons programs and defense initiatives, survive falling budget levels? There is no doubt that the sprawling Department of Defense is an incredibly wasteful institution. Inroads into even understanding what that waste looks like quantitatively are just now being made, most notably in the form of the department’s first ever and very much failed audit . Regardless of just how much money is unaccounted for or wastefully spent, deep systemic reform will be needed to really realize any meaningful savings. The big question is with all the special interests in play and with the better part of a century of shoveling money into countless black holes as fast as it can, is there really the will, both political and otherwise, to reform the Pentagon’s deeply ingrained and often downright reckless spending habits? Maybe the most alarming part of all this is that whenever I mention the coming fiscal pull-back to defense contractors they sound totally in denial of such a glaring possibility. They seem to expect that the current gravy train will chug along through the coming decade, spurred by threats from China and Russia. That is very unlikely as the skyrocketing debt is an issue that will increasingly hamper discretionary spending — in particular, defense spending —not to mention the national debt becoming a more perilous political liability. A major downturn in the economy will only further accelerate this looming fiscal reckoning. To give you an idea of just how dire the problem is, well within the next decade , interest payments on the debt alone will eclipse the entire defense budget in terms of annual cost. With all this in mind, I would posit that the skyrocketing national debt is a bigger threat to national security than any external state or non-state actor. USMC It appears as if Trump recently learned just how much the Federal Government was spending and on what in comparison to what it was taking in. This revelation seems to have occurred last October when a U.S. Treasury report stated that the budget deficit had grown 17 percent over just the last year to $779B and it will reach $1T per year by 2020. That is with a booming economy, if it were to hit the skids, that number would likely balloon. The cause of the year-to-year debt hike is primarily the Trump tax cuts and increases in defense spending . Following the report, Trump announced that he wants every agency to make a five percent budget cut , although he may exempt some government organizations, like the DoD, from as steep a budgetary decline. But even if he can pull off such reduction, it would amount to $68B in savings, which is far smaller than the projected deficit increases. It’s good that Trump wants to work at trilateral arms reduction agreements, but in the past, he has openly invited arms races, making this statement a bit confusing. Better late than never, though. Hopefully, he follows through with doing everything possible to craft such accords, by all indications doing so won’t be easy. One glaring roadblock is that Russia doesn’t seem interested in abiding by existing deals , so the idea that they would adhere to new ones is debatable. Also, between very chilly relations with China as the result of an ongoing trade war and with Russia basically entering into a new Cold War with the West, just getting to the table to negotiate will be a major undertaking. Beyond the traditional arms control agreements of the past that focused on established weaponry and domains of warfighting, areas that really need some sort of arms agreement between China, Russia, and the U.S. are in regards to space-based , cyber , and hypersonic weaponry and the combat doctrine associated with them. These areas are quickly becoming a Wild West of sorts where previous international agreement don’t address emerging capabilities that have the potential to destabilize established strategic norms and even wreak havoc on critical civilian infrastructure. The bottom line here is that it’s good news that Trump is coming to understand that arms reduction deals not only help limit strategic risk and lower tensions among peer state competitors, but they can also have an incredibly welcome fiscal impact on the budget. At the same time, it is outright concerning that the President of the United States seems not to have had any concept of the negative fiscal impacts his own policies would have. Now that’s crazy.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 17, 2019",Air Force Rescue Helicopters Raced To The Aid Of Special Operators In Somalia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Much about the exact circumstances surrounding a recent attack on U.S. special operations forces and partner troops in Somalia , which left one American dead and four more wounded, remains unclear. However, we do know that, unlike in the aftermath of the now infamous ambush in Niger in 2017, U.S. Air Force rescue helicopters were able to race to the scene and, together with other fixed-wing aircraft, potentially prevented the incident from resulting in more American deaths. On June 8, 2018, members of the terrorist group Al Shabaab , Al Qaeda’s franchise in Somalia, attacked a battalion-sized force of approximately 800 U.S., Kenyan, and Somali troops in the semi-autonomous Jubaland region near the border with Kenya, according to U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM). The firefight involved enemy forces armed with mortars and heavy machine guns. We don’t know if all 800 individuals were at the site of the attack, where the U.S. military was assisting the Kenyan peacekeepers, who are in the country as part of the African Union-led mission , and Somalia forces build a new forward operating base. Once the construction is complete, Somali forces will man the outpost as part of a broader campaign to secure the area from Al Shabaab, according to CNN . U.S. Army Sergeant Alexander Conrad, a member of the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne), died after being hit by a mortar round during the attack. The U.S. military has not released the names of the four other casualties or details about the extent of their injuries. He was the first American to die in combat in Africa since the skirmish in Niger in October 2017, in which Islamic State in the Greater Sahara terrorists killed four Army soldiers. These were also the first U.S. military casualties in Somalia since a U.S. Navy SEAL died during a controversial raid in May 2017. The video below, which appeared on YouTube on June 9, 2018, shows HH-60G Pave Hawks flying in the background as Somali forces engage Al Shabaab terrorists. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oBeN_JI025Y In the 2017 Niger incident, American personnel and their partners had to wait hours for reinforcements to arrive in the form of French and later Nigerien forces. Contractors working for the U.S. military provided the only other potential means of evacuating the casualties in that instance. In the June 2018 incident in Jubaland, Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawks were able to fly from an unspecified “U.S. military installation” to the scene of the battle, a spokesperson for AFRICOM told The War Zone in an Email. Those helicopters helped three of the four wounded personnel, as well Sergeant Conrad, evacuate the area. A map showing various US military operating locations in East Africa.

The HH-60s were pre-positioned in the port town of Kismayo, the main commercial hub in the semi-autonomous Jubaland region during the operation, and were able to be on scene within 20 minutes, according to a separate report by The New York Times . Information in official contracting documents shows U.S. forces operate a forward operating base at the airport in the coastal city. A fuel delivery schedule from a Defense Logistics Agency contracting notice regarding potential fuel deliveries to “American Camp in Kismayo.” The Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC), W91C8Y, points to the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), which manages U.S. military activities in Somalia from Camp Lemonnier in Neighboring Djibouti., DLA There were unconfirmed reports that the U.S. military had been moving Pave Hawks in and out of Somalia to support specific missions as early as June 2017. At that time, AFRICOM told us in an Email that there were no helicopters permanently forward deployed in the country, but this would not preclude short-term operational movements. The Times ’ report also said that for large, multi-day operations in Somalia, such as the one in Jubaland, armed air support is often on standby. We don’t know if this means manned or unmanned aircraft or if the U.S. military employed either type of aircraft in this case. Unfortunately, Sergeant Conrad died after the initial evacuation, though medical personnel were able to stabilize the other three personnel. The Pave Hawks also returned to the battlefield to recover another wounded individual and moved them to Kismayo. An unconfirmed photo reportedly showing HH-60Gs in Mogadishu circa June 2017. The individual who posted this image on Twitter no longer has an account and the original source is unclear., via @airops007 A C-130J Hercules airlifter from the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, also situated in Djibouti, then moved the first three wounded personnel and the sergeant’s remains from Kismayo to the Kenyan capital Nairobi. Air Force airlift and medical personnel regularly train to turn these aircraft into flying ambulances . Sending the individuals to Kenya rather than Djibouti makes perfect sense given the distances involved. From Kismayo Airport, the C-130J had to fly approximately 400 miles west to Nairobi, while Camp Lemonnier sits more than 800 miles to the north. The inside of a C-130J configured for aeromedical evacuations, complete with dummy patient, during a training exercise., USAF On the continent of Africa, where the base in Djibouti is the only official U.S. military outpost, this “ tyranny of distance ” can be especially problematic when it comes to getting aid to wounded personnel or trying to get them into a hospital quickly. In this case, the U.S. casualties appear to have been able to get to the next level of care within or close to within the so-called “ golden hour ,” which refers to a 60-minute window where medical professionals have a better chance of saving a person’s life or preventing serious complications. Once in Kenya, the medical team from the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi took charge of the wounded servicemembers and had them transferred to a civilian hospital. By June 10, 2018, however, an Air Force KC-135R tanker from an unknown unit had taken those individuals from the Kenyan capital to another, undisclosed location for “additional medical evaluation,” according to AFRICOM. It is very likely that the aircraft took these individuals to either Camp Lemonnier, which has a more robust military medical facility, or to the U.S. Army’s Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, which serves as a major hub for the treatment of seriously injured servicemen and women. A C-130J from the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron somewhere in East Africa., USAF This chain of events is a good example of how the casualty and medical evacuation processes are supposed to work under optimal conditions. It also highlights the not insignificant resources that have to be in place and on call for it to work as intended. On top of that, the mechanisms on display may not necessarily translate to a high-end conflict . Note that the HH-60s, C-130J, and KC-135R were all able to fly their respective missions entirely unmolested by enemy forces on the ground. These aircraft simply would not be able to operate deep inside a high-risk environment full of integrated air defenses. A C-130-type aircraft, at left, shares space on the ramp at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti with three KC-135R tankers in 2016., Google Earth But for limited conflicts, such as the one in Somalia, the arrangement is at least adequate and in this case may have prevented additional American deaths. And it’s an unfortunate, but distinct possibility that the Pave Hawks may be seeing more missions like it in the near future, as well. The growing scale and scope of the U.S. mission in Somalia, nicknamed Operation Octave Shield , could also increase the strain on the relatively limited Djibouti-based rescue personnel and other forces supporting their mission. Those forces already have to support operations across East Africa and out into the Gulf of Aden to the north. They also rely heavily on the aging HH-60Gs, which are becoming increasingly difficult to sustain and have suffered significantly declining availability as a fleet across the Air Force. The existing operational demands on these aircraft have pushed the U.S. military to increasingly turn to contractors for both airlift and casualty evacuation services in many countries, including Niger , the Philippines , and potentially Yemen . Airmen unload an HH-60G at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti in 2013., USAF These issues remain a factor in Somalia even over a year after President Donald Trump granted AFRICOM new authorities to combat Al Shabaab and allowed the Pentagon to designate much of the southern portion of the country an active conflict zone, giving it further flexibility in its operations there. The new base in Jubaland is just the latest indication of the expanding U.S. campaign , the goal of which is ostensibly to support African Union and local forces battle the Al Qaeda-linked terrorists. At a press conference on June 11, 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis implied that elements of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), tasked with hunting down senior members of Al Shabaab, were no longer physically in the country on a semi-permanent basis. It is possible that JSOC has relocated the bulk of its forces out of the country – possibly to the special operations mothership M/V Ocean Trader or another vessel offshore – in part to reduce the logistical strains of having to defend and maintain sites ashore. But there are approximately 500 U.S. military personnel in the country now, officially. In addition to the camp in Kismayo, there are at least two other major U.S. operating locations in Somalia, one in the capital Mogadishu and another just north of that site at a Somali air base in the town of Baledogle . We don’t know how many American troops are scattered elsewhere in the country, either permanently or temporarily. And there is an increasingly active combat component to the mission, too, as seen most visible in the dramatic surge in drone strikes against Al Shabaab starting after Trump took office in 2017. However, as has become steadily clearer for months already, the expanded advisory mission has also increasingly put Americans closer to the active fighting . For its part, the terrorist group has also been trying to put increased pressure on the United States and its partners, especially as the African Union continues to look for ways to extricate itself from the grueling conflict in the near future. There’s no end in sight for the U.S. mission in the country and if it continues to become a more proactive operation, American personnel will need to have these kinds of casualty evacuation assets and other medical support at the ready for the foreseeable future.
